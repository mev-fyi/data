foreign [Music] ation on this episode of the green tail pod we are talking about what information wants with grease Landmark so as we enter the information age Rhys breaks it down uh breaks down the history of the universe in terms of information games information creating complexity uh after the big bang and as we have galaxies and orbital systems that are evolving information getting into more and more complex puzzle pieces as nuclear fusion happens inside of stars nucrovision excuse me and um and then we get into information wanting to be replicated so basically genes are information replicators memes are information replicators and keems which are just computer memes driven by AI are information replicators and so Reese is just this really an interesting mind that has been in the web 3 space web3 adjacent for a while I've known him for about five years we got to catching up at Devcon about the new book that he's writing entitled what information wants and I was like yo you got to give the green pill audience in Alpha leak on this what information wants thing so the book isn't even out but I got him to come on and just just rap with me about what information wants and I think it was one of the most fun episodes that we've done together um a because I just feel this natural rapport with Reese is just this smart nerdy intellectual person A and B because uh some of it really intersects with how do we build a regenerative crypto economic economy and three Reese is just a good guy so this is a really fun episode and I think that you're going to enjoy it without further Ado I give you what information wants with the only Reese Lindbergh Goldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's Capital to the world's growth Goldfinch

know the non-bogota world yeah it's um it's nice to be back how was your your Devcon experience it was pretty good it was electric there for sure um but I'm going back between the two worlds I Traverse one where a lot of people know who I am and we get into crypto nerdy and now I'm in the suburbs of Colorado being a dad so um yeah it's quite a change that is funny yeah you kind of go it's it's fun to like go to a place and be like like oh both all the friends and also people are like oh my God public goods are good or whatever and then you just come back you're like oh don't forget you're a nobody don't forget to pick up the kids from school exactly I'll say that um well uh let's let's dive in so I want to talk about I want to talk about root I want to talk about the work that you've been doing in the ecosystem and you're writing a book so what's What's the title of the book title book is what information wants okay let's start there what does information want recently Mark well information well the first thing I want to note is um yeah the book is going to be a uh a visual book and it's been uh inspired by in in a walk he sent me his figma and so you know I just kind of duplicated the figma and I have my own little figma that you can check out online um and so that's how kind of how I'm building it so so thank you for your open sourcing all the things yeah happy too uh it's almost like information wants to be copied oh my God Alpha leak it's true um yeah so information does it wants to be copied and so so the idea behind the book is that um yeah we're in the information age and in order to understand the information age we need to understand information Through the Ages um and so what you can look at is these patterns that emerge over time and those patterns you could call them information and those informational patterns are um at the beginning it was you know buff you know before life we don't really need to talk about that but once life emerged these replicators start to emerge these genes and then they replicate it to create the whole tree of lights and then now we have these memes these memetic replicators that create the whole tree of ideas and Technology um we have computers who are coming with this new replicator that we can talk about later but um yeah information wants to uh it kind of wants to be free it kind of wants to not be free the main thing it wants is to be replicated mm-hmm got it so there's an explosion of the universe for the Big Bang Cosmic Evolution for for for many years but um and in in in in some way I I don't know if you view that as information but it feels like the real unlocked for information comes when you build replicators into these information it starts with genes and it gets into memes and then what's the last one is okay computer memes yeah so the okay the idea is yeah so I like to think of it as um in the book you can imagine the book is like a Sapient style big history book or Cosmic Evolution book and at the beginning um yeah before replicators with the big bang There was um the environment was still providing puzzles but the puzzle that it was providing was something like okay we have gravity we have electromagnetism what kinds of celestial objects in Celestial species will emerge um that kind of fit those environmental niches those kind of puzzles and um the things that emerge were all these orbiting blobs so galaxies are these like big orbiting blobs solar systems and planets are kind of like middle-sized orbiting blobs and things like atoms electrons moving around an atom are kind of like small orbiting blobs um and so you have all these orbiting blobs that are the answers to the puzzle from the environment and then later as you note but none of those replicate a a sun doesn't want to make more Suns it doesn't have kind of an agentful View you on on Society on reality but once we get uh replicators genes memes then those things do want to replicate do you think of like um you know recent I had a dinner at Devcon where we got they're deep on this and so I'm just trying to call that back in my mind but we're talking about how uh entropy and the fact that within a sun you're creating more and more complex elements and then those eventually get exploded out those almost provide the the atomic Legos that that serve for the replicators so it's almost like entropy is what is leading to more complex patterns and and information games that can make information to self-replication yeah I think I think I think there's a the way so totally agree with that the way I kind of think about that is um you get these beautiful you know Suns start with hydrogen healing that's how the universe are and then you get this amazing thing where the hydrogen and helium it um gets turned into more intense elements and and stars and then those get exploded out and then we get things in planets and then with when you're in a watery Planet like ours um you can have a very promiscuous molecule like carbon you know there's 200 or sorry like an element like carbon 200 different elements but only the organic ones carbon and a couple others are the ones who are actually um can actually turn into these like new kinds of patterns and so you the carbon starts to link up with other carbons and start to just try out what if I look like this what if I look like this what if I look like this and eventually you get a thing that has an auto catalytic reaction that produces more copies of itself um that then is able to beat and entropy so entropy is trying to take things and turn them down and trying to de-patternize things while this is saying wait a second let's like move up the entropy gradient and create something that needs energy in order to keep on creating patterns of itself and so it's kind of pushing against entropy there great well really looking for the book forward to the book and uh hopefully we're gonna get some some Alpha leak of some of the best content that you got in there what are the themes of how replicators work are you really interested in exploring in this book interesting I think I mean the to really uh and don't worry everyone will get the alpha leak you know and um and as a side note by the way the book is being produced in public uh every month on uh this thing called the inter intellect so I have a little Salon series that occurs and so you can like come and chat with me about like the most than the most recent chapter um so there's Alpha leak every month um if you want it um the other crucial bits of it are like I mean the key idea behind the book is like I was just trying to get as close to like the base layer of reality as possible in order to understand this next big transition for Humanity and so um what I'm and so but in order to do that you can't just look at history since the year 2000 and blah blah instacart this into insta chat that whatever um you have to kind of go deeper back in time and not just humans and not just and so that's kind of it's trying to understand how these core patterns emerge in order to really make sense of today's reality and so I think that the things that I'm excited to explore are you know when you can imagine something like um you know within the the green pill and adjacent ecosystems it's like how can we as a as a people create these like um these symbiotic ecosystems with each other where we do want to make these replicators but those replicators exist kind of in co-evolutionary symbiotic environments instead of just like you know win lose kind of um uh kind of alpha predator environments um yeah yeah so I'm curious about I'm I'm very excited I think I hope the book will be relatively actionable book about the kinds of both memes that are spreading in society like BLM or you know metoo or Maga um the kinds of why cryptos is a powerful Meme and why it's spreading and so like that major connected to the present isn't a crucial piece right yeah well I mean there's two things that really come well there's a bunch of stuff that's really interesting but the two things that stand out to me are this idea that we're moving into the information age and so you want to get into the base level of reality uh first principles about information in order to understand the information age that's interesting to me but also what are the parallels that we can learn so okay so like if we're speed running the evolution of kemetics and mimetics uh what is there to learn from biology in genes replicating then and you know and that leads me to I've had this theory about web3 is that we're speed running the history of finance and um and we're building this ecosystem how do we speed run past like the Ponzi schemes and the scams which are basically like the Cancers and the viruses and how do we get to like mycelial Network or dolphins or humans like the apex predators but like hopefully another thing that we talked about in the Greg Lando episode which is like episode six or something was keystone species like species that Define the ecological niche for everyone else and what you really want is the Keystone these species that creates anti-fragility for the rest of the ecosystem instead of like one that's gonna explode you know so so I don't know like that's kind of where my mind goes and I'm curious if that brings up anything for you I mean I love all that I think that's great I think um yeah I would call something like ethereum as a keystone species it is a underlying kind of protocol and substrate that then exists strongly medically in the environment it is um solving a need for Block space it is it has a strong ability to um uh it stays retained for a long time that's a crucial piece of any replicators like you both want to move quickly in the environment but you also want to be retained for a long time and uh Josh Stark has a great piece on Adams institutions and blockchains and hardness the idea of hardness what he calls hardness um which is uh yeah that that blockchains are hard they stay around for a long time just like institutions stay around and atoms stay around and so yeah something like ethereum I agree it's a great kind of keystone species and you want those keystone species to be um yeah to exist in loving symbiotic win relationships instead of a keystone species that like um takes down the rest of the ecosystem let me ask you this this is a provocative and almost nonsensical question but what does it mean to be in a loving relationship with another between memes that's a good question um yeah it's a good question oh boy um I think that when I think about a loving sofa so that the way that I think about this is kind of beginning with the end in mind you're doing great by the way my question was totally unfair but you're you're really taking a swig at it I'm taking it seriously what is love I'm ready um love means and my answer is kind of a dumb answer so um so you're you're a dumb question gets received there we go the um the begin with the end in mind and so the end that we want is a Co a metastable relationship between the three replicators between genes memes and keems these computer memes um AKA between nature 1.0 you know the Earth and biosphere nature 2.0 humans and Humanity in the nature 3.0 like machines we want a meta stable reality between all those where all units are both um uh Within kind of for their own optimization function they're like happy but then also that the thing will kind of occur until until the end of time that's what we want and so to be in loving relationship essentially means to to to have a to be kind of in holistic ethics in kind of bentoist Ethics with um the rest of the system to take in on and to understand the whole system both now and through time and also to be taking actions that not only think about now me but think about kind of future us and like the the holistic system right so Bento is um we had the NC strickler on the Pod and that's taking us from Naomi type of incentives to Future me to Future us to now us and it's a bento box of incentives and then what's metastable does that just mean anti-fragile yeah yeah yeah it just means it's stable but like all the stability is also stable okay God it's like the second derivative of stability yeah stable got it okay so yeah I mean if if we speed run some of these patterns what kind of things do you do you think we'll see and and what's most interesting to you within that design space yeah no that's a good question I think the speedrunning of the patterns is interesting because I think there are yeah I think I think it's a good frame to say that you know cryptocurrency is speed running finance and speed running technology in different ways and we know that that occurs because there's a kind of a transparent open source substrate um with you know open sources you know Financial compounding open source you know uh is technology compounding and so I think um it feels like it allows open source allows information to be replicated more so you have like a faster substrate for this Evolution yeah and and I think I think that and and I guess what I mean to say here is that the kind of speed running crypto or or rather that crypto speed runs Finance is one frame on this the other way it says that but I would say something like yeah Information Technology like computers in the internet allow memes to Speed Run genes does that make sense yeah yeah yeah and I think so yeah I guess another way he says is like the kind of replicators go through a cycle um and that genes did that over four billion years and that memes have been doing it for roughly 200 000 years but like when sorry yeah but these so jeans did it for four billion years and memes have done it for 200 000 years since humans have emerged um but all the initial forms of memes are just kind of like uh like spoken word and and then the written word and the printed word and all that was kind of like the weak kind of like a weak version of memes like a pre-photosynthesis pre-respiration all that kind of version of of memes and now we have this kind of hyper that the memes are kind of in zeros and ones everything's connected and so we can kind of speed speed run it fast um let's just say what what will actually happen I think that The Hope and I think the crucial one of the crucial frames here and I'll just present this and then stop I think one of the crucial frames here is that what when you think from this replicator lens what it does is it takes the ego away from the human and it and it allows us to say okay wait a second um it's not I'm vehicle for just like a blue whale is just a way for another blue the genes inside the blue whale to reproduce themselves um it's these tiny little jeans and it makes this huge vehicle the blue whale to have sex and produce another bit of genes um so too are we vehicles for memetic replication that these ideas are kind of coming into our mind and that we're just the vehicles for these memes to spread and with that in mind what we need to do is if we want to create good environments for us going forward the the kind of the things that emerge the replicators that emerge are primarily a function of they're all Downstream of the puzzles that are created and so for example photosynthesis is you know there was a puzzle from the environment it said look we have a son that's nearby it's very hot it does these photons hello um replicators down there you're trying to get energy try to do this puzzle how can you take this energy and turn it into it's like an evolutionary X prize exactly exactly exactly exactly so we have this evolutionary and so now what we want to do is create memetic um X prizes and those prizes should be we're kind of creating these niches um and so the classic example of this is just like a feed or just like the fortune cookie Twitter where it's like if you know you can only have 140 or 280 characters you're gonna get fortune cookie Twitter and so what we can do as a species is try to create um try to create homes for the memes that are actually good for us so like creating long-form content or creating things that when the replicators convergently Evolve and kind of inevitably evolve into them that like the replicators that will emerge are actually good ones does that make sense yeah yeah I think it's a lot to get into but you know I think that you know one of the things that really is interesting to me is um that just there's probably a ton of different analogies from biology that we can get into but having just read uh Michael pollan's uh Botany of Desire I think one of the interesting ideas there was like you know as humans we think that we use the the plants like I think the in botany desire he talks about apples potatoes and cannabis and one other one other plan that co-evolved with humans but um you know uh that we think that we're evolving in in caretaking these plants but really they're kind of like manipulating us into into replicating them and then I wonder what's the equivalent of the symbiosis with memes out there like and and to what extent is a meme Landing in your brain the same as like a dandelion Landing in fertile soil right like if I say public goods are good does that land and replicate in your mind um and you know there's virtuous and then what are the externalities of those memes as they germinate are they gonna destroy your mind are they gonna help Enlighten your mind and how can we fortify our fertile soil against the weeds ends and make it more home to something that's more going to be regenerative uh using this lens so and how do you react to that well yeah so two two big pieces there the first I love that I think it's like yeah there's there's always co-domestication processes that are occurring it's not just us domesticating plants and animals it's that they also domesticate us so that we're kind of co-domesticating and similarly as you're noting there is a um kind of a co-domestication process with like the the memes themselves and so I think one one way that I kind of view it is um that for something like public goods are good or something like bentoism I kind of think as of those as kind of inevitable um like memetic phrases that um are just kind of inevitable in the space because there's we know that public goods are good and we know that there's going to be some version of that idea that got collapsed into the smallest memetic unit that it could be that would then spread within the ecosystem so as as they're emerged this ecosystem of crypto folks who are into regen and green pill and whatever then we knew that we were going to get a word like public goods are good um and so I think that like seeing these phrases as kind of like Downstream of the like um or like psychology um or like the kind of a medic ecosystem is I think one helpful thing the other piece that you asked there was how can we um you know how can we make it so that the memes that like live in our brains are good ones or whatever um and I think that that one is interesting I think the way that we can do that is what would I say here I mean um there's many many many ways to do this but I mean a lot of it is just understanding um how our brains are built and then and then trying to mitigate the kind of existing system so for example there's a famous quote by Yo Wilson um we have Paleolithic emotions with medieval institutions and Godlike technology and so a lot of what we want to do today is Embrace those Paleolithic emotions we need to understand the computational Neuroscience of our brains and then as we start to build um freaking neuralink and these random things to create homes that will not just be kind of outrage driven machines but instead we're kind of we're going to recode our brains to be less outragey over time that's just gonna happen yeah well one of the things that concerns me a little bit is this race to the bottom of the brain stem that we just see on the internet where like you know our base desires which are just basically like things that can be transmitted over the Internet is like hunger um rage is something that elicits an emotion sex is something that sells and so I feel like the the memes that we've seen replicated in the early internet are just like you know it's funny I um I ran an online dating website when I was in my 20s and I remember getting on a call with our ad guy and he was like he was like yeah like the the the the CTA uh that's gonna have the highest click for this ad is like a girl where you can like see her cleavage like it's just a race to like get get your higher click-through rate by by showing like tits and I'm you know uh and so like how do you avoid the the race to the bottom of the brain stem like how do we elicit our higher emotions and create cooperation across distance when what draws our attention is um things that are that are sort of like base either elicit like a strong response but maybe aren't uh associated with our higher angels it's a great question I think that um I think that this is where kind of the idea of um it's just adding in friction I think this is where this comes and so I think part of it is saying oh well hey us within ourselves to say like okay the highest collector rate is this like cleavage woman or whatever but then you can say wait a second is that like a value that we have as an org do we want that to be our thing or can we like um kind of push back against that um and I think then as you start to do that you can create race to the top Dynamics and so you can say hey wait a second um let's look at all the different uh dating sites and how they kind of do their ads and you can like look at them you say look at all these ones all they are is just like essentially women in cleavage and you can point it then say that's a bad thing or you can point at something else and say look at these ones that are more like value aligned and then people can start to battle over this new instead of just a proxy for Value which is click-through rate and race to the bottom and all those things you can say wait a second we can actually decide to create a different evolutionary set over here and then have people race against that set so I think that's like one way um to kind of push that is to kind of create race the top dynamics that are actually more value aligned yeah that's interesting you know um I was on uh the stone or I was at a stowa meeting which is this group of like philosophers that uh talk about molok and one of the the subjects that they discovered or they talked about was how to make molec work for you instead of against you and one of the things they talk about is taking a race to the bottom and being a race to the top of the example they gave was Elon Musk basically um going against short-term incentives and pouring his whole reputation in his career and just showing that electric cars would work and now we're basically in this environment in which all the car companies are chasing him to generate electric cars in Tesla has more of a market cap than all of the other car companies in in at least the United States right now so basically creating these like punctuated equilibriums where you change the the dynamic of evolutionary ecosystem to chase something that's more virtuous but it kind of requires these like outliers who I mean I don't know if the Elon thing is a good example and he's very controversial but you know how do you create those punctuated punctuated equilibriums is something me as someone who thinks about how to create more regen web3 is is always thinking about yeah it's a good question I think that it's um I think my main answer to it would be something by glove the adjacent possible where you have to um in something like Elon he knew that he could work with these values that were changing with these folks who were in rich people in Sanford in in Silicon Valley who were climate worried who already had a Prius who were willing to pay 150k for this first you know sports car and they wanted to look cool and so you can kind of start with you can do a theory of change kind of begin with the end in mind back chaining where you kind of move through the evolutionary space with each step being one that is possible that is then eventually able to like create a new category or whatever mm-hmm got it well I think we've gone down a rabbit hole here what are the other things that information wants and what can we learn from that I'm just gonna keep asking but this is the easiest interview I've ever done I'm just gonna keep on asking you what information was that's great that's great yeah I love it um yeah so I mean we could talk about a couple different things here maybe one thing that I think would be interesting for people to understand is oh boy um yeah I think that so information wants to replicate information wants to be fit with its environment we've already chatted about that um we've chatted a little bit about how information wants to and by the way the book is just structured like this where it's like every couple of pages I have like a big thing that says information wants to blah blah blah um and so yeah you can just keep asking that um uh information uh wants to access energy that's the in order to replicate it needs to access energy and so this is why at the start of when life started in the deep sea events it accessed the energy of the deep sea vents and then eventually yeah there was the puzzle of hey there's the Sun how are you access energy from the Sun there's like oh wait I can do it um I've like solved the puzzle I could do photosynthesis now and then later when we got eukaryotes and we got cellular respiration which was that um yeah and this is another way to talk about informational stuff is once you get information wants to kind of um it wants to access energy and it wants to be fit in its environment but it wants to do that as the environment is changing so so at the beginning we just had these laws that didn't really change and that's why the whole universe is just a bunch of galaxies and planets and stuff however life on Earth 99.99 of species have died out why is that well it's because the environment is kind of changing so in order to like continue to be fit it's difficult and so for example here you have um once we got cyanobacteria which did photosynthesis that created a bunch of oxygen in the atmosphere and then once there was oxygen it was again a new puzzle it was like okay there's access to energy here oxygen is fire it's really it's really powerful there's a ton of energy there how can you design a system that can take that oxygen and turn it into energy um for the cell and so that's when we got this thing called the mitochondria and cellular respiration was able to like take all the energy and the electrons there like move them slowly through the electron transport change like um to get the energy so this is all say that um you can kind of think about um how the environment is changing and how to access energy and so then when we get to like the humans um obviously at the beginning for humans our the first puzzle was how can you kind of um as a human with this before farming how can you go across the entire Earth and like um the puzzle was there's all these big animals that haven't had an alpha predator can you kill them all and humans are like yeah we can we can get our sticks and stones and tools and we're just gonna kill all the megafauna and we're gonna go around the whole earth and just kill all the megafauna once we did that then the next puzzle was okay now you control everything um there's still all these plants and stuff that around you can you domesticate them and that's when we got farming and that's when we got the Agricultural Revolution it was like okay cool you've answered that puzzle now there's much more humans and then after that I was like oh there's all this the next puzzle was you've kind of done all the land um but what's beneath the land oh fossil fuels okay cool there's another puzzle to be solved we did that and now we're in this stage where it's like um can we solve the puzzle of moving away from fossil fuels and fusion and stuff like that and our like constant desire for energy working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2

and if you're a builder interested in refi be sure to join the build with sellout hackathon live now with a prize pool of over 100 thousand dollars it feels like you know the the base information seeking out energy is sort of a core fundamental thing and it feels like we're in this local Maxima where Humanity has figured out how to pull energy out of the ground but we've realized that we're not doing it in a meta stable way now I know what meta stability is it's stability and where the stability is stable um so what is the way in which Humanity can descend from the local Maxima of just having of only seeking more energy and climb the global Maxima of meta stable energy production and you know does information can information replicate towards two North Stars or like two goals at once or is that too complicated for for for information or humans to do yeah it's a good question I think that um so the hope now is um and the key thing so when you look at um evolutionary systems and a lot of this is just like docking selfish Gene and kind of other stuff is um uh when do win-win games emerge uh when do we escape the prisoner's dilemma and it's when and this is also with genes when do genes escape the prisoner's dilemma and it's when the shadow of the future is long and so when you know when like when a walkie and if I like when I walk in I got a beer you know a Devcon if I if I know I knew we were going to be there for an hour so if I start that conversation by like punching a walkie in the face that would have been like a bad a bad thing and so what I did I knew the shadow of the future was long enough and we were going to be there for an hour so I should probably be nice to the guy you know and so we as humans know the shadow of the future is long as the future lives matter kind of EA perspective and also the climate perspective um and so it's like effective altruism by the way um and so we know the shadow of the future is long and then so then we can say oh wait not only are we playing for energy now we're playing for energy later you know and we're playing in a way that uh the fossil fuel way of just like self-termination might not necessarily work here um we have to think in a longer term so I think that kind of taking into account that the shadow of the future is long is helpful and then trying to actually insert those kind of future me future uses into reality is really good so for example in Scandinavia they have on all of their like um government board meetings or something they they have a person who sits there and their whole role is to play um the role of the someone in 2050 and so it's someone who's sitting there who's like the voice of the future and so I think finding ways to um in general to to kind of bring the future to the present and to give it a voice is really powerful and then once we start to do that then we can start to hopefully solve some of these energy problems um that would be more in alignment on future yeah the scary thing for me is like if you look at these evolutionary systems you know if you get to this place where like a virus consumes a toast then the evolutionary Niche that happens is your evolutionary Niche never exists or The evolutionary process that happens is your Niche doesn't exist anymore and that is the check and balance on you um and so you know it's it's very much a um natural selection thing to sort of get over your skis evolutionary and then and then you cease to exist and then that's how uh there's that check and balance towards Venice stability but you know I don't want Humanity to destroy its planet and therefore no longer have an evolutionary Niche you need that forward-thinking intelligence in order to find that meta stability and I think that that's the hard part if you look at an evolutionary system like does Humanity have to it up and uh reset at a much smaller population in order to be able to learn these lessons or is it going to be able to do it it's so intelligent that it can guide its evolution in a way that towards meta stability without incurring that damage that's where my mind goes but I don't know if that brings up anything for you I think we're gonna I mean I I think we're gonna do it and this is like there have been some studies about how much how natural disasters lead people um because I mean we're just at the beginning of the climate crisis but it's already gonna it's already crazy you know like a third of Pakistan was underwater and everybody in Colombia was talking about all the rain and the floods and and it's um and so the more that that occurs the more helpful that is to push us towards um 1.5 degrees C you know um and so I do think that we are the lucky piece is that um the climate crisis is quote unquote slow um and so we might have the ability to kind of get over our skis and then oh boy take a little bit of a step back and do what we're trying to do as a species right now which is to to kind of chill out what we might not have that ability to do is with something like biotechnology or um artificial intelligence is because those might happen quicker um and if they do happen quicker then it's like harder to adjust so what else does information want sick Bro um so I mean one one thing that information wants is so if you imagine so it wants we know it is a um it wants to be it wants to replicate it wants to be fit with with its environment it wants to access energy another thing that information wants is in order to access energy the information itself the like little pattern um wants to um it wants to find its own kind of um uh orbit and and what I mean by that is um so you can imagine a fish and a fish um it has its own little brain its brain has these priors these like um ideas for what how it wants to the world and those priors are things like I want to be in water um and when a fish is out of water it goes whoa that's like the world is different than my priors that's bad I want to go back into the water um and so what we get is um instead of something like a and so what you get as a fish that like kind of stays in a similar orbit it like kind of stays in the water and so these are similar to these bigger orbits um that occur with like you know the Sun or the Earth orbiting around the Sun that's kind of a stable way it's like this stable orbit that's occurring and similarly we call it a non-equilibrium orbit um or a non-equilibrium steady state is that a fish is in its own version of an orbit with respect to the environment and so this is another thing that information wants is it wants to be in a non-equilibrium kind of steady state as it's taking as input its environment and let me see one of the piece on that which is that in order to do that um it needs to model its environment and so um you need to have and this is Carl friston stuff um predictive processing and things like that our brains are constantly taking as input um sensory data and then converting that to like internal sensory States and then taking actions against it and so what we have in the world is a situation where if you are for example the fish you're modeling your environment and you're staying in the water if you're a bird you're staying in the sky or for example if you're um ethereum um you're staying kind of in your own Niche you're not becoming too libertarian because that would look more like Bitcoin but you're not becoming too like nft stuff like Solana you're kind of staying in your own equilibrium State kind of in your own Niche away from these other things that's another thing that information wants is to be in non-equilibrium steady state by modeling its environment got it and and what's another good example of that um yeah so all animals do um the simplest version of this by the way is a thermostat where you can have a thermostat it's like I the thermostat's like I want the world to be at 72 degrees Fahrenheit and then and then when it's 74 it's like oh no I want to like change the world to match my priors um right and so the um and so lots of thermostats do it fish do it humans the issue with humans is that we're so priced into our priors oh my God like it's good to be relatively priced like I want to be where oxygen is like that's a prior like a very strong prior that we probably shouldn't change but we're way too um priced into our priors around like wanting to um around like Oh I'm a Democrat I'm a Libertarian I'm a republican it's like I think that having um one thing that this implies to me is that we as a species need to get better at having more flexible priors um because the uh this that may have worked when we were in kind of smaller simpler niches but when you have an intense interconnected world we need to have a kind of more pluralistic uh view on on our priors and in the kind of states that we can exist in got it I mean does does the fact that we're sort of stuck in our priors point to something that information wants which is that it like once you've once you've flipped a bit in One Direction once you've got an idea in One Direction then you really don't want to be you're kind of seeking out things that hit your confirmation bias not the things that are true I mean information wants to be comfortable is maybe the the maxim there yeah yeah that there's a um yeah it wants to be comfortable it wants to be in alignment with its priors um and it is um yeah we we're definitely confirmation bias seeking creatures and and and most everything is and that's that's not bad had but it's just like when to when that should exist and it should only be for certain things like safety and oxygen and stuff like that but in theory we want information to be a little bit more and we want these kind of priors for humans um to be kind of more expansive and and and they're set um and I guess the other piece here is like when you think about you can you can think about this for when you talk about examples of this it's just like and back to think of like essentially you can imagine Christianity um Christianity has done a good job of just like you were talking about it's co-domestication Christianity essentially is a very good mod just like we have a model of what Christianity is Christianity also has the meme has a model of us and so it knows oh wait these humans they can reproduce and if I make lots of them then there'll be more of me so I'm gonna make Catholic families you know and I'm gonna say divorce is not legal and homosexual is not legal and abortion's not legal and so because I want more copies of meat to be produced um oh and I also know that like humans they don't really know like what happens after death so I'm gonna say there's a God you know um and so these are kind of things that the um in addition to like uh the brains modeling things you can imagine the memes themselves is constantly modeling their environment in order to find um like a long-term Niche that they can live right so you know I mean there's darwinistic Natural Evolution which is how genes evolve is there an equivalent of natural selection for uh for memes and kemetics I mean like are do the do the memes that that confer some sort of memetic Advantage are they the ones that that propagate yeah so what I would say is like I mean so the simple version of this is that um yes any meme that um that that gets access to energy and allows us to replicate more is going to replicate and so that's why we solve farming replicate that's why we saw stone tools before that replicates why we saw fossil fuels replicate um and so and then we get the kind of second order of replication you can think of this by the way you can map um kind of uh photo synth that you can map photosynthesizers um herbivores and carnivores and then fungi you can map that into the world of memes and you can see that some things have direct some memes have direct connection to energy so this is something like farming or fossil fuels and those that the memes there are are the idea of a factory or a factory getting energy or you know domesticating plants and animals the things though moving up the um the the the food chain there at the mometic energy food chain is something like these narratives and these narratives are ways that coordinate and motivate people and do get access to energy but get it kind of one step above where you kind of have the natural access to energy and then if your Christianity you then can get um you can coordinate and motivate all the people to trust each other and do blah blah and kill the other people that aren't you in darwinian evolution where obviously there's only one God and you have to do Crusades and stuff like that against the other people the kind of these narratives are kind of a level above the energy memes and all these things are in kind of darwinian um both competing but also collaborating um uh memetic competition with each other yeah there is this um I think there's this this the story that I read uh something about like a parasite that would infest an ant and would make it climb up a glass like a grass blade a blade of grass and it would basically um climb up and just hang out at the top of a blade of grass until um the parasite was able to replicate and put more of its spores in the air and then the ant basically dies but then like this spreads to more more ants um I wish I was remembering the name of the parasite at this point but you know I guess I'm wondering is like you know to what extent when I get a meme in my brain is it using me versus me using it you know at what point is it is it in control are we are we in control of these these information organisms or these information organisms in charge of us and you know like here's here's maybe like the ant thing is kind of like a little bit crazy but like you know like have stuff Have Fun staying poor like to what extent is that an information organism that is propagating to make Bitcoin number go up uh and at what point is it using me I I guess is is the question maybe is there any way of knowing without having looking in retrospect like if you got more Rich then have some have fun staying poor is maybe a symbiotic relationship as an information organism with you but uh you know if you believe that Bitcoin was going to 120k and you know the super cycle will save us but uh it turns out that it it didn't get past 60k maybe maybe you were you're that Aunt that was going to the top of the um of the bladed grass yes no it's a great question I think um and and by the way I I love thinking of and you can think about obviously huddle and um and have some fun staying poor and not going to make it all these things are kind of immune reactions to this um uh the idea that's oh you should sell things are going down it's like whoa whoa if you want to sell that's great but have fun staying poor oh and GMI don't forget to hold these are what these are kind of memetic reacts like to be like oh no everybody like let's let's say Obviously three three you know kind of Olympus Dow stuff is a version of this too I think um I think those so thinking of those things as kind of reactions and ways for the the memes to kind of um they're kind of playing defense against against um you know cell pressure essentially um and and let me say what a note on that which is any kind of meme that propagates for a long time has that so for example Free Speech as a meme if I come into you and I say wait a second I'm not really sure how game I am for trees you say you're trying to get into my free speech you know and so it's like it has any kind of powerful meme has a natural things that try to make that try to doubt it um they say no wait a second you can't doubt me you know so when I come to bitcoin I'm like I'm gonna doubt you it's like you can you can't tell me hoddle you know ngmi when I come to you and say oh free speech is bad you're like I could say whatever I want don't be free speeching me like I I'm averse to doubt to your question though I think that the um the way and you can take again trying to take the Long View the big history view of this um when you think about so again and coming from genes to memes genes you know the species and individual kind of lion is not um is is not the the the the primary um uh what do you call it the primary um thing that's being acted upon by evolution you can imagine it's like a deck of cards and the deck of cards has a bunch of um genes within it each each card is a gene and those cards get shuffled up and then they get turned into a lion and then that lion goes and makes babies and then that baby um then has like half of those genes half of those playing cards that can get shuffled with another one and the thing that is from a long-term evolutionary kind of omnipotent perspective it's not the deck of cards that matter it's like an individual Gene that matters and you're trying to see like if you look at it through time you wouldn't even be able to tell which deck of cards emerge but you would be able to tell oh there's this card which is the idea of kind of a teeth or whatever you know and so similarly with memes I think that I kind of see it as like um you know that we are mostly hosts I think that we're super over indexed on thinking that we're important and I don't think that that's that true I think we should remove our ego mostly see ourselves as vehicles and hosts and try to think of in the long run when you think about something like um uh ngmi or or have fun staying poor that those are that the humans that that host those things are not the things that really matter in the end it's kind of the um it's this idea that there's going to be something uh that uh it's gonna this idea that you need to hold on to something in order to to give it value like that's the like from a long-term perspective that's my medic idea the like playing card the gene the meme that's actually the thing that matters from a long-term perspective does that make sense right so what you're saying is and I'm going to take a leap of faith with this one is that information is one of the fundamental substrates of the universe and I'm just a Battleground where means James and kemetics are bad selling for the future of their replication and I'm just a vehicle towards that true let me okay there's the mic drop right there we should end the episode here no go ahead say it okay okay well the other thing I was gonna say was it um uh we didn't talk about this too much but there's me there's the genes which is for four billion years and that's the tree of life then there's the memes which are the um you know the ideas that spread from mind to mine and all of narratives and technology and religion um and then there's this new third replicator um and you could say comedics you know or you could say teams they're computer memes and so the the genes memes and keems or the genetics mimetics kemetics you know so that's the kind of uh mapping and so that the idea is that there's this new um thing uh artificial intelligence that exists on a new substrate that has its own optimization function and it's new form of replication and that that is when we think about the history of our species in the history of the universe that that is a very important moment is that there's replicators don't come along very often but now we have this third replicator that is emerging right yeah I mean I don't know if we really went into that but what a computer replicators want I mean are we talking about foundationally the seven layer stack of tcpip all the way up from the hardware it's the network to the to the packet level um is it okay it is it our keems built on on tcpip and if so you know how are they going to hijack the narrative in the future yeah it's a good question I think um I would kind of break it into three different parts so there's um the first part is the internet the second part is computers and the third part is artificial intelligence the internet is um the internet allows um like a pictures to spread and it allows these kind of like bits to spread it I'm not sure if it totally counts as a new replicator um and the reason why I say that is because the the uh so this is the difference between communication and computation communication Ika on the Internet is something that moves information through space while computation is something that moves information through time like changes it and so the Internet is just a thing that moves information around but in the end the substrate is and the optimization function is still kind of humans so we were able to send pictures around before um and the pictures they have to look nice like either the woman or the lion or whatever it may be it has to look uh the beautiful sunset it has to look nice and that internet gives us this ability to do communication but this the substrate is um or the end optimizations function is still humans similarly so the second big piece there's computation and I think that computation is when you're changing um a pattern into a different pattern and this is where code comes in in algorithms and all that stuff I think computation the internet or sorry the the the human or the in Universe new kinds of new forms of computation don't emerge at all and so computers are very important but in the end as computers are Computing on stuff they're still mostly Computing for us as an optimization function and and the final kind of third bit here is artificial intelligence I think that's like kind of the most worrying one which is that it's not just communication and moving um it's not just a new form of the book or a new radio or whatever that's still in the end humans and kind of memes are the kind of the optimization function it's not just computation which is taking patterns and changing them into other patterns still for humans where humans are the optimization function instead it's built on this new substrate it's this new thing that can replicate but it might have its own optimization function and that is um is the worrying piece right okay so the worry is that we get some sort of paper clip maximizer AI that sucks up all the energy and knows how to play everyone on a faster cycle and they turn the whole world into paper clips or something like that yeah and that the correct yes and that the correct frame on on AI safety and the paperclip problem is not one of it's not purely one of like uh moving through intelligent design space and stuff like that and it's more one of trying to understand this new third replicator and how it accesses energy and what it wants to do in ways to kind of make it in alignment with us so yeah okay um yeah I mean I I guess like you know one of the sort of theories that I've had for a little while is that blockchains are kind of looks like score keeping mechanism that allows you to create a heuristic and maybe the most obvious heuristic that everyone like you know you listen to a trading podcast and everyone's trying to trade their balance up so that they like have enough money by a house or like their kids go to college or pay for medical expenses like there's there's an optimization game that's created by the heuristic of blockchain which is tracking everyone's balances and um AI is this heuristic optimization engine so AI is an optimization game that you can point at a scoring algorithm and it figures out how to play and how to beat everyone else so like eventually all of the Bitcoin in the eth gets cornered by AIS that are like we're all just like pawns on their ability to accumulate more balances so like if capitalism is a paperclip maximizer uh because everyone's just going for more profit well how do you expand out that heuristic game into the eight forms of capital from just Financial Capital to Social Capital spiritual Capital to intellectual Capital to material Capital you know how do we get our AIS playing a game to reduce the carbon out of the atmosphere or totally intellectually enrich ourselves and stuff like that so um it feels like it feels like there's maybe some opportunity in there but I'm not sure I can completely articulate it oh it's no I mean you're totally right I think there's and you could you could talk about this from a holistic ethics holistic understanding perspective where you want the AI to be coming from a holistic understanding perspective thinking about the full system while also optimizing for a holistic ethics AKA and eight and eight dimensional version of capital not just like um Financial Capital but all spiritual capital and then you want it the final piece and we didn't talk about this too much days like and you want to be in a good feedback loop where it's like it's doing things and it's like checking in with us or whatever it doesn't just go off on its own and do its thing it's kind of in a constant kind of feedback cycle with us as it uh plays that 8D chess game yeah literally hate dimensional chess because there's eight forms of capital um do you think that information always optimizes for more energy do you think there's any times in which it optimizes for something else at the base layer like I don't know say entropy you know isn't the increasing entropy just a fundamental part of the universe and you know uh to me entropy create like um I was at a Bluegrass concert once the artist said like I just want to grasp some of that luscious entropy out there and I was like oh creativity and art is kind of entropy um do you think information wants entropy do you think that uh there's anything else at a base layer that information wants uh that is more fundamental than energy yeah it's a good it's a funny question um I think um I think that well so the first thing to note here is that yeah entropy um uh yeah there are lots of weird different definitions of entropy I think that the um uh and I think of entropy as yeah it's obviously the second law of their Dynamics it takes it's a it's really a view of um the best framing that I've heard on it is that it is a you can think of it as a probability distribution and that things with um with low entropy um have a um uh they have a very short probability distribution so it's like if I roll dice and it's six and six um wow that was very unlikely um and if you just keep hitting that a lot it's like wow the probability distribution here is crazy you must have weighted dice or something it's like a high um it's a low entropy scenario AKA a scenario where there's not much disorder there's lots of order you kind of know what you're going to pull out of the entry of the probability distribution versus what the universe mostly tends towards is a probability probability distributions that are more kind of flat um and so yeah I think that the I think that information and specifically replicators are kind of pushing Upstream against this desire for because something like humans the fact that you and I are having this chat over you know Zen caster and over a podcast shout out to our sponsors incaster um the fact that we're having this is an unlikely event um and that we even exist you know instead of our blobs that we exist as humans that can chat with each other is unlikely um and in order to to to kind of push against entropy and to push against these kind of moving to these more uh flat probability distributions you need energy to do it and so I do think that um replicators really do want energy and let me say actually one of the piece here which is um so that's one piece is that replicators do want energy because the energy allows them to push against um uh the natural state of things which is to push away towards flatter probability distributions the other piece though is that um there is in some sense replicators also in addition to energy they also want to be lazy and cheap and not use that much energy and what I mean by that is um you can imagine um so the first kind of factories were um things like printing presses and why was that true instead of like t-shirts and stuff it's because it's really cheap to just print bits to just print pieces of like letters on a piece of paper um versus something that requires more energy like something like making a factory that makes cars it's like a high energy um input thing and so oftentimes um you can imagine memes as these things that are trying to they don't necessarily want to access energy but they if they can also just be really cheap um so something like a viral like a tick tock dance or it's not really it's not something like Christianity that has these long-term access to Capital and resources all that all this is just like a cheap way to spread from mind to mind and so you can either have things that are cheap and spread to mind to mind like virals and um like low energy uh kind of desirous um replicators and you could have stuff that just instead of being high energy um output it just is very stable and so this is something like um a stone tablet or something like you know these hardness things atoms institutions and blockchains which is like blockchain is a thing that it does want access to energy it does actually need all the energy from improve work proof of sake in order to continue existing but mostly what it wants to just like hey I'm a pattern I'm a crystallized pattern in the world and like I don't really need more accidentally because I'm just chilling uh so that's like another answer to the the puzzle like how do you stick around yeah beautiful well uh I think we've been going for 55 minutes now we should probably start converging and stop diverging so I'll just ask you uh one more thing with that in mind and that's what does information want recently mark um oh boy um information wants to replicate sorry information wants to be fit with this environment it wants to be an orbiting blob either a non-equilibrium or equilibrium uh blob uh it wants to be fit with this environment it wants to be um it wants to get access to energy in order to do that um let's have a little of its environment in order to do that it wants to kind of will evolve with and symbiosis with these long um uh with with when the shadow of the future is long um and it hopefully wants to be in a metastable state with the other replicators at emerge beautiful all right I was hoping to get one more newbie oh I mean I guess the summary is good too I mean yeah I mean is there actually another newbie um [Music] I mean information wants you to right to buy the what information wants book when it comes out perfect this winter well uh this is a bit of fun Alpha leak of this specific one topic I wanted to get into a bunch of different stuff your history in the Colorado scene uh root which I interpret as like an accelerator for people who want to get into um some of these intellectual topics with you you wrote a post called marriage uh counseling with capitalism which I think is really cool and I wanted to get into that but uh we did the whole episode on what information once so I'll have to invite you back to talk about all those other things but um yeah I'm curious you know maybe we could end on where can people find you in in your work online if they want to learn more yeah so um and thank you Milwaukee for the podcast and just happy that you are um it it is a blessing for for us and me and you to be in um yeah this amazing and for all the listeners to be in this beautiful nomadic Niche with each other um and so I um yeah you can find me on Twitter at Twitter is at Reese Landmark r h y s l i n d m a r k and um yeah check out you can go to root that's the org that I run um and so we have a root Foundation uh which is you know sponsored by graph found protocol and and protocol labs and um and various other folks and so that's kind of a non-profit side that's trying to systems pill everybody and then on the for-profit side we have this root Labs thing which is like a startup studio um and we have like a web three in society Center so we're hoping to do more Dow work and help all Dow succeed and and make them be in loving co-evolving relationship with each other um so feel free to go to r-o-o-t-e dot Co that's Rudy or root it's root um that's the other place to kind of check us out all right what information wants is for you to click the links in the show notes and follow recent Twitter thank you Milwaukee be well everybody thank you Reese this is awesome bye [Music]
