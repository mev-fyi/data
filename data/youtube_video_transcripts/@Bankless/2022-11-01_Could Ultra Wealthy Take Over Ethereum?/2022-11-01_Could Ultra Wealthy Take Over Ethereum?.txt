could a group of ultra wealthy people Bezos musk Etc team up and buy a bunch of eth stake it and take over the network it's really that last part take over the network that is doing a lot of work here what does that mean are they buying their e-staking it and they have like over 66 percent of all eat staked well if they just do that that's fine what I think we're concerned about is if they like start doing malicious things they can Mint new ether they can censor certain people certain contracts they basically can dictate things so that's where we go into a user activated software this is kind of like the nuclear threat but if you're telling me that ultra wealthy people are going to buy 66 of all ether and then stake it to the network to influence it the cool thing about proof of stake is you can actually identify these people we would probably just kick them out of the validator pool and if they come back into the validator pool and start taking again then we would probably do a user activated soft work where we actually social slash their ether
