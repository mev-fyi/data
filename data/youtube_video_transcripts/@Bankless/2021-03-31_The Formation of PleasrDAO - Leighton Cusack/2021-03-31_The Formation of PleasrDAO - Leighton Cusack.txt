so where did this idea to get a collection of people come from like what was the genesis of uh people please or dao yeah i think yeah please no doubt yeah i mean the genesis was basically really wanting personally i really wanted to have a a a piece of this nft which i think is an amazing ft that represents so much about d5 it's all in one um and also just knowing that i just made an assumption like i'm not going to be able to afford this personally so i just kind of threw it out there as like hey let's try and get some people together who are reliant on like owning this piece of defy history that's how i see it the genesis was i really want this but i can't afford it right so the compromise was well we can i can just get my internet friends to band together and we can all buy a share in it so how did you how did you get these people your internet friends to coordinate and like how did it how did the coordination happen i just shared it on twitter i just shared the idea i was like hey anyone interested in this and there's a couple people who responded and said like yeah i would be and so it started with that couple people um it was like uh there was like three people and so we i so then i started like a group chat on twitter from that we set up like a telegram group we basically decided like hey let's all put in a minimum of 10 10 eth you can put in more but like 10 eth and we'll try and get enough people to be able to purchase it and we sort of assumed the bidding was already at 100 eath and so we sort of assumed like maybe it would go for like 150 maybe 200 it ended up going for a lot more but we were like okay so we need 10 to 20 people and so we just sort of pinged people who we thought were um would be interested in in participating right so it's kind of like a word-of-mouth organization it's like oh people's like oh i guess with this opportunity perhaps i will do this thing because like the damn that's already at 100 eath i would never buy that myself but if if if everyone's just contributing 10 eth well what would you say was like the average like contribution size and how did you guy how did you guys even how did you guys even do accounting the average contribution was slightly above 10. certainly the most people contributed 10. i think one thing that's interesting and andrew andrew kong um i don't know if that's how you pronounce his name i haven't met him in person but um this is sort of interesting he had the 108th bid but we were bidding against him right and so we did against him but then what happened was someone someone in the in the dao uh reached out to him and was basically like hey we're making this dow to bid on it why don't you join us and so andrew actually took that 100 east and put it into the dow and if it wasn't for him we probably would not have had enough to actually make the purchase because that was a substantial so anyways basically most people contributed 10 eth a couple did 20 and 30 and then like andrew did 100 and i think maybe one other person did like 50. yeah he was going to bet 100 eath himself but then he realized that like well instead of going into a bidding war i can just join this dell i guess the compromise is that well now andrew has to share this nft with other people but i would i would assume he has perhaps like the largest share of the people pleaser dow ownership of that nft and so a bit of a compromise but now it's part of this cool story where like at least he didn't get out bid or had to pay an even higher amount because he coordinated with his internet friends yeah and he did he had the high bid he so he he placed 100 so we outbid him and this idea which is obviously very crucial to d5 and ethereum in general that like if we collaborate we can actually do a lot more than competing against each other ultimately the price uh turned into a bidding war and like all good auction mechanisms the foundation app resets every time a new bid is is accepted so there's 15 more minutes to set a a bid do you know so that bidding works so andrew joined into into the people pleaser doubt army you guys had now now you guys have more people more capital ready to bid more who who was the next bidder that you guys had to bid against do you know we don't know but they had a lot of eve met a lot and we were like watching because they they they had a wallet they were like dropping ethan from tornado cash and so we were like oh man they just added another 100e and so you know that's the thing i'm like blocking like you can see all this right and so we're like oh it bid incoming but we just anytime i mean i think they they probably had to be intimidated right because they're seeing this wallet that has tons of people sending into it from all different addresses and it's like how do you compete against that right especially when like the the invitation to the group is open and if people are interested they can find it and just throw in their capital like how are you going to fight against the army of the many right right yeah we actually wanted to um but we it was just like we only had like 15 minutes but we wanted to send them like a message on chain and say like hey come join us that's hilarious don't fight us just join us so what's what's the state of the dow now like how are things organized as soon as the auction ended what i did is got four other trusted members of the dao on a multi-sig and transferred all the eve and the nft to the multisig so that's where it resides now right okay so what is the future of the dow like how are you guys going to manage this nft you guys are just going to have this multi-sig that owns this nft and then all the xs eth is getting returned pro rata to the dow holders how is it how is this going down well that's a great question i think you know as obviously with the doubt i can't speak for the devil but i can speak to myself i can say that i don't think anyone's interested in returning the e i don't think anyone wants to eat back i think what people are really excited about is actually growing it and um i do think there is a little bit of a niche here with with sort of um these collectibles or you know collectibles is too trivial of a word they're really like pieces of history that are specific sort of to defy i mean people pleaser is to me a quintessential defy artist right like she's been doing so many videos for so long um and so owning something from her uniswap obviously the quintessential d by protocol and there's other there's other artifacts like that that we can continue to collect that are in this um nft art but also sort of intersecting with d5 uh category and so personally for me i hope that the dial um continues collecting these because i think to me we're building we're building a museum on chain of financial history and it's going to be awesome that's so cool yeah i saw somebody's tweet that they had a people-pleaser piece of of art on for for auction somewhere else and they said oh i was trying to figure out why my piece that i forgot that i had for sale was bid on and apparently other other artwork by people pleaser was immediately bought up on the on the secondary market after the fact was that you guys well yeah so there may be some that was brought up but some was bought up by dow members yeah so someone bought down members because obviously the names pleaser dial and again like you know we we think very highly of her art and and think of her as being really again like a quintessential deep by artist and so we do want to collect a lot of her art for sure um and also uh but also you know brought more broadly these defy artifacts that um are really again it's the history in the making and we're kind of collecting it in real time that's cool this is such a fantastic story it's got a little bit of everything it's got like social organization spur the moment social organization using a dao a dao and an nft as a financial asset like capital allocation and digital art and meaning and culture that's pretty cool well and also like let's not forget the the philanthropic side of it too you know because that is yes all right of course obviously like a huge shout out to uh few people pleaser like she could have made a lot of money off of this and she decides to um support a cause that's really important right now with all the racism against asian americans or just asians in general i guess maybe in other countries but um yeah so anyways that's that i think is really cool because that is like that's also ethereum's ethos in my mind right right uh did you and did you read vitalik's piece on legitimacy uh before this event happened by chance no i hadn't seen that until you tweeted it and so and i actually i read your tweet but i haven't read the whole thing yeah it was it was so crazy like he put out this piece like a week ago about how like nft the reason why people are paying so much for nfts is because versus like like versus a copycat nft where copycat nfts are the same nft but one is legitimate and one's not and he said well a way to help gain legitimacy for nfts is if um the artist commits to doing something valuable for the world and that bestows legitimacy upon this nft and then uniswap like ethereum's de facto like application that exhibits all of the values of ethereum it uh runs this nft that is exactly in line with like this predictive like legitimacy model that vitalik had the the timing of that was just so cool that's amazing yeah i'll definitely need to read that metallic's always ahead of the curve this is always true but only by one week this time we're catching up that's good awesome leighton well thanks uh thanks for coming on and let me let me record on the youtube yeah thank you
