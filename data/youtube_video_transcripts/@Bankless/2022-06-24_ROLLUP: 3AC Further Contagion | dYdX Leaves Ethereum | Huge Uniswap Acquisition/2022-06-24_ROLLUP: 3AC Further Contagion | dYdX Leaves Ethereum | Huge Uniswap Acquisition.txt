thank the station it is friday morning you know what time it is it's a friday morning bankless weekly roll up a little bit different this week because uh ryan the ai powered down for the moment he and his other ai kids and and ai wife are all at the beach uh and so we're bringing in the substitute teacher anthony desano anthony welcome to the show man hey man great to be here great to be the substitute teacher we all know the substitute teacher is always the one that you have the most fun with right that's exactly right yeah we always love the change of pace uh so yeah we all know what's gonna happen next it's the end of the week friday weekly roll up it's the third week of june so you gotta drink go grab your morning coffee uh because we are going to recap the entire week in crypto uh which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless some big things happen this week in the world we got further three arrows capital contagion to talk about uh the cancer spread a little bit further than what we originally thought last week so we're gonna cover all of that also dydx spins up dydx chain on cosmos leaving ethereum for going for the cosmos change we're going to talk about that and uniswop acquires an nft aggregator so we're going to talk about that as well you know what to do got to like and subscribe if you're watching this on the youtube hit that subscribe button if you're watching this on the podcast go give us those five star reviews because the eath price and the five star review number are highly correlated so if you want that bull market to come back we need those five star reviews uh anthony ready to get into the markets let's get into it starting with bitcoin of course coming in at twenty thousand five hundred dollars a little bit flat on the week i'd say maybe a slight down uh anthony how are you feeling about overall in the market in bitcoin price uh i don't know like the markets are are in a funny place i think they've done things over the past i think few weeks that uh people never thought they would do right like btc and ethbo both going under their old all-time highs eth did it first then btc caught up after it and we've kind of like bounced back eid is still not back above its old all-time high but bitcoin is back above that 20k uh and i think it's kind of like no man's land right now people like oh did we actually bottom at that eight in the eight hundreds there for eighth or are we going lower and i think people are just scared to to bid right now because of that right they just don't want to get caught buying something that's going to go down even more but we don't know right it's just very very hard to tell right now i think yeah certainly ether coming in at eleven hundred dollars right now which is about 24 below its previous all-time high which is kind of a big oof i'd say uh that i don't really think we've seen that in prior market cycles usually the previous all-time high is it the crypto prices stay well above that um so yeah that is uncharted territory look i think we didn't go as high as people thought that we were gonna go on the way up right and i think that because of that we came down percentage-wise ether is down by 80 which is obviously less than last bear market which is 94 and last bear market uh btc went down 85 so i think because we went up less we've just come down like similar amount but because of that uh it means that we've kind of like gone below that old all-time high which once that broke it was kind of like well you know where's the support now sort of thing so yeah i mean that's just brutal looking at 2018 right now like johnny said so crazy oh my gosh okay no from 2017 it went down 94 oopsies but then it went up in total from the bottom oh a casual 5 500 percent to the very very pico top and then from that 5 000 up we are down another 75 so you know like three three steps forward one step backward five thousand percent up seventy five percent down these are normal normal shenanigans i guess if you zoom out in the crypto world uh quick comment on the eth btc ratio uh the new new number is about point zero five four uh we did get dow to a low number of just below point zero five but it looks like uh the btc ratio is defending the 0.5 number 0.05 number anthony any comments on the east btc ratio i think look the overall market is bearish and i think people are risk off in general and the wider market definitely considers eth to be at least a little bit riskier than btc is to hold so you know we did see the ratio kind of lose strength there but i think it's on kind of like a support level right now uh you know depending on what the market does i i'm not sure where the ratio goes from here obviously we have a huge catalyst coming up towards the end of the year for ethereum with the merge which is not just a huge catalyst on the technology side but also on the the market side but i don't have any strong feelings with the ratio right now i think it's in the same position where it's kind of like you know it could go either way at this point yeah totally all right moving to the total crypto market cap we're coming in at 0.95 uh trillion dollars so still below that one trillion dollar mark uh a little bit flat on the week um but overall crypto in the last seven days flat flat-ish um there's been some some losses here and there any other comments about the total crypto market cap anthony uh we've come down a lot right three trillion i think was the top and now it's under a trillion uh yeah it kind of like hurts that it's that low but i think it's dictated mostly by the top coins right like bitcoin and ethan stable coins things like that so you know it can change overnight right it can go back up to 1.5 trillion before we even or something like that before i even know so i don't know how much stock i put in the total market cap but it gets a lot of media coverage that's for sure certainly it does did you uh slurp any three-digit member my brother yeah yeah i i didn't get to catch the the exact bottom because i was sleeping um i got it at like 900 because i had i have resting buy orders like down every 50 bucks until like 500 so i was able to slurp it around 900 uh when i woke up i was like oh yeah that buy hit well that's scary and good at the same time it's always when uh you feel fear and you press buy anyways is when the opportunity arises uh there's a fun perspective for the for the newbies out there this is a frequent format for for bitcoin tweets in 2011 the tweet reads 2011 bitcoin fell below 20 in 2015 bitcoin bullet fell below 200 in 2017 bitcoin but fell below 2 000 and in 2022 bitcoin fell below twenty thousand dollars i actually don't know if it fell below two thousand dollars in 2017. i don't remember getting it getting that low uh it would have been like it would have been like the volatility from like the start of the run right it's kind of like cherry picked but i guess that's what they were just trying to make like a patent yeah right right right well i mean when you make the pattern and you ultimately get a fourth house 14 000 like tweet uh what would the price for ether be if we did this it would be like eighty dollars in 2017 uh almost 800 so far um maybe maybe next time it's eight thousand dollars maybe hopefully that would be good uh and then one last comment on the on the market it's a different market than what we usually talk about but the gpu markets are starting to get flooded here's a tweet that i thought was pretty interesting uh that reads chinese miners and south asian uh i don't know what the next word is uh now dismantling their mining rigs and putting up cards for auction on live streams uh 360 ti's which is a nvidia graphics card going for 300 to 500 or 300 to 350 uh us dollars which if anyone has been paying attention to the gpu mining market no the gpu market for like gaming and also mining gpus have been super highly priced for i don't know two years now uh and it looks like a lot of people are starting to actually the gpu miners are quote unquote pricing in the merge by selling their gpus on the open market uh and so gpu price is going to finally come down if you guys if anyone has been on the hunt for a gpu to build out their gaming computer it has turned into a buyer's market uh anthony any comments on this i've had a thesis for a while this was going to happen uh you know you mentioned the merge but also obviously as the prices come down miners have to sell because it's just not profitable for them to mine anymore so i think especially you know obviously once the merge happens like all these miners have basically nothing as profitable to mine like some of them will go to other chains that are that are compatible with gpus but most of them will flood the market and i actually remember posting to some friends a few months ago that i i thought shorting nvidia would have been a good trade and that has so far been a good trade and i didn't take it of course because i don't really short things but yeah it's just obvious to me that there's just going to be an absolute flood of gpus and i think nvidia themselves should be scared of this because they're trying to launch a new kind of like line of gpus by end of the year well why would anyone buy their new line when they can get like a severely discounted uh mining gpus which um for those who don't know uh miners when they use these gpus it doesn't actually materially reduce the gpu's effectiveness and doesn't really harm them so it's not like you're buying a car that's going to die on you within a few months the card is is fine to buy it's just that it's severely discounted because there's going to be so many of them flooding the market at once and it's going to be a pretty good time for gamers i think they want to want to pick up a card here yeah i actually came into the world of crypto via mining and so i remember like uh taking the profit maximalist approach to mining was not to actually run these units at super hot high speeds you would run it at like 80 to 85 capacity because you need that thing to live a long time and not break down on you uh and and i do think there's gonna be like this stigma discount on these things where like oh a mining like gamers are kind of like uh what's the word uh kind of like priv yeah they're really really picky right and so like no i don't want like a a mining gpu in my computer like that's i don't want the miners to have touched my gpu i want my gpu to be flawless but the the gpus themselves the cards are gonna be like not bad so uh different different corner of the market the the gpu market but uh you can start to see the effects of the merge getting priced in here all right fam coming up next we're going to talk about the three arrows capital contagion the continued fallout from that and of course dydx trained and as well as the uniswap acquisition of genie the

to talk about the further reach of the three eras capital cancer the spread of the virus the spread of the contagion uh voyager is an exchange apparently ryan anthony and i were just talking about like what the hell voyager is right before we uh we got here uh not not an exchange i'm familiar with but somehow they ended up having exposure to three arrows capital uh and voyager tweeted out to better serve and protect our customers in current market conditions today we announced that we signed a term sheet for 200 million dollar and 15 000 bitcoin revolving line of credit with industry leader alameda research we'll get into the alameda side of the story here the reason the details behind this why this is happening is because apparently voyager had 663 million dollars of money that they just lent out to three arrows capital which then like went full leverage full tilt leverage and then lost it all uh and so apparently voyager and exchange lend three hours capital 660 million dollars and now that three years capital is completely insolvent uh they lost all that money which is weird that it's coming from an exchange anthony what are your thoughts on here i i just can't believe like this stuff that's come out over the last few weeks like people the funny thing about people in the crypto space i mean probably people just generally is that they think that because someone has a lot of money or like a company has a lot of money or fun has a lot of money that they have that they somehow have like uh the the intelligence to back that up and as we've seen from the three hours capital fallout that definitely wasn't true they were literally pretty much the same as the dgns you see on crypto twitter just with a bigger kind of balance sheet and it's also seems to be that they didn't actually have much of their own money they didn't take outside capital as investment but they borrowed money from pretty much everyone and then we're putting that into their trades and then paying back the loans right that they took out using the profits from those trades and not telling anyone that they were borrowing from everyone else and obviously once they blew themselves up they had all this exposure to various parties out there and i don't know why voyager gave them so much money because you just saw in the tweet they have like 150 million dollars left themselves which basically makes them insolvent if 3ac doesn't pay them back right um and i'm just so confused like why did they do this like do they really get fomo and think that 3ac was going to trade this money up to be worth billions of dollars or something for them and the fact that they're kind of like i think a customer facing exchange as well uh that kind of like has retail investors it's really sad because retail investors have gotten absolutely slaughtered over the last few months right they had the terrace stuff then you had celsius you had block block fire recently block fire there hasn't been any out there yet because they got bailed out too but you know you have kind of like voyager now it's just like how how how much damage have we done in such a short period of time to these people like it's actually just insane to me right here's a tweet from tom lombardi showing one of the like terms and conditions of voyager where there is a consent to rehypothecate which i best i guess means that if you put your money in voyager you are consenting to let let them go and do whatever that they want with your money kind of like a bank uh and tom the take here from tom is that when you don't know where the yield comes from you are the yield so you go and deposit your money into voyager voyager on the back end gives all of their money to three hours capital who probably like promised voyager some yield right like give us give us your money uh and then we'll go and give you this percentage of yield and to some degree and this also happened we talked about this last week where a lot of startups gave 3o's capital their treasury uh to go do that same thing right like here's here's our treasury for our new project that from what we just raised uh ethereum's capital please go give us like six percent yield and then like ethereum's capital like probably just takes it and puts it into like anchor on tara luna and then that that goes down bad uh and then they leverage themselves up probably trying to make it back uh and that which just never ends up working out anthony you brought up uh blockfi so uh this is also part of that story zach prince the ceo of blockfi goes uh today blockfly timed uh signed a deal sheep just kind of like voyager did with ftx official also kind of like how voyager did to secure a 250 million dollar revolving revolving credit facility providing us with access to capital that further bolsters our balance sheet and platform strength the proceeds of that credit facility are intended to be contractually subordinate to all client balances across all account types and will be used as needed basically to ensure that block fi is solvent enough to allow for users to withdraw their assets and they're actually being assets there to withdraw and they're getting this money by a loan from ftx because block fi like many other lenders in this space basically every crypto lender that that three arrows capital could borrow money from three hours capital borrowed money from uh block fi included uh and so uh zach and and block and block fly like definitely like i would call it more regulated more above the board type of lender out there but even you know even block fish is not immune to this anthony any thoughts on on the blockfly side of things yeah i mean i think we're just very quickly seeing why c5 is not sustainable why c5 is what we're trying to replace with d fire right while we're actually trying to build better systems is because once you throw your funds into these c5 platforms it's opaque as hell and you have absolutely no idea what they're doing with your funds as opposed to defy even if these defraud protocols aren't actually decentralized you can still track whatever what what's happening on chain right you can see where all the funds are going like it's all open and transparent uh and there's no need to kind of like uh uh just kind of be in the dark about it and even with the terror collapse people were screaming about it for a long time because you could see exactly how it all worked i mean even the white paper told you how it worked whereas with these c5 platforms you're just throwing money into the void and hoping you can withdraw it one day and you mentioned they were regulated they are but they're not regulated like banks are right and they don't suffer the same consequences as banks and that's what they need to get to if they want to be you know a better platforms but i think that's going to come now i think regulators are really going to screw these guys now because they've just played with fire and got burnt yeah like we say frequently on banquets if you can be regulated you should be regulated and if you can't be regulated it's because you're decentralized and you're transparent and therefore you're regulated by code the last part of this story comes from blockfy which is apparently allegedly uh struggling to raise uh so they are going through another raise round i believe blockfly raised something that raised at a valuation of like five billion dollars at least that's what this tweet says from frank shaparo at the block definitely reputable news source so when when frank's tweet something it's not it's not like vapor uh and so previously block five raised at a five billion dollar valuation and then they are now raising again raising more money uh but at a valuation of just about one billion dollars uh so going from a five billion dollar valuation to a one billion dollar evaluation in about six months time uh so a significant loss of valuation by block fi i mean probably related to crypto market prices going down yields going down but then also like losing a bunch of money to three hours capital too uh and so uh overall just like not a it's a bad week to be a centralized money lender let me tell you that anthony yeah yeah exactly and man i think this is just following on with the trend as well of like uh the private markets coming down they typically lag the public markets by about three to six months but some of the private valuations are getting way ahead of themselves and when i saw block fight raise at that valuation that five billion dollar one i even thought at the time that that was insane like i didn't think that they were worth that much at all based on kind of like i guess what they were at the time and definitely today they're not and i think the market is kind of repricing that there and also repricing the risk now of these kind of like uh these services all right moving on to the second big news item of the week dydx chain the whole entire blockchain uh dydx the uh has it used to have its own layer two on ethereum using starkware technology and it still does i don't think they've migrated yet but they are planning dydx version four which includes dydx chain which is a cosmos chain so going from ethereum layer two to a cosmos zone i think and so they they tweet out dydx v4 will be developed as a standalone blockchain based on the cosmos sdk entenderman proof of stake consensus protocol at dydx we embrace radical changes in technology that have the potential to dramatically improve the protocol after exploring the landscape of current and upcoming blockchain technologies we've decided that cosmos will allow us to build the best and fully decentralized protocol anthony what are your thoughts on this move so there's there's a lot of thoughts here like a lot of thoughts um i do want to say that i think diy dx isn't being that forthcoming with their reasoning here i think that like from people i've spoken to and just thinking about this a lot uh since it was announced i think that the main reason they're doing this is regulatory i don't actually think this has much to do with the technical aspects of it and i'll explain my reasoning there in this announcement in this blog post they talk a lot about decentralization right decentralization is the centralization that blah blah right right now with their starkville implementation of the ui dx they cannot decentralize it because starkwear does not have the ability to have decentralized sequences yet uh stalker hasn't hasn't put in those features uh or anything like that and the order book specifically is centralized and dydx does all the matching and things like that whereas with a cosmos chain for example they can spin up their own validators they can say well there's dydx people can can stake their token holders can stake their val um their tokens and validate the chain and then they can kind of say to regulators or anyone that comes knocking hey we're actually decentralized we don't centrally control any part of the protocol it's part of the the um dydx protocol and there's nodes that validate it and they're spread are all around the world when in reality it's not really going to be that decentralized because the 50 of the token supply belongs to insiders anyway but i guess that's orthogonal to the point of that i think this is just much more to go to do with regulatory than it does with technical because i actually think this is the third time that dydx has now pivoted on their product stock first they were on layer one ethereum then they went to stock ware layer two now they're doing dydx chain and honestly like yes they're kind of like got a lot of traction as they're layer two and their layer two is actually really cool i love using it but uh from what i've seen they're nowhere near the capacity that starcraft can give them right i think they do like 10 tps or something like that and i'm sure starkware has plans to decentralize the sequencer and and kind of like improve their technology and bring more scale and all that sort of stuff so i think it's less technical and much more regulatory for those reasons i outlined and i just don't think that this is a good move from that perspective because i get the regulatory side of things but you're sacrificing your product and your technology for that and maybe they believe that they can build a better product maybe they truly believe it but i don't know like from everything i know layer twos are still strictly better than cosmos chains and it's not even a technically a cosmo zone because they're not going to connect to the cosmos hub from from what i've seen they're just going to be their own standalone chain that uses cosmos technology and the dydx token will be used to validate the network and so by doing that they're actually giving up heaps of security too right like they're literally leaving say you're in like a massive fortress and you have an army protecting you that this is what they're doing they're leaving that fortress and they're going to their own camp out in the wilderness have a few guards posted and that's how they're going to protect their chain now so i think the trade-offs that they're taking here are really really kind of like bad and i actually don't think this is a positive for them but as i said if if you take the regulatory view i think it makes a lot more sense than the technical view yeah i i definitely agree with that take that's an interesting take that i haven't heard yet about the the security comment uh this is also where the changes in the dydx token come into play uh and so the uh the dydx token which uh you know is is a token on ethereum but is now going to be part of its own layer one blockchain this is a brand new layer one blockchain that's coming to play here uh the in in this blog post they go the dydx token uh is the protocol token of the duidx protocol of course governed bias holders the v4 protocol is designed with a need for layer one protocol token the protocol token would be used for staking to validators as well as ongoing governance of the chain the t the dydx token would seem to be a natural fit to be used as the layer one token uh of the v4 network but we look forward to understanding with the perspectives of the dydx community uh i'm trying to find where this is on screen but i'll find that in a sec but basically now in order to have a layer one blockchain uh you need to have a token and so like dydx is becoming the ether of uh you know ethers to ethereum dydx token is to dydx and now you stake dui dx and run a validating node and you like process the blockchain as one does but this like previously dydx didn't have to pay for security which is what you were saying they would just they would just receive the security from ethereum now that they're going to their own layer one blockchain there needs to be duidx emissions to pay for security changing the nature of the token uh and and so you can now if you're bullish on dydx you can now stake it run a node process the blockchain and receive those emissions but this is now an expenditure that the system didn't previously have and now it does have because like you said they have to pay for their own security yeah any thoughts on that yeah yeah i mean you're totally right and i think like you know some people have kind of brought up what up points around are they they're doing this because they want to drive more value to the dydx token and i'm like yeah okay i could see that right there is a there is typically a layer one premium some of these things get but at the same time uh there by by doing this as you said they have to inflate their token to secure their chain here um and actually one thing i forgot to mention about the regulatory stuff before and gives further kind of like proof to this is that the air drop that dydx did they barred us investors from getting that air drop so they have been very very careful when it comes to regulatory stuff right so i think that um that game is kind of like further proof that this is a lot to do with regulatory stuff rather than technical technical stuff and we've had antonio on the show before and one of the takes that i've really enjoyed from antonio is that he is not uh he is not a maximalist in anything other than dydx himself he's going to build the best derivatives exchange possible i and we enjoy because he was building it as a layer two on aetherium and he says that he's going to be able to beat out competition by by optimizing for decentralization and using decentralization as a tool uh but the take here is antonio is a dydx maximalist he's going to do whatever possible to make the uidx the best exchange possible and so the the the writing on the wall actually started i think forever ago when suzu had that abandoning ethereum uh tweet uh which you can which antonio retweeted and said here's a risky tweet of the day this is said much harsher than i would put it but i somewhat directly agree ethereum has not executed over the past years i can't think of a single 10x useful improvement ethereum has made in the last four years uh and this was back in like november of 2021 when we had this like drama with suzu and the ethereum community uh and antonio kind of tapped on and agreed with stu saying like well you know ethereum as a protocol hasn't really upgraded and so uh the writing on the wall here uh was it was was definitely present and then later antonio tweets i don't 100 don't care what train dydx is built on all i care are the technical tradeoffs decentralization security scalability ux et cetera the apps will move to other chains if or when they offer better trade-offs anyone who doesn't like it will be out-competed uh so you could you could kind of see the the tone that anthony was taking forever ago antonio excuse me uh was taking forever ago in november 2021 uh and now it has come to fruition of dydx going on its own blockchain we are actually having antonio for the state of the nation this coming tuesday so we're going to talk to him about this this decision uh and like what made him uh make this decision for moving dydx over to cosmos uh there's some takes from some ecosystem participants uh paulinea had this tweak where he said they said very interesting technically everything here can be done with rollups and better so for many reasons there are two advantages of going with their own layer one blockchain i can think of sovereignty and timing probably a combination of both concerned about the plummeting security though one observation in potential red flag they have some deep answers about uh they have some deep answers about decentralization but there's not a peep about security they say they will use the dydx token with 50 of tokens allocated to insiders how will this thing be economically secure and sustainable what do you think of polynya's take here anthony yeah i think he has it on on the money uh i think it like when you kind of look at these sorts of stuff and the arguments from the pro i guess cosmos people i should say their arguments usually revolve around them thinking that sovereignty is critical they think that every change should be an app chain should be sovereign should be able to do what it wants and have full control over its uh kind of like destiny and you know what i actually get that i get that view i don't agree with it but i get it and i think this is where the divide comes as well from ethereum and cosmos like ethereum ecosystem believes that sovereignty of a chain is just really not that important you don't get any benefits from it the trade-off includes you know you're plummeting security as polynomial said here um and then timing i would also agree with because i don't think starkware is ready right now for what the idx wants to do so if they're trying to get ahead of regulators then they you know it's probably existential enough for them to kind of like go to a a new chain as as well there so so yeah i agree with those points but i also just wanted to quickly touch on what you were saying with antonio before i actually don't really believe what antonio was saying a lot of the time like a lot of the comments i've seen from him over the years and this might be controversial i don't know antonio personally or anything like that but the comments that he's made especially that tweet that you highlighted from november 2021 showed that he just doesn't really have a deep understanding of ethereum or its scaling roadmap or how it's going to kind of like get to where he i you know he would want it to be for dydx so i do believe it when he says he's a dydx maxie because it's his company right he's trying to grow it as big as possible but i think that he's making strategic mistakes here personally and and you know well that's just my own opinion i could be wrong i'm not going to say i'm right here but i do think that he he makes some comments like oh you know eth2 is three you know habitually three to five years away and it's like well no even back then we knew proto-dank sharding was going to be that thing that gave a lot of benefit to em layer twos and that should come like relatively soon he also had made a comment about eip1559 and he thought it lowered gas fees when you know anyone who was paying attention knew it didn't do that so i think that there's just a divide here that um you know i don't know if it's other app developers or just antonio where they don't seem to understand how ethereum is going to actually scale even though he built on a layer 2 and everything i i feel like because he's so focused on dx itself as a product he seems to miss the forest for the trees so to speak right he seems to be focusing a lot on the atx but losing sight of maybe the bigger picture of kind of like the the scaling stuff and you know i guess it's his kind of like thing to prove everyone wrong you know with cos with uh not cosmetic with the idx chain uh we'll see how that how that goes there but this isn't the first time we've seen this either there was comp chain from compound back in december of 2020 that went nowhere they didn't build it on cosmos they built it using polka dot substrate or at least they attempted to that went nowhere and now cosmos wants to deploy to other evm chains and and things like that like layer twos and things like um some other apps have done so you know we're still early remains to be seen but again going back to what point point i said uh i just don't think the trade-offs are worth it like trading off massive security for some sovereignty for what right like what do you need that sovereignty for that is worth all that security loss is my question to people and i haven't really come up with a good answer yet yeah and the other the other conversation is do you have the same on-ramps when you're on your independent blockchain versus layer 2 to ethereum because if you're on a layer 2 to ethereum like i can send my assets on ethereum straight over to dydx instantly but i in order to get to a cosmos train i'd have to take a bridge or go through a centralized exchange so like there's a conversation about like where the money flows in but let's go ahead and move on to the next big item the last big newsweek news news item of the week unit swap acquiring genie uniswap labs tweets out the uniswap universe is expanding in pursuit to unlock universal ownership and exchange we're excited to share that we've acquired genie xyz the first nft marketplace aggregator expanding our products to include both erc20s and nfts anthony first impressions on on this news first impressions was that it was only a little bit surprising to me like i think that uni swap uh as a kind of like a vibe and a culture has always been about just swapping things in general doesn't matter if it's tokens or nfts i mean obviously they had uni socks which technically isn't an nft but i mean uh it kind of like it practically is uh so yeah i wasn't really surprised by this but i also had some thought thoughts about like just aggregators in general and how i think that so far decentralized exchange aggregators themselves have actually not fared well against the single exchanges so like for example one inch has not really fed well against uni swap and neither has the other aggregators but i actually think when it comes to nft aggregators it's going to be a different story because you know you can have the same fungible liquidity pool across many different dexes but a lot of the time you won't have the same kind of like thing between different nft marketplaces so for example there might be an nft that's listed on openc but it's not listed on looks rare and then you're only on looks rare well then you haven't found it there and you won't you won't be able to buy it whereas an nft aggregator will actually tell you where the nft is like what marketplace it's on uh so i i think that because of that the nft aggregator probably has much much more of a chance of being a thing than the decentralized exchange regulators have been to date uh and unicef obviously has that brand power to make it happen too like just insane brand power and and awareness around uni swap that's for sure and in case you missed it we talked to hayden on the on the youtube uh to that show if you guys want more details on that show hayden and i talked to this is him in the uni-swap offices down in soho in new york uh pretty cool offices i've been there uh i was uh over there about a week ago where he actually like gave me the alpha a little bit ahead time so i kind of kind of knew it was coming uh if you guys have used uh genie uh you got a usdc airdrop if you used genie more than once you got air dropped usdc uh which is an interesting airdrop i don't think i've ever seen a dollar stable coin air drop before uh but either way that's what that's what happened so uh airdrop season's still on still on but usd air drops that this time all right uh that is the big news items but there is so much more news left we got the arbitrary odyssey to talk about which is extremely exciting we got some defined down bad stories as well as some ether staking stories uh and of course we got some elon musk and dogecoin things to talk about as well so all that is coming up next right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the era of proof of stake is upon us and lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stick any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return sces can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eath to centralized taking services or exchanges lydo now supports solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof-of-stake asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your eath soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started and we're back bankless nation on to the rest of the news starting with the arbitrary odyssey arbitrary tweets out the arbitrary odyssey will officially start on tuesday june 21st that was this last tuesday so this has already started happening we know all you argonauts have been very excited to venture into the unknown with us and we're very eager to have you on board and so starting on june 21st at 1 pm by using any of the bridges or centralized exchange listed below here's the here's the tweet uh you can to to move eth into arbitrary you'll be able to claim the first nft after the week ends users who end up using the bridge that have the most wallets bridging into arbitram are in store for a bonus nft so here is a bunch of available bridges hop protocol across transact li-fi leafy d-gate seller network cash flow uh there's so many of these and so i guess if you get your ether on to arbitrarium you get an nft uh and then that is the first part of the aubergine articy that's the bridge week and then weeks two through eight is like dap week is kind of how i've separated this in my head first there's bridge week to get all the ether onto arbitrary and then there's dap week which are weeks two through eights so there's so many applications on arbor stream that you're gonna use and then they're gonna give you nfts if you use them uh so it's basically just a big treasure hunt for nfts over the arbor trump odyssey anthony any comments on this i think it's an interesting way to grow their ecosystem without using a token that's what i really like about this is obviously arbitrary does not have a token yet may or may not in the future but uh because they don't have a token yet they're using this as a way to bootstrap the the growth and i think also they are aware of the fact that people are going to be using this as a way to potentially farm a future air drop right which obviously has factored into this but i mean i don't think that's that's kind of like uh a big deal there i've already seen some really nice metrics that people are kind of like bridging in and they're kind of using um kind of arbitrary there and they're kind of like obviously using i think hop protocol i think yeah that was that's the tweet that i saw so most people seem to be using hot protocol there there's actually a lot of bridges now like that graphic that you just showed there's so many bridges there's too many at this point i think but like i just don't i don't think most of them are gonna like survive long term just just there's too many right but uh but it's cool to say that they're all being supported at least by arbitrary people can use them they can kind of like get get value out of them uh but yeah i just as i said i think it's it's cool that albuquerque's bootstrapping kind of growth new users without using a token because i've always for like a long time now said that i want to see more kind of like incentive programs that don't involve a token because we all know how liquidity mining programs end they don't end very well for the podcast listeners this tweet that we're looking at here says over 4 000 users have bridged to arbitrage on the first day of the odyssey campaign over 2800 alone used hop protocol amazing to see and then the chart here is just like a big candle uh uh which is illustrating daily new users bridging into arbitrarium it looks like it's hovering around like you know 50 to 200 on like an average day and then like this big red candle is at over 4 000 people in one day and about 2 000 people the next day and so people like the tokens people like the nfts uh and so william pister in the bankless newsletter put an article out called the arbitrary odyssey begins breaking down the arbitrary odyssey and getting you all the information you need so if you're trying to do a deeper dive into what you should be doing if you want to embark upon the arbor patron odyssey you can check out that newsletter for all the details down there all right moving into the d5 down bad section this is a governance proposal on this thing called soul end uh and this is this is some spicy drama uh the title of this governance proposal is mitigate risk from whale and basically the tldr of this proposal is that there is somebody using soul and on solana and soul end is basically like the ave or the compound version but on solana seoul lend like lend your money and there's somebody there's a big whale that put all of his soul tokens into soul land and borrowed a bunch of stables from it and it's very very close to getting liquidated i think the liquidation price is something like 22 dollars the sold price is back up to like something like 35 but it did get down to like 28 dollars and the problem here was that there were so many solana tokens in this position and there was not enough sufficient liquidity in these solana decentralized exchanges to liquidate this for for what it was worth so like the soul token in solana's defy ecosystem was literally going to go to zero because there wasn't enough liquidity there uh and so there was a governance proposal to uh take the money take the the position from this whale and like uh take it over liquidate a part of it and then just in order to prevent this cascading liquidation uh anthony what are your takes here yeah i mean this is like the cardinal sin right of uh of kind of like d5 if you do this you just are not defy like at all like i mean there are obviously admin keys for a lot of d5 protocols and multi-sigs and things like that but i'm not aware of any in the ethereum ecosystem that have done something like this even propose something like this of taking over an account because uh they want to kind of like do it for the good of the protocol or something like that right so i i think that it was insane and then they had another vote i don't know if we're going to talk about that but like that another vote to like invalidate this first vote which was i mean in very much in favor of yes you can see a 97.5 yes um and like which was i think a lot of the a lot of the voting was the team like in investors because of course they're just gonna vote with with with them but uh yeah it was not it was not good that's for sure okay so the this initial vote to take over the uh the position of this whale passed but then there was another vote that said like wait wait no just kidding we don't want that well yeah because the sold price went back up right and they're like well the sole price is up but it's no longer our risk anymore so let's do another vote to cancel the first vote and i was like this is just clown world now like this isn't even funny anymore like it's just stupid um but i don't know if it's gonna load for you there but yeah there was another vote um i think like uh this is the end but mind you this is the first vote on the governance forum they had no other ones they just had this one oh man it's just it's funny it really is yeah well i think there's a i would imagine that the sole lens token doesn't have a lot of distribution because of how uh how young the application is uh and so there's the critique going around that this is basically just like the operators of the protocol voting to take over the margin position of this of this large whale who just didn't do anything um so i hope this guy both the sole end community the sole end operators in this whale is definitely hoping that we don't go down like another 20-30 percent because then we will start to be liquidating all the solana tokens yeah i mean there is that but there's the thing with the whale is that like i don't think the whale even cares to pay this back because how are they going to liquidate that much salt they've already got over 100 million dollars of stable coins that they can just keep right like who cares about the soul like they there is obviously a 60 million difference here but if they can't sell the soul anyway because there's too much of it like they're just gonna take that money and run right right right yeah there's a lot more liquidity for us dollars than there is solana tokens that is for sure um the here's a tweet from fat man tara this is pretty wild this a lot the soul end team wants to take over the whale's accounts and execute the liquidation themselves the whale's position is so degenerate that if soul drops too low it will cause cascading liquidations basically recapping what we just said uh and then at the end of this tweet thread he said the solen team just confirmed to me that when this change is implemented the whale will instantly be partially liquidated down to a safer ratio soil price is 32 but his current liquidation price is only 22 on the fence about the main proposal but i do not agree with that part uh so some some interesting decisions going around when communities get stressed and speaking of communities get getting stressed bancor has released a market conditions update in june 19th 2022 which is when this was posted and they said due to hostile market conditions bancor's impermanent loss protection is temporarily paused il protection will be reactivated on the protocol as the market stabilizes this is a temporary measure to protect the protocol and its users and so what this really means is bancor has this interesting mechanism to mitigate from il and permanent loss protection and basically if you just want to supply ether into bancor's amm bank or is like a very much like unit swap it's an amm but it's got some extra features uh and it involved with his token and some other things and so you can do single-sided liquidity providing so you can provide liquidity for the ether bnt pair but if you don't want to provide liquidity for both you can just do it for bnt and the bancorp protocol will mint the extra bnt to provide that that balance liquidity and that this is a way for people to not have to deal with in permanent loss because they just inflate to bnt in order to mitigate from impermanent loss which is attractive for lps but also it's it's a it's a sacrificing value capture in the bnt token by making it inflationary as a function of impermanent loss and so hazu had this really spicy take that says bank or shell of impermanent loss hiding is collapsing they print new bnt to compensate underwater liquidity providers and they call it impermanent loss protection the cost is transferred to bnt holders via inflation which causes further impermanent loss to all other bnt pairs and leads to even further inflation a death bio you can see it clearly in the performance of these dex tokens uni's down 20 sushi's down 28 but bnt is down 61 and then he continues saying now bancor is pulling the plug to stop the bleeding didn't even take three weeks for my prediction to play out more reading and he he tags a kobe tweet and kobe says the need to pause in permanent loss protection is a result of how we designed and built in permanent loss protection kobe always being a little bit facetious here anthony what are your takes here i've been really harsh on bancor on my own show like over this and i've just not been a fan of bancor since basically day one i remember their ico i participated in their ico back in 2017 um and back then they actually in their ico for those who maybe who weren't around they changed the rules of the ico mid mid sale where they were supposed to be capped and then they changed it to kind of like be uncapped because there was so much demand and they got all this extra money and ever since then i've just like not liked them and then even even on their technology side they didn't really seem to do anything innovative right they have that obviously the amm and everything like that but this impermanent loss protection thing that they were doing i looked at it i'm like what how does this make any sense it's literally just inflating the token to uh and and the um the cost is born by token holders so as far as i'm aware there's no kind of like solution to impermanent loss like in terms of like everyone winning someone's always losing like you know what i mean like there's always going to be someone losing if you're trying to protect against impermanent loss so i think from that perspective i uh i think what bangkok did here is another cardinal scene where they paused it they broke their their social contract with their community uh to save their their own kind of like token value but you know you're bringing bring up the chart here it's already down 95 percent from its all-time high so it's it's not much left to save [Laughter] it's actually interesting you can see this dynamic play out when you compare the price to the market cap of bancor because since the token supply is flexible the market cap and the price charts look very very different so like the market cap chart actually has gone up like the system has captured value it's lost a lot of it in the last like you know week or so um but like the price seems to have you know been down over over the the course of time since like uh july of 2017 when this token came into existence but the market cap has actually gone up a decent amount because the system captures value but the token is just sacrifice in order for the system to capture value uh and so uh with the removal of the permanent loss thing what happens is that if you as an lp would have suffered in permanent loss but then you withdrew your assets uh bnt would just be minted and sold into the market so that you could be protected from i from a permanent loss but since so many bank or liquidity providers would have felt impermanent loss because of how down bad the bnt price is it would cause a hyperinflation event not unlike the one that we saw with tara luna but just with a different mechanism and so like you know impermanent loss protection good in times of market when markets don't go moving in one significant direction like if it stays within a particular band that's kind of where the mechanism works but as soon as you find any long tail risk and like down 90 percent mechan market conditions that's when the whole system breaks um so moving moving on from that d fight down bad here's some some more optimistic side of uh the the crypto world going into ethereum staking this is at the nether mind saying with the sepolia beacon chain set to be launched today we can cur confirm the readiness of our sepolia nodes today we'll mark another big step towards the merge with the panda emoji anthony i know you pay attention to this side of ethereum much more than the average person much more than me and ryan can you give us the tl dr what's going on here yeah so the the sapolia public test net needed a beacon chain uh because if it's going to run through the merge transition it already has a you know execution kind of like layer chain it needed a consensus layer to merge with so they launched a new beacon chain for sopolia which will be merged into the existing sapolia network uh and that will happen look there's been some dates thrown around it's either gonna be late this month like really late this month or early next month uh and then once that happens that'll be the second public test net that goes through the merge transition and then we have one left after that and that's goalie so but yeah the beacon chain needed to be launched for sepolia because there just wasn't one so we couldn't merge into anything unless we launched a a new beacon chain but this is test net this is not main there nothing to do with mainnet it's just all test nets still right now yeah but there's only so many test nets left before the main net day eventually comes continuing on the theme of e-staking lido has announced an expansion of the lido node operator set so i previously believed that lido had about 14 validators independent validators from around the ecosystem and they are adding in a bunch more chain safe attestant a few others nevermind prismatic labs all becoming validators in the lido network but also at the same time while lido does move forward in adding more and more validators to their network we have swell network an alternative newer staking as a service application protocol i launched a test net so things are moving in the world of staking as a service uh the swell network dow says they are pleased to publicly announce the launch of swell v2 test night on the gorly network a critical milestone in the development swells next generation eath liquid staking design and so if you are interested in that world of staking and want to be part of the swell networks test net there's a call to action to join that uh that test net and there's a link in the show notes to get started anthony any comments on these two bits and news yeah i think staking uh especially lsds or liquid staking um uh tokens and and providers have been uh the talk of the town over the last few months especially because lido's dominance got so high you know over 30 on on the network and i think with this addition of new validators or uh they're basically going from i think 21 to 28 or 29 uh validator nodes which is pretty cool to see and some of these include you know obviously ethereum core teams as well which has led to a bit of controversy people saying you know we shouldn't be throwing so much support behind lido because they're already a big part of the network and things like that i mean i you know i see all the sides to it but i've long been a believer that there's just there's really only two things that are gonna fix the um i guess like distribution of steak and is going to make the steak be more distributed uh it's more competition would you just mention swell network entering the the fray there with their test they're going to be on main net hopefully soon um and there's others out there like rocker pool and things like that and also waiting until withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain for people to actually be able to withdraw because right now all you can do to exit your lido position is sell your st on the open market which is actually at a discount right now you can't actually redeem your st for ether from the beacon chain because withdrawals aren't enabled so lido's position can only go up only unless people stake with another provider and their share of the network goes down but all of the eighth that went through lido is still going to be locked through lido until the beacon chain withdrawals are enabled so those are the two main things i look out for and i'm always for kind of like more competition coming online for these staking providers and there's going to be so many of them there's the the opportunity's so big to be a kind of like staking provider as well so so yeah i'm i'm glad to see that kind of like um kind of that continue on here uh if you want to you can go to coin get go and see it quickly if it's not working on on curve oh there you go yes yes yes discount there yeah damn it it was uh it was up to seven percent a few days ago and i was thinking about locking it in but now it's down to five percent um it's basically a free year of staking yield when you think about it right because if you're willing of taking that little bit of risk on to buy st now and just wait till beacon chain withdrawals are enabled you get like a free year's worth of staking yield that you can just redeem once uh the withdrawals are enabled you can get one eighth back for 0.95 st right for example which is which is pretty cool but again there is some additional risk there right some additional assumptions but i was going to buy it capitals are going to be locked up for a while so you got to be ready for that all right okay moving on i'm going to close these tabs on to some nft news crypto's web3 expert leaves auction house to run crypto punks for yuga labs noah davis a key factor in the storied auction house's embrace of crypto and was involved in people's 69 million sale in march of 2021 has left christie's and joined yuga labs uh to lead in the crypto punk effort which is a unique thing to do of course because crypto punk's a unique place in the in the world of nfts on ethereum being like kind of the the first og nfts on ethereum so noah tweets out i'm humbled and honored to announce i'll be leaving my current post in july to steward crypto punks as brand lead under the umbrella of yugo labs before i say anything else it's important to confirm what we won't be doing simply put i will not f with the punks uh which is a very important part of like the the crypto punk ethos uh as a crypto punk owner i align with this uh don't mess with the punks leave them alone uh they don't need a road map uh they don't need any sort of like uh the the punks kind of think the apes are kind of cringe i would agree with that uh and so noah just wants to put out this tweet thread saying that he will leave the the brand of the punks where it is and so he says uh what does this mean it will be no punks on lunch boxes or cringe tv or shitty movies it means no arbitrary rush utility through thoughtless airdrops it means if you love your punks because of what they are just punks then you and i see eye to eye the first thing i will do is this if you are a punk holder and you will care about the legacy future of the brand i want to talk one on one i will be at the punk's brunch during nft nyc that happened last tuesday and we'll begin scheduling with sit downs immediately wherever punks go the community will help guide us anthony any thoughts on this not too many thoughts like i'm not an nft guy but i thought it was funny that there was insider trading that happened before this was announced yeah right about like 24 hours or so before this was announced yeah you can see here the the crypto punk floor just absolutely went bananas and everyone was wondering why and then we saw why and it's just funny how like obvious it was right and people are trying to say no it's not because of that it's because punk's a back baby and it's like well no it's because of this announcement but this announcement could mean that punks are back so to speak and punks will actually um you know be given the love they deserve so to speak that they've because they've been neglected for a while here so i guess whatever the reason was it's just still funny to see that this was a pretty big move as well this went from like what 38 to 60 or something i can i can see on the chart there yeah i think the the low is like 48 or 45 to eat i wasn't i wasn't tracking the absolute low um but yeah like punks did have their all-time high volumes in week last week uh and every like and again it happened so much volume without any explanation uh and then we realized that somebody got the leak and then it started just trading um also in the nft world doodles announces that pharrell is coming on as the chief brand officer uh along with a fundraiser led by alexis ohanian so if you're a doodle holder congratulations i guess pharrell is now your chief brand officer and alexis ohanian also a part of the the doodles ecosystem and then of course what else we have in the nft world yeah time magazine partnering with sandbox to build a the time square version of itself in the metaverse and this will be used as a hub for all of the time pieces and so time did that nft sale forever ago um forever forever in crypto it's like six months ago and they have actually really leaned into a good useful uh an honest application of nfts at least in my opinion and so now they are partnering with sandbox to produce a virtual version of times square where you can see some of the timepieces this is what they call themselves they're nfts timepieces in a virtual version of times square so that is pretty cool anthony any comments on that before we go on um just on the doodles thing they also announced doodles too i think and they hinted like going off of ethereum or something and going to yeah there you go and going to another chain but i don't know what chain they're going to go to i don't know if it's going to be a layer 2 or something like that uh but yeah i don't know like this is why i have like a love-hate relationship with with nfts like they say oh they're doing doodles too it's like okay well you know i i i haven't been following this that closely but like a lot of this stuff always looks like just a money grab to me and maybe i'm completely wrong as i said i don't follow this very closely you you're actually way more involved with nfts than i am but uh we'll have to see how that shakes out we'll have to see what doodles 2 actually is is it just like a new platform that people can migrate their doodles to it's like a layer 2 or something like that that'd be cool um but yeah i mean they've got like big names on board now for our williams obviously and alexis alexis is an investor they're obviously trying to build a world and trying to build a metaverse around doodles rather than just be a pfp project which i which i [ __ ] with honestly i like that like that's cool like and you know what i would i wish that i bought like some of those coffee cup doodles early on because i love the look of them i'm obviously a coffee maximalist for those who know me but yeah i don't know the nfts as i said love hate relationship with them and you and i get into debates about them quite often actually uh so yeah i mean i hope they prove me wrong i hope they can be more than just what we've seen over the last you know year or so of just constant scam pfp things coming out and just like extracting money i want to see meta versus i want to say cool [ __ ] built i want to see actual products and services built around them that's just my kind of like take on nfts maybe more generally it does seem to be the new meta for nfts that if you aren't creating a metaverse then your nft is like not playing the game like every single nft needs its own metaverse uh this is where like apecoin dao started talking about ape chain uh having an own independent blockchain and having your own independent metaverse really goes hand in hand uh and i totally see a world where every single nft pfp profile picture whatever that wants to really invest in itself creates its own layer two or its own blockchain uh be it if i guess if the they're doing their own chain then the theme of the week is like abandoning ethereum uh we also know how that turns out uh in the long term anyways moving on into regulation and tradify stuff tesla ceo elon musk accused of dogecoin ponzi scheme in new class action lawsuit uh elon musk is facing a class action lawsuit over his dogecoin hype fest the the complainant alleges musk's tweets and public messaging drove a significant price by condoge and encouraged people to invest those people ultimately feel the fallout when doge price took a nosedive anthony any comments on this i mean i'm honestly just sick of elon musk and day's pumping of those like i don't think that he's responsible for what people do like if people want to buy doge because he tweets about it that's on them but i'm just like always of the same opinion that i've been on for a while that he could be using his platform to educate people about crypto and and more generally instead of just funneling them into some retail slaughterhouse because a dogecoin is not a scam right it was not started as a scam or anything like that it was actually one of the the fairest launched coins in crypto to be fair but the thing is is that like it's treated and abused as a retail slaughterhouse because traders just kind of like trade it whenever they know that retail's here and they can make some money off of it it has no kind of like fundamental value at the end of the day backing it up and no one really cares to hold dogecoin for the long term or anything so i that's just my overall opinion on it and i really wish musk would just use his platform for better crypto things yeah he does seem to be uh chaotic neutral on twitter at this point uh and sometimes that chaos leads into the negative territory especially when it comes to financial assets ryan sean adams the ai robot that's not here today said sorry dude elon musk wasn't responsible for you buying fake internet money based on a dog meme you did that to yourself uh got to take responsibility when you buy some assets uh okay all right moving on into the world of jobs there are always jobs there's always hiring going on in the world of crypto so this is the bankless jobs board you can go and go off the shelf and pick a job off the shelf here at bankless.palette.com jobs we're going to read some of these out we got a cto job at alliance dao got a software engineer full stack software engineer also at alliance dao senior software engineer and executive assistant all at alliance dow a solidity engineer at otter space a front end engineer at abstract ventures a founder you can become a founder do you know you can become a founder on a job support who knew and founder and ceo of a web3 community analytics platform boolean labs twitter specialist at bankless if you can write good tweet threads let me know also a research engineer at blockchain capital a tech lead at swell network that's that staking as a service dow that we talked about earlier and many many many more we got argent we got tally we got d5 yield we got a hiring coordinator at ethereum foundation there are so many jobs uh so go to the link in the show notes get a job bankless.pallet.com jobs also if you think that you are highly talented and you don't see a job right for you you can also post your resume post your your profile to thebanklist.palette.comtalentboard and you can have the jobs come to you so get a job in crypto uh that's why and we're going to buy the dip with all the money that we're going to get from our new crypto jobs isn't that right anthony yeah yeah well i'm not going to get a crypto job but i think everyone should i already have a crypto job right i do i do the early way but i think that if look my honest um kind of like take on just jobs in crypto in general is that getting them in a bear market's better than getting them in a bull market i think in the bear market there are a lot more honest teams there's a lot more sustainability and a lot more things that are just interesting and there's a lot less crazy so you can actually take your time as well but yeah if you're listening to the weekly roll up every week and you love crypto and you're not working in crypto yet well now's the perfect time to get involved in my opinion yeah music to my ears man all right quick uh quickly into the world of releases and raises immutable x and the immutable ecosystem announces a 500 million dollar fund to accelerate the adoption of web 3 games and projects and so they aren't just like spraying and praying there are these uh you have to apply for some of this money uh they have a split between ventures and grants uh take and they say they've taken insights from gazan chains guild and guardian and hiring some of the best people from leading studios riot games i actually met somebody who works at immutable at riot games here at nft nyc and so they are taking their the knowledge that they have from that ecosystem to help spin out a grants program using this 500 million dollars and there's also venture arms as well so they are putting money into the people that are investing in the world of gaming uh and that is that details there tether launching a british pound peg stablecoin uh so if you use the british pound you have a sable coin that you can use now uh i don't expect too many people to be using that but some do some do uh and then of course uh actually i'll pause there anthony and get your takes on these two of these two things yeah i mean look i think i was talking to you about this recently and i mentioned that on my show as well if anyone's going to prove me wrong about crypto gaming it's going to be immutable like i am a bear on crypto gaming thus far just because what we've seen so far has not really appealed to me especially as an actual gamer who gamed for most of his life before he found ethereum that's basically what i did with all my time and now it's just ethereum but i think a lot of the crypto games we've seen are really just ponzis with a code of gaming on them so if anyone's gonna prove me wrong and build better things it's gonna be immutable and this is a massive fun there's a half a billion dollar fund going towards this and this is on top of the other funds already as well like polygon has huge funds for gaming too there's a few other ecosystems that are doing it like when we when i kind of look at this i'm like okay well something is going to come out of this i mean really cool is going to come out of this they're going to on board the right people they're going to build really cool things so i'm just like super pumped to see what they come up with and if they can prove me wrong here like i'm bullish on immutable i'm bullish on their ability to prove me wrong that's for sure yeah 100 they really make this uh process painfully easy on their on their website meetable.com fund submit an application it'll get reviewed by a panel uh successful applications will be contacted and then you will be funneled either into the grant or the venture arm depending on how that ends up uh here's something that's interesting ex-sushi cto joseph de long raises eight million dollars for an nft lending platform named uh astraria estrella estaria and then estaria thank you the platform that subtitles reads led by ceo justin bram and d5 veteran joseph de long aims to provide instant liquidity for your jpegs and should be available to the public by september uh that's pretty cool uh anthony what are your thoughts on here well my thoughts are that i'm an investor i participated in this round i want to get that out of the way um but i think that it's really cool justin brown for those who don't know has his own youtube channel where he does a lot of different kind of like d5 guides and things like that and he's really really passionate about uh kind of like everything ethereum everything crypto so i really love his energy um and i i and i consider him a friend and same with joseph de long you know obviously had a stint at um sushi before that he was doing a bunch of ethereum core developer stuff and things like that so i saw them teaming up and i was like you know what i think this is a cool idea i think these guys are gonna are gonna pull it off they're smart enough they're passionate enough and that's kind of like why i back them here but i i think these nft lending platforms is a few of them now i do think that they're gonna be a big thing because nfts are gonna be a big thing or already are a big thing and you know you don't want to have to kind of like not be able to uh i guess get liquidity on your nfts and be stuck with it like how many people want to be able to put their nfts as collateral and borrow against them there's probably heaps that want to be able to leverage trade and have teas or something i can imagine that happening and and the craziness around that but i think you know i'm super excited to see where where they go with this that's for sure yeah totally totally the the world of nft liquidity is just in the first hour of a very long long uh time frame of of uh getting more liquidity infrastructure i mean we talked about uniform acquiring genie an nfc marketplace aggregator there's like liquidity uh platforms like like this nft lending platform coming about there's just overall so much financialization left in the world of nfts the last last phrase of the week magic eden raises 130 million dollars hitting the unicorn status at 1.6 billion dollar valuation which is an nfc marketplace which actually just launched nine months ago raised 130 million dollars in a series b led by electric capital and greylock partners bringing like i said its valuation to 1.6 billion dollars anthony any comments on this before we go to the next part of the show yeah i mean magic eating from my understanding is basically the open sea of solana uh and this and kind of like just basically trying to do what open sea does on ethereum and and polygon but on on solana instead and yeah they they only launched a short while ago and they've had some some kind of some impressive growth there which is cool to see and actually one of their founders is was the previous uh ceo i believe at dydx uh funny enough uh uh his name's joshin um he's a friend of mine but yeah i i think that um it's it's cool to see like how many nft marketplaces there are because it's going to lead to a lot of competition i didn't i like i don't like that openc had a monopoly for so long because we saw all the kind of i guess negative externalities of that now they have a lot of competition not just on ethereum but on other chains as well so i think opens i think openstack did announce that they were going to go to solana but it's not like they're going to be able to go to solana and automatically be the the big gaming town right they're going to have to compete with magic eden now and competition is just good for everyone at the end of the day so um cool to see this and you know maybe magic eden comes to ethereum and it's like well let's see what we do on ethereum let's see what we how we can compete here so yeah we'll we'll see how it plays out but yeah huge huge i guess raise and huge valuation yeah that's for sure yeah we got competition between layer twos between average arbitrage and optimism we got competition between nft aggregators uh and nfg exchanges we got competition with staking as a service network coming online uh the competition in in d5 building crypto building right now is at all-time highs and of course like you said it's always ultimately good for the consumer all right fam coming up next we got the takes of the week we got the questions from the nation and then i'm gonna ask anthony what he's bullish about and then that will conclude this with this show with uh substitute teacher anthony cesano we're gonna get to all of those things and more right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of the cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrarum or boba networks rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only syncing provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there all right bangla nation let's get into the questions of the week we just got one question coming from webb the third web of the third says how much harder is it to get a job in crypto now if layoffs have flooded the web 3 job market with talent i'm mid-career change from non-technical too technical almost done with a computer science masters and was about to start the job hunt but my experience still seems too low especially with limited positions anthony any thoughts or perspectives that you could give web3 about getting a job in crypto know that a bunch of layoffs are happening from some of the bigger companies in the space yeah look i think that it's definitely going to play into it there's definitely going to be a lot of like people now thousands of more people to compete with than there was uh before maybe even tens of thousands more than there was before just because of these layoffs and there may be a slowdown of hiring due to just the bear market generally and teams not having as much runway as they thought they would be able to and not raising what they thought they would be able to so that's just definitely going to play into it but i think it that if you're kind of like doing your cs masters obviously complete that finish that up uh and i think that look you're not gonna be at the kind of like skill level of someone who'd already completed it already kind of like works one of these companies and has already got a bit of experience under their belt but that doesn't really necessarily mean anything like there's plenty of junior positions still out there there's plenty of entry-level positions for you to kind of apply for and get and i think what really matters for a lot of teams within crypto is that you're a crypto native um and i think crypto projects and teams would like to hire people from the ecosystem rather than hiring them from the web 2 world directly because crypto culture is not something you can teach it's something that you have to just go on and learn yourself and go on your own journey for so i from my experience teams really do love those crypto natives so if you're a crypto native already i mean you're listening you're probably listening to the roll up right you're listening to me answer your question right now then you're already head of the pack i think or ahead of a lot of people that would be coming into this ecosystem so i guess head up don't don't be discouraged uh you know and i i think you'll be able to find something that's for sure yeah and i will say the companies that are doing the big layoffs are the ones that scaled really really aggressively and one of my critiques of coinbase i'd say is that they scaled with they scaled so fast so quickly that there literally wasn't enough web 3 people to hire uh so they had to hire non-crypto people non-crypto natives who kind of like you know so you can't force people to care about crypto people choose to care about crypto and that's what makes them a crypto native and so coinbase hired a bunch of like you know normies right like web 2 people trad five people uh and those people aren't necessarily like beholden to the crypto industry in the same way that crypto natives are uh and so when coinbase lays off a bunch of people you know some certainly are going to stick in inside the crypto ecosystem but i would also definitely say that some are just going to look elsewhere and be like you know cryptos get i don't want any more crypto no more crypto for me uh so i think like in the companies that scale that that fast that aggressively uh are probably more composed of a bunch of non-crypto natives than they are crypto natives so i wouldn't say that like if they're if you see these big companies laying a bunch of people off that therefore all these people are coming into the web 3 job market i think the web 3 job market is really owned and operated by crypto natives and being a crypto native is a huge mark on your resume if you can if you can uh good mark not bad mark uh if you can prove your crypto nativity uh then that is just like uh if you can speak d5 if you can speak the language if you speak the lingo if you stay up to date with things that can be a huge uh value add to who you are as an applicant uh and so learning to be crypto native and being crypto native uh is going to like make you be highly competitive versus other applicants who don't have those properties all right that's our one question of the week so into the takes of the week as well we got some some spicy takes this is from smoosh axey soul bound nfts are like digital tattoos one cemented they're permanently a part of your wallet people viewing your wallet will always know this culture identifier is or was important to your digital identity minting may require levels of premeditation similar to getting a tattoo uh and this is of course coming on the backs of these soul bound nfts decentralized identifiers verifiable credentials conversation that's been sweeping crypto twitter lately anthony any takes on this take well i mean it depends on how the soulbound nft is is constructed right there could be an escape hatch where you could just kind of like be able to send it to the burn address for example like you can't send it to anyone else but you can send it to the burn address where it just goes into the void and no one has access to it so in that respect i mean it probably the analogy still fits i guess probably sending it to the burner dress would be like getting tattoo removed by like lasers or something like that right so i think the analogy works if you it works even if you think too hard about it like what i tend to do sometimes i didn't think too hard about it um but yeah i mean you got this reply up here you want to read that out yeah there's a reply here it says great analogy if you completely ignore that it's possible to have a tattoo removed and that someone could just sell their wallet in which your tattoo will be the same thing as selling an arm or a leg actually it's a little bit more reasonable to sell a wallet yeah well i mean yes and no like that wallet basically you'd have to kind of make sure it has nothing in it and has access to nothing else and the thing is why would anyone else want that wallet when you have access to it as well right yeah you wouldn't be able to use it for anything else yeah you wouldn't have any assurances that the person that is selling the wallet might actually just keep the private keys exactly anyways a bunch of uh bunch of things to explore in the world of uh uh soul-bound nfts and decentralized identifiers anna rose who's the podcast of uh the podcast host of zero knowledge when i when a podcast i think is one of the best podcasts in crypto and i know a thing or two about podcasts and crypto anna rose tweets out defy legos versus c5 dominoes anthony what do you think she means by this well you know defy building uh building strong buildings sustainably building up uh like legos do and c5 dominoes falling like dominoes do right they do there's a lot of contagion between kind of like the c5 applications and things like that but again this is another analogy that if you think too deeply about it it maybe breaks apart a little bit because people thought that terra was defy and like the ust collapsing brought down everything on terra so it's more there was like a domino effect there uh but yeah i i think it's a kind of like funny analogy when you think about it all right last take of the week vance spencer coming in with the spiciest take of them all coinbase is a great company but needs to stop [ __ ] around with this trash if you spent five minutes on crypto twitter you know pond the token pond isn't legit stop the retail meat grinder ship staking ship basic features like usd to usdc on prime improve custody get better analytics launch futures and advance is retweeting a tweet from coinbase exchange saying that our pawned usdt trading pair will now enter limit only mode on coinbase exchange coinbase pro uh uh basically he's critiquing coinbase's uh listing of all these weird tokens that no one seems to use that no one seems to understand why they are listing anthony any takes here yeah i mean it's no secret that coinbase is both listing uh for trade and also listing as part of their kind of like custody solution these absolute trash tokens that some of them aren't even on coin gecko which is just so bizarre it might they must just go down the list on queen market cap and go to like the shittiest tokens and be like oh yeah this one seems good let's add this one and it's for anyone who's been following coinbase for a little while now and some of their decisions it's just puzzling right they should be focusing on so many other things but it seems that they're focusing on just this absolute trash it's just really weird yeah here's an interesting take uh the seb from zapper i believe yeah says i think it's a two-fold issue drawing the line on which tokens to listen which tokens not to list is either an everything or nothing line so like either list everything or only do like the the most high quality fun fact once upon a time coinbase was only bitcoin ether and litecoin for a very long time and then he also follows up saying uniswap is also an existential threat implying well if you can get liquidity on uniswap coinbase needs to list absolutely everything in order to be competitive so i think that's a fair take it's a fair take i do think uni swap's going to kill off most of central isaac extreme well not just unity but the centralized exchanges are going to kill off most centralized exchange activity anyway over the long run except maybe for fiat on ramps so i guess yeah i don't know i don't know if coinbase listing everything is going to really stop that all right that is the last takes of the week i haven't told anthony that we always talk about what we're bullish on at the end of the show but i'm going to ask you live for anthony right now anthony what are you bullish on so this might be a funny thing to say but i'm bullish on the bear right i'm bullish on the bear market because we do our best building in a bear market we do our best innovation in a bear market and it's much easier to pay attention and focus on things in a bear market so i'm just overall much more kind of like bullish on on the bear market than a lot of people are i think it's a great time to get involved with crypto whether that's to work within it or do something within it as like a hobby obviously i think it's a like i i mean i've been stacking each lately i can't believe ethie's kind of like with at these prices and things like that so i just look at the bear market as both a gift and an opportunity and that's why i'm bullish on the bear and i mean other than that like obviously just bullish on ethereum generally the merge is coming still the market doesn't matter about like for the merge it's not like the merge gets pushed back because the market goes down in value or something like that so yeah just bullish on the bears is kind of like how i would describe it yeah then uh that's exactly the sentiments that we echo here on bankless as well so you can fit right in anthony you guys the bank station can tell why we uh why we bring anthony on every time that the ai is powered down uh and let's actually take a moment to talk about what you're up to over at the daily gray for people that do not know anthony cesano and aren't familiar with the daily gray i can't imagine that they aren't but in case they aren't uh aren't familiar can you tell us a little bit about what you do over at the daily way yeah so the daily graze ethereum education system much like bankless every day on my youtube channel i'll do like a 30 minute video of basically the ethereum ecosystem kind of recapping what's happened giving news there i'll also write a daily newsletter um about ethereum just commentary about uh something in ethereum and there's a discord channel that's very very active we have a really great community in there so if you want to be part of a very very ethereum native i guess pretty much on the verge of ethereum maximalist community then the daily gray is is definitely the place to be for for you certainly it's been it's a fantastic resource for me as well so i appreciate all the labor that you put into the daily gray anthony it's it's a relentless amount of energy uh and anthony this is where you have to ask me about what i'm bullish about okay what are you bullish about sir oh i'm so glad you asked anthony i'm bullish on josh rosenthal the guy the podcast that guest that created the crypto renaissance podcast very famous podcast episode in the bankless ecosystem returns to bankless he's coming back on july 4th uh independence day for for the the freedom burgers out there and so we have a themed episode an independence themed episode coming on july 4th monday july 4th uh really excited to record that one recording that a week from a week from tomorrow with joss rosenthal uh and so i'm really excited to get that episode recorded uh i always want to hear about what josh rosenthal has to say uh annie i'm excited any last comments so yeah i'm definitely excited for that yeah and as the person that usually puts the agenda together for these podcasts uh josh rosenthal gave me 19 pages of notes to turn into an agenda oh my god he he has put in some work uh and so he's he's got some things to say and i'm excited to hear it all right anthony very lost power of the show are you ready for the meme of the week yeah let's do it meme of the week this is kalio on twitter he tweets out don't worry guys i'm sure it'll hold and the picture is of a swat team with a battering ram the battering ram is the global recession the swat team has three errors capital and celsius insolvency and of course the door is being held by a cheeto and that cheeto is labeled 20k bitcoin support so far has been holding however we are above 20 000 bitcoin anthony any comments on this meme of the week i mean we went below it so i guess like it broke and then someone put another cheeto in there to get us back above 20k so let's say if the second cheeto can hold stronger than the first one oh yeah that's that's that is the idea maybe we just needed two cheetos two cheetos anthony thank you so much for stepping in for ryan during this bankless weekly roll up uh like i say in the
