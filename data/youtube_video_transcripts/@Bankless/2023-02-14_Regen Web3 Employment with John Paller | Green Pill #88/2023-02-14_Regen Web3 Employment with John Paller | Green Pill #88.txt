foreign [Music] ation on the Pod today we've got John power we are talking about regen web3 and employment so basically how is employment going to involve with decentralized blockchain-based Finance I know a lot of people think that blockchains and web3 are about the future of finance and so that lends a lot to talking about decentralized finance and also art investing was and nfts were a big thing this past cycle but I think that we got to not sleep on this idea that uh jobs and employment are going to be an important use case in the future 90 95 of humanity mostly their financial lives is their communities people that they work with and their employment how they earn an income and so how do we build a bridge from the old world to the new world on employment how do we get more Talent working for tokens and um working for Dows and how do we do that in a regenerative way such that they're able to not only support themselves but support their communities and the causes that they care about out so um John's one of those people who's kind of building a bridge the real practical questions that that come along when you start earning tokens from Dallas like how do I get insurance I want to buy a house how do I prove to the bank that I have a certain amount of income are kind of the kinds of things that John power's company uh Opus can provide for people so we talk a lot about the decentralization of the future of work region web3 employment how the future of work can't be built on the history of work and what younger Generations want with with employment and how blockchain-based employment can provide that for them so I think this is an interesting episode because John's been thinking about these things for decades now and it's finally coming to fruition with opolis for him but um you know also John is the executive Steward behind youth Denver so we nerd out a little bit about Heath Denver we're recording this on Tuesday February 7th which is about two or three weeks before East Denver biggest fiddle-a-thon in North America for the ethereum Unity annually so uh judge the executive Steward of that but also the CEO of opolis so pulling double duty for the web 3 ecosystem over there um also John is a Colorado Native so him and I have known each other through the Boulder blockchain and ethereum Denver ecosystems for a couple years so it's been great to follow his progression over the years without further Ado I'll give you John power on regen web 3 employment enjoy coordination working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work tax time is coming up opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity generate proof of employment through paystubs and receive a W-2 at the end of the tax year are you self-employed and forced to spend money on expensive Health Care insurance with limited coverage opolis leverages group buying power through a community employment Co-op helping you save 20 to 50 on high quality affordable health care options through Cigna and finally offices member owners share inopolis's success and profits based on their work token Holdings you must be authorized to work inside the United States and select Canadian provinces to receive office's benefits book a 30-minute free consultation with opposite's experts and join Opus by March 31st 2023 to get a thousand work and a thousand Bank tokens go to connect.opolis.co banklist to get started and if you're going to eat Denver make sure to stop by the office Booth or attend their future of work Summit hosted by Opus the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty Goes Down Glow is a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe Reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glowdollar.org greenpill that's Gro dollar dot org slash green pill what's up John how you doing what's up Kevin good to see you man so we're recording this on February 7th and East Denver is two or three weeks away You're the executive Steward of Youth Denver on a scale of one to eleven what's what's the stress level like prepared for the biggest uh ethereum conference in North America well in the world how about that yeah but oh excuse me it's not a conference I know I know that it's a build-a-thon right it's a hackathon well it's a it's a community Innovation Festival is the official uh taxonomy label that we prefer because as you know we don't really like the conference moniker because it has some pretty lame implications but yeah yeah uh depends on who you ask I mean I it's not my first rodeo so like as much as I get a little wound up about particular details like I'm pretty good about like not letting it turn me into a basket of nerves or anything but you know this is uh this is a big year for us in terms of growth so the big challenge is new venue lots of people uh you know we had an advantage last year for example we were in the same space for four years so we knew exactly like what we were doing and how to lay things out and the problems with the building you know any of the kind of nuances we'd figure that out now it's like we're almost starting over so I mean not entirely we have a much bigger team and it's going to be fine but like there's just so many details to plan that even with a team that's probably five or six times the size it's just a lot so yeah um yeah the team's doing a great job though I mean we have something like 50 core stewards now and um meta stewards another 50 or 75 at least and then volunteers some were pushing 400 so I mean it's it's quite a community lift nowadays yeah well uh I'm I'm sure I speak for the ethereum community when I say uh really happy that East Denver continues to grow year over year and brings so much of the movement to to Colorado so I think on this episode we wanted to Veer away from East Denver and talk about your day job which is opolis and decentralization of employment so I think a lot of listeners might be familiar with your work through East Denver but if they're a member of Adele then they might use Oculus to manage their benefits and compliance and stuff so I'm wondering if we could if we could shift the conversation over to Oculus for a bit and you could tell us what you've been up to there yeah sure um so for those that are listening that don't know much about opolis or maybe heard about it or not really sure how to use it or why it exists um my background is just a little high level um sort of precursor to this is I come from HR Tech and employment systems so in a previous life I built like a big Staffing Company I did a few startups and like the Uber of economy back you know 10 years ago and um the sort of thesis was trying to figure out how to democratize the activity of employment um when I first uttered the words in 2005 now I'm going to date myself um I didn't really know what it meant but I just I could but I understood that there was some pretty Market Paradigm imbalances when it comes to the relationship between employers and employees and who controls what um you know maybe call it permissioned employment is the traditional corporate structure where like in the U.S for example I've got to have this I gotta subjugate myself to a corporation in order to get basic stuff like Health Care access to retirement plans simplify my tax payments like oh if you get a W-2 we'll just do it for you but if you go on your own then good luck with all that quarterly calculations and so um in this sort of progression of the different experiments and hacks and learnings um basically kind of settled on the idea that fundamentally none of this is going to change in terms of how we relate to our our commercial experience until self-sovereignty comes to employment and what we mean by that is really who controls the decisions around a person's legal employment and the minute it it it's in a dynamic where somebody else is choosing that for you whether it's an HR department or some you know team of Executives or whoever you know you don't really have any sustainable durable say in anything really I mean so we said okay well is there the the question that then got postulated out of that was is there a way to redesign an employment structure so that individuals could use it um call it like a public utility like how do we create a platform where people could just plug in use it but like it's kind of set it and forget it you know they don't really have to worry about it too much like No One's Gonna rug them because they plug in and it's their choice right so um and then that led to a whole bunch of research and legal work and you know I mean two and a half years of designing an actual like legal compliance and technological system that actually could service this and so the net result is we've built uh a Cooperative platform or if you want to call it an employment Dow with a legal rapper of a Colorado cooperative we can talk about that more later the Colorado Co-op is actually one of the big advancements that we pioneered with this but um it acts like a public utility I mean if you're in a state that the the community can service which is 49 out of 50. and if you're in Canada you know we can help as well but you can essentially opt in to take control of your own employment so you know the notion of self-sovereign employment is not really that different conceptually from like self-sover data or self-sover Identity or you know it's just I'm taking control of my stuff but in the context of your commercial life now like your actual legal employment is being handled by you through a design that we created that's fully compliant completely legal and essentially replicates all of the positive features and Hallmarks of traditional employment without actually having to subjugate yourself or give up your Independence right so it seems like if I'm a listener who's working for a dow out there I can use Obelisk to manage my compliance with my local city-state federal government but also knowing the United States with benefits and all that kind of stuff can it kind of builds a bridge from the old world to the new Yeah we actually frequently refer to obelis as the bridge to the Future right or or just a great legitimizer depending on which side of the bridge you're on so if you're already working in a dow and you're sort of yoloing maybe for multiple Dows making your you know you're getting paid out of Treasury uh via stream on superfluid and usdc or something like how does that turn into like hey I can go rent an apartment and prove I have income how does that turn into like um actually getting money so you can pay for your health care how does that turn into like uh reporting any of that and paying taxes like there's a lot of fun and cute stuff about web3 in the future but like there's all this necessary evil crap that we have to do as well so what opelous essentially does is enable you to do both you get the best of both worlds you don't have to give up your Independence you don't have to give up your sort of crypto sovereignty or the fact that you're getting paid and um stable coins or whatever but you can plug it into our system and be legitimized and then on the other end of it if you're exploring web3 or if you're hesitant to take the leap into the future of work um I often say that I see web3 as being synonymous with the future of work so if but if you got a a young kid or a baby at home and a wife you know who's like how are you going to get health care how are you going to pay rent what are you going to do with all that crypto that you get like what are you gonna say like uh I don't know we're just gonna YOLO it you're not gonna do that okay there's no way you're gonna do that okay so you're gonna hesitate and you're not going to jump into the pool now forget crypto for a minute like let's say you're a twitch streamer okay and you're getting all sorts of views and you're making money and royalties off your streams and all of this like that person has the same issues as the other two that I mentioned can't get health care don't know how to report any of this stuff you know they can't rent an apartment because you know they don't have two years of documented income history you know like all this stuff is a problem so whether it's a bridge to the future or it's a great legitimizer of web3 you know natives it works both ways so it is a bridge it's a bridge between Both Worlds 100 percent yeah um well I just think it's so neat that you know if I'm a contributor who makes money off of Bitcoin grants or coordinate or any number of of crypto platforms um it feels like in the future there's going to be people earning a from a plurality of um of places and and earning might not even be work you know I was just showing off before we started recording my validator back here where I earned a pittance of uh of eth every month right um and and so on the plurality of token streams and having a bridge where those can all be compliant I think is an interesting world well I mean I think it's it's not just an interesting thing I think it's going to become standard I mean if you look at the behavior of the youngest generation I mean they're working for multiple companies having different income streams they're doing side hustles they don't really want the traditional W-2 corporate you know Cube Farm job they don't want it they're like actively opting out of it so like and then you see like uh play to earn contribute to earn refer to earn validate to earn models that create these secondary tertiary revenue streams like well what are you gonna do how do you how do you deal with all this stuff and most people I mean it's kind of like you know you know See No Evil Hear No Evil speak to me I don't know you know I don't know what to do with any of that but like that's not going to be a good excuse for the taxman when they start coming around asking questions so you know you've got we've got to figure out how to legitimize this new world of work and unfortunately the corporate mechanism has been used as essentially a tax payment vehicle now what they've done is if you look at the Regulatory Compliance standards pretty much all of the responsibility for tax payments lands on the corporation they're going to do your federal tax withholdings they're going to do your 941s they're going to do all the different things that and if you don't pay like if you do um if you do tax withholdings ever like say on a bi-weekly basis for for payroll if you don't pay it by the following Tuesday they can literally issue a bench warrant for you like you can go to jail as an executive of a company if you don't pay your payroll taxes you you could go to jail you're like personally liable criminally so like they've put so much responsibility on corporations which translates to risk and risk equals cost and then there's social behaviors that come out of that it's become an incredibly unfun sport to play so like how does the average person know how to deal with any of that stuff they don't so you've got to be able to replicate this you know in the corporate world they call it shared services right so shared services is like you know you got a big company like IBM or something and they've got a huge payroll department a huge HR department a huge legal department well these these departments service the different business units from those particular core disciplines well opolis is doing the same thing but just providing these services to solopreneurs right so you get access to your accounting support and HR stuff the benefits management tax payments and like all the different things that need to get done so you don't have to be the expert that's the point it's not about well you know if you want to be a solopreneur you should take your life seriously and educate yourself about all these different things that you need to do it's like that's like a second and third education man like you go work in a corporate Cube Farm you don't need to know any of that stuff why should you need to know it as a solopreneur seems like an unfair bar you know like oh in order to own my life I've got to know all this other stuff I'm not saying that you shouldn't know it I'm just saying it's an unexpected it's an unrealistic expectation for Mass adoption most people aren't going to do that one of the things that I think is really interesting is like this idea of modularity you know the Unix philosophy of each component does one thing and does it well and as an entrepreneur I kind of like the idea that I could just trust that obelis is managing my compliance and I can focus on providing value in the marketplace as opposed to jumping through all these hoops with the legal form so I think that you're kind of taking one for the team by managing the compliance like the thing that no one else wants to do here well yeah and and then from from my view you know when I when you say I'm taking one for the team my goal is to build it into an automated platform Cooperative dao-like structure like a public utility that's just sort of is and does you know it's just like oh I'm gonna go out and start my own thing oh we'll just plug anoplist it's like and you kind of don't associate it with any one person or thing it's just it's just a it's just a a tool set that Aggregates all the things that I need and I can just plug in and you're right I can focus on the thing that my core competency is which is for most people not this stuff you know it's no average person has the ability to understand the nuances of the things that I've learned in 20 years of doing this crap and like you don't want to know it okay like the the worthless information that's in my brain that we've transposed into the product nobody wants to know any of this stuff okay you shouldn't have to and we're just systemizing it and building it into a you know essentially think about it at scale as a protocolization of these core shared services that people can just plug into but they can also become part owner in it you know so it's it it takes the whole web 3 thesis and bakes it into a you know a very needed service but also making it accessible globally and and incentivizing behaviors that actually create value for the network as a whole I'm wondering how much of your clientele is like kind of these younger Generations that are drawn to Independent work because the hierarchical frame of employment just isn't bringing them happiness and joy and freedom versus like older General like just by the law of entropy and the directionality of time in the universe these younger Generations are going to become older and they're going to want to do things like have a mortgage and like have psychological safety and financial stability and so I think security is the yeah it's interesting this is actually a really interesting and curious phenomenon so um when you say older Generations are you talking about like Boomers or exers um well I'm assuming that your clientele right now is like younger Millennials and gen zeers but eventually they're going to become older and like want to get puppies and then like get mortgages and then have kids one day and I'm just wondering how this ecosystem matures to to provide that Financial stability and and all of those things that people just naturally want as they get older yeah so if you look at uh the social anthropology of employment it's very clear that it was designed to cater to the desires of Safety and Security um so the idea the social contract Back in the Day Day post World War II um height of the Industrial Revolution was look you know you come and work in my auto Factory and in exchange for that I'm going to give you a pension that you're going to earn over time come do it for 30 years you're going to retire completely great and you're going to be able to buy a car for your family have a really nice home and it's gonna be it's gonna beat the [ __ ] out of like a 10 mortality rate and working in a steel mill okay so like um the the social UPS you know up classing that you could you you saw happening in the early days or even the middays of the Industrial Revolution was there was a clear exchange going on for Safety and Security was the core now that social desire came from things like the Great Depression World War II that created a ton of uncertainty and a lot of social pain economic pain for people so they saw this this trade-off it's like well [ __ ] okay so if I basically come and do this for you and we sort of like build this this social contract of based on loyalty you're going to take care of me and my family economically and also from a Prosperity standpoint the the quotient of prosperity went up a bunch right so there was a there was a really big upgrade in social status that happened around that time but at the quora that was always Safety and Security so what you're talking about was not just an I'm older I want to put down roots and Safety and Security is more important but it was the undertone maybe even the overtone of the social uh temperature at the time so now you look at how employment is organized which is really still supposedly Safety and Security driven but there's no pensions anymore there's no guarantees there's no promises there's no social contract of loyalty that's all gone but we still do things the same way and even the corporate virtue signaling still says a lot of the same stuff but it's all [ __ ] right so we all know it's [ __ ] we've seen the crash of 2008 we've seen the pandemic we've seen how loyal corporations are they're not okay so the point being is the structure is the same but the social goals are different now so freedom and flexibility are now the name of the game and it's it is in part being driven by a younger generation but socially where they're getting this attitude is they're not seeing their older populations their their parents in some cases um Happy so they're like wait this Safety and Security thing didn't work out well before you did it buddy right so screw that I'm gonna go YOLO my life I don't care about the house and this and that now they will when they get a little older so the Jen's ears will probably have a tendency to settle down a little bit more but what's really interesting in this is uh the great resignation you look at the the distribution of age yes it's mostly Millennials and zetters but like it's still across all cohorts so when you look at the migration out of the traditional labor force and the estimates in the U.S are 90 million independent workers by 2028 it's five years right now we're about 45 maybe 40 45 million it's gonna double which represents over half of the U.S labor force because there's 160 million active labor participants so we're talking about a huge social shift so the thing that's driving that is the broken social contract of employment there's no loyalty there's no trust there's no guarantees so why do it and then corporations on the other end of it are like man this is too risky it's too expensive screw you I can't do this so it's like okay well how do you design something that actually works for both parties like what's what's the next Generation social contract around employment and how we create reciprocity and mutualistic relationships that's where we got to go so I think it's it's it's yeah go ahead man you're making my job as as a host easy let me just roll out this one what's the next Generation social contract for web 3 workers John well I I think it's uh I think it's emerging actually I think we're experimenting with it right now I think I've seen a lot of failed experiments where they try to replicate the old sort of subjugated model where it's like well will you work for the Dow you know it's like well you're just trying to replicate employees then like but then they're like well but we can't get anybody to do anything they're not productive and it's like well then you have a an accountability issue and you can't just micromanage people to productivity you've got to be able to align skills resources in time and actually create results and it takes a different sort of recipe so what do I think it's going to end up being I think it's gonna I think we're gonna move into what I would refer to as a statement of work culture where if I want to engage with a dow they're or anywhere really they're going to tell me okay um what are you gonna do and by when it's going to be objectively measured and it's not going to be my so my reputation for work is going to be purely measured by my productivity and I am gonna take another bet that most of this is going to be done anonymously within 10 years I'll just be hiring people with highly skilled backgrounds to do very specific things and I will have a really good gauge on whether or not they're going to be able to deliver what I need when I need it and if they deliver it they'll get paid and in some cases they'll get paid ongoingly the streaming payrolls and other things will be much more real time yeah um well well the thing that I guess I got to ask is like the person who's trying to engineer this regenerative crypto economics uh ecosystem is where where does the social safety net come from if it's like a statement of work culture and and it's like yeah I think it's going to come from the the community of workers I think you're going to see potentially many different groups like obelisks that pop up that are sort of these Guild of workers like call them next Generation unions or something but we'll see uh D5 2.0 maybe 3.0 maybe 4.0 where you have um Financial systems that are built into these ecosystems that help with things like mortgages or car loans or student loans or whatever where essentially these communities are financing themselves and you will have a um a much more regenerative aligned input output system if you're doing this inside of communities versus like external Banks or third parties that have different interests you know really it's it's creating these next Generation systems inside of these marketplaces which that's really what I think opolis does best at Scales it Aggregates people into a single system that then creates that ability to to leverage that size for other things yeah whether it's like I said building um Next Generation banking systems or lending systems or just plugging into other D5 Primitives to like create that scale I think that's that's going to be the power of it yeah I'm really interested you know one solution I might be answering my own question here but like one solution to that that I sort of seen is that our Legacy Insurance infrastructure and social safety net just has so much administrative overhead on it what would need to be true to be able for me to be able to deploy my own insurance Cooperative where the people who are paying the premiums uh are subsidizing each other's health care and there's not some like fat cat CEO who makes 35 million dollars per year off of my insurance premium um what would have to be true to um to have these like more peer-to-peer mutualistic social safety nets that we deploy together and and I think that like the opportunity here is cutting out all the middlemen that have been extracting off of this infrastructure in the oh in the old world and and that gets me really excited because it's better for everyday people and and not just these like Financial intermediaries that that are on top of these things and we're probably five to ten years out from that insurance Cooperative that I just made up being a thing but I man every time I I see my premiums and how much I get from my insurance company I just think the the loaded it's much longer no it it can't um so I I think the the simple the simplistic answer is um the problem with the existing game design is the game incentives are misaligned so at scale if you look at the actors that you're referring to and what they do in in terms of extracting value they're incentivized to do that that's success for them in fact the C Corp legal structure in the U.S mandates that directors and officers maximize profitability for shareholders and those shareholders are not the employees right so the employees are the ones paying the bag so one of the things that we've done with obelisks in The Cooperative framework is we've created a for-profit Cooperative structure that still has incentives around growth value accrual and traditional sort of capitalistic endeavors but it doesn't have at its core the same hardcore drivers around profit maximization as you would see in a traditional you know web 2 corporate model and but it's also not what I would call a uh like a full non-profit public good either right which I have um sustainability questions around because you know when you talk about this a lot the question of how to public how to fund public goods public goods are good and you know but what are the incentives and like why don't people want to fund them it's like you know nobody really cares about the Kumbaya at the end of the day they want the economic return so the question is how do you create economic returns in a regenerative model that has durability around aligned incentives for all stakeholders and then how do you grow that pie so that at scale in oculus's case we see that happening here let's say we got a million members well one that would make us one of the world's largest employers literally because we're aggregating employment from all over the place two from a procurement standpoint we could pretty much go do whatever the hell we want and three from a pooling of economic resources standpoint and underwriting for example Actuarial analysis and creating funding pools around health care and other things we could do it much more efficiently than any bureaucratic mechanism that exists that has again screwed up incentives because these bureaucracies if you look at why they do what they do they're incentivized to do it they're incentivized to be inefficient so why would we expect that they're going to be efficient if they're incentivized to not be that they're not going to change so you know I have a saying that I I like with don't hate the player build a better game so that's the whole point behind what opelous is doing so we feel like these engines that get built like Obelisk that can aggregate these people into procurement pools essentially is what we're talking about can then build these secondary layers these Insurance pools that's the goal we don't want to be subjugated to well let's put it this way if we got to a million members in the U.S we would absolutely essentially create our own health care company and insurance company and we do it through a collective model 100 but then our stakeholders our owners are the members so we don't have incentive to just screw everybody and be overly extractive and then you know anybody who's a third party has the same incentives because value gets accrued the more we grow so they want growth just like everybody else wants growth because it makes it good for everybody so again it's just figuring out how to durably and sustainably align incentives in a new game design cool yeah I mean I think that it we talk about web 3 is the future of Finance in a lot of ways and I think that where a lot of people's minds immediately go is towards Investments decentralized Finance uh and if he's obviously Breakaway use case for just funding art but I think that man most people's Financial lives is mostly their work and so this is such a key unlock for web 3 going mainstream well I always say opolis is the unsexy underbelly of necessary evil [ __ ] that we all have to deal with but it's the one use case that everybody has to touch so we talk about nfts we talk about defy we talk about next Generation D5 we talk about whatever okay social networks but at its core this is like fundamental to like just doing life right so it's kind of like I said the necessary evil that we all have to do but it's kind of a great way to Trojan Horse adoption and kind of get people thinking about things in new ways and give people optionality around these commercial decisions that otherwise they might not otherwise they might not otherwise have it so like I think it's a great I mean I often sellopolis is the biggest use case for web3 and if you take a giant step back it makes a lot of sense right like in the moment it's like it's at least like employment some people get it but some people are like I mean it's not the first thing you would think of it's not like it's definitely not sexy well you know one of the questions I sort of have is it's one of those great power great responsibility things uh web3 democratizes Finance in so many different ways and because of that in a lot of ways the things that have just been provided for us in the old system are not there and so you know how do you how do you not only be compliant but like once you start receiving tokens what do you do with your tokens um how do you avoid pump and dump scams is a responsibility is placed on users in web3 and so um I think it's like the ecosystem has got to evolve a more responsible way of onboarding people in general but I think that for employment is definitely providing a key uh a a key piece of that regen decentralized employment puzzle you know I think you just I mean the word regen is really the Crux of this um so my criticism of web3 crypto blockchain up to now is the narrative is been largely degenerative and I'm not going to name names but like if you look around even the podcast circuit you know you're one of the only people talking about region stuff all the time most of this stuff is still price driven hype driven fomo driven memes memes night memes night and what is that okay well it's dopamine it's it's ooh fomo right money economics we're speaking to a very degenerative part of the brand now we all have the Degen part of the brain right like we're all human beings I have it too but like I don't think that we spend enough time talking about like or I mean it's it's just gonna take it's gonna take more time I mean if you look at the last three Cycles it's all been hype driven and Degen driven so like there's a lot of good that comes out of it in terms of awareness but in terms of durability sustainability and credibility you know at the end of those Cycles they get kind of rugged a little bit so like I think the next cycle you know we keep talking about well we haven't learned anything no we haven't we're humans we're pretty look at the the generational you know slow progression that we've made as humans I it's not that different in crypto so like I think the next cycle is going to be slightly better and then slightly better and then slightly better but like it's it could take a little while now I do think there's going to be an inflection point uh you know I'd like to think that a project like opolis could could spur that I think gaming is another area where um for example if there were a proven business model sustainable one where people could participate in gaming and earn real incomes um you would see people flocking to that not just dgen stuff not just like oh yeah you know but like with shitty economics and like no sustain but like a real model that actually showed sustainable regenerative value being created in an ecosystem where people could contribute and participate in these gaming systems uh dude it would you know people would flock to it they would leave their corporate jobs in two seconds now is that a good thing socially I don't know I'm not going to get into it but you know as far as like the behavior itself sitting at a computer for 12 hours a day playing games probably isn't the best thing for a Social Development for humans but at the same time it it creates new opportunities and if that gets replicated into more and more productive things then it's just like you know once there's like this new paradigm of opportunity it could really rip the roof off it and then things like Obelisk take off as well so it becomes a compounding effect socially I think that's what we're gonna see um I think that people are cautious enough around you know scam coins and hype and [ __ ] that I don't know and then things like FTX and Celsius and three arrows like I think these are things that people are going to be on the lookout for just could be skeptical of which I think is good um but yeah I think it's the next cycle is going to be more real I think but when that happens I don't know I mean it could we could be in Winter for another two years yeah well um I think that we're getting towards the end of our time together John I'm wondering if there's anything I didn't ask that that you want to say about opposite Denver anything well I think um for those who are really interested in the regen sort of fundamentals of this you know I would recommend that you check out the work Rewards program which is our tokenization of our community um I'd also recommend you read the off-white paper which is sort of the manifesto of this decentralized employment organizations sort of cluster of orgs that exist that that will exist into the future there's a there's a bunch of really interesting I think um I don't know kind of the academic research work that we've done so like if you're genuinely interested in understanding more about opolis as a um a live-action experiment in regen games um I'd check those things out for sure and then you know of course I'll be around East Denver so like come say hi amazing well um John thanks for supporting the regen movement really excited to see more people earn incomes via tokens and do it in a compliant responsible way with opolis and uh yeah CD Denver like you said yeah man we'll have some tequila dude sounds good peace [Music]
