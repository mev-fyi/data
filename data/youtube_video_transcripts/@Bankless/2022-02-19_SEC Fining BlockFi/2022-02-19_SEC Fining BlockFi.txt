is this block five settlement on friday the end of centralized crypto lending in the us interested in your thoughts a bunch of people reached out to me crypto lawyers and such and blockfi gave their take and they actually spun this as a big win big win for blockfy they called this a landmark resolution with federal and state regulators so a hundred million dollars seems like a massive fine for this sort of thing but the flip side says block fly is we are getting clarity on a pathway for crypto interest securities so what blockfi has done i believe is anyone who had a a crypto interest account still gets to keep their crypto interest account right now they are not allowing new signups on the crypto interest accounts but they will transition those crypto interest accounts to a sec approved version of the same interest account and what the sec gets out of this what they wanted out of it was more investor transparency which i actually think is a great thing
