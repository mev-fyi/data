let's talk about ship that's the other big story it just dominated it crushed so ship what his ship first people are like don't understand this thing it's a dog i don't understand it either yeah it's a dog token i don't do honor you do understand you don't understand why it's going up but like what is it it's just a meme isn't it what is that i don't know how it is like i can mention token called like some sort of doggy token i don't know how shibb got so much traction in that it did but like it's it was basically just a derivative of doge after dough started pumping a lot of dogs tokens came out shib being the leader and for some reason it just collected a lot of meme power and a lot of traders and like the amount of volume that went into the ship markets this week was absolutely insane billions just flipping billions of dollars it flipped it flipped without it based off yeah right like they're not even a billionaire supporting this thing the amount of money like so much of this trading volume happened on coinbase uh because these are all these you have u.s retail apes um oh yeah tick tock tick tock is a great answer as to how this happened like apparently the very low denomination of ship of 0.000078 cents per coin uh is very very low so like you buy like a dollar of these things and you have a billion of them and so people like to think that them well i'm a billionaire now because i have like a billion ship tokens and people legitimately think this thing's going to a dollar yeah people actually think this thing is right and so like it should be like a trillion dollar market cap something absolutely insane yeah uh and so ship like could pull up the chart ryan the the chart movement of it is absolutely nuts uh yeah just hit just hit refresh this is uh the trading ju view chart um shipped to uh yeah zoom out to you at the one year yeah i'd go and go oh yeah three three months oh my god dude it goes the that is the denominated in dollars right and so it started the year it started this pump at point zero zero zero zero zero five cents and then around september it jumped it did like a six x and then it would go ended up at like point zero zero zero three we you can you might be able to type in in the left hand corner ship market cap that might show up i don't know though okay that's i mean but it is it is the market cap hit the log button because you can only really view this thing in log in the bottom right corner there you go that doesn't even it it doesn't even change it doesn't even move it's absolutely the same so yeah just like the again insane amounts of volume all piled into ship i don't know why it happened but it happened uh shiv just like dominated the marcus this week are you mad about it or do you not care uh it's just frustrating how much volume is going into these things and like i got i literally got four text messages from people not in my like crypto chats or anything like hey like do i sell this [ __ ] that i bought and i'm like yes what do you say yes you absolutely sell that how do you not sell that but if you told someone that in the beginning of october david they'd hate you right now well i mean because it's gone like but they didn't text me because it didn't pump yeah if you if you're texting me about whether you should sell a ship or not the answer is yes the answer is yes yeah that that's the top signal somebody's texting you four people four people yeah it's like dude i've been trying to get you to buy ether for like four years you bought shib without asking without telling me about it like god damn it okay but people are people can be right in the short in the short run and they can be very right in the short run look at this uh person right this person had a wallet purchased uh this is an ethereum address eight hundred eight thousand dollars worth of ship in in last august you know dog token yolo purchase eight thousand dollars yeah like you know eight thousand pro eight thousand dollars whatever whatever yeah it's now worth 5.7 billion dollars that's so [ __ ] insane so crazy from 8 000 to 5.7 billion dollars in 400 days we might actually be looking at the greatest individual trade of all time and it's a ship coin it's a meme token we haven't talked about it at all on bankless like i don't know how much liquidity there actually is like i don't think the guy could actually sell five point seven billion dollars but he could get us still a lot of money it's still a fantastic he could probably get a billion yeah could probably probably get a bit so only eight thousand dollars can come out of the ship market and still be sustainable maybe or maybe once this kind of moves if they see this address who knows but right you can get hundreds of millions anyway let's call it that yeah great trade no matter no matter what you're doing so like what does this teach us david fundamentals are dead i guess so it's everything stop listening to bankless advice we clearly cannot find the ship markets look yeah look at you know this is uh yeah i i don't know what to say coinbase is number one in the app store it's because how they advertise themselves trade btc eath and ship is in the title of the coinbase application on the three greatest assets of all time digital assets our industry can bring you bitcoin eth ship buy now folks meme coins are gonna meme though this is partially why i'm actually not that mad because like if you're buying shib um i mean shib is not actually pretending to be something it's not i'll say that about [ __ ] that's true okay it's just a dog token this is what i actually appreciated about doge it's just like it's kind of intellectually honest it's it's here to be a meme and it's here to go up and a lot of people get wrecked by it but like it's not trying to pretend it's something it's not it's just a meme so i actually appreciate that at least also unlike though which is built on ethereum so there's that where's the meme index we gotta buy that um here's if you're an eath holder uh and you missed out on shib um it burnt 2 000 ether in the last seven days yeah 2000 so it's an erc20 token right that's the difference okay doge's got its own chain has to provide its own security ship actually leverages the security of ethereum and every time a token is purchased sold uh transacted on the ethereum network it burns eth which is interesting so here's my take on this okay so like this is why you won't get hot tips on what dog coins what means to buy on bank lists like because quite honestly guys we don't know yeah all right like we just don't know and here's the other truth nobody does no one does all right like i don't think anybody does for the one ship that's successful how many meme coins have crashed and burned and gone to like zero and how many like millions of dollars have people lost on these things right or like tens of millions hundreds of millions okay so my our strategy is to keep buying the things it's like it's like you buy the infrastructure it's the warren buffett just be warren buffett and crypto okay you buy the infrastructure you buy the things that are lasting i'm going to keep buying eth because shib is built on top of eth right although every meme all names coming to eat they pump and dump they're going to be burning some eath right and ether is something that is going to be lasting is sustaining does have fundamentals and you don't really have to like guess so that's this dumb turtle strategy but you know what do i know yeah you're just a dumb turtle but i mean i'm also doing the same thing so there's that uh yeah so we'll see what the next one is david do you think how do you think this ends let me ask you that before we go to the you think this is uh up only the fact that it flipped doge gives it a bunch of lindy so i think ship is it's here to stay man it's its meme is officially stuck flipping eath next flipping bitcoins oh gosh
