why ethan is going to hit 20k conversations with the hottest protocols in crypto and pay off your student loans with d5 all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the headlines and important narratives from around bengals this week as always there are going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics now before we start i want to shout out our sponsor zirion xerion is an all-in-one place to see your assets and invest in d5 but they're also going in on nfts this includes sending nfts between wallets and also ways to flex like home screen widgets and apple watch faces check out xerion.io bankless to plug in and get a new home page for your portfolio on our podcast and state of the nation episodes this week we hosted leaders from two of the hottest projects in crypto right now open c and dydx devin fenzer is the co-founder and ceo of openc and a lot has changed since the last time he came on bankless nfts have achieved escape velocity capturing a tremendous amount of attention and capital do you think the nft market can actually get bigger than it is right now oh yeah it's certainly yeah i think like at some point you kind of achieve you know a level of escape velocity and i obviously think we have a i mean it's early days we have a long way to go but i i do think we made it sort of past the point where matt where we have to sort of like try to you know correct the naysayers it's like why i spend mental energy like telling people why it's going to be big when you can just sort of like point to you know what has happened and say like it's pretty clear and if you don't see that then that's fine i do think that we're witnessing i mean we've been witnessing this over and over again but each cycle or each sort of movement within crypto kind of becomes it becomes clearer and clearer that this is like a giant trend not sort of like a mini trend within um within tech right it's this i think crypto is the big paradigm shift that you know a lot of people have been looking for uh for a long time devon tells the story of scaling out open c under immense pressure and the difficulties that come along with success recently crypto twitter found that an openc employee was front-running nft trades taking advantage of openc's privileged spot at the center of the nft boom the employee was let go but this led to broader questions about ethics the spectrum of centralization and the metaverse then on state of the nation we had dydx founder antonio giuliano on to talk about dydx's meteoric rise dydx is a four year overnight success it initially launched in 2017 but it is absolutely exploded in the last several months this success weaves in a bunch of different narratives tokens are powerful there are advantages to scaling to a layer two and chinese regulations are squeezing in new capital to d5 and that's china's loss before starting dydx antonio was a coinbase employee and recently the defy exchange eclipsed coinbase's trading volume dui dx a d phi exchange is doing more volume than coinbase on ethereum on a layer 2. maybe what i liked most about this episode is antonio very explicitly describing himself as pragmatic what's interesting to me about what you just said is this seems like a pragmatic approach you're trying to be the biggest exchange in the world and you actually think decentralization is the way to get there yeah exactly and not to take anything away from like anyone else who's just sort of like you know fully hyped on like decentralization for more ideological reasons i'm a big proponent of it too obviously but like where i'm coming from is i want to build this biggest exchange like how do we do that decentralization is literally i think like how we do that um and there are you know multiple different reasons why people could be excited about building protocols and startups but for us it really is as you say like a pragmatic approach he's not on ethereum or layer 2 for the sake of ethereum he's not interested in decentralization just to be decentralized dydx is a decentralized layer 2 protocol on ethereum because antonio believes it is simply the best place to be to become the largest exchange in the world so you can be a pragmatist you don't have to be a dreamy idealist with ethereum you can simultaneously get yours while also being incentivized to be a good person blockchains make people nice blockchains can also inspire people to do things to the right reasons mariana conti is another defy og having run maker dao's smart contracts for the last six seven years he came on layer zero this week to tell the story about how crypto made him a hard worker inspired him to do everything he could to build out this new ecosystem when i discovered crypto and i started working you know at maker i found my freaking calling i i have no other way of explaining it it was um it was finding a group of people who were building something together and not just what we were building the way we were building it you know decentralized all over the world uh on a chat room with never met each other uh and i don't know i felt such a kinship to that and i'm still not sure i believe that he was ever lazy or a chiller simply because of his productivity like mariano has shipped for years now and this episode wasn't all about work though mariano has done a ton of traveling over the last year and relays his experiences from around the world detailing conferences vacations and road trips like mariono's cool like we get it cryptoculture is about leveling the playing field between employers and employees governments and citizens banks and customers another example of that is the relationship between game developers and gaming communities it seems that day by day gamers are increasingly fed up with the extortion tactics used in the modern gaming economy micro transactions pay to win dlc content season passes these are all ways to maximally farm your fans for capital crypto gaming changes this suddenly community ownership becomes a thing and along with it you have this novel idea of play to earn when you dump time and effort and passion into something you should get a slice of what you produce if it's an in-game item you should be able to do what you want with it sell it collateralize it use it bridging gaps and power structures incentivizes cooperation swing the pendulum back towards a fairer system where merit is rewarded and collaboration is encouraged crypto gaming has a long way to go but the train has left the station in this week's tactic we covered paying off student loans with defy as we all know student loans are poison uh read the article for the full scoop here but effectively you're just moving your debt from traditional c5 infrastructure into d5 in d5 you can leverage yield incentives for both lending and borrowing and also just the general composability and capital efficiency of the defy ecosystem there are risks like liquidation smart contract failures markets variable rates but here's just another example of a new ecosystem that is taking strides in the right direction while the traditional world increasingly crushes its young people with debt this week we also claimed that ether price will hit 20k oh but 20k is such a big number it's already overpriced well not gonna make it luke uh it really just boils down to issuance eip1559 plus proof of stake equals less issuance a supply shock to eth if that sounds simple to you read the article if you don't know what any of that means check out our coverage of eip1559 and proof of stake with justin drake the sheer bullishness of this article is maybe overwhelming but i find myself agreeing with the thesis markets are manic but the fundamentals of the ethereum protocol intrinsically raised the long-term fair value price in market monday david referenced an article titled blockchain bros and crypto socialites came to party subtitle it's like pretty woman meets the great gatsby but with crypto now i personally thought this article was very much negatively biased against cryptoculture the great gatsby is like not a love letter to partying the author seems like a crypto outsider standing in the corner of the party arms crossed making jokes about excess decadence whatever but i'm personally no fan of decadence either i think that lamborghinis are lame and there are much more important things happening in crypto than nerds getting rich and showing it off but instead of me sitting around and complaining about it i realized through reading this article that we can grow as an ecosystem while also enjoying the ride things can happen in parallel synchronously it's also a pretty good marketing campaign for people looking to get involved fomo into crypto fomo into cryptoculture generally i personally dislike the behavior of elites i find it gaudy and kind of dumb but if reasons to celebrate can be distributed out via a new elegant economy built on top of a trustless permissionless financial system well i'm all for that i'm just going to be annoyed that i can't complain anymore so with that i want to quickly shout out our sponsors gemini lido ave and uniswap these are places where new wealth is being established and also this video wouldn't be possible
