if you are engaging with a wallet that has a ton of value in it have a vault address and what that means is you put all of your high value nfts into that Vault address if you would like to sell that nnft you send that nft away from the Vault address to a wallet that doesn't have much money in it and then you approve it for sale from that wallet so you need to protect yourself it really is the wild west right now
