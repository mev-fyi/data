i think cryptos is you know one of the more interesting things because it's like if we zoom out enough uh you could argue that the entire goal of cryptos is to make organizations that can do commerce with each other on the internet welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with tarun chitra who's generally known as one of those giga brain math wizards on crypto twitter and around and uh tarun is is so good at like math so fluent in math that he actually comes out the other side and he's actually really creative about it um so he's like a creative math geek i'd say uh and you can definitely see that in like his style that of his clothes and apparel uh but uh this is this episode turned out to be less about uh the creative side of math and the beauty of math we do touch on that at the end but more about the relationship between regulation and finance and we talk about how smart contracts are more of a innovation in the legal space more than they are in the financial space and we unpack the fact that finance is really just the combination of money and law money and contracts is how you create finance and we talk about how uh united states regulation is perhaps holding back the truer manifestation of this world of finance not just inside of crypto but but outside of crypto and how this incumbent regulation actually slows us down in the way that states can engage with each other and what if we had interstate law law agreements that were based on smart contract rather than a federal system which was very slow so some very hypothetical zoomed out applications of what it means to have smart contract law is code law so let's go ahead and get right into this conversation with tyrone right after we talk about some of

hey turn how's it going great how about you oh absolutely fantastic troon i think you have a very interesting position in the crypto industry and i think it's one that what i want to parse apart is are you more analytical and math focused or are you more creative and art focused and i actually don't know the answer to this question and so do you i don't think i know the answer to this question but i will say it's like a coin flip every day i prefer it having some like randomness and and uh kind of things changing um i also think there's kind of like a a sense in which it there's like phases and seasons of for things for me um you know sometimes it's like i you know there's a time where it's like you people are more in the like production mode and creating things mode and other times you're like consuming things you want to read read things go see movies go places and stuff like that and i i tend to think of things and more in that dichotomy of like am i in a production mode or consumption mode and like how how are things changing and that that usually guides that but i don't think i think kind of i try to stay in the middle as much as possible i think if somebody who is watching on the youtube they would look at you and be like oh that's definitely an artist like got this colorful stripy shirt got called for glasses got a colored hair but i think if somebody looked at your twitter they would think like oh this is the biggest math gigabrain like like theoretical physics type like brain person and so like it's interesting to see that you i think are very much on a barbell as in like you know math and cryptography to the nth degree but you know it so well that you've actually been able to make creative stuff out of it like you're like you're fluent in math to the point that it becomes creative for you i think there's always like some element of that um but i think one of the things that um you know i in retrospect got lucky with was i didn't go do a phd um i think you know after undergrad i was like oh i got into a bunch of phd programs i was going to go do my phd but then effectively it sort of became i don't know i i just like got a little weirded out by like hey you have to like pick a field now and then you have to stick in it for seven years and i kind of have this like wanderlust of like uh i like some fields i like you know i like some math there are many math-related fields why do i have to pick one and get stuck in it for seven years and then even after being stuck in it for seven years there's like no jobs at the end and dot dot dot dot right like there are there are a lot of problems with academia um so i i feel like that just led me to be like all right well i'm gonna try to optimize for what city you can have the most fun in and then that just like led me to not not really like to kind of like move back and forth between all these different different worlds and i think living in new york especially like post-financial crisis i feel like there was actually quite a bit of like unbridled creativity here um and uh you know i think that was like a fluke a luck and time type of thing i mean you know i i think in general it's easy to get like stuck in one thing and i think uh you know i just personally always had a little bit of an aversion to that when did you move to new york 2011. okay uh so like just long enough after the financial crisis that like things started getting back to normal i feel like but also excuse me around the time that um like san francisco was starting to have this like uh you know kind of grow and have this like economic boom and from my perspective uh attract all the uh from new york uh to go ruin the bay area so i i i found that also like to be like a great time to be here because a lot of people who are kind of shitty left you know that's like a weird weird reason to be like i love this city because all these people left but i feel like there was a while you know probably 2000s where people were like oh new york it's like the like finance bro like stereotype real estate trump wall street bro whatever type of thing um and like with the younger versions of those people a whole generation of them just didn't go to new york and went san francisco which was great and that that actually i feel like was good for like music and arts here in a lot of ways yeah how would you characterize the city now have you been in new york ever since 2011 yes i've been here for uh 11 years um yeah i think it was like everything was i mean the pandemic i i don't think the pandemic is over here so like i i've like definitely traveled a bunch in the last year and have kind of come to the conclusion that you know people in new york were very scarred um by the original part of pandemic and haven't quite got like okay here's a great example this week i believe on monday all indoor mask restrictions were removed everywhere in new york and yet you cannot go on the subway and find very many people not wearing math in spite of the fact that like there's no you know like things have have gone people are just so wired to that right now so i would say things have changed a little bit because of that um and people are more mobile so there are a lot more people who are i meet myself included who are like kind of like hey i'll move around in winter and like go somewhere warmer and then come back so i feel like the there's kind of this interesting thing going on where like a lot of people are like part-time who are full-time new york residents or like part-time new york residents but there's also way more people here right now than i've ever seen so like it feels like post-pandemic um there were just like more a lot of people who were stuck in the suburbs at home for like months my theory is that they just hit some turning point where like we need to be around people and like lo and behold you got this like huge huge uh increase in the population especially in brooklyn like manhattan i think is actually lower than its population pre-pandemic but brooklyn and queens are like way higher um and so that that's been like kind of an interesting yeah brooklyn has turned into would you say the brooklyn's kind of turned into a new shelling point for definitely for crypto people i don't know i don't actually honestly i don't know anything about any industry that's not crypto at this point because i'm so into crypto but like everyone seems to be moving to brooklyn i think that's definitely true for people in tech related fields so like okay there's a ton of people who have come from sf uh i call them the the the the fang refugees uh and they've they've sort of like all moved and mass um and uh you can see this in new york in a funny way in that like kind of the shitty the like not very artistic but like very modern buildings are all all the rents for those skyrocketed but like the rents for like the brownstones like are the same um so i i think it's true for tech people especially tech people who want to get out of california um and then i also think like this whole like miami austin denver thing was oversold and having been having been to all three of those cities this year or in the last 12 months let's say sorry uh i'm not convinced they've like built up this like whatever tech hub that you see in like the new york times you know what i'm talking about you were just there like i i it doesn't feel like it's really there it feels like it's like kind of flimsy at best yeah um denver always has had some sort of presence in web web 3 but i don't see it like growing miami i do see growing in austin i see a lot of people moving towards just generally but again brooklyn is definitely up there in places that people are going towards and it definitely seems to have like a frontier of of technology frontier of just like human exploration and innovation uh kind of vibe to it yeah kind of in a weird way uh because like you know i think people you know if you went to like another country and you're like okay what what is like the most innovative part of the us and like 99 of them would just say like silicon valley sf something like that right does not seem to be true at all right now um or at least like i feel like a lot of the really a lot of really smart people took advantage of being remote and are just like i'm never going back to that hole and uh that that seems to be what has happened i i actually feel like europe also london also felt like this super super alive i mean london is post pandemic new york is like on the precipice of crossing the the rubicon but it's not quite there but like yeah london also felt like really back alive in a way like way more than i remember it so i think i think it's cool that the world is like kind of having these new centers um but personally i'm actually more excited for like latin america i kind of feel like in the same way that um asia like leapfrogged the us um [Music] by like skipping building landlines and like fiber and stuff like that and like went straight to mobile like i kind of feel like latin america is going to like skip uh like the venmo era and go straight to crypto like it feels like they're just like way more primed for it right now than i i was living i was living and moving between cities and latin america and pre-pandemic um like no one took credit card like absolutely no one for cracker if you had a credit card you're already looked at a little bit weirdly and someone would you know it was it was already kind of like a weird thing this time i i went to like mexico city bogota um other places south uh like chile everyone takes credit card everyone is taking like tap to pay stuff and i kind of just feel like they there's this weird chance that like the us gets leapfrogged by by like latin america maybe africa although i i haven't been there so i don't know what to say but that's definitely aligned with what i'm hearing from i did a podcast with um santiago uh santiago siri santi yeah uh talking about the rate of crypto adoption in argentina uh and he says that everyone's got um everyone's got crypto on their phones and they use actually binance the binance exchange they all have binance accounts and so when they're sending stable coins they go from binance account to binance account because they can't pay for the ethereum fees so they're all using like the binance exchange not not bnb not binance chain but like binance decentralized exchange yeah and that's how they pay they pay with stables in in just using the binance exchange and he said that um vitalik's recognition like vitalik as a celebrity status is like bled out from the crypto community and now like it's just the regular argentine society that is where vitalik is a superstar and regular like argentine societies using crypto i i think argentina has always been at the cu ahead of everyone because of all of their kind of uh debt failures historically um but like mexico you know if you asked me in 2019 if like mexico was going to be a big crypto place i would have said not really because like i'd gone there a bunch of times um and i i don't mean like tulum and like that type of stuff i mean like actual like mexico city like mexican people who are right who are who are using uh digital assets because i was like everyone wants to use cash there like no everyone's like we just want cash we hate credit cards and uh you know the pandemic you know for for them seems to have really made them suddenly embrace digital finance like way more um and i think the interesting thing there is that uh they're like the apps that people use are way more like one stop fits all type things like that like you know their app for like a robin hood like thing does like rob it's like revolut it's like a even more crazy version of revolut it's like you can trade stocks you can send stables to each other you can buy crypto you can buy insurance like in in app like it's actually kind of crazy because it's it's easier than anything you get in the u.s i'm i'm seeing this trend i think we're seeing this trend across the globe um i mean this is the like in china they have the super apps right uh and ftx is kind of turning into like a financial superstructure it's a bank it's a crypto exchange it's got derivatives uh it just got an integration with stripe for payments um they're doing nfts they're doing it all right and so i'm seeing kind of like a converge on to like if you don't build an app that does everything then like you're gonna be bought or can or your or your services are just gonna be integrated are you seeing this the same trend uh for sure i think in the us you don't see it because there's tons of like regulation reasons and like for instance insurance right like the fact that i can go into an app in mexico and buy car insurance and it's like five steps and like i i'm done i literally just take pictures of the car uh and then you have car insurance and then here it's like every state has a different law and like to be an insurer in each state you have to like have deposit capital with each state's registry it just it's just natural that the us is going to be last in the aggregator game because it's just like there's just too much like state-by-state financial regulation whereas i think in like places like latin american africa this aggregator thing works like insanely well like the binance and ftx examples are like i their american branches of all these exchanges are kind of not that great right like volume-wise like right user-wise but like their international stuff is like insane and and i think you know they're all private companies so we don't know but i would love to see like the breakdown of like latin american and african users um in terms of like not in terms of dollar amounts because like if you if you try to like say like hey like who what who transfers the most obviously it's gonna be like the whales in china and like american like institutions or whatever but you know like if we actually do some more like transaction count based type of thing how many users do you have who are regularly using certain things i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised to see like somewhere like mexico had got went from like 50th to like second uh since pandemic which is like that's like an interesting trend and so definitely recommend going going and taking a little tour uh just to like see how like behavior has changed do you do you think that the leap frogging of the united states just in general is because many other countries in the world just don't have the same the sheer volume and magnitude of regulations that we have i mean i think i think part of it is the regulation but part of it is also like um you know matt levine this bloomberg calmness he he always says like everything is security's law uh like because like you know someone can commit a crime or like kill someone but then like if you look at the statistics half the time it will be like hey they didn't pay their taxes right like that was like how all the mafia rico stuff happened in the 80s right like none of them were really arrested for like the murder crimes because it was you know but a lot of them were not arrested for like tax division um and so in the u.s financial maybe a less pithy version of this is like in the us financial law is the strongest seeming law here right it seems like if you can convert some type of social more into a like hey like there's some some financial mismanagement here you can get your case through quit more quickly and like it work the system seems to work only for those cases and i just don't think that's necessarily true in most places and then like i i think that and and so because of that we have this somewhat onerous system um and and the leapfrogging i think will be interesting in that you know i remember like in the early 2000s japan was still kind of like the viewed as like the most technologically sophisticated country right whereas like right now it's probably like i don't know taiwan singapore right um and japan seems a little old like it's like still stuck in like sort of like the sony era um and uh you know i think an interesting thing was like everyone was like oh asia like completely leapfrogged the us they went straight to mobile never did you know everyone had 100 embed internet in their house um but yet if we look at what products ended up being distributed the most right it ended up coming from south korea and the us right apple and samsung so the leapfrog might just like be a good way of like you know if we if we play the game out two steps you know latin america and africa leapfrog the u.s you see some huge companies get built out of there and then people in the u.s start copying that and then like they are able to effectively lobby congress to basically give some exemptions to things that look like the things they see outside that are working and successful and then the u.s can kind of innovate that way like i could totally see that ending up being a a thing i think the the mobile thing was actually it's a similar regulatory thing but sort of different in that in the u.s um you know there's there's sort of spectra so like you know the frequency radio frequencies the the frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum um there's certain frequencies the government has dictated that they they own and you have to buy licenses to broadcast on those frequencies um from them and so there's a thing called the spectrum auction uh and you have basically you it's almost like a patent like the government gives you like the rights to that like 102.5 megahertz to 102.7 megahertz and like radio stations usually lease their um their frequency from from someone else so the spectrum auction actually kind of kept the us back in a lot of mobile stuff like that's the reason 5g is taking forever is like people can't actually get that can't like there are a few players who own the spectrum and they're not the technology providers they're like um you know like the comcast type of companies that bought bought up all the spectrum a long time ago and you know i think basically what happened is south korea leapfrog u.s and now there's like all this pressure and this is why 5g was in the news right before the pandemic uh where like the us government's like we can't get left behind we're willing to get do anything and it like plays catch-up and i kind of feel like that's how it always is it's like someone figures out how to do something somewhere easier and it like blows up in a good way like grows really fast and then the us suddenly is like ah capitalism must run faster and like so i don't think it's necessarily a bad thing i think it's actually a good forcing function because it kind of is like a way to be like to give a narrative to regulators to be like yo this is stupid like you should allow certain types of things to happen so is the pattern that's unfolding here is like where america we have american exceptional exceptionalism we're in the lead we have all the money we have all like the talent but then we rest on our laurels uh and like regulation perhaps kind of like disincentivizes innovation and so because of this like disincentive to get up and do something because of regulation we let somebody else do it but then we see that being innovated somewhere else and then we're like all right well we were resting on our laurels too much now we've got to get up and go and so we make an exception in the regulation to uh capture that new innovation that was made offshore to bring it home to america uh and then we innovate on that build that out and then we can rest on our laurels again so it feel it feels like we're the hair in a tortoise and a hair race where like we go really fast we sit down we take a breather we rest on our laurels because we're americans and we're awesome and then innovation continues the march of innovation continues elsewhere because they don't have the same regulations that we have and then at some point something inevitably crops up out of uh out of just pure unbridled uh innovation that's unbridled by regulation elsewhere outside of america and then and then we just repeat this process is that a fair way to describe this yeah yeah it's like an iterated tortoise in the hair like the hair is like only realizes it's losing the race when the tortoise is like five feet from the end and then suddenly runs and like just tries to like play catch up right um but i think that's generally the like the whale versus minnow dynamic that often happens even in other types of games abstractly where like the whale with a lot of resources gets lazy or like they have too much concentration of power wealth resources and then that just like has a sclerosis thing effect uh and then you know someone more nimble kind of takes advantage of that and then like eventually the whale's like ah i gotta like save myself and uh i the question is how many rounds of this can we survive right like the pandemic was like a weird you know that was like someone like that's like playing chess and someone just in the middle of your chess game randomly removes like 50 of the board spaces and you're like all right go you have to play now and anything that doesn't have a piece you die you know it's like so i think there's like kind of a question of like is it sustainable kind of always have this repeated tortoise and the hair type of thing or is it is it like is it inevitable is there like no other alternative um yeah i think the crypto industry is generally a fan of just like we have way too much regulation let's reduce regulation by like 90 percent and go from there uh would you be in that camp as well i don't know about like 90 i think it like needs to be metered i think the the beauty of the us right it's like we built this union founded on this notion of like a very clear separation of like local versus national rights and you could have the separation of local versus national in the same way you're supposed to have separation of church and state um i just think like in a world where internet commerce is larger than real life commerce perhaps um then the state versus national thing doesn't really matter anymore and so then you kind of end up needing a different legal structure uh otherwise like you're gonna have you're gonna kind of always run to the tension um and like a very stupid example of this uh but like one that that's interesting is that um so uh you know if you go to say mexico argentina the delivery apps there can deliver you any type of alcohol basically any time of day in the u.s however because certain states want to charge a liquor tax on stuff produced in that state they don't allow delivery outside that state and like there's this very complicated set of rules of like when you're allowed to deliver alcohol and if you cross the state border you have to pay taxes on both sides and like it just becomes it's like kind of a huge mess right and all that you wanted was just like hey guy in florida making some small batch whiskey i'm in new york why the can i just order that online and i'll just like new york and florida just agree to split the tax evenly well that doesn't happen right and so then you have these like turf wars between states and then eventually that fragments the apps right like the now the liquor app has to be kind of separate from like the ubereats doordash thing um so i think this like the the the maybe 10 000 foot view of this is actually there's this challenge when you have so much commerce done on the internet uh there's this challenge of like reconciling that with like these like state and national laws and let alone international like internationals be more complicated let's just start with state and national like those things are even hard to reconcile so i think the question is do we end up with a different governance structure which then would yes it would change 90 of regulation but it's unclear if it would remove all of it or if it would just like re-shape it or if like there would be some sort of like treaty you know because like in the the the articles in the constitution we have this interstate commerce clause right in the interstate commerce clause is very interesting because that's the thing that ensures that one state can't ban you from going to another state and selling stuff or you're basically doing any type of business um and a very interesting anecdote about this is that in australia uh the western part of australia um basically until like last month from 2020 to last month completely shut its borders to any other australia like in the us you can't do that you can't just like have one state say you you can't come in here like right and so there's kind of this thing that like at the time that the us was founded this interstate commerce thing was kind of a groundbreaking sort of form of of governance in that it like allowed commerce to be free and sort of the internet sort of also does that but somehow like we have to reconcile the fact that with our current legal system and that that that that's going to be the tension i think of the next like 20 years in the uf is the story of that just that we as humans are coming together as a global society faster than our regulations are as in like we're all on the internet we're all having commerce with each other uh the regulations still think that we're in a pre-internet you know you know adam's bit like no not less bits more atoms type of environment and like it just hasn't caught up with this like globalized society that we're creating on the internet yeah basically which is why i think crypto is you know one of the more interesting things because it's like if we zoom out enough uh you could argue that the entire goal of crypto is just to make organizations that can do commerce with each other on the internet and those organizations can be as loosely defined as a club or as strictly defined as a nation state that has like capital flows like a d5 protocol is more in that side and then like you know these other types of more loose styles are a little more like clubs but the idea that the internet lets you kind of have the same substrate for all different type types of organizations versus like in real life you can't have that you have like some notion defined locality of like what types of structures you can create um kind of makes makes reconciling those two things quite quite uh difficult not i i don't know i don't know if i would say it's going to be like a revolution like a war but i do think there's going to have to be some sort of generic reform of like how law in the real world interacts with law in the digital world and like we're we're we're still living in the like surf days of europe you know like 1500s 1400 something like that like we haven't figured out how to reconcile those we didn't have the french revolution we didn't have the the you know british empire growth and crash you know like there's still a lot of stuff in like the institution building phase that um you know we're we're still waiting for and so the question is like what is the catalyst right the pandemic was one catalyst for people to realize oh you can basically build institutions online whether it was crypto or whether it's not crypto um because people were forced to run their institutions online and then they realized oh you can do that there was a planet money podcast i listened to about the pandemic and it was about all these regulations that um maybe they were just like in the back of people's minds no one were paying attention to them pre-pandemic but once the pandemic hit all these like regulations got in the way of stuff one of the regulations was um cross nurses as in nurses couldn't go and do nursing in a different state and probably kind of some of the similar regulations that you kind of listed off with commerce and alcohol it's just like licenses didn't work across state you would probably need to get a different license but then that held so much of just like healthcare back in times where we needed it the most and so the pandemic kind of just like took the regulatory cage and like rattled it and some stuff fell out and we were like all right like let's get rid of that regulation that's like holding us back um but i don't think that's nearly enough like you just listed off like the french revolution or the fall of the british empire like uh we i think wouldn't have so much like in instead of technical debt we have like regulatory debt as in where we have regulations that i think perhaps the paradigm of these regulations probably started post-world war ii like just in the rebuilding of of you know western liberal democracies post-world war ii and the the regulation probably the culture of regulation probably got started right around there but now we have this brand new regulate regulatory uh paradigm with the internet and now also with crypto and so what you're kind of alluding to is that we need this great reshuffling reorganization re-regulation rewriting of the rules and this kind of reminds me of what a lot of what ray dalio's talking about with like and also what people are talking about with like the whole fourth turning where we're going from one paradigm to another where there seems to be like the world seems to be ready for something new and we don't know what and i think that perhaps regulation or the regulatory debt that we have is part of that story is like we're trying to find new social structures we're trying to find new systems of engaging with each other but things are holding us back and it's making us as a global society frustrated yeah and i think the you know like one thing to kind of uh remember is that you know in in history the length scale of organization was quite limited by uh you know a geography b resources c technology and d sort of like rate of population growth which you could argue as metered by resources but some some version of that and so we have these organizations into like cities agoras nation states and the nation states sort of congealed into like state-ish things and then we fractured the states and once the state grew big enough we had to like break it again and we you know there's sort of this like aggregation and disaggregation uh thing that we've had to do as we like built institutions and collectivism uh in human society and somehow the internet makes it so that there's not like a clear length scale right there's not a clear size a notion of a distance that is the right sort of organizational length scale but it's very clear that the ones we use in the real world of like state and nation and maybe city are not really good for the internet they like they just don't work right like the it's the wrong metric the wrong distance function uh and i think like once we once people decide whatever that is that will determine what this new structure looks like that makes sense yeah yeah i think so um but also i think there's room to say that like there perhaps we can't find that new like frame of reference that new meter stick between physical nation states and digital societies like some things about the nation say really only operate on the scales of atoms atoms and not bits and and like the true aligned governance in the digital age especially in the crypto age i think probably is like nonsensical to ask that to come from a nation state because the nation state is really only good at governing over the physical world not the digital world and so like when they like all the regulations that you talked about about like hey like when i'm on the internet in new york why can't i buy that whiskey that's in florida well that's a physical product that's going across physical supply chains uh and it has less to do with like and this is why i think like there's inevitably going to be like a coming uh we're going to come to a head with crypto regulation and nation state regulation just because like so many things are gray areas and crypto that the nation say i don't think we'll ever really have a clear answer towards yeah and i guess it gets back to this question of like should a nation state really be able to regulate like these entities like like what at what type of aggregation of people is the right one to regulate these and like it's not clear it's actually nations or states right it could be a larger thing maybe um nations want to regulate it of course but i i don't think it's like very clear like whose author like what what level of like this many people agreeing is like the correct authority and like i think that yeah to your point that that's where we're gonna get in trouble and i think all of the supply chains we saw during the pandemic and like we still are seeing right like the us is still living in this like crazy supply chain world i don't know if i i don't know if a lot of people have pay attention to this but like the us's shipping um infrastructure like physical infrastructure is really really bad um like there was a story um of this guy who uh you know this like startup founder guy who like i guess works in this logistics infrastructure space and he you know he was like you know there's this law i guess in long beach california that you can't like stack uh shipping containers more than like three shipping containers up or something and um this led to basically lines of trucks just like acting as storage for shipping containers like on the street in parking lots and basically there were too many containers coming in and like you could you couldn't find them and it's completely manual there's not like these things were tagged and you could be like oh this is there's a gps location for like where this container that contains x y or z good is completely not robotic not automated no tagging and he just like wrote this like viral tweet and then after that like apparently like the i guess the the county official like changed the law for this thing and like basically you know like this two months backlog suddenly was able to get cleared pretty quickly and compare this to places like um i think the most as far as i know i'm not like an expert in this so this is just you know whatever little i've read on this rotterdam in amsterdam in uh in the netherlands sorry has like this like fully robotic automated tag shipping thing it's like processes like you know the us receives like hundreds of times the number of shipping containers but rotterdam can basically process more than what the us does with one tenth the number of people who are working on and so there's this interesting thing on the supply chain side too of like hey we've kind of been like completely leapfrogged um by a bunch of places and and and i think now the last six months you you've seen like a ton of investment and like acknowledgement of this as like one of the bigger problems but this gets back to this question of like why did this guy's tweet suddenly get the law changed overnight right like that the fact that it took that is already like a weird a weird kind of thing that shows you that like the internet has changed our perception of like state like local regulations and in a way that means that like the definition of a state as this regulating entity might be sort of boomer in like 10 years well this state is always like a lagging thing right like legislation is slow governance is slow passing laws is slow but i think especially with the technologies that we have these days and also triggered by covid because kova just made us feel like much more of a global society it's like oh when italy gets when all of italy gets the covet it comes for us like two months later all of a sudden we start to pay attention to what's going on around the world a lot more just because that data means more to us now um especially during a pandemic but then but then like we're just getting better at like taking a look around the world and saying like well what they're doing over there is working out real well and we have some problems back home and so i think maybe perhaps it just like especially with societies moving so incredibly fast like technology makes time speed up like we innovate faster we can produce things faster and like our governance systems are going at the same pace that they were if not slowing down and so like the juxtaposition or the dichotomy but behind things that are working and things that aren't working i think people have a lot less tolerance for these things nowadays and things like twitter allow us to actually like discover the working things versus the broken things um and so like maybe maybe it's just like actually twitter was really the upgrade here rather than our like our governance didn't get any better but our dissemination of information got better yeah i mean i i definitely think there's certainly a sense in which dissemination of information is important to this although there's this other problem of like you know like you know obviously i guess this is like a topic du jour of like what is information and misinformation i i can't of worms i don't even know if we want to approach that but there's a question to me of like how is it possible that the people regulating this thing didn't know that there was this problem like right like they needed this like external feedback loop to pass this information back well they needed the kick in the butt because they were the hair resting on their laurels right yeah yeah yeah and then that's that's a good way of thinking about it i just like kind of there's kind of just something wrong though if like your legal system needs this other system to like kick it into doing anything right like at some point it has to change like very dramatically right do you think that we're ever going to be able to update our governance structures like talking about like american democracy here in a way that can actually keep up with the rate of innovation in society has any government structure in history ever been able to keep up with innovation well it needs to start with that question no probably the answer is no but it just basically needs to not fall off the end of the treadmill like it doesn't have to keep up with the head of the chain but it needs to keep up with it before it falls off like it just needs to be able to go fast enough and i think people are saying like hey like it's not fast enough right now like you got to go faster yeah and and so so the the like physics analogy i like to make is like there's there's the second law of thermodynamics which kind of says like in sort of these open systems uh open physical system uh which you know entropy is sort of always increasing like the more there's like this tendency to higher chaos always um and there's just inevitably going to be that when you have sort of like innovation in the society or even just unrest in a society and the question for government is not hey can we actually live forever even though like obviously that's like when you're writing this the rules and structuring things you're supposed to like be thinking of it like that like that but the question is how long can we live before the entropy of the universe distress right right and and like the question is like what there's this trade-off uh between being really fast and reactive um to changes and being very slow and methodical and like making few changes right and like you know governments are always like moving on that dial to try to like they're trying to measure the amount of chaos and then like decide based on that where they are with that and i think the problem is that the longer your your governance structure exists just in naturally just like humans themselves even macro structures built of humans seem to have this thing and like they get more conservative as they get older um and and we've yet to see a human structure that is like a blockchain in that it like it like consistently replaces its leader uh without like lots of strife uh you know i guess the u.s is the best example but it's not it's not clear that it's going to just like be able to continue that way without sort of can you unpack what you meant by that uh how does a blockchain consistently replace this leader we're talking about appending blocks of the chain i just mean like on every block at least for sort of a leader-based blockchain right you're sampling some distribution whether it's the stake distribution whether it's like the hash power distribution and you pick a new person at random for that block and and yes it's it's random dependent on the resources they're providing but it's still you know you trust the randomness that's the crypto part of this thing um and so i i guess it's like you know do we trust the the randomness or like the thing the process that's like generating like the new uh you know the either the new laws or the new sort of like structure or is it actually like eventually just school or you know tightens up and uh you don't you know we can't it becomes too much of a structure to re kind of fix and one you have to kind of blow up um and that's sort of where i i i just feel like this the current system of like state and federal laws somehow has to adapt to the fact that like for some matters you know for some matters you might actually only care about federal law for other matters you might say like hey me and my neighboring states we all need to have the same law and for some matters you might just say oh this only applies to this city right like it can like move between those skills and dows basically do that right they have like different scale different scales of dowels in terms of like how much power or treasury or whatever they have and coordination between them kind of lets them say hey we're like actually just only going to do this for the city oh we're going to do this for this group of things we're going to do this for this bigger group of things and i think like eventually physical nature will have to be able to adapt adapts to the internet by allowing all different scales of organization if that makes sense and like that sounds like a revolution like that doesn't sound like a hey we're gonna just like tweak like state laws until we look like that if that makes sense yeah so just to make sure i'm up to speed with where where your head's at um state laws and federal laws have a friction behind them because they're uh if you pass a state law then there's like regulatory overhead so maybe it worked for doing the thing that it meant to do but it also caused a bunch of collateral damage with other and and also in the future you don't know about uh and so making the laws precise to where it wants to go is difficult in the physical nation state environment but then you're saying with daos like with uniswap raises or lowers its fees like 50 bips or whatever that's that's a big change because so much of d5 relates to unit swap but then unit swap can but it's also contained to uniform at the same time same thing with like the maker das ability fee but then you have like much more smaller dials like i don't know friends with benefits and they change like a bylaws and it only contains that's only self-contained to friends with benefits are you saying that like dow governance structures just like are inherently more surgical and therefore much more aligned with what is being governed over is that is that kind of what you're saying yeah yeah sort of yeah like imagine if like you know let's say we have a liquor law but people in aggregate vote on its jurisdiction okay are we going to make the liquor law only apply to the states of california oregon and washington or are we going to make it sort of apply to the whole country we're going to make it apply to like one city and imagine if there was sort of a market mechanism for determining the scale at which a law gets applied dows kind of do that to some extent and that's a very different version of the law we have now where it's like this you you to create a new law you have to pick a a sort of jurisdiction in which it is enforced right like a picket for the municipal government or i pick it for like the federal government it doesn't naturally move between those like maybe a law needs to be able to scale with its users like a law only impacts 10 people at the beginning but all of a sudden it impacts 10 000 people now's jurisdiction needs to also change i think dows actually allow you to have that like scale up and scale down and whereas like laws in the world right now do not do that right you pick the jurisdiction size like boundaries first and then you say hey it's going to hold here can you illustrate the scaling up and scaling down of a law with the dow just to make it super concrete yeah yeah yeah so let's suppose that um uniswap uh and you know uniswap raises their fee uh and then in response curve raises their fee and there's this natural market mechanism of like people trading between them which changes the volume and liquidity structure and then at some point people say like oh uh we want to vote on actually like curve always following unisos fee and now you've kind of merged the two laws right even though they're technically their own sovereign protocols they can choose like the users one can choose to just follow the other one's law right and they vote on it once and it goes into action that's very not true in normal life right like if pennsylvania makes a law it's not like new jersey's like yeah we're going to follow the pennsylvania right like no instead you have to like go to you know what i mean okay so like yeah so like there's like this it's like it's like a bottom-up federal law system where like if curve and uniswap uh if like curve agrees to follows uniswap uh and then i don't know sushi swap agrees to follow curve which is then following unit swap there turns in right now pseudo universal fee that's determined for all of defy and that's like the federal government's law because everyone in the d5 ecosystem is using the same source for the fee structure but that source is uniswap instead of a globally mandated law right exactly like there's some sense in which the they can you can have market effects determine how why how widely the applicable the law will become right and and like that's very different than state laws right state laws don't have this like competition between them in some sense so like the the the power here is of course smart contracts where like curve can just like build this into a smart contract just as like hey like tell me call call the uniswap fee number tell me what it is and so this is akin to like california pinging washington and being like all right tell me what the liquor law is there but they don't have that ability because they're not on smart contracts and like yeah sure they can find it but it's not like they can copy it they can't just like write a piece of law that says hey we're going to copy washington and update it every day like it's not going to work they won't view that as sovereign right they're like our law can't be superseded by theirs it can only be superseded by federal law which covers everyone but what if california and washington just want to have a little alliance they want a little um is the if this like if you scale this and federation out to like all the laws like imagine imagine the states were some sort of like crypto economic network of taos and organizations or whatever like is the idea that we can actually outsource the role of the federal government just like this mesh network of interstate agreements about every different relevant laws like all right guys like what are we going to do for like the driving age and what are we going to do what are we going to do for the drinking age and what are we going to do for like whatever this law is uh and like it's just like imagine there's like federations right where there's like the the northeast federation uh so the max speed limit is 70 miles an hour and the south you know like but texas illinois and washington state decided to make their own federation say  you we're going to make the speed limit 100 miles an hour and i feel like this idea of being able to like group together units and break them apart this bundling and unbundling of laws that like you can agree to or break apart from that does not happen like you can do it in in in normal study but it's not built to do it so the system takes forever if you ever want to do something like that and during the pandemic we saw that right where like states tried to like join together to buy mass because like they then had better purchasing power but then they like couldn't agree and like they couldn't like get their their like one one state would like apply instantly because they like had enough of a budget like allocated and another state would be like no we have to like go through our procedure processes oh wait everyone has to come in person oh we can't do that we have to rewrite the law to like you know what i mean like you have to rewrite the law to rewrite the law and the recursion on this type of stuff makes it such that people don't do it whereas like recursion in the smart contracts or like gluing together these things disease and so like there's a sense in which the laws can now scale to what they're the the use the correct user base and like to me that's like the cool thing that like the internet lets you do that like kind of normal law doesn't right you have to like kind of choose these boundaries

to get started when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswopgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless uh one of the big critiques of government mainly from libertarians but mainly i hear it from the bitcoiners is that like the nation states never gets smaller they only get larger and like i think a different way to state that is kind of what we just said is that like or alluded to is that like laws only get added they only get appended rather than erased uh and that adds on like regulatory complexity and so like like if discover a problem what we do is like we write a law to fix that and then we discover new problems so we write a new law and it's like this patchwork of like laws layer on laws layered on laws and that adds friction but what you're saying is that like the routing or navigating of all those different patchwork mesh network of laws becomes trivial if it's a smart contract because you could just have the code you can also just fork if you say you i don't want to be part of this right like you can't fork the liquidity and whatever sure but my point is if you really really are like i hate this thing you do have this like exit criteria and so i'm not saying that the real law will copy this type of behavior right like it is hard to do in the physical world right just by the nature of it but i do think there will be some lessons that have to come go backwards from like we learned from like internet institutions that go back to real life institutions and we don't know what that looks like right now but i think that that that's something that you know the next 20 plus years we'll see i think i think the question is like do we exit serfdom uh you know in our lifetimes or not going back to our metaphor of just like the united states resting on its laurels and then innovation happening elsewhere and then copying copycatting that like do you do you see a world where like we actually figure out how to do some sort of real world governance on ethereum uh and then like kind of using the structure of like smart contract based laws or just like if this then that statements for laws uh yeah in like 10 years the united states is like oh that's working out really well for them in that in the internet world can we apply this to our world like we actually have like governance innovation at the at the federal level i i mean it i guess effectively this would work if you were like hey the congress congress is is the oracle that like guarantees the the data input from the real world is correct well isn't congress just an oracle of the the desires of the people isn't that what they do it's just like uh suppose it's supposed to be it's supposed to be yes suppose design yeah yeah unclear if it's uh unclear if it's uh that's realizable i think like this is why defy is to me the place i find the most interesting thing that it's very precise like the things dow's d5 do are extremely precise things and like i said the us financial law dominates overall and so if you can show that this thing can do better than existing financial law but with way less resources then you can you can now start to say like uh you know hey maybe you should start thinking about replacing and i think that's why to me d5 is actually the pill towards this direction more so than like nfts right now um because it it it is way closer to this like real world law thing and i i'm not saying like all like i don't see like liquor laws somehow being done with liquor laws on the blockchain i mean i'm sure there's some shitty ico at some point but like i i do see like financial log going this way um like i i really do see it it could very well um kind of move in this model and financial law for a lot of financial financial stuff is federal um of course insurance and stuff is not but like but but you know for broadly speaking we could argue it's mainly mainly federal and so it i i just think it will kind of be the first test and we're not d5 isn't like good enough yet right for that to happen but like i think it will be the place where we we get to this point of like oh this shit's working a lot better and uses less resources to maintain right right i want to dive into the whole like financial laws getting forced the most uh thing because you brought that up and and again and i want to dive into that because like i think if you zoom out and view the nation state holistically that actually makes a ton of sense um because like all nation states are are like these meta organisms of resource capture and management right like what nation state can capture and utilize its resources better than a nation say ray dalio had this really good line in his book where like uh like social structures like cities cities have laws that we all follow and cities have to follow the state laws and the state laws have to follow the federal laws and but then at the nation state level once you get to the nation state level like there is no bigger structure than that and so at the nation-state level it's the law of the jungle because we don't have any sort of meta organization bit behind all these different nation states like we have the u.n but like it doesn't it's more of an agreement between nations come on come on the u.n security council couldn't even like do anything for ukraine like right it's kind of a bit of a joke in some ways right and so as soon as you get beyond at the nation-state level there is no higher order of organization that forces the the lower orders to like adhere and so at the nation state level it's it's just the law of the jungle and that means resource capture and resource management and so like that's why like that's why taxes are such a big deal and that's why we're watching like capital controls happen in russia right now because capitals leaving the country or attempting to and that's the number one thing that a nation state is concerned with which is resources and like uh and and so this is this is in my mind when you tell me that financial laws are the things that get enforced the most to me that's the nation state doing its damnedess to make sure that the resources that are inside of its borders are properly managed and counted for and taxed by the nation state is that is that a fair assessment i i think it's also to some extent again a form of this thing i was just saying of like they're very precise decisions relatively speaking like you didn't pay your taxes by this amount and this time right whereas like a murder trial is very different because there's so many ways in which um you know a a trial murder trial where say 90 of people polled say like the person did it can still end up having them not be found guilty and so i i think like there is a sense though and with the nation state for enforcing these like kind of more complex matters it can only expend a certain amount of resource like the resources there are like the time it takes time as a resource the judges um you know getting doing the whole jury process like there it is it is it is a laborious task and there's only so many you can do right whereas with financial cases they're so much more precise that there's like they're almost automatable and my argument is in d5 you're basically removing all the lawyers and automating as much of that as possible so you actually might get to the point where it's like more efficient for the nation state to just use something that looks more like defy as a way of enforcing things um you know obviously that's what these cbdc type of things want to do i it remains to be seen if anyone's smart ever wants to work on them that to me that's like the bigger problem it's like no one no one's super bright really is like yeah i want to work on like the you know us cbdc or like work at visa and like on one of these things really it's the talent differences like between cryptocurrencies and you know like visa or like you know these kind like the chinese um digital dollar digital ramindi but is huge right like you don't see like really smart people going into doing that and like that should tell you something about like how feasible it is for a government to do it and so if it turns out that like it just grows so big on its own it might just become easier to just adopt defy as the law for that right and like i i'm sure small nations will be first to do that because they get free currency stability possibly um and so that that will be that that's why i'm much more bullish on like d5 being the the kind of way of the real world kind of um real laws kind of being restructured right okay so the argument is that like all these financial laws financial laws when they go to court are just so incredibly objective because it's just like all right what are the numbers involved with what what of the parties and and did the numbers get transferred in the most appropriate ways and so this is all like almost like math based almost like trust in math which is like part of like the the crypto ethos and so what you're saying is that like porting over this legal structure onto defy allows us to just reason about these things better and also with the aid of smart contracts to make sure that we never actually have to go to court in the first place it's just like all automated on defy and so you're saying the gap between managing interstate commerce laws versus like interstate finance and tax laws is like much smaller you have to actually put that on defy versus like how do we manage like alcohol like licenses on the blockchain exactly yeah and it becomes easier to adopt right like it just becomes easier to be like in the same way i was like oh curve just adopted unisop's fee a nation state can adopt an amm's price as an oracle for an off-chain contract right it's not it can go the other way right like we've spent all this time using oracles to like pump in prices right but if it becomes the most liquid venue in the world then you can also go the other way and that's the equivalent of a nation state taking the rules of defy are now our law right that's a very simple case like a maybe not like a crazy case but it's still it's still like an example and the the case for that would be like uh in some sort of like courtroom they're like all right well the uniswap price for this token at this time was this amount therefore you owe this much in taxes or the settlement is like determined like this or something like that yeah i mean or a a more like nationalistic version is suppose that there's some nation whose currency is majority issued in a stable coin um and they instead of making a digital dollar they just like act like circle or tether and they just like make an erc20 that is i don't know the marshall islands dollar i'm making up a currency um and they just issue their stable coin on there and then there's a unisop pool of usdc versus the marshall island dollar and any anything that the government needs to ever get the exchange rate for and governments have tons of stuff where they need exchange rates and contracts in law um to enforce the law comes from use law right that's that that's another case where like you're basically adopting the laws of defiance there and like i think i think it you know there was a lot a lot of time in crypto i think in like especially in the bear market was spent on like i don't know i remember like ripple like tried to like get itself adopted as like the currency of some like random country or whatever right none of that worked regardless of how much money like people were like giving these random countries a more powerful version is the opposite right like the thing that already has a ton of liquidity also has the sovereign coin and now they're accepting the laws of g5 right like and like that seems kind of not impossible uh do you believe in code is law like straight up lex cryptographia or whatever it's called not really but more because it's so easy to write bugs okay do you believe in the philosophy as in smart contract laws supersede nation state laws um you still have to care about the users right i think they're smart a lot of these smart contracts only work under some conditions of like there are certain types of users or providing liquidity trading doing whatever right at least for d5 again and it depends on the users plus the contracts and i think it is lock code is like conditional on some assumptions being met and then without those assumptions being met you can't assume you can't say that it's a causal statement what's an assumption that needs to be met i'll give you a simple example unisop to be a good oracle needs a ton of liquidity and the cost of manipulating the price is sort of like proportional to like sort of a function of the liquidity in there okay and you know if if i'm going to use it you know if the code is like law in that like some government's like using that unit swap pool to like figure out how much to pay in to some other country like there should be some condition under which that's true yeah right code is law when we're ready for it as a society basically yeah yeah yeah okay um drew when you wake up in the morning what does your brain go towards what do you focus on naturally what's downhill for you uh where is caffeine like that's i mean you want the honest answer yeah first first thing okay when you're caffeinated what do you start to think about um i don't know i feel like most of most of it is just like reading like the news and seeing what happened overnight i mean the thing about crypto right is like there's so many times i've woken up and there's just been like some crazy ass surprise and or like some crazy thing happened overnight in asia and like i don't know yeah the world's gone crazy i i'm actually a late night type of person so like actually in the morning i'm kind of bleary and like no good ideas no good ideas come in the morning uh it's actually like usually like i just take a long time of like reading things before i can finally start like thinking about stuff and then usually it's it's uh you know trying to understand what things in crypto are actually working by usage not by hype or uh things like that and then trying to see if there is you know my research process for coming up like papers to write is like really trying to understand if the the there's something that's working in spite of the fact that the developers had no clue why it should work they just like wrote the thing kind of hoped it worked and the duct tape and bailing wire put it together and it's like 90 of the time this thing should fail but for some reason it's like able to survive and not get exploited and not get people or not like you know uh and then so like i spent a lot of time thinking about that and like trying to analyze the space of these things because i think that that that's how you find what the new primitives are uh at least and do you find so much of like and we saw this with the internet and it's also true with d5 is like so much of it is emergent okay so when we started with the internet we just were making newspaper websites instead of what we know of today yes right uh what's that maybe that's dating me uh geocities used to be this like it was the first uh website that was like build your own website for free and like um it it it got bought by yahoo um but like it was like squarespace but really really like shitty like you know it would it had it had it was most famous for inventing the following feature which was the page counter which at the bottom of the page would like show you the number of time visitors okay so yeah so like a lot of the early internet stuff that actually never ended up like manifesting into what the internet is we know of today and i think now that we have that primitive we kind of can apply it to defy right like or at least with ethereum too like when in 2015 2016 a theory and we had pepith which was like twitter on ethereum as in like you would write tweets and they would be in transactions on the l1 and this was back when gas was like basically zero cents but now it's completely ridiculous uh and so like but but now we understand that like there's going to be some sort of emergence with what we build in d5 we know that like the things that d5 will look like in 20 years were probably going to be completely different from what we're building out today and what we're really on today are probably skeuomorphic and backwards and reductive so like is that when you think about defy like are you always on the like lookout for it's like oh well like is this really gonna be what it looks like in 15 years or how do you how do you navigate a world that we know we don't know what it will be like in the future with d5 it's like i i feel like that the key is there's you know i i prefer uh saying this and i say it all maybe too much but d5 has nothing to do with actually changing much in finance has everything to do with changing things in law and like removing law more than finance so if you see something work there has to be some analog that's existed in finance somewhere it might be an arcane esoteric thing that like doesn't exist anymore or like blew up in some weird way um but there probably is an analog uh for for like nft stuff i that that's above my pay grade like i i i i have no clue how to think that way and like i i know there are these people who are geniuses like andy who are just like always on for that stuff but like i just i can't see that whereas here it's more about like trying to draw analogies and also to understand kind of like the users really well and like and i think like yeah for finance it's just a little bit easier it's like i just don't think we're going to like invent something that's completely new it's going to be more like something that was very hard and could have existed or did exist somehow was able to be made really easily um with smart contracts like before it was like too complicated too expensive and the cost of it somehow went down 10 000 x and that made it an attractive product and that's that's sort of how i feel with with with with like a lot of financial products yeah i think one of the things i've learned about you the most is exactly almost exactly what you just said where like this isn't finance this is law that we're working on like smart contracts is an automation of law not an automation of finance but finance itself is inherently law based right you can't have finance without contracts because like that's all finance is is money and contracts basically and that's how you create finance and i think a lot of money is a contract look at the back of the bill it has all the philosophy written though that's a really good point yeah i never even even thought about that but i think that's something that like a lot of listeners probably people that think about d5 think of it as finance and don't really consider the law aspect of it yeah and i think i think like when you make law cheaper you change which products are used mm-hmm yeah your changes are viable rich products yeah exactly yeah um tyrone when you wake up in the morning what makes you optimistic other than your cup of coffee that's coming um you know obviously human humans seem to be unable to to to not cause strife for themselves but um i just think there's just so many kind of like pretty things in the world that come from very different aesthetic standards like you know certain types of math are very pretty certain types of you know people's like devotion to something is very pretty like you know like people like i don't really find this art very interesting i don't like it but the dude the fact that the dude did that for like so many days in a row and didn't get bored of doing it you gotta respect that it's very it's it's like there's some there's some joy beauty to that so i think it's more about finding like taking all of these kind of things that you see in the world especially on the internet in internet culture and trying to like be able to find some like little nugget of like hey you know like i probably hate that thing but it's actually kind of there's some there's something some like you know there's always something a kernel of niceness in a lot of things and you know to do that you have to keep yourself only locked into certain parts of internet and away from others but uh what to do what oh to always be able to find some like nice like nugget of like fun like hey this is cool i appreciate it type of thing and like finding those things every day like that's that's kind of my what i mean why do you have to lock yourself there are those in this into the internet to find oh i i just don't i'm just trying to say like i i don't read 4chan like you know what i mean like there's certain parts of the internet that there are some things where i i'm like i don't think i'm going to find anything positive here okay what's um what's an example of a piece of math that's pretty so what's the last pretty piece of math that you saw so i i i think like my favorite proof of all time is like the one thing i think that's very interesting in in in math is like the more powerful like a theorem or statement um the more a it gets used but b the more people try to find different ways to prove the same result and so the more fundamental and important um an object is the more you find like 500 proofs of it and within those 500 there's there's many different forms of style and aesthetics them some are you know they're they're pretty because they use really fancy machinery and the proof is really small some of them are pretty because it's like very first principles you don't need to know that much background and some of them they're pretty because they like are a tour de force they like are able to like glue together things that you wouldn't have thought would like work together but i think my favorite proof is the the fundamental theorem of algebra something you kind of like learn in high school which is like any polynomial has n roots in the complex numbers like it has it has all its roots and like when you learn it the first time you always learn this like really ugly super ugly proof but there's this one proof using liuvil's theorem uh which is something a complex analysis that is just very very clean and i i find like the fact it's like it's it's it's like a proof i have committed to memory and i think like it's kind of like finding a poem you really like you know there might be 500 poems that are going to the same sentiment but there's sometimes you find one where you're like this is the this is the one that like yeah i i you just insta commit to memory and so that that's probably it i i the way that i relate to that is um when i am when i'm doing my writing and i'm writing out a paragraphs to make a point and going through the revision process i find a way to take like this three paragraph section to that's making what i think is like a really awesome very strong point but it took me three paragraphs to make it and then in my editing process i'm able to like actually like take the third paragraph cut some stuff out and then like integrate that into the first two paragraphs and if i'm really on my game then i can actually find a way to cut that paragraph down into two paragraphs and like the best theorem if you will is like oh i actually collapsed a whole entire section into these two sentences and these two sentences actually land so much harder with the listener with the reader than this whole entire paragraph uh and uh ryan always uh says like when he when we're trying to onboard like writers into bank list is that you're supposed to write like you tweet like if you're actually constrained for characters how do you get your point across uh and like it's the art of like writing a whole entire like 10 000 word article but that you get the point across inside of 500 words and right it kind of sounds like the same thing it's the same it's the same thing but somehow you need to have written struggled through the long one to figure out the short one and like that that process is also very can sometimes be pretty to see like how that how the simplification happens are you familiar with the concept a mathematical concept i'm sure you are actually uh with basins you mean like basins of attraction and dynamical system yeah yeah so like is it fair to try and extrapolate this out as in like the bottom of a basin is like the most simple and most reductive uh proof or in my world the most simple like the the how do you collapse 10 000 words into a single meme like do you think the the base of the attraction basin is like the bottom of it is like the most distilled thing of what we're trying to talk about yeah i i like the analogy i i will say it's not true for all basins uh because because oftentimes they don't have unique points like unique minima they can have like many bottoms um and so you know but like the sentiment's correct for sure assuming you have a way of describing like a dynamical system that's like your thought process right but then again neuroscience is very far from being that precise well uh can we we can also extrapolate extrapolate this to d5 right where like maybe there's a desire to swap tokens on d5 so what do we do the first thing we do is we build ether delta and that was a very very messy proof of trying to swap tokens uh and then you know later we find uniswap we find x times y equals k and that seems to be like the most reductively simple way of swapping tokens uh and i feel like you could probably extrapolate this to like almost all domains of knowledge where like you can just find the most simple and most easy way to do something um but then when you extrapolate that like do you get into the conversation of singularity like what is the most bottom-most basin of the universe and if we all end up there like what happens did i just get way too far out there i don't know i feel like i think the answer is yes that's that's just like yeah i i guess so i think the interesting thing is i feel like the concept of the singularity seems to have like lost popularity like i feel like 10 years ago it was like kurzweil was like uh you know really like hot character and now instead we have his son making very cringe fake dowels wait is that real bessemer dao like like this venture fund is like claiming they're making a dow and they're like going to invest out of it but it i don't think they understand what the d stands for right and his son is running it i do think we actually kind of accidentally went down like the wrong path with naming these things like none of these things are doused i mean pets.com was an era right like no one says like you know bankless.com right yeah so well you know you have to go through this again this is like the you know we're going through this dynamical process you know all right tyrone um do you have any like rule of thumb that you follow or bit of advice that has been useful for you um good question um probably like you know i the thing i started doing in college and then like kind of have still done is i have this rule of like never eat a meal alone and so like that leads you to like actually try to find to meet new crazy people obviously pandemic kind of ruined that rule but like let's ignore that fact but uh and like i think like being able to like have some like very simple structured goal like that which forces you to like go you know change your social behaviors somehow is uh i feel like it's a very good good thing uh yeah so if it's dinner time and you don't have somebody to eat a meal with what do you go do go meet someone random go eat at a bar read a bar no no air pods allowed sit at a bar yeah yeah yeah no yeah exactly exactly you're talking to a guy that like eats most of his meals at a bar with their boss in you know in new york though i feel like it's very it's very different like there's like tons of people who just like go and hang out on their own and it's not yeah so all right bankless nation action items go to a random bar and get a meal and talk to a
