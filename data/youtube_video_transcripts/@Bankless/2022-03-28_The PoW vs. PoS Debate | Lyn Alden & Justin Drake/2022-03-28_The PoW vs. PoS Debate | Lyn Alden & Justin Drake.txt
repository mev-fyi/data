it's almost black and white the proof of stake is clearly superior than proof of work so there's a bunch of points they respond to so i'll try to go linearly i guess welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys you are in for a treat today we've got two experts on proof of stake and proof of work and they are debating the subject over which is better for creating a global money system a crypto money system proof of work or proof of stake lynn alden and justin drake on the episode today we're going to talk about a few things number one which provides the most economic security proof of work or proof of stake number two which provides the best deterrence and recoverability in the face of the dreaded 51 percent attack number three which minimizes governance power for the elites which is more power to the people number four which is economically the fairest system to participate in and number five this is personally my favorite this conversation around proof of work being more commodity money and proof of stake being more equity money is that correct that's what one of our debaters believes and we dive into that as well david why don't you tell us a little bit about the format of this episode because uh it was a fantastic uh i think format in that the participants like i feel like for times during this episode you and i could just sit back and watch the uh participants go over their points and articulate them well back and forth it was like watching a you know tennis match of like a serve and then a volley and then like back and forth back and forth yeah the first the first half of the episode i'd say just wrote itself seriously debated going back and like making a bag of popcorn because the first half at first half of the show as as host we didn't have to do a damn thing uh yeah lynn and justin just took it and of themselves and took this conversation in in their own direction uh and then uh we started you and i as hosts again started in the second half of the show really to actually direct the conversation and uh summarize things that were said and digest things that were said uh and so the this is kind of how this this episode is bisected down the middle but then i would also say i really enjoyed the closing statements as well just allowing both justin and and lin to really just summarize holistically their entire scope for why lynn believes that proof of work is a better money system and why justin believes proof of stake is a money system uh so there is so much knowledge baked into this episode this is going to be ones one of the ones that we're going to have to re-listen to to really fully extract all of just the the fantastic knowledge that is here and overall i'm just very happy that in this very tribal world of crypto that we have people like lynn alden and justin drake who can come to a podcast and just talk about things without the yelling that you would find on twitter spaces and without the jabs that you would find just a very respectful respectful conversation which i know is important for the listeners because it's just very it's a pleasant debate to listen to so i'm so happy that we were able to produce this podcast here ryan imagine having an adult conversation about crypto it's impossible to do on on crypto twitter and other locations but that's what was had today it's fantastic points by both sides of this argument well articulated one thing david and i are going to do is have a conversation about the conversation that was just had we have that on an episode we call the bankless debrief you get that if you are subscribed as a bankless premium member dave and i are going to talk about the merits of both sides maybe maybe your mind was changed david in this in this debate maybe there are some points that uh justin brought up maybe some lynn points that we'll have to talk about so i'm looking forward to that conversation if you're a bankless premium member you can look forward to that conversation too should be available to you now just upgrade to premium membership we're going to get right into the conversation with lynn alden and justin drake

sponsoring bankless bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest and host this conversation about proof of stake versus proof of work or flip that around proof of work versus proof of state depending on what uh side of the of the conversation you're on i want to introduce you to repeat bank list podcast guest founder of lynn alden investment strategy lynn alden she's a leading expert in macro markets lynne alden has been a leading expert commentator on macro she's been a proponent of bitcoin for a long time she generally believes that proof of work is more suited to producing a new global money system than proof of stake she also wrote an article on this topic that was widely read uh very well circulated and well argued so we've got lynn on the one side who is pro proof of work and critical of proof of stake lynn welcome to bankless how you doing uh happy to be here fantastic uh on the other side of things we have justin drake justin drake is also a repeat bankless uh guest he is a researcher at the ethereum foundation he's the pioneer of eth as ultrasound money you may have heard that meme a few times before he's also been hard at work at helping ethereum transition to proof of stake so of course he is a believer in it and he believes that proof of stake produces an asset with the properties that the 2020s will need with the monetary properties that is so he's on the side of pro proof of stake and he's more critical of proof-of-work uh justin how are you doing welcome to bankless doing great thanks again for having me guys okay uh we're super excited to host this this debate this conversation if you will i know you you both have some fantastic uh points to go through i want to start with kind of the big question i think we're settling and see if we have some agreement uh on that big question um which is i think we're trying to answer the meta question of whether proof of work or proof of stake is most amenable to the accrual of monetary premium basically which of those two consensus protocols are most amenable to making a cryptocurrency a money have monetary premium do you guys agree before we get into kind of the the subtopics here that this is the correct framing of the whole conversation uh we're trying to answer which consensus protocol has a better monetary premium potential justin why don't we start with you yeah i think that is that is the big question and it kind of boils down to what the consensus mechanism is all about it's about security and so we kind of we can kind of look at a consensus mechanism and through the lens of economic security for example we could look at it through the lens of governance security to what extent does the community have control over the consensus participants which are meant to just be doing their job of maintaining the the blockchain we can look at physical security which one is more liable to attack uh you know from violence uh in the context of of nation states for example we can look at quantum security and we can even maybe look at meme security you know monetary premium to a large extent is about having the best memes and i believe that proof of stake has the potential to have much better memes than proof-of-work when it comes to looking at cash flows um but that's i guess something we'll discuss later glenn i want to get your way in on this so um do you think that this is the question we're trying to answer is which sort of consensus mechanism is most amenable to the accrual of monetary premium proof of work or proof of stake or would you re reframe this in a different way i think that's a good way to phrase it and you know in the current system we have you know not on the blockchain but we have proof of work and proof of stake assets essentially right so equities because you you know you own a stake in that company you have a proof of stake right and so your stake allows you to exercise some degree of control over that company whereas of course we have normal commodities that are proof of work assets more or less and what we've seen over history is that either asset can acquire some degree of a monetary premium right so for example in this era of bad money um stocks have required in some cases a monetary premium so you can have assets of either case that have monetary premium and so the question becomes what is most suited to a monetary premium and what is able to acquire and then hold for the very long run and accrue a structural monetary premium i really want to kind of interject almost at the very beginning here and kind of try and and and kind of argue why this this analogy with equity and proof of stake is maybe a bad analogy and the reason is that in the context of of of equity um you have the right to vote on anything you can completely change the rules of of the company um but in the context of uh proof of stake um actually there is a bit of an ambiguity you could have proof-of-stake governance and you can have proof-of-stake consensus so some chains like tezos like polka dot like dfinity they empower their token holders to make arbitrary changes to the rules of consensus and that can happen even without a fork if there's a sufficient quorum the rules kind of automatically change on chain but um in in the context of proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism for security um the consensus participants can't just arbitrarily change the rules so for example and i think there's something we can both agree on the consensus participants can't say we're just gonna give ourselves you know a thousand if each um because that would be kind of an invalid transaction an invalid block and so ultimately the consensus participants are beholden to the community and that is a huge difference relative to to equity and if we really want to go down this equity metaphor then we kind of need to think of us think of how proof of work would be equity like and it is equity like in the sense that the consensus participants those who have hash rates have this very constrained voting power only in the context of governance so and on the context of consensus not in the wider context of governance guys i think everyone here is really eager to uh get into the details and we jumped ahead a little bit with that justin so i'm going to zoom out and kind of give a road map for the listeners before i give it right back to lynn there in order to answer the question which produces the best monetary premium there's a bunch of sub questions one of those is like the commodity versus equity debate with which we just kind of hopped into and so we'll start with that first but the other things that we're going to talk to talk about on this show are things like 51 attacks which one which system can recover deter and recover from 51 attacks economic security which provides the most economic security fairness and decentralization which one is economically fairest for participants and kind of what we were just talking about commodity money versus equity money lynn generally thinks that proof of work produces commodity money or money with commodity properties and proof of stake produces money with equity properties as we just alluded to and that is i guess where we're going to start this debate as we've uh hopped into it already so lynn uh do you want to just keep on going with that conversation about proof of work as commodity and proof of sake as equity so i agree that there are different types of proof-of-stake systems right so they're ones that give you more control than others um and i you know if i were to focus on say defining proof-of-work as as you know commodity money i would also even go you know so far as to say that if you have a proof-of-work system that has difficulty bombs or that has say very large blocks or just you know very uh uh you know hard to run your own node that starts to have equity-like systems as well and so for example you can have some of the hard forks away from bitcoin start to look more equity-like because it kind of consolidates the number of people that can make decisions for that protocol rather than being a fairly immutable protocol as you would generally see in a commodity right so producers have no influence over the properties of copper for example that's that's an example of a commodity money or a commodity in general and so going back to the you know proof of stake to equity analogy we can point out that for example shareholders in a corporation can make changes but of course they can't make changes that violate the law of the country that they're that they have a jurisdiction or that you know places they operate in right so they're still bound by things that are outside of just their stake in that company and that that's that would be true for this as well and so in this context the proof of stake would refer to uh the fact that people that hold the capital are the ones that get decide which transactions are processed more or less that's kind of that's what their their stake is is rather limited to right so if we want to take kind of a technical perspective i guess um the consensus participants can try and do two things one is they can try and do a hard fork which is basically to make transactions which are are not valid and somehow make them valid and as you say this is the context of the law there's this law which is set by by users which cannot be violated by the consensus participants and then there's this other thing that they can try and do is basically as you said restrict the set of transactions that can be processed and so this is what's called a soft fork which is basically a form of censorship where transactions that used to be valid are no longer being processed and so they're effectively invalid and so i do agree that consensus participants have this ability to do censorship and then the question becomes if we want to compare proof of work to proof of stake which one is least liable to these census flip attacks and and here what we need to do is we kind of need to zoom out all the way to the social layer because this is where the social layer needs to intervene and it turns out that one of the massive advantages in my opinion of proof-of-stake is that the social layer has the tools to go intervene whenever there is censorship by the consensus participants um whereas proof of work does not have that now in terms of um you know things that you mentioned like like the difficulty bomb small blocks versus big blocks these are things that i believe are somewhat of a gonna to the discussion today and i think one way to really focus the discussion on the topic of specifically proof of work versus proof of stake which is a tiny part of consensus it's kind of interesting how this this professor proof of work with proof-of-stake is actually all about restricting the set of consensus participants that can come in it's an anti-sybil gadget and you know there's other things in the in the in as part of consensus there's the folk choice rule there's localization there's dvm versus utxos there's big blocks versus small blocks there's all sorts of other things but i think in in order to have like the simplest discussion possible maybe we could compare a hypothetical bitcoin proof of stake and a versus a bitcoin proof of work or we could just look at ethereum proof of stake versus efferent proof of work but if we start um you know talking about things outside of canvases apples to apples comparison then the discussion becomes quite quite convoluted i'd like to go um back into the kind of commodity money versus equity money type of discussion um so lynn i i i want to understand kind of your take here um is it is it the case that you believe that uh any kind of proof of stake produced monetary premium or money is more like equity and less like a commodity or um is there some like granularity there uh in in in kind of your belief i i think you just expressed in what you were saying previously that some proof-of-work systems can actually become a bit more equity-like and less commodity-like is the same true of proof-of-stake systems can they become a bit more commodity-like and less equity-like in your mind so i think there is some degree of spectrum but i think for the most part it's a rather one-directional street in the sense that it's there's there are multiple ways to become an equity but very few ways to become a commodity in that sense uh and so commodities by their nature are somewhat rare they're immutable and there are so many things that require governance in our world and so you know especially when we're talking about the topic of decentralization and immutability there are multiple ways to essentially become an equity and there are multiple ways to define what an equity is in that context and so i would say for the most part you know the the the ways to create a true kind of commodity in the digital realm is extremely limited and that's why i bring up the block size i agree that we should we should focus almost entirely on the proof of work versus proof of stake concept but my point of bringing that up is that even among even in proof of work there are multiple traps to fall into to create a system that ends up being more equity-like in the sense that those with with capital and those you know with outsized influence can control the network uh compared to uh one you know having one that's that's truly decentralized and as close to immutable as you're going to get in the digital realm do you think part of the difference here lynn is that um like a difference of ossification right so some networks like maybe say a bitcoin for instance has far few fewer governance um decisions to actually make since it's kind of done it's like fully baked but something like ethereum whether it's whether it's proof of stake or or whether it's proof of work you know it's it's not a complete project maybe it's 50 complete i think vitalik said you know somewhere between 50 and 60 uh recently complete so there are still future governance decisions to make and whether that is like hash power uh you know it kind of influencing some of those governance decisions or whether that's you know staked tokens influencing those governance decisions is the difference that ethereum and many of the other proof of stake chains are um not ossified they still have work to do versus versus something like bitcoin and proof of work do you think that's a useful distinction in your mind i think that is a useful distinction but i would say even in an ossified proof-of-stake system it still wouldn't uh be basically a monitor premium in the same way that a proof-of-work system is one way i think one analogy you can use is that a proof-of-work system is like non-volatile memory right whereas proof-of-stake system is like volatile memory basically you have to be continually online to be as trustless as possible with that system and so that gives you different levels of hardness as it relates to attack surfaces in addition when you go down to the complexity of the code proof of stake is far more complex far more bloated compared to proof of work and again i'm not saying that proof of stake has no use cases so so saying that something is a digital equity is not saying that it's worthless it's just saying it's not a digital commodity and so that's how i kind of would make that that kind of differentiation that even if you had a hypothetical ossified totally done proof-of-stake system or at least close as close to being done as possible or maybe you're changing with gradual soft forks and things like that uh that you still inherently require more governance because the failure modes in case that there is a major system event is requires more intervention than if you have a proof of work system and if you had for example something crazy like the internet goes down for a month right so proof of something like a proof-of-work system where bitcoin can just restart again whereas a proof-of-stake system requires kind of more of a kind of a manual restart because you know it's not a system that's designed to make sense when it's not continually online and so i think that there are there are multiple angles you can approach it from a hardness perspective and it's more than just ossification although ossification is a factor justin i'm kind of interested in you responding to that but i'm also interested in your concept of ether as an asset do you view ether as more commodity-like or more equity-like do you think that's a helpful distinction i like to think in technical terms and so like these these traditional labels i'm somewhat uncomfortable with um and i think the case could be made that both bitcoin and btc and eve have you know commodity properties and both have equity properties um but you know i want to you know ask lynn kind of a simple question which is you know you you mentioned that the capital holders have this this outsized power in the context of a proof of stake um so if let's say bitcoin was a proof-of-stake system fully the same kind of ossification the same kind of culture and everything like that what exactly would be that outsized power because i'm i'm not really seeing it well essentially go down to the idea that those that hold large stakes in the system have an influence a structural influence on who can transact in that system who can be censored and who cannot be and so for example in the current banking system as we've seen in some countries lately uh you know there's a rather small number of entities that can then determine what people can use that system to transact and which people cannot and so both types of systems have a risk where uh they can become you know centralized to the point where they have temporary or permanent blockades on certain sites of transactions and so in a proof-of-stake system uh you have a situation where if you hold a quorum of the capital if you had if you hold a a majority of the capital you can then lock down the network uh uh to uh entities that are considered for whatever reason unworthy of uh transacting in that system and i think one one thing to keep in mind is when we talk about say attacks on a network we have to think of like you know some rogue actor coming in to attack the network whereas i think a more realistic thing to uh approach is from a like a you know from a regulatory standpoint so for example if a country declares that all of the proof-of-work miners have to you know avoid processing certain certain types of transactions right so that that's an example of regulatory capture that becomes a problem if you have a lot of say publicly traded uh bitcoin miners for example located in one country and that they have you know a majority of the the processing power now that could eventually be rectified by bringing more hash to the network and other places whereas when you look at the proof of stake system then the question becomes looking at custodians and looking at whales and seeing how to what extent they can be regulated to essentially capture the network and so that's how i'd phrase that right so you you somehow acknowledge you know and kind of highlight the the outsize power that you know the the stakers might have but i think it's the the the miners those who own hash rate have the exact same outsize power right it's just and at the end of the day both proof of work and proof of stake are proof of capital and so one of the questions we should we should be asking ourselves is you know how much capital is required to go overwhelm the system that's one of the key questions around economic security and it turns out empirically that proof-of-stake is vastly superior by roughly an order of basically an order of magnitude 20 x better from an economic efficiency standpoint to go raise that that barrier to entry to actually perform a 51 attack now you one thing that you said which is that you know there could be these external attackers but that could also be kind of endogenous attackers and this is the exact same situation in my opinion for proof of work and proof of stake like you could take for example a company like genesis mining they're effectively a custodian of hash rate they have customers who will basically just send funds that's all they do they hold the miners and they can you know be regulated in the exact same way that the custodian can be regulated now the key critical difference and is it goes back to the the the counter attacks that the community can do you mentioned that in proof of work you could have more hashrate come in well i i don't think that's the the expected outcome and the reason is that if a 51 attacker comes in they get to collect ev every single piece of reward every single piece of issuance every transaction fee goes to them and the reason is that they can mine a chain where they're all the only miner they win every single block and no one else wins block blocks and so the honest miners what are they going to do they're going to turn off their miners because it doesn't make sense to be spending electricity and not get get income and then what's the next step well they're going to want to liquidate their assets they're going to want to sell their hardware and then what can the attacker do well now the attacker can buy this this hardware for pennies on the on the dollar and basically reinforce themselves um as as the attacker and it's kind of this this really terrible situation and even if for some reason or another the community despite you know a totally compromised blockchain despite the price of bitcoin maybe having crashed quite significantly manages to to make a counter a counter attack which is not against their rational interest because they would likely be losing money uh in in in that process the counter-attack would take months if not years to organize on the other hand in the context of of proof-of-stake you have a very straightforward mitigation which is just take the attacker and remove them from the validator set this is what's what we call kind of a forced exit now it turns out that in in ethereum if you want to join as a validator there is an activation queue so it takes time to go from non-staked effer to state ether and if you want to double the amount of staked if it takes roughly 200 days so at a minimum what you can do is you can kick out the the attacker and that buys you 200 days but of course the the community has more powers than that one of the things they could do for example is totally destroy all the rewards that have been accrued so far in addition to doing the forced ejection or they could do like something even much more nuclear is that they could just destroy the whole stake of the attacker and if they do that we're actually in a position where we can bound the number of times that an attack could happen in the first place let's imagine for example that there's 10 million if that's honest and that's staking if you want to do an attack you're going to need another 10 million eve and every time you make an attack you lose a 10 meter leaf now if there's only 120 million if in circulation the attack can only be done you know 11 times so really in the in the case of healing these attacks it's it's almost black and white the proof of stake is clearly superior than proof of work so there's a bunch of points they respond to so i'll try to go linearly i guess um the first point is that the difference between mining uh as basically the source of control versus staking as a source of control is that staking requires little or no you know there's no almost no entropy there right so once you hold the power you accrue more power whereas in any mining business including physical commodities and then now extending into into digital commodities with with you know mining of say bitcoin and or other blockchains it's a very capital intensive business you have to constantly put in fresh capital in order to maintain those rewards and so it actually doesn't really accrue a lot of value for the miners other than on the margins right so basically scraping by and and you know uh you know it's historically been a very rough business to operate in and so that's one difference between say the the that you in either way you need capital in order to you know be a processor in the network but one is kind of inherently more structural inherently kind of you know power begins power and the other one is it actually kind of rewards new entrants people that come in and say okay there's almost no economy of scale here there's some degree of economy of scale but for the most part with proof of work the most efficient energy sources are these small strand energy sources around the world right so you know you can have these you know uh uh large entities that have say a a big you know kind of economy of scale in terms of their ability to buy machines and things like that but when it comes to the cost of energy smaller uh entities actually sometimes have the advantage because they can they can go to places that are just too small for these bigger ones to deal with the second one i think relates to overall when it comes to security it's not just about 51 attacks it's also about bugs right so for example when it comes to the largest blockchains i'm far less concerned that they're going to be 51 attacked than say the smaller ones that are sharing a hashing algorithm with a larger chain right because they're much easier to you know like say one percent of bitcoin miners could attack bitcoin cash 51 attack and then go back to mining bitcoin right so i'm more concerned about the smaller chains getting 51 attacked then i am the largest one or the largest five let's say and so in in that context i'd be far more concerned about bugs and so one of the things that's that's easy to grant is that in a world of just like where everything works perfectly proof of stake has a higher cost to attack that's something i mentioned in my in my article a couple times where uh you know if especially if the system's smaller right so especially if you're in a world with multiple chains and you're trying to create a project proof of stake makes sense because it gives you a higher initial threshold to attack it whereas the downside of that system is that because proof of stake is inherently far more complex and there are greater attack services there are greater bug services it's more bloated code there are more challenges to that system and then when you you know this goes somewhat out of the bounds of proof of work reverse proof of stake but then you layer in additional features right so for if we're talking about what makes a good money it's something that is inherently simple and inherently small no decentralized proof of work basically the the leanest code you can get and distribute is among as many machines as you can get and as immutable as you can get whereas as we layer things on top of it like proof of stake adds a lot of code complexity it also makes it use my prior example more like volatile memory the non-volatile membrane needs to be continuously live in order to function as intended and so when you layer those things on top of it i would say that takes away a monetary premium and then you can argue that it adds equity value right so for example when we look at apple stock right so we look at apple stock over the long term you know like this this this kind of meme of ultrasound money for ethereum you have this thing where it's mostly focused on whether it's inflating or deflating and what percentage right so for example apple stock is actually one of the most deflationary assets around it's it's got a 4.5 average annual deflation rate over the past 10 years they decreased their share count from 26 million to 16 million and that's of course one of the factors for why they did well on a per share basis but at the end of the day what it comes down to for because they're in equity it's the attractiveness of their ecosystem for customers right so it's not about how many shares they have because you have other ones like ibm that are also rapidly reducing their share count but because their ecosystems unhealthy uh they're not really crewing that value to shares overall and so i think when it comes down to kind of what what is trying to be money the thing that does almost nothing other than just be money is the best money and something that tries to do multiple things including proof of stake as one of the components uh inherently gives it less monetary premium and then just to finish up at the very last point uh when it comes to recovering from 51 attacks so i think the the main point there while granting that say in a non non kind of bug world uh where things are have to approach honestly proof of stake does theoretically have a higher uh cost to attack but when it comes to unwinding that attack the only way to do it is to soft fork and then take people's capital which you know if you phrase it as you're taking the attacker's capital that sounds fine but if you realize that the attacker could be a regulated custodian and that you're taking people's capital that had nothing to do with the attack right so their their coins were captured and then used against the network you're basically then splitting participants right so either way responding to a 51 attack a sustained 51 attack is is a messy proposition well um i'm happy to go through the you know response point by point i guess um so one one of the things that you you've highlighted lin quite a bit is complexity and and bugs now i don't think you know complexity is is necessarily like an evil like complexity is one of the things that the humanity thrives on right that we could be doing calculations on on an abacus we could be doing calculations on a calculator or we could be doing calculations on you know on a computer and you know humanity is very very good at abstracting away complexity now in terms of the complexity of proof of stake it's it is more complex and proof of work granted you know at least 10x you know maybe 100x but it's complexity that at this point in time we have tamed and you know one of the biggest maybe example show examples of this is that we have five different clients that have implemented the the the the protocol um and these are the small teams you know we're talking on the order of five to ten people per team and they've each managed to implement the the consensus now one of the strategies that you can take to mitigate against complexity and bugs is to have client diversity and this is the whole one of the big reasons why we have five clients is that we can enable the community to basically buy insurance against these these bad bugs and another point that you've that you've brought up is the idea of being continuously online which is basically the technical word for that is is weak weak subjectivity and the idea of weak subjectivity is that if you've been offline the way that you sync up is that step number one you get some sort of semi-trusted checkpoint and then you sync from that checkpoint onwards now it turns out that bitcoin has these checkpoints all over the place now here's one example like literally in the bitcoin core software um you know in the c plus code there's like 12 checkpoints and so if the if hypothetically there was an attacker that would you know build from genesis build an alternative chain that completely rewrites history then guess what this chain would not be valid why because the developers have literally put you know subjective checkpoints in the code base where's another place where there are subjective checkpoints well if you've been offline you need to go you know download the the software the bitcoin core software that's like step zero right before syncing and guess what when you're downloading the software you're trusting the code you're trusting the whole supply chain you might be trusting you know github is giving you the right code you might be trusting even your your operating system there's all sorts of places where you're effectively trusting um you know the the the initial checkpoint that also baked into the the software is this idea of boot nodes right the first time you sync um after being offline you need to connect to the peer-to-peer network right and so what what happens in practice is that literally in the code are some hard-coded ip addresses and these and now you go talk to these ip addresses now guess what if all these ip addresses are compromised you're going to be you know disconnected from the real peer-to-peer network you're going to be in this isolated kind of fantasy island and you're going to be downloading and syncing the the the wrong chain and furthermore i think that the bitcoin is thinking that hey we're always you know sing from genesis even if there were not all these issues that i mentioned is kind of fantasy like just imagine hypothetically that there was a reorg of a hundred days right the last hundred days was just completely wiped out do you really think that the bitcoin community would just say okay yeah we're just gonna accept that that's totally normal uh we're just gonna pick the longest chain even though it's wiped out a hundred days of history no of course not what will happen is that there will be social you know governance would would create effectively create a new subjective checkpoint um and then basically pin the the the chain that that was attacked and say this is the canonical one despite not being the the longest one of the other points that you brought up was around the the the last mover right where um if you if you the the last person to come in as a miner you have an advantage and i would argue this is um actually a huge disadvantage for bitcoin so in proof of stake you have perfect fairness you put in one unit of capital and you get the exact same amount of rewards no matter how big no matter how small in proof of work you have various places where the last mover or the big fish have these you know unfair advantages so you mentioned economies of scale if you're a retail miner buying one bitca bit main um mining rig you're going to get absolutely screwed on on the price you're going to be overpaying by by 2x3 x four x five x um your your hardware relative to the professional miners that are buying in bulk you know 100 million dollars at the time another thing that you mentioned is that you know because of because of moore's law you have a last mover advantage and so guess what that means that attackers who want to attack they have an advantage over the rest of the of the of of the network and not only do they have an advantage because they can pick the the latest and most bleeding edge hardware but they actually for them to perform an attack the the price of electricity is to a large extent irrelevant um and the reason is that in in order to perform a 51 attack it suffices to run it for let's say one day or one week and then discourage all the honest miners to just turn everything off um so the 99 of the cost of making an attack is in the rigs and in the transformers and all the electrical infrastructure to run the rigs is not in the actual operation of the miners and the electricity costs um associated and so what what that means is that um as as as a miner you can actually go buy um acquire hardware which is in in literally in the dump so you have um you know professional miners who they need the the price of actually to be let's say under 10 cents now if the price of electricity for them is over well you know it's over it's over 10 cents then they they would let's say get get rid of that hardware it's no longer valuable for them but it is valuable for for an attacker and so you know we can basically the fact that proof of work is inherently unfair is inherently unequal cr actually creates advantages for for for an attacker and then the fact you know one of the things that you you mentioned as well is around um slashing custodians right one of the tools that the community have in the context of proof of stake is that they can slash and slashing a custodian is kind of problematic because you're not really penalizing the custodian you're penalizing the clients behind the custodians and this is why i wanted to emphasize the fact that there's softer tools and slashing one of the tools that you can do is this forced exec ejection you're not there's no penalty there you're just removing them from being consensus participants and that will buy you some amount of time in ethereum it's 200 days that's a parameter you could make that a thousand days or what you could do as well is you could actually freeze the funds you force eject and then you freeze the funds for five years you know that will teach them um or you could do partial slashing you could say you know we'll we'll we'll give you a slap on the wrist this time we'll slash only 10 percent but if you try under attack again will will slash hundred percent and so there's this wide range of tools that the community has to address these more delicate situations but again this is a tool set that is completely unavailable in the context of proof of work so one thing i so i would rephrase the one part in the middle where you describe proof of work as being inherently unfair i would describe that as inherently renewative basically that that every dollar that goes into the space has a set of decisions with it right you're determining what hardware you're going to buy what scale you're going to buy it what stranded energy source or what what cheap energy source you're going to use and a series of decisions goes into determining you know your your success as a miner and then rather than you know say early participants they're then having a permanent advantage right so for example in say a pre-mined system proof-of-stake system those who bought in at the early stage you could say okay they made one good decision but then they have this permanent structural advantage for the rest of time as long as they continue to hold their stake whereas proof of work requires an ongoing series of good decisions in order to maintain your ability to be our participant in the in the network and i think actually when we look out longer term the kind of the direction that we're going i think in in proof of work uh assuming these systems continue to be around for for quite a while is that you'll see you'll see increasing integration between uh miners and the energy producers themselves we already see for example uh early signs of co-location uh where uh you have a you know an energy producer it could be solar could be hydro could be whatever and they have bitcoin miners on site you know they often will contract with a miner to co-locate them but they could easily do it in a vertically integrated model where the way that the grid works and this is something that a lot of of kind of environmental criticisms of proof-of-work don't understand is that the electrical grid naturally has to overproduce electricity right otherwise if we didn't have extra productive capacity then turning on the marginal laptop would cause a brownout right so we have to have this this spare production uh always going into the network and then we have to have a way to drain out excess power that's being produced but not consumed and it's actually this really kind of tricky balancing act and so proof of work systems are actually a really good load balancer where if you if you're you know the type of energy source that is doesn't have full control over your production maybe you're a wind farm maybe you're a hydro dam maybe you're solar or maybe you you have just kind of your nuclear plant that just kind of has like continuous power but maybe the demand is fluctuating uh throughout the day right so it's more more demand at evening less you know less demand other times and so i think over time we're going to see that the cheapest source of electricity is that virtually zero cost stranded energy and the best ones to harness that are the producers or people that contract directly with the producers and go on site and so i think over time that's what basically makes it is as kind of diversified as possible and right now i think you know last i checked the biggest bitcoin mining facility in the world is like one percent of total hash rate it's already kind of a structurally decentralized system and i think it only gets more so as you increasingly incorporate that into uh production and so you know i agree that that say slash you know basically proof of stake systems have multiple ways to deter attackers uh they require governance and at worst case scenario they require confiscation whereas in say a proof of work system you also have a couple ways to require recover the simplest way is to do no changes and more more network more capacity i should say more hash capacity can come online and if there's an existing attacker then those new entrants have an advantage over that existing attacker and you know people can fund that in multiple ways right so for example if you're a large bitcoin holder and bitcoin is currently being 51 attacked you now have an incentive to uh you know bring hash online it might not be a profitable first you're basically making an investment to unlock your bitcoin transactions number two is that there's also potential soft work uh to to you know kind of the nuclear option in say a proof of work system would be to do a soft fork to kill the miners uh and you could you could phase that in over time there's a way to do it gradually and so there are those nuclear options if they end up being needed but the kind of the beauty of the system that it's self-regenerative so one of the things that i'll i'll say on the fairness is that in order to be a profitable miner you need to operate that scale like you can't just be a retail miner with with one rip that does just don't work you need to have and there's like these centralization forces like you have miners for example building their own custom firmware they have their own specialized know-how they know how to take the mining rigs that they receive and just assemble them as quickly as possible so that they can be immediately connected and then there's all sorts of centralization vectors around the supply chain what if the fab what if tsmc or global foundries was to create you know create their own own rig well actually we've seen that right intel right one of the big fabs they're building their own ships what if you just cut the middlemen and you know they that is a huge centralization vector um and you know in in in practice i don't i don't know anyone and you know i'm i've been in this space for for for you know almost a decade i don't know any friend or any anyone any individual who who minds a bitcoin at this point in time it's all industrial uh on the other hand with with proof of stake i think ev everyone on this call you know maybe except you lynn alden are literally mind staking as individuals um we're all contributing like the diversity on proof of stake is much much much larger the barrier to entry is much much much lower you basically just need to have a computer running 24 7 and that that that that's about it and the fairness is just out of the box what happens with with with bitcoin mining is that you have two classes of people you have the the retail who are gonna get absolutely wrecked uh on in terms of of of returns and what's gonna happen is that they they might not even realize that they're getting wrecked and the reason is that you know the price of bitcoin went so high uh that you know in dollar terms they're actually profitable but in bitcoin terms you know they put in 10 bitcoins initial investment and they they got three bitcoins back whereas on the other hand if you're super sophisticated industrial miner you know you can go you know sell hash rate futures you can go buy you know energy futures you're like really well connected to the fabs you might even make your own chip you know making a chip is like at least 10 million dollars you know if we're talking three nanometer chip you know you might be minimum investment is 30 million dollars um the the the barrier to entry is much much much higher to be competitive and like empirically like that's what can be observed today um and then you talked about you know the the two remediations that the community can do one is kind of the the do-nothing approach um and as i mentioned i don't think the do-nothing approach really really works out um because you know the the price of bitcoin will crash it will be difficult for honest miners to be to be to be to be profitable um you know because you know now they have to make a huge a huge like guess not only do they need to not only is the the current hardware need to be turned off and they make no income but you know now we're talking about amplifying the risk and they need to go double the amount of hardware that they have um and now they're basically doubling the risk it just seems completely crazy when you have no income to just grow your your capital by by so much and in terms of the nuclear option well that that's not satisfactory either because you you're just effectively starting from scratch your old um your shot 256 that's completely compromised and now you're starting with some new algorithm but that that here you have you could have an attacker just buy out in terms of capital you know five five billion dollars or whatever it is ten billion dollars of that other thing and completely overwhelmed that that that new form of of proof of work so i'll try to keep my response short just so we don't keep going super back and forth on these without kind of uh you know guidance but one thing i'll point out so it is true that there are supply chain risks with proof of work and that's something that that you know participants have been familiar with in quite a while and it's also you have jurisdictional risk right so for example you know when china banned their mining uh you know a lot of kind of a lot of people were like oh like uh that's bad for bitcoin was actually a lot of bitcoiners are like oh thank god like now we won't have like 60 of the hash rate in china whatever the number is we actually want to see that geographically dispersed as much as possible uh and you know a lot of them welcome uh the entrance of new uh you know participants in terms of making the hardware because you don't want that to be super concentrated either because you can either consolidate power you can put in secret backdoors there are risks associated with the supply chain kind of like how there are risks with hardware wallets associated with the supply chain so there are those real risks with proof of work uh and so it's not the argument that any system is is perfect in every one in every single metric it's it's how it responds overall you know what what are the trade-offs that it's making and you know the the i think the last part i would just jump on is right now for example there are a large number very very small private bitcoin mining companies very small firms now they're still larger than the individual right but they're but they're you know small uh compared to those publicly traded companies because you kind of have two different classes right so you have some companies that are going after you know just economy of scale they're just building a massive facility and then they're buying a lot of energy and then they're operating that way uh and they're actually still tiny in terms of say global companies right so they're not these these mega companies because mining is inherently not that lucrative but they're these they're going for the economy of scale approach then you have the other type that is basically buying older machines and then they're going off grid for the cheaper source of energy right so they're they're going for example when you find uh an oil well and it has a little bit of natural gas with it but it's not enough to build a pipeline for they just burn the natural gas there's nothing else they can do with it so these companies go in and say hey instead of just burning that natural gas how about we just put this little box of bitcoin miners and you you you can um you know use it to generate electricity and mine it there and only small companies can really do that it's only it's something that small teams have to go out and make make deals with these companies and kind of you know arbitrage and so there's there's not just one model of how a bitcoin miner works um so i would phrase it like that but overall i think the key thing to focus on is one versus like normal attacks versus bugs and other things like that and you touched on that with the client diversification where there's different clients but you know one thing worth pointing out is like at least i don't have the numbers in front of me but last i checked the the biggest client is like what like 84 of ethereum clients so you do have some degree of client diversification but it's also partial illusion and these things over time tend towards uh you know basically becoming protocols where once one becomes dominant it's pretty hard to then have true diversification there but i agree that in in theory client diversification is a good thing and helps protect against bugs but you know in practice i think one of the key things that protects against bugs is having the simplest possible code base so complexity can allow us to do a lot of things and you know in a system where you wanted to do a lot of things if you're not trying to be the best possible money if you're trying to be a operating system that you do multiple different things then complexity is a useful thing and that's why i don't for example say that proof-of-stake systems shouldn't exist or the smart contract blockchain shouldn't exist it's whether or not they're capable or if they're suited to acquiring a monetary premium over the long term and that's i think the key thing to focus on on the client on the topic of client diversity we actually have two types of clients and they're very very different we have the execution clients that's basically gaff which is effectively to you know at first approximation is effectively a monopoly let's say hundred percent used use gef gaf and then we have the consensus layer where we have five different clients now we can ask ourselves what is the value of client diversity like one of the the value is to be an insurance against bugs but guess what guess how gaff has been battle tested for years and years and years you know with hundreds of billions of dollars that it's securing and guess what there's not that many bugs left in gef on the other hand when you take you look at the consensus layer which is much much fresher the value of client diversity in these early days is much much higher and right now we do have a client diversity problem you know with prism having roughly 65 but some of the bigger stakers you know have signaled that you know they understand the value of diversity and i'm very optimistic that this is going to improve in the months to come leading to to to the merge another thing that i want to highlight is that if we want to be the internet of money we need to have a time scale on the order of the the internet itself right the internet is here to live on for for decades if not if not centuries and it just so happens that complexity is is something that has a half-life of i don't know maybe like let's say one year right like um it can be tamed it's something that can be hardened we have this idea of the lindy effect right where over time as lots of lots of values being secured by these systems they can be trusted um and maybe different people have you know different risk tolerance but if you look over the long term if you look at fundamentals this is this is noise right the complexity of the system is absolute noise the bugs will be um fixed um the system will will harden and and really what we should be looking at is like these long-term fundamentals and when we project ourselves to long-term fundamentals we bring up topics like like like quantum right it turns out that the the nature of computing is going to change in the next 20 30 30 years and it it so happens that proof of work is going to be completely disrupted by quantum um and so yes there are these you know these short-term things which in the grand scheme of things are just noise but if you zoom out and you really focus on the fundamentals then actually you can see that there's fundamental reasons to be bearish on on on proof of work living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the banks nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're going bankless you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet you can now trade tokens on any decks or aggregators metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across all the defy exchanges allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that i use when i'm out and about which i use to collect po-apps nfts and do all my defy things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out web3 wouldn't be the same without it download menomas for desktop and mobile at metamask.io and load up your trezor ledger lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web3 so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits [Music] set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only debt his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] lindy i think you've kind of taken the lead in the world as like a macro commentator focusing on macro markets and commodity markets and something i've noticed out of the bitcoiner camp is they tend to be focused on commodities uh and just come on the commodity properties of bitcoin and how it kind of relates to the money and you've described bitcoin as something akin to commodity money as related to how it consumes energy of viewing energy as a commodity and how that energy is one of the thing that you know produces bitcoins via proof of work and in my mind this i think is partly a maybe described as like a moral argument as in i think bitcoiners kind of think commodity money is just a better suited money to the world based on just its uh equitableness and fairness uh is would you agree with that description of the general belief from bitcoiners and and why you think if you agree why you think commodity money is just a better property for money to have so i think that i mean there there would be different arguments among them uh and so if we i mean if we look at back in history right so i do approach this mostly from a macro perspective right so for example if you're talking about say different types of proof of state competing with each other which one's going to win you know i would let the phds of computer science work that out when it comes to kind of a macro analyst looking at different blockchains and determining which one has a monetary premium or should have a monitor premium or is secure enough to invest large amounts of capital in i approached it from that that macro perspective uh with you know some degree of obviously technical details along the way as needed to inform that macro perspective and if you look back in history you know essentially what you're giving up if you go from commodity money to stake money is that it goes basically towards governance right so for example in say the the period prior to the early 1900s you had commodity money for the most part and you had layers of stake on top of it but the underlying foundation was commodity money proof of work in the form of gold and then as you shifted towards a purely fiat money you essentially shifted more towards proof of stake and you know as an example of how the federal reserve works right so you know it the cost of producing money has no there's no constraint on how much money you can produce so you have to you have to add artificial constraints to how that's going to function and and how transactions can be processed who can make new you know for lack of better word tokens new units of the system and who gets to participate in the network and so for example most central banks are not really decentralized at all the federal reserve is is you know the most decentralized and it's basically it you know it's basically like a proof-of-stake system but not on a blockchain right so you have the system where you have 12 regional reserve banks each one has you know they're owned by commercial banks right so they they have this kind of special share structure so they they have their representation in that system and it's based on their capital their initial capital their stake in the system then you have uh you know the federal reserve board which is appointed uh by the president confirmed by the senate so that theoretically you know goes downstream to the people because you vote for the politicians and then they appoint and confirm those participants and so you when you look at the say the the federal open market committee you're that you're in that system where you have the seven uh reserve board governors the ones that were appointed by the government and then you have this rotating member of five of the 12 uh uh presidents of those banks right so you have this kind of hodgepodge uh mix of federally appointed and bank appointed officials determining what what the policy is going to be for that network and that's you know generally over time that tends towards centralization because as debt builds up and as the system starts to break down they increasingly get captured by the government system because they have to monetize debts and they have to basically bail out the system and provide liquidity uh when no one else is providing liquidity and so basically with the invention of bitcoin you have kind of the reintroduction of commodity money and it kind of allows that system to potentially reset over the long term and allow people to opt into a different system and so those those systems can continue to exist side by side i expect that they will for a very long period of time where you have that more existing stake system and then you have introduction of basically a kind of a lack of a better word digital gold and then of course with that you know as people innovate they come along and say hey we can also if we have digitally native commodities we can also come along and have essentially digital native equities and so we're still kind of exploring the total adjustable market of what all these things are going to be and what their different use cases are going to be for and i think the one thing i would just point out is that the more that any given system tries to do usually not not necessarily all the time but usually the worse it's going to be at any one of those things and and so one one example is that as say ethereum has tried to somewhat hardest monetary policy it's also you know arguably lost market share in d5 so for example you know in in late 2020 ethereum had something like 97 percent of total value locked market share as we speak now it's down to 55 percent so you have all these different basically ecosystems than competing on fees on usability on network effects things like that so you have kind of you know ethereum obviously has the largest network effect uh the most lindy of all of them then you have these other ones coming in often with increased complexity often already proof stake from the beginning uh and they're doing their own thing and we're seeing this kind of diversification over time whereas so far bitcoin doesn't really have competition from other systems you know we had these kind of brief periods of competition you have like a meme of doge for a period of time you have temporarily bitcoin cash is relevant and these fade over time and so you have these kind of two different worlds and so i think one of them is based more on governance and making your ecosystem as attractive as possible and the other one comes down to which one is the hardest and essentially what is what is the one that is is basically the best at being money oh i definitely want to throw that to justin but just a quick follow-up lin uh i think baked into that argument is kind of um or or maybe i'm just pulling this again from from other bitcoiners who make these make similar arguments is that the nature of how kind of like proof-of-stake represents the fiat system and proof of work represents like you know the commodity money like gold on which the proof-of-stake system rests on top of i think is some sort of like a subjective argument about uh people of the world will like this system more that like the proof of work system more because it feels more fair versus or how much how much of this do you think is actually like a technical objective argument of this is objectively a better system or how much do you think this is a subjective argument of people think that this system is more equitable and more fair to them so therefore they're going to choose this new proof-of-work commodity money system so i think i mean it's a good question right so i think you would get different answers depending on on which person you talk to i think that there are some that would make the you know the kind of the fairness argument i i personally approach it more from a tactical risk perspective um and so i i view what is the what is the system that is less likely to have tail risks what is the system that is optimized for what it's trying to do and you know kind of the whole like you know ethereum maxi versus bitcoin maxi versus multi-coin to all that debate you know i approach this as someone who i own dozens of different stocks i mean i'm happy with diversification i'm happy with going out to different systems and going out to distribute my capital in a diversified way and the only challenge is that in in this particular ecosystem it's inherently very speculative right so we're still in some ways early stage in many of these things and so you basically have one that looks the most lindy 13 years of operating history very simple proof of work and then you have these kind of a large number of kind of vc type of investments and they're rapidly innovating competing on capturing that market share and so you know when it comes to the fairness argument i think partially that that's gets mixed up in a bunch of different things so one is the proof of work and one is like the scarcity of the tokens right so basically in the current system as designed now the argument is the continent effect so the closer you are to the money printer for lack of a better word the more advantage you are and a tangible example of that is say during covet corporations large corporations that are able to issue public equities debt i mean public debt so public securities able to issue debt they had no problem getting finance whereas if you were a small business relying on bank loans and things like that you were far less able to get access to that liquidity when you needed it the most and then the fed came in and exacerbated it because even when the corporate sector kind of freezed up that's when they said okay we're gonna start buying corporate bonds to help uh liquefy that system and you didn't get to reliquify the lending market until later right so you had kind of these you know restaurant you know small restaurant would close whereas large restaurant chains for example had had better access to capital and so that's an example of how the kind of current system is kind of designed to you know advantage those who have that scale or that direct access to public markets and i think i would separate that from uh you know the idea of proof of work versus proof of stake in the technical sense i i like to think i like to look at things from from from a technical perspective and so these these labels equity and commodity you know i'm i'm trying to to define them and understand what they mean like for me you know equity there's kind of two aspects to it one is that you're kind of financially exposed to some sort of upside for some sort of project and i think all blockchains have this any blockchain with a token including bitcoin including ethereum are you know exposed financially to some sort of upside you know in terms of adoption in terms of their block space being more valuable uh in terms of the token being used as as a store value as the money et cetera et cetera um and then there's the other aspect of the equity definition is the voting aspect and i would argue that there's there's no distinction there either you know both btc tokens and eve tokens are non-voting equity tokens um and so you know i've this goes back to the the second kind of label that that you that you're talking about which is commodity and i think really what you mean by commodity is the non-voting aspect well guess what they're both commodities in that sense they're both non-voting um and you know we we we've been talking about you know consensus participants you know exercising some form of governance you know by basically doing 51 attacks that is kind of the the the extreme scenario but like in the in the default situation it has nothing to do with with a company with a board of directors and the ceo and all of these things by default the governance is exactly the same for bitcoin and ethereum which is namely governance by rough consensus of chain through the community right this is how tap root went through this is how segwit went through it there's lots of debate lots of discussion very chaotic and organic and then ultimately the way that these you know these governance decisions are enacted is through users you know installing software and and and agreeing that this is the canonical piece of piece of software the whereas on the other hand if you look at the other companies completely that's just not the case by default you've you've enshrined governance powers that are just exercised on on a day-to-day basis whereas with consensus participants there is no day-to-day exercise of governance powers unless maybe you're in this kind of special type of blockchain like tezos polkadot or dfinity where you have on-chain um token voting now one of the things that i think david said is you know around like the objectivity of of of of of of labeling things and i think um you know i think memes play a huge role here um when we want to look at a monetary premium and it's it's kind of interesting because proof of work and proof of stake from a meme perspective are almost the exact opposite now let me elaborate with proof of stake you have what i call a scarcity engine proof of stake is a mechanism to turn liquid if into this frozen if which is used as collateral right now we have roughly you know 10.5 million eve which is staked but my my projections basically say that we're going to have roughly half of the whole supply of eve being staked eventually so on the one hand we have the scarcity engine for proof-of-work it's the exact opposite in the sense that issuance and transaction fees which is basically the income that miners have to a very large extent needs to be sold to cover for expenses to cover for electricity to cover for the hardware and so basically what you've created here is a liquidity engine where you're adding liquidity to the market by being a forcing function to sell this issuance and to sell these transaction fees and so you know if you were to ask yourself which is the best system to create money for the internet is it the one that's like constantly market dumping or is it the one that's encouraging people to hold the their token i think it's pretty obvious which one is is is more valuable for from a meme perspective to push forward this idea of being the internet of the money for the internet i want to get um lynn back on kind of that that last last comment of her yeah her reply and sort of the meme aspect of this of this money and i think you were talking about like deflationary supply maybe justin or just kind of you know lower supply um and greater issuance and a proof of work system but but it strikes me that the distinction that you're making as i'm i'm going through this is it seems to be the case lynn that that you're saying um you know proof of stake is the thing that really moves the asset from a commodity to an equity generally and you're taking like like historical reasons for why that's the case and i think justin you are saying it's not proof of stake it's actually governance control that moves the thing closer to an equity versus a commodity and if that's the case i i want to get you know your thoughts on that lin so um if if justin indeed is saying that it's more about governance control and less about proof of stake as a consensus model would you agree with that because i i think i and i want to think maybe clarify this justin that i don't think you are uh saying all proof-of-stake systems uh have like are more commodity-like than equity-like you were saying like tezos and other you know systems that ret retain governance control at the token layer are maybe more equity-like using lin's definition but let's get lynn's thoughts on that first what do you think do you think this maybe hinges upon governance control rather than maybe proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work i think proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake is one aspect of governance control and so you know as we touched on earlier there are multiple different models but you know at the minimum what a proof stake system gives is that the more of the the units that you hold the more say you have over what transactions are valid you don't get to necessarily change the other rules of the system but you get this you get a st you get to say what transactions are processed which ones are censored and so forth so there's that the other aspect is really who gets to change the protocol and how and when and so for example and that that's that's the part that goes outside of the proof of workforce proof-of-stake debate because you can have proof-of-work systems that then start to look more equity-like an example would be you know he mentioned the the the segwit and taproot updates both of those were opt-in so they were soft forks meaning that you know and i think this also ties into the the meme idea so so what makes a better marketing message essentially so obviously bitcoin and ethereum and other systems come at it from uh you know different you know marketing perspectives where kind of the the meme of bitcoin is self-sovereignty so you run your own node nodes are small uh you know it doesn't take a lot of resources to run a node even 10 years from now it shouldn't take a lot of resources to run a full node and have the whole blockchain and that any updates that occur you can choose to opt into or you can retain your your uh you know your your existing node and of course the smaller it is the the more audible it is uh that the less trust there is there is always some degree of trust unless you go line by line about how that system works but the smaller and more compact you make it and by making all updates opt in you basically maximize to the extent possible that self-sovereignty whereas if you for example put in difficulty bombs you then say okay so you know it doesn't really matter what you think because the developers are going in a certain direction and you don't really get to opt in you know you're existing what you have there is going to die if you just leave it like that and that becomes a matter of marketing so theorem says okay well that's that's a trade-off we're willing to make for now but we're going to focus on the fact that our system's changing that our that our system is you know has a say a longer term time frame we want to you know you know we're less focused on ossification now or focus more on change on kind of having a system we want in the future um and so there are obviously different marketing messages for different systems and then you have some of the you know the quote-unquote ethereum killers or competitors come in and their marketing message is hey ethereum is super expensive to use uh it doesn't scale well uh and you know it's mostly for the rich whales to you know play around in we want to have low transaction fees so you know there's all this there's different marketing messages for different systems um i would separate that from meme in the sense that you know i think i think beams are useful for for marketing ideas uh that they're just uh that's obviously that the whole point is they spread very quickly you can you can contain quite a bit information in an analogy or a picture with a couple words on it that people already know that what the picture's from that's a way of spreading information but it needs substance behind it so something is only memes if it's like dogecoin where it's just it's built on memes the staying power is not going to be great whereas if something isn't you know the technology's there it's doing what is advertising that it's doing then it becomes you know marketing can spread the message faster uh than others but the underlying foundation is still there for it to have staying power justin i'll let you uh respond to that but um lynn at the beginning of what you uh of your statements you were talking about how uh the unit uh is the thing that gets to say the transactions are valid like ether the unit is the thing that approves or declines transactions and that is governance in of itself because it's baked into the asset itself bitcoin has one of the mental models that we we talked about in the ethereum land is like ether is like this virtual asic right it takes the properties of the asic and it imbues it into the asset itself and i think what you're saying is that that represents some sort of governance but then doesn't that by in by the same rule also apply governance to the physical asics and what what does the separation of the asic from btc how does that meaningfully change governance and doesn't that just mean that the uh mining facilities then just have the same governance powers that you uh alluded to token holders having so historically one of the big challenges of say wealth concentration uh is that wealth begets more wealth because as you get more wealth you can influence say laws to further support your wealth uh and you can you know basically just have that virtuous cycle of more and more wealth and so one of the difference between a proof of stake system and a proof of work system is in a proof of stake system if you acquire stake in the system and then that that you know inherently provides income from itself you've essentially acquired a permanent stake in the system for as chooses you want to hold it with no ongoing input costs to retain your control of the system it kind of over time inherently collects it here it consolidates into more and more you know fewer owners holding larger and larger shares of it whereas in a proof of work system you're essentially renting your ability to govern the system and again only with transaction ordering right so you're you're you're putting in capital and you're buying machines that will degrade uh your your energy source could over time become less efficient so your facilities that you set up uh the energy sources that you're arbitraging could change could could dry up could could become less efficient and the hardware itself uh becomes less cutting edge over time and so your decision to actively maintain your your control that network or at least the control of the transaction ordering is required on continually recycling your capital into the system so it's a constant series of decisions rather than kind of the system that inherently benefits people that bought in first and hold it forever and so in something like a a proof-of-work system you know obviously the early token buyers get more money right so if you if you buy early and huddle it that's great for price appreciation and you can over time influence price by buying more um but you can and you know no matter how much say bitcoin michael saylor has he has zero control over what transactions are going to be processed and so i would say that you know but that's again only one aspect of it so even though this this particular bait is say proof of work versus proof of stake rather than bitcoin versus ethereum or you know simple money versus smart contract money whatever the case may be but there's it's kind of one piece i think of the puzzle which is if you're going to have something that's commodity-like what you have is some degree of immutability you're never going to have as much immutability in the digital realm as in the atomic realm right so just atoms of gold or atoms of copper but if you're going to approximate as much as possible what you're designing is a system that is you know very decentralized very hard to force changes on and that you know if anything there are either no changes or there are opt-in changes uh whereas anything that that deviates from that model and requires either you know ongoing kind of forced buy-in from say a small team of developers or kind of small development hubs right so most of the proof-of-stake systems have these foundations or these kind of companies associated with it that this kind of named this name the same thing as the tokens named so you have this these kind of these hubs you know they could be one hub there could be two or three hubs depending on the protocol um and those are kind of inherently more equity like even if they're proof of work so even if they are proof of work but difficulty bombs or proof of work but super large blocks so that you know people can't run their own node there are multiple kind of ways you can then shift and to be looking more like an equity system meaning that there are quote unquote managers of that system rather than an unmanaged mostly unmanaged system i i want to just uh i think uh unpack that and define that again just for for the listeners and summarize i think what you said is that you know because the uh the asic is separated from the unit it requires in order to have similar levels of power over the system it requires further investment in addition always always always more and more and more investment into the future which uh bears risk and i think a lot of bitcoiners really like that risk aspect when it comes to investing in proof-of-work facilities because it doesn't guarantee you anything uh and and i think that's a a property of bitcoin proof of work that i think bitcoiners really really enjoy but i i just want to um ask the ask the question doesn't that argument rely on the fact that returns on capital are [Music] less significant in proof of work than they are in proof of stake well i think so historically with commodity monies the producers rarely have much control now it it so there are commodities for example that have very very low stock to flow ratios like say oil where producers can get together and have a lot of control over the system whereas something like gold where most of the gold is already out there so so gold miners have virtually no control over the system and that so far has been true in the in the bitcoin ecosystem where you know the power is not really residing in the miners and we've seen that for example with the whole kind of um uh you know kind of uh block size wars where there's a period of time where the majority of miners were favoring the the block increase and they still couldn't get that through uh on that network uh they basically you had kind of the node rejection and so i think part of what maintains a commodity system is i mean a decentralized system is that combination of kind of division of powers where you have this the super small node where you can just run a node and you become you know all the memes self-sovereign all that then you have uh uh you know uh uh separately from that you have the the mining uh and so you can rent you can put capital and risk the ability uh you know to potentially give you a temporary period where you get to you get to essentially vote in terms of what transactions are going to go through but it doesn't it doesn't give any sort of permanent allocation uh compared to you know just holding tokens and then that gives it gives you a long-term uh you know kind of permanent ability to to order all future transactions forever one of the points that was brought up is uh this idea of the rich gets richer in the context of proof of stake now i see this as as as kind of not completely the truth i the way i see it is wealth preservation the rich stay as rich as they were and the reason is that when you're staking you have to pay for something and namely what you're paying for is opportunity cost and it turns out that in an open market you know the apr is just going to tend towards the opportunity cost so you might be paying three percent opportunity cost by placing your eve in this black box and you can't touch it you can't do d5 and all this good stuff um so that's what you're paying and then you're getting compensated and so net you're basically just wealth doing world preservation the other point that you're that you do that you put forward is basically trying to distinguish bitcoin like proof of work to proof of stake because there's this risk well it turns out that professional miners they will they will hedge this risk and then what they're interested in is the exact same thing as eve holders they're interested in a btc denominated return which will roughly match their opportunity cost you know that might be whatever five percent now how do you lock in as a professional miner like five percent well you use financial products what you do is you you look at your uncertainties what is uncertain the price of electricity is uncertain well guess what you can just go buy electricity futures and what what else is uncertain well the hash rate is uncertain well guess what you can go sell hash rate futures and ta-da like you've you've locked in your five percent profit on your btc and now it's just a matter of executing it over four years and so these large professional miners they're very much risk-averse um and they're not going to take the crazy risk you know with hundreds of millions of dollars at a play no what they want is a essentially risk minimized return on your on your bitcoin which roughly matches the opportunity cost you know if you have an efficient market then that's what it's going to tend towards and so really you know there's this kind of distinction that doesn't really exist and you know one of the sayings that we have in in this space is that proof-of-work is just proof-of-step a proof-of-stake with extra steps and really the risk that is being introduced can be removed with financial products and at the end of the day you're kind of walking back all the differences and you can have essentially the same financial product with the same kinds of risks and the same kinds of returns guys this has been a fantastic conversation and i from my perspective and i bet a lot of bankless listeners will agree this has probably been the best proof of stake versus proof of work conversation history that's ever been put out on crypto so we appreciate um both of you for having this very collegial conversation for for arguing points and for bringing a lot of rationality to what is otherwise a somewhat tribal and irrational conversation so we appreciate both but is now closing argument time so just have a final question for both of you um i'll start with uh i'll start with uh justin since lin started uh with uh with her with her part first um so i want to ask you this question justin why is proof of stake the best way to create a crypto money summarize it for us right so when we want to build the money like the thing that we want to try and achieve is monetary premium now it turns out that in the context of monetary premium it's like a you have this competitive landscape right maybe bitcoin and gold are competing for monetary premium and it it turns out that the reason why you have this competition is because you need society to kind of come to consensus on one particular asset to endow it with this kind of magic economic energy which is monetary premium and so what we need is a shelling point a coordination point to focus our attention on one particular asset and so really what we want to ask ourselves is which of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake distinguishes itself makes basically stands out relative to to the crowd if it was only proof of stake in isolation in a vacuum that could that could work fine for monetary premium if it was just proof of work that could also work fine as the internet of value but it turns out that we have this this competition and so we need to start comparing them and there's there's various ways in which we can compare them we can compare them in terms of economic security this is one of the things that's most mind-boggling for proof-of-stake and i haven't really made it explicit so let me try and make it explicit for every unit of economic and um security so for example for every hundred dollars of economic security the consensus needs to pay for that and how does it pay for that it pays for it in the in with issuance and transaction fees and that's about five dollars per year right because that's the ap apr that you give to your stickers now if you look at uh proof of work the maintenance cost of a hundred dollars of economic security is roughly a hundred dollars every single year so the the cost is much much higher of roughly 20 20 x higher and so that kind of means uh several things but one of them it means that for much much lower issuance you can have a much much higher economic security and we're already seeing this the beacon chain has 32 billion dollars of economic security that's just the market cap of all the e-states and if you look at bitcoin we have about 10 billion dollars of economic security and this is using like very very fresh numbers it's using numbers from the the grid purchase from intel um and if you want if you want the detail i can give it to you but basically it comes out you know on the order of fifty dollars per per tera hash second and there's about 200 million tera hash per second and so you get a roughly an economic security of of of 10 bit 10 billion the other thing that it unlocks for you is the possibility for a decreasing supply and this goes back to the meme like the the fact that you have a 20x improvement in economic efficiency means that you don't need so much insurance and so there is a possibility for transaction fees when they're burnt to be greater than the issuance and that again is a distinguishing factor it's a distinguishing factor because from a scarcity standpoint we can build systems which are better with proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work and then you want to look at the non-qualitative the non-quantitative aspect instead the qualitative aspects and here for security the really really big one is that we're empowering the community the social consensus to do its job to act as a backstop in case the consensus participants abuse their power which has never happened in in the history of ethereum or really in blockchains but could happen in theory and if it was if such an edge case were to happen in the context of bitcoin it is my belief that the community doesn't have this backstop power and so to summarize really i think that proof of a proof-of-stake system can really stand out because it has much much bigger security both from a quantitative standpoint and the qualitative standpoint and then that unlocks memes that are backed by fundamentals these are real memes in the sense that they spread virally and they're very dense but they're also backed by real fundamentals uh behind them lynn closing arguments on your side why is proof of work the best way to create a crypto money from your perspective so historically when we look at things that acquire monetary premium it's the things that are the hardest the things that are the the most immutable the thing that you know technology cannot come in and find a better one or cannot increase the supply of and so with essentially what you want is something a commodity or an asset that is vast majority of its value is the monetary premium and very little of it is the utility premium and that's an example with say gold where the vast majority of it is held for its its monetary premium and very little of it is used in industry as you know percentage of its value compared to something like oil that is you know entirely for its its utility value and you have things like silver that are somewhere in the middle and so if you were to go about say designing a blockchain system and he wanted to maximize its monetary properties you would make one that you know that the almost the entire purpose of it is to be money where you would sacrifice everything else in order to make the best possible money and so for example if i you know want to make the best possible fork it would just be a fork it wouldn't be a fork and a spoon and a knife combined together because that that instrument is going to be worse at all three of those things than the three separate things are at their own field right so uh basically the perfect you know the quote the close thing we're gonna go to perfect money is something that is extraordinarily as simple as possible and and you know he talked before about um you know how complexity works itself out over time right so that complexity is kind of a short-term thing but then it becomes less relevant as we look out in the future i would say that history shows that's not really the case and so for example you know up until like literally three years ago the u.s air force used eight inch floppy disks as part of their nuclear code launch process right they had mainframes uh and they had floppy disks and that sounds hilarious right it sounds like they have to upgrade but it's actually the whole point is they keep it they kept it extremely simple as possible they updated very slowly they wanted to disconnect it from everything else because when it comes to the the you know the software that manages the nuclear system you want it to be absolutely rock solid you wanted to do nothing else other than not have bugs you want it to work when you want it to work you don't want to accidentally work when you don't want it to work and you see that with bank software you see that with like you know that the most extremely secure things purposely change at over the over very slowly over decades because you know any new complexity as risks even though you know we're we're increasingly capable of handling complexity when it comes to the absolute most uh critical things we move very slowly and keep things as simple as possible and we don't combine it with other things and so when it comes to say a money that is suitable to you know put your corporate treasury in or that you're gonna you're gonna allocate part of your endowment into or that as an individual you might want to hold 10 or more of your net worth in or you know if these things get big enough if you're a sovereign wealth fund or if you're a you know if you're if you're managing the the sovereign reserves your country representing decades of accumulated trade surpluses what asset do you put that in and so historically the best one's been gold and so now we have this this you know potentially these new competitors that can come in and do it and what would you select you'd select one that is the most decentralized the most immutable the one that doesn't sacrifice any of those characteristics to do other things now it doesn't mean that that other systems couldn't be valuable as well right so just because gold has value doesn't mean tesla stock does not have value uh they're they're just two totally different things doing different things and the last thing i want is like some sort of weird merger of like gold and tesla stock right so it's like i don't want them to compete in that realm and so i would say that the reason that proof of work makes for the ideal money is that it's the simplest system it's the most resistant in the sense that it's like you know it's non-volatile memory rather than volatile memory doesn't have to be continuously online it's it's kind of self-verifiable self-correcting uh and requires the least amount of of governance and then when you combine that that's even that's not enough you have to combine that with something like small nodes and various other measures uh that help ensure uh immutability and even then you can never be sure it's all about you know basically aligning the probabilities because there's more ways to fail there's more ways to accidentally become centralized and bloated and buggy than it is to preserve decentralization and to minimize the chance of bugs or security flaws and things like that and so i would say that the perfect money is willing to sacrifice just about everything else in order to have the perfect attributes of money uh where its main purpose is to be held and occasionally transacted with uh compared to uh you know something that is trying to be a swiss army knife and to do multiple things while also being money so that that's how i would i kind of view this whole ecosystem and that's why i separate you know assets that are trying to be money versus assets that are trying to be operating systems essentially what a fantastic conversation i want to once again thank you lynn alden and justin drake for joining us and having just uh the best debate i've ever heard the best conversation i've ever heard about proof of work versus proof of stake thank you so much thank you and also a special thanks to lynn alden because i know bankless definitely leans ethereum pretty heavily so coming into what other people might perceive as uh the away team i i appreciate that as well someone once called david an eth maximalist i think so thank you lynn we definitely appreciate you um action items for you today wow uh bankless listeners what what can i say i mean first thing you gotta do is just like stop what you're doing and go listen to that episode again i think it was that good and there's so many takeaways that's what i'm going to do as soon as we get this edited and downloaded also of course lynn alden has her proof of stake article which we referenced in this episode we'll include a link to that in the show notes uh justin drake rattled off some numbers at the end on eth versus bitcoin economic security we'll get those numbers for you in the show notes as well risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been financial advice i don't even know if it's consensus algorithm advice uh but we definitely know crypto is risky defy is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is
