[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and today on this episode of our zuzalu series we are exploring some New Frontiers New Frontiers and new technologies all of which are poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything by the operating system that Society is currently running today we are exploring the frontier of life does it have to end is there a technical reason as to why we can't live forever and if we do figure out how to live forever should we what does living forever even mean how does that look what kind of ethical considerations are there the longevity discussion was front and center at Zoo's ALU there's a Dao called Vida Dao which is a community-owned collective dedicated to funding and and advancing longevity science that organize in an entire weeks-long worth of talks and panels and workshops which included speakers like Aubrey DeGray who's like the vitalik of longevity research the conversation of longevity definitely evokes some natural reflexes in people but in different directions some people get triggered by the thought of the pursuit of longevity where the idea of living forever just seems unnatural and offensive to some and they immediately reject the idea outright some argue that it's immoral others argue that it's impossible everyone seems to have an opinion on longevity like immediately one thing I noticed at zoosalu is that there are different tribes that emerge out of the Health and Longevity space there is the Health and Wellness Group which would be characterized as the morning exercisers the cold plungers those who refrain from drugs or alcohol who did the occasional fast and overall attempted to live as healthy of a life as possible in the two months that we had at zalu and then there's the longevity tribe who are closer closer to like crypto nerds who really like geek out on research and Science and they're all in the pursuit of the longevity pill the Silver Bullet intervention that humans need so that we can live forever the sciency research Innovation side of things and interestingly these two groups were like really far apart the overlap between the Health and Wellness Group and the longevity group was not that great and as a member of the health and wellness tribe we often joked that the longevity tribe are just taking the Gambit of ignoring Health and Wellness in the pursuit of trying to find the silver bullet while living a fun and more unrestricted Life along the way anyways one important note about the pursuit of longevity is that there are two conversations here one is slowing down aging and the second is accelerating Rejuvenation the deceleration of Aging can bias time and there's a lot of effort and research going into this and it's pretty simple exercise good food sunlight friends and family not looking at screens Etc but the magic really happens with the acceleration of Rejuvenation this is longevity this is the secret sauce that's going to get us from living to 150 years to 1 500 years or longer and if the idea of living beyond 200 years just makes you feel icky I get it it's a weird thing to wrap your head around the first interview in this episode in this longevity series is with Patrick Linden who wrote a book called the case against death which flippantly describes why death is bad and life is good he addresses some of these socio-cultural reactions to the pursuit of longevity and I think it's just an appropriate place to start for people who are not yet bought into the idea that longevity is inherently a noble Pursuit after our interview with Patrick we'll talk with Sergio Ruiz who is working in the field of epigenetic reprogramming AKA reprogramming the way our DNA is expressed and specifically reprogramming it to go backwards to a more youthful state which is apparently a thing you can do over and over and over again and is currently the most promising area of research in the whole pursuit of longevity thing and then lastly we'll follow up with Michael Greer who is the founder of an app called Humanity which uses a combination of big data and AI models to produce a longevity score and it's an app that I was using throughout my time at zuzalu in order to expand extend my house ban as long as possible a goal that I've always been trying to pursue but sometimes crypto gets in the way like I said in the intro longevity had a front and center focus at zuzalu although not everyone was bought into it the growth of the longevity industry is constrained by Nathan nation state regulations it's hard to do research when things like the FTA just get in the way of all viable experiments which is why they longevity people and the networks date people mingled so well together the Network State people want to provide the longevity people a place to do legal longevity research I understand that the idea of human experiments in the pursuit of living forever is kind of a bad look but first it's not as bad as it sounds it's not this like weird mad scientist experiments playing around with human DNA it's just that the FDA has such an immensely High bar that most human studies just can't get over it Additionally the downstream effects of discovering new treatments and interventions are immense part of the pursuit of longevity naturally comes with the elimination of many many diseases that both kill millions and cost trillions the successful pursuit of longevity can free up an entire healthcare industry of ineffective practices and expensive interventions and unlock trillions upon trillions of yearly GDP all while massively reducing suffering along the way so even if the thought of living forever does make you feel icky the second order effects of finding ways to be healthier for on for longer will unlock so many new doors for so many new humans so that is my Preamble for this longevity conversation I think y'all are going to learn

Linden has a hot take for the world Patrick what's your hot take it's very simple that life is good and death is bad how dare you well we should do all we can to avoid death basically it's my idea why have you gotten and the story here is that uh explaining this that that death is bad there's well there's more to this story but yeah Society uh pushes back on this frequently so maybe we can unpack this a little bit more like why is this a hot take and and why do you get resistance for this well there are two groups of people so so one group will say what's your next book called kitten so cute Pizza is delicious that is they take it as an obvious fact that that death is bad but not only death but also the slow death aging of course uh is bad right and then there's the other group of people who say you can't think like that deaths and aging is part of what it means to be human and it's not something we should resist per se as at least not do all we can but rather learn to accept in a kind of gracious way and you know they have various ways of saying that they say that you shouldn't try to add years to your life but you should try to add life to your years and so on so they will say sure it's okay to be interested in in the quality of life that we have but to extend it it's not something we should be doing and that's it seems like it's a majority view in fact I don't know have you talked to people about this yourself and what what attitudes do you get yeah I think just a lot of people aren't ready to put themselves into the mindset that um that human the human project is one of seeking life and that's a novel like area for people to consider and so when we say like life is good like you said like many people are like yeah but then when we start unpacking what that means like oh no life always life forever so when you say like life is good death is bad is this synonymous with the pursuit of immortality is is this kind of the on the same track here absolutely absolutely so I don't personally think immortality is the right word because immortality logically means that you're unable to die and that would be very dangerous proposition because what could happen if you actually couldn't die you could have an accident and be buried in in a house and then millions of years later you find yourself buried hundreds of feet down in the soil right unable to unable to move right perhaps in pain but also unable to die so we're not talking about like Supernatural Powers we're not talking about super men we're talking about simply the lack of aging and the lack of uh biological processes that cause us to die well so what I object to then is the fact that we are forced to die before we want to die so it's a little bit about essentially about expanding human Freedom as I see it so I find it a prison really for us that we have this set limit that we we just can't break break through so far right we're trying to um and so what I want is indefinite life extension so there's no definite time that nature ordains you now you die but if you run out of interest in life uh or Prospect in life Etc and you think oh for some some reason you're very unfortunate circumstances and so on life can be an exit right but of course I also hope that I will never be in such that circumstances so in effect I want this indefinite completely open road I want and every good person I want to have this possibility of a completely open road you have no idea when it's going to end but it's going to keep going as long as you want with some luck I mean there are accidents out there Etc right I think I think it's very good when you talk about supernatural because I think immortality in some sense belongs to the Supernatural and not the natural world I mean even when we talk about immortal jellyfish for example or other Immortal creatures uh so-called Immortal creatures they're not Immortal at all right they just you can say they're contingently Immortal that is their Immortal as long as nobody steps on them right well you know a motorboat drives through it or something like that it will keep going because aging is not going to kill it right but of course this issue is is so tied up with aging because aging is that which kills the most people and and is that which means that no matter what you do and how lucky you are the Grim Reaper is going to get you right yeah so I think there's two boundaries on this argument that um living forever is good that that life is good one boundary is like we said like well we always want the option to be able to die that is an option that we would like to retain and so we don't want the curse of watching the machinations of the universe pass by us for thousands and thousands of years while we watch our families and loved ones come and go and we are just this being that exists in this space-time Continuum at some unknown where time just becomes weird like we don't want that that's not what we want similarly um with the one that we haven't talked about yet um and I can't remember the name of this like I think Greek Fable or something uh but this one man goes up to a God and and asks for uh the ability to live forever and he's granted that wish yeah but what he forgets to ask for as well is for health and so he does live forever but he slowly he continues to age and he slowly gets more feeble and like just I don't know the full story but turns to dust so like there's two guard rails that we want to split between uh and that when we say life is good we mean to stick between these two things we want to be able to live forever while having the op and while like being hit by a car will still kill you but also we don't want to be decrepit forever we want uh we want our health and our our Rejuvenation to be very very strong and this is like the needle that we want to thread as a species correct yeah exactly so in reality uh the longevity will come as an effect of the health and everyone who works in this area see Health as being the means to longevity it's It's Not Mere survival that anyone is interested in well I am interested in mere survival survival but having a uh the the the quality of your life being what also causes the quantity is is the ideal we're looking for here absolutely and that's something that when you argue these ideas and when you look at surveys that has been done uh people in general become more sympathetic to this longevity project once uh it's explained to them that they will have a good health with it right then then the interest shoots up but it's it's people have a very hard time wrapping their mind around it it's as if they they have a vision of what it is like to be 80 or 90 and especially when they're young and far away from it that is incredibly pessimistic right so uh when you ask just the ordinary general public uh or if I did this in my my class so I taught the class at NYU for many years called deaf longevity and values and each a semester I started with a survey of people's or the the the students attitudes to death and Longevity and I asked a question that was it was clearly clearly specified that they would be in good health I asked the question how long they wanted to ideally live and I got an average of 90. and this is even when I explained to them you're gonna be in in indecent health and so on and still you got like a spectrum between you know 70 and and the hundred after 100 it's as if they could not fathom the idea that you could be 100 plus and still in good health of course now we see it's one of the the biggest growing demographics in this world the fastest growing demographic it's a tiny demographic but it's fast it's growing very rapidly now the 100 plus right and the 90 plus and 80 plus right what would your answer be well my answer is uh I can't give a number it would be ridiculous to give a number I don't know what my life is going to be when I'm 200. or 1000 right or five thousand if I say 200 would be enough what happens on my 200th uh uh birthday I'm sure I I have tennis scheduled for next week I'm sure I have some book I haven't finished a project I haven't done you know and and or or I may just want to say well it would be terrible for me not to be able to just watch the sky uh I think people are um I think the mindset that we would have uh would obviously adapt itself and I'm talking here about longevity through science through Health right which means that it's not something where you would be the only one in the situation but you would have many people choosing to live 200 or a thousand or five thousand years right uh and none of them I think have a good reason to say I mean we're completely arbitrary to sit and guess and in 2020 23 to Guess that I'd rather be dead the day after my my 200th birthday right I mean it's ridiculous right so so it just show you the immaturity of this subject matter in the public discussion that even the most basic fallacies when it comes to thinking of that are underexplored and so that's why I wrote my book and my book the case against this in order to expose all the fallacious reasoning around this topic that is just uh uh so underdeveloped right yeah so I think people when they wake up every single morning they don't really ask themselves this but like if for the thought experiment you can wake up in the morning be like do you want to die today and the answer is probably going to be no and then you can ask yourself again that same question the next day and the answer is going to be no and what you're saying is like well you can repeat that process up until you're 90. and then you're going to wake up at 90 with this um all this health span technology and all of this longevity technology and all this improved Health uh uh environment that we can create from ourselves that technology is going to create for ourselves and at 90 you're going to wake up and be like no I'm I'm ready to go to 91 plus one day and that's and so it's not really about I think when you ask the the question I was like uh to what age uh do you want to live to people are assuming this like Decay function in their life that is a fallacy that you're saying like don't assume the Decay function we're trying to eliminate the Decay function and so estimate your lifespan once we eliminate this s Decay function exactly but even when you explicitly postulate that we're not going to have as you put it the Decay function people still say 90 90 right yeah well because they're stuck in that mindset right it's like Stockholm syndrome and they're like stuck in this world where like yeah we we live to 100 and then it's a yeah it's interesting when you say stock called um syndrome so if if not all listeners aware what that is it's basically what it comes from a kidnapping case in Stockholm in Sweden actually and uh it was um the kidnap victim started identifying with her uh captors right and so the idea here is that we are captive to aging and death so since we can't do we can't escape it looks like uh we might as well identify with the captors and say okay it's good you know we'll actually want this I want to fall apart I want to see my parents fall apart I want to lose my grandparents I will go gracefully into that good night oh yeah it's gonna be you know this is just how it is this is what I want I wouldn't want the opposite you know and then people start intellectualizing it so what can I say on behalf of my my captors staging in death uh how can I paint them in a positive light okay I can't escape but I can kind of identify and glorify and make the captives will my will and thereby kind of overcome them this is like bargaining right we're bargaining for death yeah yeah so so so philosophy in monten's world where the the French philosopher Montana is he says all all geared in all history geared towards having us accept death right and he himself tried to I mean he was himself in that school of thought that this is something we shouldn't be afraid of we shouldn't resist Etc which is very understandable of course when you live in a pre-scientific era where a very early scientific era right but now such a Pacific is itself a problem and and dangerous because if people understood the very simple truth that it's better to be youthful and Alive than to be old or dead um we would see investment that well maybe we could have been 20 years ahead today from where we are now but there's a I mean it's a scandal when you when you think about the things we can afford in this world and that we cannot afford apparently or there's no interest in stopping aging which is hurting everyone around us is an absolute outrage and we we should be outraged but you know the most important thing is to to wake up now and try to undo the incredible harm of inaction right a non-committal that is being sustained by a refusal to think about death in a kind of straightforward way where we say okay enough with the nonsense there isn't much good about aging and dying if it's the end it's a personal catastrophe for every everyone everyone basically everyone yeah I think what you're saying is like it's just this like blind spot that we've accepted yeah that uh maybe like the medical field the medical uh areas of academic study and and actual practitioners just like just don't look there because no nowhere in humanity have we had the tools or the conversations to actually Point our attention to aging so Patrick why now why is now the time to try and and uh illuminate this this blind spot that humans have well so now is well the thing is yes it is now because now it's what we have but it could have been uh it could have been uh something we've done or you know the whole last century it could have been the focus and of course there were people who thought they should be the focus of science very early like Francis Bacon right Roger Bacon and uh Descartes and uh pantam and uh another philosophers who who thought that science should be concerned with this so well it's not today I mean it is we should have been doing this for for a long long long time but all we have now is the now and now now is high time to start of course right there is more promise now that this ambition is not just the pipe dream but uh we hear uh of course weekly about small small promising possible breakthrough we're still waiting for the the the kind of cure that that passes the gold standard and where we have good uh longitudinal and clinical studies and so on but there are many uh people not enough people at all I mean some estimates say they're only 5 000 or so working on uh fundamental aging and so on so so much much too few smart people are working on it but there are a lot of different paradigms that are being pursued and that itself is very promising that there isn't just one approach but there there's a plurality there is approaches and interventions from the the kind of everyday simple interventions they were getting better and better and better at I don't know if you follow the the debate about what we should and shouldn't eat you know it's it's it's still a terribly messy situation only meat no meat only vegetables no not vegetables or this and that but I mean of course uh sometimes that overshadows there is a lot of consensus as well uh that you you should avoid eating too much sugar you should get your exercise you shouldn't smoke you shouldn't drink maybe not at all or a little bit you can drink right and um and and you shouldn't engage in meaningful projects um and so on right you should call your mom things like things like that those things are all positive when it comes to longevity and these are things that you can do today and in fact when you think about it and you when you think about what value and Beauty it is in just existing even if you have problem even if you have bad days um it might make you want to think well uh let me be serious about my health and let's do this while we're waiting for the miracle drugs so in some sense we can take action today because the longer we can keep us with this kind of low Tech interventions we can Keep Us Alive till the big breakthroughs will come right I I think it is worth noting that um a lot of the world of uh the health industry the health Academia health research Health practitioners the hospital system like if you ask a cancer researcher what they're doing they're saying oh I'm trying to I'm trying to cure cancer if you ask um some like infectious disease researcher they say oh I'm trying to cure infectious disease some metabolic disease practitioner what are they doing they're trying to cure metabolic disease and so as a whole we're all approaching these more surgical parts of uh Health interventions but if you really zoom out and look at the health care system as a whole each one of those systems is trying to create health and prevent death and so this the idea of the health industry is a longevity industry it is a longevity Pursuit it's just people inside of this system are it's like the the elephant the people feeling the elephant metaphors like the the the cancer people are just feeling one leg and they say oh like how do I how do I help health I prevent cancer but if you look at the elephant as a whole what health and the medical industry is trying to do is preventing death but no one really seems to be able to zoom out and understand like what this thing is from the big picture but that makes me hopeful that Society is on a cusp of like a phase change where once this narrative once this story breaks out and once people realize it and once this gets spread through the the culture through the internet through memes through propagation through podcasts like this I'm actually hopeful that there can be a pretty rapid phase change of people understanding like oh pursuit of health is pursuit of contingent more immortality do you see are you are you that helpful as well because I am that hopeful are you hopeful yeah I'm very hopeful and I think that the practice the the science the Advent of medicine that actually works on aging and intervention that works on Aging together with the ideological change they will feed each other so the more hope that's rationally based that people can prolong their youth the more positive they're going to be right and this this is what surveys show as well in fact just knowing about the various projects of extending life makes people more positive to it simple exposure to it um and the way you describe the healthcare system too much of it is is sick care really too much of it is is not preventative medicine and that's an incredibly waste of money so of course because you're sending the worst parts of your life yeah exactly it's it's a terrible waste of money and it's it's a it's a terrible wasted opportunity to relieve suffering so there needs to be a a kind of mindset change here and the in terms of dollars spent versus suffering reduced is the worst like allocation of resources that we have because actually it actually probably net increases human suffering yeah it's it's it's it's it's terrible I mean of course it it's it's great when you have uh something that that can manage a disease or patch it up or even cure it it's fantastic but it's much much better to have us not get sick in the first place and it should be obvious and in fact I like what you said before when you describe this kind of old mindset that in fact they see a contradiction where there is no contradiction if you if you if you talk to people about this even in the health profession or even in the science many will have a kind of reaction when you put it in terms of longevity when in fact if they succeed it's exactly longevity right I mean they're going to get that as a side effect and we want to get it as a side effect from addressing the root causes of Aging of course when it when we look at potential upsides of a potential breakthroughs they must come from addressing aging the mechanisms the various many mechanisms of Aging we don't have to understand them to be able to successfully do something about them fortunately because it's very complicated but that's way because we get cancer we get diabetes we get Alzheimer's because we age so what was the average age of people dying from covid it was 80 around 80 right how many people died from covet under 65 11 right so I want to say look what's going on here is people are also dying from aging right they're not just dying from covid right most of them they're also dying for May aging that undermines their immune system Etc and feebles them in various ways um and and so you can just see what a more youthful population how much more resistant they would be to a virus like this Etc you can I mean the the potential of saving money here right that can then be used even to address particular illnesses Etc is enormous so I don't know if you saw David Sinclair's article last year so he wrote an article with two economists public published in nature where he calculated how much in the world money would be saved by retarding aging that is prolonging youth one year and it was 38 trillion one one year of more healthy people yeah saves us 38 trillion dollars yeah it's worth 32 one year one year so uh yeah this this is uh this is where where progress can be made and even even if if you can't make people see that it's good for them to live longer which is absurd that you can't make people see that but even if you can't you can say look this is how much suffering we're avoiding right because no one likes cancer right aging causes cancer you could say or is you know makes it much more likely that you get cancer at least so fixing aging is fixing cancer etc etc etc so I think step by step it will Dawn on people this project makes sense yeah financially and economically it makes sense and because uh keeping somebody alive at like 90 95 100 years old is the most costly and precarious time in their life to keep them alive because when they're dying of cancer at at 90 it like aspherosclerosis or Dementia or Alzheimer's is not far behind them and so that's why you say they're dying of Aging even though it's cancer it's really aging because there's three other things they're going to die from in the next five years and so keeping someone alive at that age is the most expensive and also the time in their life in which they are suffering the most and so I think the the financial and economic argument is to take all of that Capital that we expend State trying to prevent people from dying when they are 90. push that forward and apply that Capital when they are 30 40 and 50 to increase their health span and their longevity interventions then and so that the ROI on that dollars is just a ten to one order of magnitude increase because it's easier to manage at that point in time and then people actually can effectively live longer while they are not suffering while they are not in the worst part of their life in a hospital bed dying of 13 different things that I'm assuming this is like the summer a good summary of the the financial and economic argument absolutely and and there are more Dimensions to it because it's also the fact that when people are youthful they can work so you also get taxes right from healthy people because it's you know we see in in France now they're trying to increase the the pension age and so on that's uh today necessary most likely but um uh it's something that can be a good thing people uh keep healthy if they work they can go down they don't have to work full time Etc it's actually good for people to work a bit longer uh and the time we have after we retire is just so much longer today that it's not a cheat really it's a necessity but it's it's so I'm not defending exactly how macron went about this at all right it should be subtle you should have people who work hard with their bodies physical work etc that's a different story right so you have to have to do this in an intelligent way but all in all what you get is uh people who are healthy are able to work uh longer which itself is an incredibly good uh good for econ for the economy certainly uh Patrick you've written a book yeah yeah uh what is that book called It's called um it's called the case against death so that pretty much explains it and and and of course the Absurd thing is that I have to write a book like that um it was you know provoked by well I was basically triggered by people's acceptance of death and how much you have to hear this uh that that you know I had people you know without me bringing this up saying uh you know I think it's wonderful to age you know I heard that my my brother's 40th birthday sounds like cope oh yeah it sounds like cope or massive cope but uh yeah and and and and and and you hear it and it's just it's so incredibly thoughtless I mean uh you know to make it personal my my father is in hospital today you know with pneumonia and and and and it's very very dangerous thing when you're 80 right in your 80s right um and so I don't think there's anything wonderful with that at all I think it's it's it's uh it's an evil and I think it's almost it it is a form of of kind of banal evil uh to have this attitude because what you're doing is when you say that you think aging is wonderful is you that all of this suffering is wonderful that something that is destroying people destroying people's bodies and Minds you know see Alzheimer's which is it's like a horror movie that somebody is there but not there and and you lose yourself you lose mind people around you suffer incredibly to say that that's good and they'll say no no we don't say that's good it's aging we don't say the the diseases are good we're saying that aging is good but in practice I don't think you can make that sharp distinction because if you don't get any of that deterioration you're not aging right right right so but it's just of course these all nice people and and and it's it's not that the day are evil right it's just that there is a you know that concept of the banality of evil in some sense it just happens uh yeah and and everybody has that justification and so on of course here it might be to protect themselves from the horror of death as a sunflowers versus psychologists have argued that people just don't want to really think about this and and so therefore therefore their their their thought processes are kind of unusually limited and and and in the Box about it right yeah there's um like four or five big reasons why people will die like one of them is cancer one of them is uh metabolic disease as stero sclerosis Alzheimer's like these account for like the vast majority of of people's deaths uh and I and these all have like overlapping comorbidities right these all if you have one the chances of you having another one is pretty significant so all these different circles are like also Venn diagrams that overlap with each other and I would assume that if you the the part of the Venn diagrams that overlap with all of them you would just call that aging like that's what that's what aging is and so like with that perspective I think it's a little bit easier to wrap your heads around like oh aging isn't this thing that just happens to you and you can do it gracefully or ungracefully like no it's a disease that we all have we all have this disease called Aging and it's all being we're all experiencing it every single day you know certainly I mean and so if you for example you accept something like David Sinclair's view that it has to do with you know real information and uh if you are like CD the CD gets scratched and so on I mean there's nothing good about having a scratched CD right I mean what's good about that nothing you know what what people mean is it's great to have that experience that you have when you're 60 or 70 or 80. and it's great to have those kind of long roots that you have with people and projects and so on that's great because it's it's it's paradoxically not it's not like people get less happy right when they hold uh if they're someone lucky with their health they they can have their happiest tears despite everything but I think that's what you have to say despite everything because how happy would they be if they had all those good things to experience the network The Roots Etc the knowledge but also good youthful Health right we haven't seen that but but I mean what we have seen is that that all the people who also have their health are doing comparably better than those who don't so those who have aged less because aging is something that happens to to a small degree on an individual level that we we age differently at different speeds somewhat and it of course has to do with lifestyle choices and and luck Patrick uh for all the the listeners out there that are peaked and curious as to what to do next what to read next what to where to go next yeah uh what advice you have for them well my book is very good surprised that you would answer this the case again stuff is very I mean it's very good because I go through all of the arguments that people use to justify death and I trace these arguments back to their Roots philosophical Roots so I talk about ancient philosophy and and psychology and things like that right and and myths because it's it's like we've constructed this I call it the wise view that it's a view that that accepting aging and death is a sign that you're somebody who's wise right and there's a long tradition of of course people who are World wise like Socrates and and uh Play-Doh and the stoics and epicureans and a lot of these schools who all teach the same you know that this is something that is best accepted and and not feared and so on so uh okay so that that's that's where that's play one place um there are other uh places of course they can read uh Sinclair's great book about why we age and why we don't have to age if they want to get into the the more science bit and if they want to get in uh to do something uh practical about it well they can well they can contact me or they there's an organization called Vita Dao and vitadel will then be able to uh connect you and uh and and make it make it so that you can actually do something in this issue no matter what you kind of background this it can be from science but it can also be from Finance or or if you're a humanist so Patrick thank you so much for for helping us uh tell this story and uh showing us the top of what seems to be a very cool and interesting rabbit hole and so thank you for

longevity which uh before we hit record I realized has an interesting intersection with some of the events that happened in the 2021 bull market uh but we'll get to that Sergio welcome to the show thank you so much for having me so one of the very very important topics at zuzalo is longevity uh and this is a topic that I know vitalik is intimately interested in and I've had my own like small history with it but for a lot of our uh listeners that longevity is a new subject for them maybe we can just start with the basics and that I think that really starts with the conversation of Aging I think we all and we all know what aging is like we get older and like it looks like we get older and like our bones don't work as well but maybe you can help Define it from a more technical perspective what is aging sure so agent itself is the tendency for our bodies at all levels from a cellular level to a tissue level and organ level systemic level or a systems level to head towards atrophy and degradation So eventually the forgetting of performance for the forgetting of um creation of of a new material the the creation of new material that is now mutated or you know I like to think of it and explain it as a when you you take a piece of paper and you see rocks it you photocopy it right you start with a very high resolution but by the time you make the thousandth copy you end up with a blank piece of paper you lose information you lose resolution that's really ultimately what aging is that you as you go across time and space you you lose information your body doesn't read information as well and that's what ends up ultimately uh you know contributing to us losing our eyesight our hearing our abilities to to jump to to even enjoy life some some mental problems actually develop as well so uh it's that that whole tendency towards degradation yeah and and the idea of um slowing aging or preventing aging I think uh is a pretty common uh Common Sense practice as in like you know you eat good food you exercise you don't drink alcohol and I think this is all things that that people you know most people know intuitively at this point but that's also not necessarily the conversation of longevity because longevity is not just about slowing the aging process it's about something that's all together different can you can you talk about that that different perspective that longevity has sure I mean longevity means a lot of things to a lot of people is actually a term that he has been used and abused quite a bit uh for me longevity is the combination of Health span and lifespan whatever intervention whatever kind of endeavor project therapy uh drug helps you not just live longer but in a healthier way and you're absolutely right I think that a lot of the scientists have figured out that in order to really achieve that it's it's no longer um it's no longer okay to just kind of delay the onset of Aging but now to start looking at reversal techniques uh and thankfully science have gotten sophisticated enough to understand all the characteristics or the majority of the characteristics of Aging is is not good to be absolute in science right because then science humbles you and teaches you something new which is the beautiful thing about engaging in any and scientific Endeavor but but yeah there's there are actual processes that allow you to take a cell for example and turn it into a younger version of itself um one of them just as an example is the Nobel prize winning Breakthrough by Dr yamanaka where um where with a set of instructions or mRNA factors they were able to take an adult agent cell and bring it all the way back into an embryonic stage right um so that in itself just shows that there is such a thing as H reversal the issue there and and why that in itself is not a longevity uh Centric uh intervention is that in the whole process of reversing the age the cell also forgets what it's meant to do so if you do that in a skin cell it goes all the way back to an embryonic stage and it forgets to be a skin cell it no longer performs the functions of a skin cell like generating elastins and collagen etc etc so I often liken it to let's say you're in your 60s and you are a successful professional right and now somebody snaps their fingers and you're back to being a one week old baby not only do you forget or you rejuvenate it but there's a there's a problem there you forgot that you were a successful professional you forgot everything you learned in high school in college and university so the the longevity intervention that now we're focusing on in the longevity field today is called epigenetic reprogramming which is the decoupling of identity loss with the with the Rejuvenation enhancement so there's now different companies that are looking uh to bring back in the in that example and an aged skin cell to a younger version of itself so in the in the example of the 80 year old you take the 80 year old and you bring it back to you know being 20 21 right what we believe is the most optimal youthful age and uh and that skin cell still remembers to be a skin cell except it now performs like it used to when it was young one of the companies that is at the Forefront of that is is term biotechnologies out of uh Stanford lab in in Mountain View California okay so maybe you can just help give us the the lay of the land of longevity Tech and Longevity startups right because um from from my knowledge that I've been able to gather here uh the idea of like a longevity community and and research efforts very young uh it's maybe only a couple decades so no now that we are in the era of 2023 can you kind of place Us in history I know there's a long future of longevity ahead of us where are we in the world of longevity research and and product and all of this like where are we in history so longevity research is is very mature right in in 2000 just to give you a kind of a chronological uh or to Center us in a chronological Spectrum um early 2000 it was immoral to study aging 2005 um the Methuselah Mouse prize for extending the the lifespan of a mouse was very successful in showing the scientific community that if you could do it in a mouse then you could certainly do it in a human because the mouse has always been this kind of like Gateway into what works in a human at least from a regulatory perspective um so a lot of really good science has happened since uh people have had permission to believe that they can not just delay aging but reverse aging there's aging institutes all over the world there are um a lot of really good [Music] um non-profit and academic institutions the best ones in the world are now they have an arm uh so about about 2020 2014 2015 all this researched uh Technologies and all of this interventions started becoming a little bit more mature so that you could start creating companies around it so in 2020 in 2016 all the way but up until now you're seeing an explosion of uh interventions that are now making their way into the the professional investment world right anything for a small molecule into Gene therapies into cell therapies they're now getting backed by uh VCS uh and then slowly you're you're starting to see uh the the big Pharma right uh coming in and developing different little units of of longevity units to try to understand how this Technologies new technologies are going to be deployed not just in the mainstream but in their current pipeline as well so there's a lot of interest because um you know longevity is trying to do this moonshot thing and they're actually generating platforms that are useful even for non-longevity applications uh we have several of our companies that in trying to address aging their cancer becomes almost like a very simple thing to do and uh and that's how the in the current landscape to answer your question is a lot of these longevity companies are integrating currently into the the regulatory environment and to the current investment environment by deploying solutions to things that people understand already like cancer like Alzheimer's like um you know uh osteoarthritis and and heart disease things like that yeah so it's not just operating inside of its own vertical it's on Silo it's being able to find waste it's probably helpful uh just to have that integrated with pre-existing companies and pre-existing like domains of knowledge but just to really uh make sure I understand the answer uh it sounds like actual applications actual interventions are are already known and known science and we know how to do them and now we're at the point of VC investment going into these systems to try and scale them out to make them like ready for consumers is that where we are I I would say not only that we're at the point where professional big funds Beyond VCS even you know these are 50 to 150 million dollar check writers and above are bringing in money so that this Technologies can go in human which is to me being or having been in longevity for 12 years is is the Holy Grail is where is the product you know people have been talking about longevity for a long time but still today the best thing I could do is eat well and exercise and maybe take rapamycin and Metformin but I want next Generation products and this is what a lot of these companies are now creating and focusing on is taking all this next-gen uh intervention into the clinic into humans and that in itself is going to allow the longevity space to just flourish tremendously yeah sure let's try and make longevity a little bit more real for the listeners and also for myself we talked about the the idea of epigenetic uh epigenetic uh what is it reprogramming that allows us to take off shave off the years and sounds like uh shave off specific amounts of years going back to a specific time uh and we just you are talking about that in the concept of a single cell which just means that if you can do that in a single cell like can you do that for the whole body like how does this work can you make it a little bit more real for for listeners sure um so he in in the long run you do want a systemic approach right you want to be able to go in get some kind of injection or some kind of IB drip system that goes all over your body and starts rejuvenating across different types of cells and such unfortunately that is that is not the best way to get to market the best way to get to Market is to pick something very simple or very needed and and go after it and show the FDA and other regulatory bodies that that there is Rejuvenation so a company like turnbayo has assessed two big markets to go after one of them is Dermatology so they'll be able to go into your skin maybe with some micro needling with the help of dermatologists and start rejuvenating the dermis and that dermis eventually comes up into the epidermis and you'll end up seeing like the the results that we're expecting is that your skin is going to get thicker it's going to get more more youthful so the way it's moisturized the way collagen and elastins are shown the way your actual normal skin color shows up if you go to the beach uh you're going to have better protection against the sun um you're just going to have a much more youthful skin and skin is the largest organ in your body so that's that's the the main thing uh right there um so the idea is like a more targeted applications and so you said micro needling it sounds like you it's local to the injection site correct and what are we actually injecting in into you right the skin yeah so one of the things we could do is like microneedle into the the hair the scalp and rejuvenate you know hair and uh that's gonna have even some uh hair coloring applications where gray hair is going to be reversed um but uh what is going in is actually this little fat bubbles we like to call lipid nanoparticles in the in the industry but we've actually created our own novel lipids um these little fat bubbles are food like you're given self cells in your body food they eat fat that gives them energy to keep doing their thing so we've created new types of cells of of uh lipids that can go into the cell as food um and inside that cell inside that lipid that goes into the cell is a cocktail a Rejuvenation cocktail which is ultimately uh mRNA factors now turn bio this epigenerative reprogramming company created uh they use synthetic biology same bio to create this uh very specific safe controllable mrnas type of mrnas called t-u-rnase Turners and that's what it is it's it's a it's it's a set of instructions inside a fat bubble becomes food for the cell the cells eats it and while it is digesting the food this set of instructions go into the the the cell and the cell it starts performing the instructions right so for example if you go to the doctor the doctor says hey you know you may want to sleep better drink more water uh eat healthier exercise a y and z right so that's what we're doing at a cellular level we're telling the cell to do different things that ultimately are structural changes to the cell the cell kind of relaxes right and then tightens up and going through that process the cell rejuvenates itself because the cell is able to remember how it used to read your DNA now this is epigenetic reprogramming we're not changing your DNA we're just reminding the cell to read your DNA in a much better way so it's very safe um from what we've seen and we're hoping that you know when we go into human studies we can even show this safety level that is unmatched by any other similar technology such as like the MRNA vaccines that had some safety issues and toxicity issues well all that if you can think of it that was like version you know the the beta version of of any kind of mRNA Technologies now you're getting to mRNA Therapeutics that this is all things that we have optimized for safety because we know it's important to um in in rejuvenating someone you don't want to hurt them right it's counter-intuitive to to do that right and just to unpack the name epigenetic reprogramming this is actually taking back uh taking me back to my biology days epigenetics means above genetics right and so it's it's like this layer above your DNA that chooses what parts of your DNA to turn on and off and my intuition from what you said is that um uh the ability to read the DNA decays over time and that is perhaps uh the what aging is and so uh epigenetic reprogramming is like just sharpening the lens perhaps of your epigenetic layer to read the DNA better that's that's a great way of putting it by the way thank you great job um I'd like to I mean we some of us understand it maybe a lot of you listeners understand like computers right so if you think of your DNA as the serious and ones right the binary code that makes the computer at the the base very basic happen and and startup and all these programs are at an Epi level right right uh at a you start having all these coding systems that make use of this binary and eventually as your computer goes through times of space it gets slower like functions Decay the environment like Trojans and viruses and all this start attacking it uh not only that the hardware becomes a little bit sloppy as well um and then you have you know issues with how that information is read properly so every now and then you'll have your optimization uh programs that come in and start deleting and and doing all these things so maintenance work right maintenance work right so that's that's what we're doing we're not changing the zeros and ones um but we're we're reminded we're coming in with the you know with the cleaner right and uh and the antivirus come in and just get rid of all the crud and all the all the and doing the debugging so that your computer runs as optimally as possible yeah and just to really drive this point home the idea is that this works at your DNA level and your DNA is you and so I think I think this is kind of like surreal to really try and like think about it's like okay we can make our skin better I can I can imagine that like I can imagine my skin being 10 years ago the hair et cetera my eyesight get better but then when you apply it holistically to the whole body like that's I think kind of when it gets weird for folks it's like so imagine you take uh some 70 year old and you do this program like do they just like rewind back to 20 years old do we have any indication that we have an answer for this uh so you know it's it's good not to give an answer that is you know absolute but what I will probably see is um what I would probably say from a speculatory perspective is uh you you start seeing a lot of benefits and on how you feel and how your body performs um unfortunately most of the things that are important about aging happen internally right anything from like oh man I used to eat a burger and when I was young it it meant nothing to me now that I'm old it's like oh my gosh I can't use the restroom I fill in foggy like all that grease is just making me feel bugged down you gotta take a nap oh yeah so so that's what we'll probably see a lot of the Rejuvenation happen internally but what I'm most excited is you know eventually we'll rejuvenate the brain so neuroplasticity all of a sudden you'll be able to remember things uh or learn new things right one of the things of against longevity is like oh well you're going to be the same person that you've always been and then nothing's going to change well no our goal is to rejuvenate neuroplasticity if you want to learn a new language when you're in you know in your 90s then do it right if you want to switch careers so another thing thing is that the thymus and the way our our bodies regulate hormones right that could be a lifestyle issue right anyone that or any female that goes through menopause knows how difficult that can be or all humans that went through like your teenage years where your hormones were just going all crazy know how unsettling that could be well that doesn't change as we grow and there's people who for example um can't control their weight simply because of the way their thyroid is is maintaining different things so um there are certain systems and certain organs in your body that will give you a much better yield from a Rejuvenation perspective of course you'll have your your liver your lungs uh your eyesight definitely is a big one and you're hearing uh so yeah I think I think overall it's going to be as slow effect but eventually you start seeing uh you know your skin gets thicker uh you can now run a marathon um your your knees don't hurt as much uh or you're no longer a candidate for knee replacement surgery because your hyaline cartilage is is is regrowing uh your synovial fluid is able to um prevent you from falling because that's another thing that happens when we age is so many Falls take place and then that affects the way a person uh lives their their life when they're in their 80s or 90s so all these things are probably not going to be super evident you're not going to come out and going to look like a 20 year old in you know within minutes but you're slowly going to have this Rejuvenation effect the dosage is still yet to be determined so we don't know if you're going to be taking this every week every month every year every 10 years our goal is to get get someone to a point where they're rejuvenated and maintain gain them as long as possible but but yeah that that all remains a mystery that is exciting to to go after and look into the answers for yeah certainly and uh there's a podcast that vitalik was on that uh the clip of this went viral when he said it that he thinks that somebody's already alive today that's going to live to the to be 3 000 to the year 3000 uh do you also believe something along this nature that that's rooted on something called longevity's Cape velocity so my my um the CEO at the Methuselah Foundation my business partner David Goble actually came up with his idea and it was uh postulated publicly and popularized by Aubrey de gray which is the the goal that you know eventually interventions that are gonna help you keep living longer are going to come out at such a fast pace that you're gonna be aging and then taking all these products to help you de-age at a much faster rate than than you're ever going to be able to to get older if you can still if you can keep yourself alive to the point where technology has advanced to the de-aging peak where our technology allows us to de-age then you're good yeah you've made exactly exactly and that's that's ultimately the the goal I think that is something that is very uh possible I think in five years from now until 2030 it's it's a very critical stage so for all those who are thinking of supporting longevity and biotech now is the time because I think in the in the next seven years we're going to see a lot of these interventions go into humans and it's those those uh interventions and the success of them in humans that are going to dictate whether or not um you know maybe you or or I or vitalik himself are going to be able to live to be 3 000 years so um I say it's possible I think I'll be more bullish in 2030. sure sure how how will this um industry the longevity industry impact listeners and people today like what what's what's or or the first like what's going to happen in the near term that the like what's the first few products that are going to come out of this industry um so right now there's a rush towards creating longevity clinics and unfortunately I've I've I feel there's a there's a it's just a little bit more of a hype than anything else like you look at a lot of longevity clinics and all they do is just like vitamin B infusions right you know whether or not it's in longevity uh treatment that remains to be seen but their other Linux that actually have hard times behind it like if you look at Everest Health ever is that bio you know they have eight years of of creating the Methuselah protocol and trying to figure out what actually works for you as a specific individual now that's an average of a population um so I think that's the first thing you'll start seeing is longevity clinics everywhere people trying to really maximize things that could work today and then they're also going to become the distribution channels for all these next-gen therapies right so um you know if you really do want to make use of the best thing out there already for you I would say go to one of these reputable longevity clinics and uh what you'll see is you'll get you know normal health care but instead of saying okay see you in a year right they'll say okay let's figure out throughout the next year every four months or every three months who you are how we can optimize your vitamins how we can optimize your your lifestyle so that you can become the best version of yourself as we wait for this next Generation uh therapies and it makes sense for example the person that you are during the winter changes to the person that you are during the summer and this is something that most doctors don't even care about because they only see you once a year and they're they're pushed to see so many people during a day so they don't really have the time even if they want to help you so I do think that right now there's a paradigm shift a lot of people actually our age or are not just looking at life expectancy like oh how long are we going to live for but we're also looking at a health expectancy meaning you know I've gone to a couple of doctors where I said you know the quality of care you're giving me is subpar like I can get better care just by looking at WebMD right and uh and you know I don't feel demeaned or like you know a lot of doctors out there think you're you're dumb and and they treat you like very poorly unfortunately or they're just trying to push some pills because they get some kind of Kickback and I'm not saying everybody's this this way but it's unfortunately the system that we currently live in so it's it's going to be a health expectancy Paradigm where people are just going to give their their money to the clinics that are really going to spend a half an hour to an hour to really optimize you for who you are as an individual not as a not as a statistic uh some kind of average what's holding back the longevity industry like what's what are the obstacles that uh longevity as a as a as an academic study or as a an industry needs to get over uh there's a there's a few things that are holding back not just longevity but um the Next Generation therapies very first thing I would say is delivery there's a lot of really cool stuff that's happening at the lab level at an academic level that will never make it into a human because mice are not humans right actually the predictability of whether or not something works in a human um it's not very good um when you use a mouse model like dogs are allergic to chocolate what if dogs were the getting item for whether or not you and I could eat chocolate I'd be very upset because you know it's toxic to dogs doesn't mean it's going to be toxic to humans and as as humans we don't really know what things didn't make it to us simply because they didn't work in a mouse right so in a way that's a kind of a species Insanity to have uh another being be the Gateway for what's good for us so I like for example a a new uh initiative called the animal free animal free Precision medicine so afpm.bio that it's aiming at creating architecturally correct 3D printed human tissue that is able to be very predictive to within like 90 percent of whether or not it's going to help you and I humans so human tissue to help see whether or not humans can actually benefit from a certain type of drug so I think changing that Paradigm is important so that we don't just help longevity but also help medicine as a whole number two delivery right um just because something cool happens at an mRNA or DNA level does it mean we can put it inside your body your body is actually very well made to prevent any kind of foreign object from coming into your body so it's going to be attacked is going to be prevented so if there's a really cool set of mRNA instructions we need to put them in a fat bubble that works really well so that is a nascent technology or is it it's a industry that needs to be developed significantly I know at least 20 different longevity companies that are gonna go into that roadblock as soon as they start thinking of going into into humans and number three is regulation regulation meaning uh the understanding that um you know aging is a disease right um and making that a a well-known fact for Regulators so that they can fast track a lot of this life-saving Technologies I think it's it's going to be important but we're very thankful to uh the FDA modernization act that just past this this December I think the FDA Now by law has to go ahead and modernize and and start looking at how to put together uh programs like the warp uh warp speed program right that gave us the vaccine well there's a way to make a drug go through the whole regulatory environment in a year right so I think the FDA needs to really sit down and figure out what the business model is that going to be right the business model up until now worth billions of dollars is let's let's take five to ten years for any drug to go through and a lot of people make a lot of money in in between but I think there's a way to make even more money by fast tracking it but maybe creating some kind of royalty model sure maybe paying for safety right uh that that could be a good thing but those are the three big things in my opinion and and how would uh longevity in addition to all of the awesome things it might be able to do for us on an age standpoint just impact other areas of medicine and the Health Care system like what's the conversation like there um that's a that's a great Point um I think costs driving costs down I think it's important I think uh there's a paper uh that came out explaining that 47 trillion dollars is what humanity is going to spend by 2030 every year on taking care of you know an agent population 47 thrilling I mean if you give me 47 trillion dollars I could do a lot with that right uh so just from an economic perspective and by the way I'm an economist by training uh I think not just other areas of healthcare but just other areas of the GDP are going to be improved and the pandemic really showed this if you have a population that is sick you're going to lose trillions and trillions of dollars in actual value add for from society as a contribution so like never mind the growth in GDP that gets from having a working popular Innovation right exactly exactly and a population that is more productive a population that has neuroplasticity to invent more a population that is not worried about having to work you know seven days a week but now they've been given more time to kind of reflect um about what they can do with their life what's the best way to to move things forward how do we you know how do we use our time wisely I think it's it's a really good they're good existential questions and philosophical questions that only longevity is going to enable um yeah Sergio maybe you could just take a moment to tell us about yourself and and the companies that you're working with and and also just if listeners want to learn more where should they go um so thanks for thanks for that um I I like to help different companies uh create products uh in the context of longevity I've been uh working with term bio so www.turn.bio Leucadia Therapeutics uh leucadiatx.com Leucadia has a novel approach to solving Alzheimer's my grandma died with Alzheimer's after fighting for 17 years and I became indignant um at when I realized how much time and money has been had been wasted battling unsuccessfully Alzheimer's and my grandma was not a human being halfway through the whole process and yet Society paid for her to get the best the best health care that was potentially offered to her and I became enamored with disrupting Health Care much like uber disrupted Transportation Amazon the retail space Etc you know this is prime for disruption and it's it's going to do tremendous amount of good so that's who I am at the core but I've also been volunteering um for for a long time with foundations and non-profits so the Methuselah Foundation uh I created an investment fund for them called the Methuselah Fund in 2016. we invested in different companies and helped them create uh new products and new Innovations thankfully none of them have fell apart you know not knock on wood right um but you know we sold one of them that we started with 150 000 we sold it for a deal worth 400 million dollars it's a merger and acquisition deal with 3D systems and this company called volumetric could create whole the technology could eventually create a whole new printed organs so if you ever need a kidney transplant and you're no longer able to be part of a a you know transplant list because you're too old or because you know whatever that may be you know this company is going to be able to pre 3D print you an organ that is yours with your own cells it's not going to be rejected and so the whole organ transplanting model uh is going to be fixed hopefully with this um it's a partnership between United Therapeutics and 3D systems and I really have really good hopes there for them um Ocean biotechnologies and oncosenix which is their their cancer arm I think they're incredibly important company for cenolytic approach as you get older you get more more of this zombie cells all throughout your body I think it's one liter by the time you're 80 that's just roaming around eating your nutrients and just consuming all the good stuff from your body you want that to be gone just as much as you want cancer cells to be gone I think that's a really cool uh project as well and then we have exterma which are trying to make organs live longer and also to create cryopreservance that are going to be non-toxic which is a huge problem today with Academia a lot of the materials that are being used are toxic so there's potentially a case to be said that all the institutions around the world could be generating better science if they use better materials that are not toxic Vision biosciences as well it's quite the list yeah you've got your your hands everywhere a little bit um and then also win santor which regrow your your nerve endings which is really cool for neuropathy and pain um and a couple of the companies that are in stealth mode uh one of one of the fun ones uh is actually through the Methuselah Foundation vitalik uh donated 43 of the world supply of this uh fund meme token Community called dojilon Mars doji Elon Mars yeah that's uh that's that's on the long tail of dog tokens for sure yeah yeah it's actually I don't know if it still is but I think it was deutschko and Shiva and dejulan Mars which is number three in the world it's it's incredible uh fun community and uh yeah it's it's a really interesting story for sure yeah well thank you for guiding us through all of this crazy crazy topics uh this is uh only like one of many many longevity topics so thank you for for walking us through the top of the rabbit hole and I hope to continue going down throughout this week thank you thank you so much for having me introducing polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifle user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem

talking to Michael Greer of humanity Michael what's up not much it's great to be here Michael I first met you at the 8 A.M cold plunge and you have been there every single day been best friends ever since yeah best friends ever since uh So you you're at an interesting intersection between all of the various topics that are being talked about at zuzalu the the intersection of longevity which we had a longevity week I think we're gonna have another one uh and also AI so that's a fun little place to operate in uh tell us a little bit about how you stumbled your way into that world yeah and honestly I think you can throw the the public goods and the uh the crypto into the mix there as well um yeah I mean I started with I think a lot of people in health Tech start is they they have someone close to them or themselves have kind of a really tragic you know Health event that kind of uh you learn the cliche that if you don't have your health you don't have anything right um and so I had people close to me find out really late about cancer I think a lot of people unfortunately have had that experience and that threw me for a loop because I was in my 20s I had this big business success you know this dating site that got quite large so you're feeling like you can conquer the world and then you can't do anything for the you know the people sitting right next to you um and so I went down many rabbit holes basically trying to figure out like early detection of disease of cancer uh that led me towards genetics uh because of things called liquid biopsies that are now coming to fruition which is a great space but when I kept going further I went out to the valley I took over operations at a consumer VPN I started meeting people that started giving me this it sounds like a very simple idea but I didn't have it in my head before which was there's something better than early detection of disease you can actually monitor the whole body going towards higher probability of disease right more success it's like one step in front of that yeah yeah because what what the whole I mean we don't need to go into the whole Healthcare System but I think most people that spend a lot of time in the Healthcare System call it sick care now uh because we we focus at that end stage where it's not too late but it's like the person's already pretty diseased and you're trying to save them right and you're saving them in the most expensive part of that trajectory and also the part of the trajectory where they are suffering the most yeah and so that is the part that the current institution of medicine is prolonging the most yeah and and it's good that they're there the problem is not that they're do they're giving sick care that's great and and they do an amazing job in hospitals doing that the problem is that we don't have a lot of emphasis on much earlier right in that in that process and so a lot of people have well almost everybody has the intent to be to stay healthy or to be healthier but there's just very few tools out there that can actually lead them in the right direction and So eventually once I had that idea in my head I could I don't get excited about stuff until I can really understand like how the whole operation works and then I got excited and so that's what we we created humanity and Humanity basically allows you to monitor your rate of Aging which is basically your probability of disease is it going up or down and then basically guides you towards slowing it down sure so across our user base we're looking at all the users what they're doing then we're finding users like you so you know your kind of biological sex your age you know different attributes of you and seeing what seems what group of actions is seeming to positively affect this endpoint and that end point is this prediction of future health and so what group of actions is actually making that that prediction that you're going to be healthier in the future oh those are good actions for that type of person let's tell everybody right that that's the type of person hey you should do this and then see if it works right yeah there's a lot of magic behind the scenes at the app that I'd definitely wanted to dive into and we'll we'll see if we can get some visuals up on the screen as well but uh first I still want to zoom out and just like can you give us like a high level just mission statement for you and humanity and also tell us just a little bit more about the is OT gap between the current institution of health and where you think it would be more Optimum if the institution of Health progressed towards yep I'm gonna sometimes I'm gonna stop you and ask for definitions of some of these things sure the isot is a is Art Gap yeah so there is it is odd Gap is like currently have nots uh currently the world of medicine is one way okay and I think you as a result okay ought to be some other way cool so where is it and what would it be and then like your own personal mission statement with what you're building here at Humanity cool uh yeah so our we try to boil down our mission to real Simplicity we want to give a billion years of Health back to humans by 2030. um that that's funny so at bank list sorry just a slide class we talk about we want to help a billion people go bankless that's been our line billion it's a nice round number yeah one is the largest number that humans can still reason about yeah exactly but I mean so the consumer VPN that I was running we got to 900 million users so like the beauty of the internet is that you can you can actually affect that many people right um so that's the mission we want to get back those billion years uh and and very specifically healthy years right so those fully functional or you know mostly fully functional healthy years that we almost all of us enjoy living um and so that's that's the mission and kind of what we have right now I would say the biggest thing if I was to cut straight to the chase we don't we don't measure our health right uh so those that are real Seekers and kind of out there like early adopters trying to you know biohack and all that kind of stuff very few of them even measured their health they kind of their their content consumers and there's a lot of great content out there and you're trying different things but there's not you're not monitoring yourself over time to see if if the group of things that you're doing is actually moving you towards what most of us are going for which is we want to be healthier for longer right and so the what the system doesn't have right now is is measuring the cool thing though is we've just entered maybe the last you know five years I would say we've entered a time where almost everybody has a device on them which can monitor their health so like our Mainstay of monitoring your health as a user is your movement pattern right and so if you keep your phone in your pocket or near you throughout the day we'll be able to at least give you some probably you know prediction of your future health if you have a wearable right you know we could feed in the heart rate right there's so there's so many out there and you're saying that even the very blunt tool of your phone in your pocket still can provide sufficient data yeah but then like we were we're many years into the Fitbit Revolution now we've got the Apple watches uh there's the whoop band there's the aura ring there's the sleep eight mattress that actually tracks you when you when you're sleeping so there's even other non-wearable devices that are inputting data and so I think this is the industry the the sector that that humanity is really tapping into there's all this data out there yeah and now we can start to apply it exactly and and apply it in almost leave the leave the kind of clinical trial system and these kind of like small research study things behind in a way because the whole the secondary problem so that was the big you know uh the secondary problem is that we because I think in the past it was easier to have one common marketing message so if you're a public health official and it makes sense like if you're a public health official like you can't go out and say hey there's 20 instructions to to follow you you just say hey sugar is bad right and you just hope that you know that message can you know get as far as you know it will go right and the problem is each of us is different in the combination of actions actually affects the outcome and so to give you an example so like if you're if if you're a certain type of person which which I am lucky for me don't be jealous I can eat as much chocolate cake it's not going to spike my sugar I've I've experimented multiple times with continuous glucose monitors it just won't do it I'll have to try a couple more times to make sure that the results are sound uh but the normal person would say Hey you know that's unhealthy you shouldn't be doing that right and so each of us needs to start measuring ourselves so that we can actually know you know what's actually working and what's not um and and so the getting away from you know how do you how do you get away from that real need which was these simple messages to actually applying a much more personalized thing unfortunately I don't I don't want to say everything's in your pocket but like again we have this great delivery service that we unfortunately stare at a lot during the day right and that thing can give you very personalized stuff and we and we actually are unhappy when it you know we talk about how personalized it is these these ads know too much about me right that same thing knowing everything about you can give you specific Health knowledge right so right we can start to to uh turn it around and start to use it for our benefit and I think this is where just perhaps the AI conversation starts because the idea is when so many people have their phones everyone has their phones and even not as many people have phones that has wearables but a large number of people have wearables we have a ton in their closet too and now they're taking them out to use put the app right yeah so like I've had an Apple Watch and I've Loosely worn it here and there but since coming here to zuzallu and doing the morning cold plunges going on the runs having this app to actually tell me what's going on with that data all of a sudden my rigorousness about how frequently I'm wearing this wearable has like tripled I'm gonna I'm gonna cut this part of it I'm just gonna send that to Apple feature us more please Yeah official iOS partnership app right for selling watches okay so we have all this data we have way more data than I think we know what to do with and maybe that's even like one of the big problem statements we have more data than we actually can apply to uh actually know what to do with it when it comes to our health behavior but I think this is where perhaps the AI conversation uh starts and just the Big Data conversation to start so can you walk us down that rabbit hole yeah and I think what you're what you're touching on is also I think we've had a few years I I I think all this stuff just puts it in the in the mainstream so I don't think any of this was like a wrong direction but we had a few years of like hey we have a bunch of data on you and here's some cool graphs right and and I think people started to get a little bit of like okay well that was cool but didn't really help me yeah yeah and they're like okay you know you can only look at your hrvs for so long and then you're just like I get it that's your heart rate variability by the way uh and so I think sorry what was the question so now that we have uh other tools uh not just wearables not just data but we have ai and lots of data what can we do with this yeah so I think that's where the cool the cool thing that happens is when you have enough of this data no matter if data is noisy no matter if data is you know interspersed and you're not getting it every day the great thing about AI is it actually can just still it looks at all that data and it can find all the relationships I mean deep learning is about finding the you know the kind of relationships and associations between multivariant systems and just taking that as knowledge and then in many cases it's applied in different ways you can you can fold all the proteins in the world or you can you know it's that deep knowledge that deep learning that gets that knowledge of how these variables are associated and so that's that's kind of the the byproduct of deep learning but it's actually the beautiful thing that now we're applying to health which is you can take that knowledge and actually then feed it that you can create an algorithm off of that and then feed it back to the user so they can feed in their their data and it will actually give them Guidance the other thing I don't know if we want to get too deep into it but we can go off in a tangent the uh I think what we're working on also at humanity and kind of plays into the public good that's uh that's happening behind us a lot of great talks is we want to find a way and there is a way we want to actually build out a proof of concept of that you can keep the data private stays in the same place the owner of the data is the user when they want to delete it off of that place that they put it they have full Reign to do that but you're also able to work the route where it's going is creating synthetic data so we're basically deep learning learns all the relationships and then you create fake users that have all those relationships you can open up that data to then train models on and everybody can do that the you know we we have 150 000 users but there's there's Health tech companies that have you know 100 million users right and and there's the NHS in the UK and you know Montenegro Health System they can keep their use their user and patient data completely private not anonymized and send it off somewhere keep it where it is completely private but still train models on it and allow researchers to do that allow anybody to do it I think that's now that we have blood in the water with AI with you know chat GPT just made it completely mainstream right right yeah now people are like what else can we do with data so I think now is the time really that we need to push to open up this data but not in not the real user data but actually just the learnings from it so right and I really want to drill down on the kind of the the problem of all this data that we have uh for anyone with a wearable or an apple will I'm sure Android has this too but if you open up your health app you can just like scroll and scroll and scroll through all the things that it's measuring right sorry Apple Health app yeah yeah they're taking and taking some some credit back uh so like it measures things like your gate imbalance right which leg that you put more weight on while you walk it measures uh heart rate variable variability which is very useful it measures how many steps you take like it it measures everything that it can get its hands on and what the cool thing about the humanity app is that it actually just boils that down into just like are you living longer or are you living shorter and that's really the power of applying AI here just consolidate all that data down to one output but hopefully can you like just illustrate the magnitude of the data problem and how AI fixes that yeah and I don't want to be overly positive but there is the other side of the coin which is basically these these platforms these these Hardware companies or if they consider themselves Hardware companies their sensors are getting more and more prevalent more and more people have them and they're getting better and better and they're monitoring more and more stuff the secondary that you touched on is they're also and I think this is a place for them to play as well they're also creating processed values like you know gait instability whereas I might not have a person on my team that necessarily is going to be an expert in that right but they create this process this this feature that they take out of that data that then we could use like I mean if you're a sports app you get gate instability you're like okay you're injured here's you know go out in this on this route right right and I think that's so the the there's there's an ecosystem where there's easier and easier ways and cheaper and cheaper ways for people to get this data on themselves then there's an ecosystem that can live within the same player where it's like how can we process this so you're not just sending you know raw accelerometer and gyroscope data and then you got to just learn how to deal with it right it because it just makes it easier for you know people like us like Humanity to then take that and then we're like hey well actually now that it's processed it's a few kilobytes and we now can do this very cool thing with it you know so okay so when you apply AI to all this data can we just unpack a little bit more like what that means because uh in this day and age we just say and then we do AI uh and so like that's where the variable reward is you press the button and Magic happens right yeah what magic am I going to see next so how does how does Humanity actually apply AI to produce meaningful results for its users yep and so we're doing something I wouldn't say simple but it's you know it's kind of like really good machine learning on it which is basically saying what so we see all these actions that people are taking and so we take all these values from your from your wearables from your from your phone we take values from your input you can say what your mood is you know if you're not monitoring your sleep you can put in you know your sleep so we take some manual input and so then we just we just take these all as these are these are actions we're not making any judgment on them whatsoever so a person did these actions and then we have this prediction that happens every single day using your movement pattern and your heart rate pattern if you have it and we're just saying okay this prediction is it predicting that you're going to be healthier in the future slightly or or less healthy in the future slightly so that's the end point so you can think of it in traffic navigation the end point they're trying to look at is time to destination right so they're saying this path takes five minutes that past six seven so we're basically saying okay it's a prediction of your future health better or worse and then if it was better you almost just like label back into that group of actions and say this seems to be a generally net positive group of actions for this type of person right so that's where the stratification is the most important and so you just do that repetitively every single day and you can take time periods you can start to understand if there's a lag between an intervention so maybe if you do a cold plunge we'll see your prediction of Health better in three days and not immediately right so you start to learn all this from the data but in the end it's it really is exactly that traffic navigation you're not trying to do a study on side streets versus highways you're basically like hey these cars were heading on all these different paths and all these edges put together made a better end point got you there in five minutes instead of seven so okay so uh let's talk about some of the healthy behaviors that are do actually move the needle so we have all of this data but most of the data is probably trash and some of the data is probably really really good you always got to be careful with that because I think the genetics space played this out very well yeah like these these are Gene encoding areas and then there's a bunch of Randomness that you know throw that stuff out and they're like oh that actually well nothing really some data is going to be more valuable than other data correct in the moment yes in the moment right and so like maybe we could actually just like zoom out and put Humanity aside we'll open up the app in a second but just like talk about what are the big behaviors that do move the needle for people that can actually be measured by things like our fitness trackers but there's like what are healthy behaviors that most people aren't engaging in that the humanity app or just longevity efforts would tell a user to to engage with yep so I think there's there's a bunch and and you need to be monitoring yourself and and the combination is important so I'll keep repeating that throughout but right um the combination and the one that probably people people couldn't understand that they're different and so they they pick up on that quicker like okay it works for him but it's not gonna work for me uh but the combination of things is makes a big difference right and that means like if you didn't get enough sleep I'm just making this up like if you didn't get enough sleep and then you do a high intensity workout it might actually be net negative uh if you got a bunch of sleep and you did high intensity it might be very positive right uh probably also the order of those two things also matters right yeah yeah exactly timing yeah yeah so order you can see so well with nutrition right so if you talk about like blood glucose and it's spiking and that that being generally bad at least you know according to what we know so far is you know if you go for a walk this is why some of these common Public Health messages get out there is because for a lot of people if you go for a walk right after a meal it drastically lowers any Spike that you might have gone no matter what you ate really um and so yeah they order in the combination and so what we sorry I lost the question again uh just what what are the behaviors that really move the needle yeah and what people always want to know so I'll list I'll list a few I think uh from our data I'll give it straight from our data we're actually seeing for some cohorts and you may or may not be in that cohort so please don't take this as a prescriptive thing in some cohorts moderate intensity activity seems very has very little impact really and so this kind of like stay in the you know just go for a moderate jog for some people from our data so far with 150 000 people seems to not really move the needle and so but the low low intensity which basically means like walking around and possibly kind of low intensity yoga that sort of stuff uh is is fairly impactful for most of the strata and high intensity has quite a variation in its impact but is every single strata needs some of it interesting but the moderate for for I'd say like we have pretty large different cohorts now but like let's say three of those cohorts I could just see the data in my head right now like three of them is just doesn't show up so when you said uh moderate activity doesn't move the needle uh can you define what that means to move the needle like what what does that mean so is it impactful in this multivariant analysis this group of actions that people are taking in a day does it seem to be impactful on reducing their probability of future disease okay so that endpoint that we're trying to affect and that's just based on scientific study that we are looking at for indicators of Health uh no that's that's directly from the data is is saying yeah so our prediction that we're getting from your movement pattern and your heart rate pattern on a daily basis that prediction doesn't seem to be moved impacted by in in a couple of the strata sure by the moderate and so that means it and you don't want to then immediately take that but and then jump to like oh well that's that's what we thought we'd find right but it is exciting now I'll admit it it's quite exciting to like see the real data now because I think in the longevity space it makes a lot of sense uh but again this is my own you know personal Michael gear kind of conjecture is you know there are certain things that you trigger in the body when you do high intensity exercise one of the main ones being a hypoxic response meaning your your cells think they're running out of oxygen and so they start cleaning up breaking down misfolded proteins like doing good stuff that makes your body stronger uh just getting nutrients to your body throughout the day which is you walking around and not sitting at your desk at your computer is you know it makes a lot of sense from a systems like physics you know you're gonna more consistently deliver more nutrients to all your cells throughout the day if you moving and your heart's pumping it just slightly higher and getting the blood around right and so that makes sense moderate you can't necessarily find a lot of uh kind of in the very high level longevity kind of framework be like oh it doesn't really do much more than the low intensity because yes you're moving blood around but you probably were moving blood around fine walking around and it's not reaching the point where you're getting a hypoxic response for your cells think they're running out of oxygen and so it makes sense that for some strata you don't you don't see much going on right and we would only really be able to know this if we have a lot of data and the models to be able to create these relationships I'm assuming right yep and so like one question I have is like going back to like what does it mean to move the needle there's one there's one perhaps way of making a health app which is going through all the literature and all the studies and all the doctors that say Hey this is good it's kind of the way that most health apps are made actually right and then there's another way of doing this which is just giving uh models AI models a bunch of data and then also cross-referencing that with how healthy these people are how long they live and actually have the AI models determine what is good exactly and then is that sounds like kind of more of the approach of the humanity app where you don't want to actually have like inputs as to what is good or what is bad you just want to input a bunch of data and have all of that data create relationships with itself and then have the AI model say like oh well this person's doing all these things and they are living longer and uh being being more healthy but not actually telling the models what health is allowing the models to determine what health is yep how does a model determine what health is so and then I can go back and give you kind of uh hopefully it'll be interesting kind of the the ins inside uh story of kind of the the daily struggle of running a you know running a company like Humanity um so the um the bass truth and a lot of a lot of people are starting to base models on this and it for different things like drug Discovery and things like that and I and I I I'm a I'm a Believer like uh there's some great people that Kristen Fortnight that runs bioage that kind of turned me on to this idea but you basically go to biobanks and biobanks are they're run by governments they're run by you know it's different institutions around the world uh different countries have them and biobanks are basically you follow the same people the same humans uh for decades and so this idea of like how do we actually know what's going to happen to the in the future is solved by by these biobanks where you have a bunch of measurements on these same people in the past so the UK biobank which were built most of our stuff on at the moment uh has about 18 years of about 500 000 people where they took a bunch of measurements on those people in the past 18 years ago and and throughout that time and then you have the actual what happened to them health-wise their health records for the next 18 years so this person you know what they look like 18 years ago and you know that they got cancer you know five years into that so you know 13 years ago right uh and so that's where you can to predict the future you only need Association you only need correlation right I think we're all fed that that Meme so many times we don't we don't know the difference causation yeah correlation is not causation but correlation is good enough to predict the future right correlation is correlation yeah and and if if the same things happen at the same time repeatedly right that's good enough to predict the future right and so and so that's what all these bottles are built on and to to kind of just maybe emphasize it a bit more uh to really put it in people's heads is anything you measure on the system in this case the human body years ago becomes a predictor of the future right of varying strengths some will be stronger predictors like meaning though they'll be more weighted into your prediction and some will be less but everything you know their their zip code where they live their their their movement pattern so in the UK biobank they hooked on accelerometers to these people very very good Force you know foresight by the way um you know 18 years ago about a hundred thousand of them and and heart rate monitors and so that's what our digital is is built on because we know the pattern of movement second by second pattern of heart rate second by second four people and then we know what happened to them in the future so we can make a prediction uh and so that's that's basically what all these predictions are built on so one thing that I'm kind of just excited to watch is that we're uh I would assume the amount of data that we are collecting from our wearables and also the strength and precision of our algorithms both are up only and probably in an accelerating fashion yeah and so and also when there's two things that are accelerating upwards the the what you can get out of that the competence oil is like it's like it's to the power of two right is the output of this is and so like what I'm thinking I'm excited about is to watch this Humanity app develop and strength and power and significance over time and so like can you just paint a picture of what you want humanity and what you want this part of the health industry to be like in five 10 15 years as AI gets better as data gets better what what can we do with this what's the bull case yep I think what we want to be is we and relate this to it here we we want to be a beacon to actually show at scale that you can basically take this data and then figure out exactly you know how to guide the person with it and so we want to we want to show that both it is worthwhile for us to do the little bit of work it takes to basically keep the data private but start training models on it because hey all these Humanity users are getting younger you know their probability of future disease is dropping right uh Humanities told me that I started at the app at 30.3 and I'm now at 29.7 Cold plunge cold plunge shout out coplunch yeah so I think that's one thing and then on the side and especially now that I've been in you know at zuzulu it's been quite uh it's it's motivated me even more to push because I because I think like I said blood's in the water with the AI like people now know like they feel it they taste the possibilities right and I think up into the echelons of of government people Now understand it to at least like hey there's potential here right right and so what we want to do is is be basically a beacon to show hey you want to start training models first of all you have a bunch of data so I think sometimes the conversation starts with how do we motivate people to start collecting the data's already there right you know the health systems have a ton of data every single Health tech company you know we have 150 000 users data like the data's there how do we unleash that data keep privacy of that data stop anonymizing it and it actually loses people privacy keep it private but start training models on it synthetic data is our path and I think that's I would love to see say in five years that we have a hundred million users you know me and my me and my co-founder have done it multiple times now we have 100 million users uh that are using our app and we want to continually be the best guidance app like we want to be the best you know it sounds mundane but like we want to be the best you know traffic Navigator but the best navigator for your health right so the ux UI the real Behavior maps for health is great it's a great model exactly yeah yeah and that we are very good at why we got into this is we're very good at people using an app and and changing their behavior because of the app all the things that we might not like about some of the the other you know social media apps like that stuff works to change behavior and we're using that to change health behavior right and so we want to do that but we also want throughout that process to have you know Montenegro to have different places start to actually use the data that they have on their servers to actually increase people's you know their lives right certainly yeah and so I'm gonna hit record on my phone here and we're gonna pull up the uh the humanity app and so uh congrats on actually introducing a new app into my life that's not an easy thing to do I haven't gotten a new app in years now but like I've been using uh Humanity for an uh uh ever since coming into zuzalu so there's four main I know I'm showing the screen but there's no point because you can't see that so like we're gonna put this on on the actual screen there's four main categories movement nutrition mind and Recovery uh and you get points on side on each different one each different vertical and the idea is to I think it's out of 100 points every single day yep and so you want to score as high as possible I've got 80 points so far so I got like 20 to go I've never gone higher than like 92 or 93 but I still it's showing me a blue color and I like blue it starts off red but blue feels makes me feel good got to get the blue uh and so like talk can you walk us through movement in mind and Recovery how like how do you know how many points to allocate to each one and how does that how does that math get determined yep so yeah like you said really well earlier we wanted to boil it down to things that are quite easy for the user to follow and getting more points in a day you know is an easy thing to follow what we do is we translates so we figure out how impactful is each of these actions will be for your type of person and still quite large strata uh you know 150 000 users but you know as we approach a million users that's they'll get more and more personalized but we see how impactful each of these actions will be and that then translates into how many points you're going to get for that type of action so my points are my points but if I get two points for doing this one activity that's because that app waited me to have those two points somebody else could uh be given a different weighting because of just the data that they have exactly and so when you're going through your guidance all very simple stuff once once you have that semi-complicated kind of backhand system very easy to then say hey we're just going to raise the guidance to you in order of the most points and you can scroll through you can decide hey I'm not going to do that I'm going to do that right uh you got to do your meditation I I skip my meditations I'm I'm naughty on my meditation sorry to call you which is why which is why my mind is my mind part is at the lowest which makes sense because I'm a chronic user of Twitter and other things like this but you're expanding your mind here at Zuzu so it's all good but yeah so then that's that's how we apply all the all the science and all the tracking in the back end then just gets applied to you're getting you know as you go you know maybe we need to give you four points for meditation and then we'll then we'll get you over the edge the longer that I go without meditating the app starts to wait okay you need to meditate a little bit right now so okay nutrition movement mind recovery I would assume like as more data is available more pillars could come online based off of what the models and the data suggest yeah yeah it's quite simple right now the the cool thing is you also get a bit of a kind of a crowd a crowdsourcing thing that will be going on sure we'll we'll more and more allow people to actually enter in things that they're trying or doing and so our our thing is like take everything at face value if someone thinks something's work hey do it but now we're giving you a method to actually measure whether it's working or not and if there's enough people that are doing that intervention that that action then we'll start to see who it's working for for who and in combination with what other actions right so it sounds like a complicated Matrix but that's the great thing that you know computers and AI are very good at keeping these things straight so speaking of complicated Matrix I think one other we were talking about okay more users are wearing more wearables so there's more data out there the missing part of that that I forgot to bring up is wearables are actually getting better yep and so we're not only are we getting more data but our wearables are actually getting more precise about things yeah so like is the bull case for this is like almost any variable about the human body like our our glucose in our blood our insulin levels like et cetera et cetera is actually going to become more and more measurable and that's just all gets fed into this at this app that you're building yeah yeah and it's happening very quickly and and like you're saying that then you get an exponential effect of like the the thing that we're missing right now other than you know Humanity uh doing it is we're just not using the data but yeah once once more people are using that data like we are I think yeah then the acceleration comes from better measurements uh measuring different things and everything is an indirect measurement I think people forget that like everything is an indirect measurement you're not you're not necessarily you know measuring the molecule happening in the cell but the great thing is all of those things when you have enough of that data you can understand what that indirect measurement means right you triangulate I think is what we were you know saying you triangulate a couple of these things together just like heart rate and movement pattern and you're vastly ahead of where you were with just one of them so yeah and maybe we can take this back to the beginning which is uh this is a perspective uh at a vantage point that the traditional Health Care system has not been able to have or be able to operate with and so with all of this data and with this data being made available to everyone uh what is your what is your hopeful case for the healthcare industry as it is able to to change and adapt to this new new paradigm yeah that's a great question um well one hope is I see that I hope they see us much later in life all right guys you're not going to see me for a few decades you know that's one hope um I think the other thing is I mean we started to see this a bit in covid and honestly it took us about six months into covid to start even or at least you know people talking about it was hey we have all these different treatments so once people are already in a bad way they need to go into the hospital we have all these different treatments and all different hospitals are like we're desperately trying to try different things because we wanted to save these people it's like do ventilators help do ventilators not help who do ventilators help and who do they not help like we were trying to get this Matrix and it started to get organized a little bit but I think it showed like a promise for the future is like you should walk into that hospital visit on that unfortunate day that you need it and they should have it pretty personalized to know hey we've read all these things off of you know David's body or Mike's body and we now can have basically a diagnosis but much more importantly we know we want to get David's body back to this right stabilized and healthy point and we know the routes that we've done that on for other people like David right and so you again you're you're less trying to categorize things you're just letting the AI say we have seen this before right and we know how to get this person back to that that we know the path right right where the current uh practice of medicine is probably just so blunt as in just so like it produces best practices for standard of care comes from a very sometimes not varied enough population of views of patients and and sometimes too varied in the sense that the standard of care is like the the least harm that we can do to the general population right unfortunately you're not the general population right yeah when you walk into a hospital you are treated as if you are general population which you both are and you are not right and with this Noob world with you can come in maybe they scan your wearable download all of your data and be like here's what this person is here's how they're different from the general population here's a much more surgical intervention that we can apply that's appropriate for this person based off of that data rather than having to like go to a textbook book that did some study about some people that aggregated some data and made some blanken statement about all of these people that it and the only reason why we operate on that uh with that study is that because we prove that it didn't harm any people and it provided some marginal benefit that's our current way yeah and the the new way is just something far more precise yep yeah and and I will I will say this I think um we're seeing we're seeing kind of an analogy with like large language models just a shout out to the AI Watchers uh I think there's been a lot of talk like well we need to we need to compute like the world's data uh and spend you know 100 million dollars to create a good llm but even just months later we're seeing people do it with like much less compute right like sampling data like all the stuff that like saves money and time and and pretty decent results from it right those llms those smaller llms are actually like performing pretty well and so I think I don't want to I don't want people to come away being like if only every single human on earth was measured with a ton of stuff and we feed that into the system I think a lot of benefit comes from just a few extra things that we're measuring and just acting on them right with an algorithm of saying hey we did this to this type of person and this happened it's it's really the biggest thing that we don't do now is we don't take that result of that thing and then feed it back and train the algorithm more like we don't we come up with a standard of care that comes from maybe some study that they did at a couple hospitals and then we basically stopped feeding data into the system for the next 10 years right that standard of care just like statically lives right right and the biggest thing is we need to keep feeding the results in and be like hey actually it seems you can both personalize it more because you do that because why did it work for that person it didn't work for that person you get so many of those cases that you then your algorithm gets smarter it's like oh actually for this person we always do this type of person we always do this thing right and so I think I don't want to I want people to understand that it just using the data that we almost already have we can do much better very quickly so Michael thank you so much for for guiding us on this conversation thank you David if people are interested in trying out the humanity app where can they go yeah so uh if you have an iPhone you can use it right now so just go to the App Store put in like Humanity Humanity Health uh and uh yeah check it out and we love feedback you know we're constantly learning and growing and you know the more data we have the better it is for every single user and then Android is coming soon I'm uh I'm an Android User uh so I feel the pain of the Android users but yeah we want to be very inclusive so the Android's coming soon uh and then I think if anybody out there is interested in you know opening up Health Data synthetic data kind of uh looking at things like that where you're preserving the privacy of data but then allowing models to be built on it Federated learning I would love I'm I'm open to all conversations so I would love to talk about that too awesome Michael thank you so much thank you David cheers [Music]
