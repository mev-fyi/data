[Music] welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front around the opportunity this Ryan Shawn Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we are here to help you become more Bank list David how are you doing this week my friend doing really good just came out of a fantastic interview with the Winklevoss twins getting the Winklevoss onto the bank list podcast was an absolute blast and picking their brains about how they think about this space where they think this space is going and also where Gemini is going is was it really insightful really tip of the hat to the Winklevoss twins to building a really awesome exchange and in my opinion building something that is going to be really successful and crucial infrastructure into the future Ryan what did you really enjoy about this interview look III think it's cool cuz you know who hasn't seen the social network right you know it kind of felt like we were interviewing celebrities in their own right but now the Winklevoss twins are big into crypto and have really developed a compelling exchange offering but I like this because we were able to ask questions that I think a lot of people in crypto haven't asked them so talking about defy talking about Bank less at one point we we brought up the subject well how can defy how can crypto banks remain neutral in this space will they become just like the traditional banks if given enough power and they had a good answer to that I think one of my big takeaway is really from from this conversation is they see Gemini as being a bridge almost an interface for money protocols with Bitcoin and ether being sort of the first of a set but then also die they seemed open even to to integrating the dye savings right and possibly compound protocols like ave down the line they seemed open to that and when you brought up the protocol sink thesis they nodded their heads yes basically yeah I think the protocol sink thesis is going to be a very reoccurring question for all incoming guests on the bancos podcast and it was really exciting to hear their appreciation of that thesis and so in the Bitcoin space we often see you know Bitcoin banks things like block bi things where you deposit your Bitcoin and you get some banking services and I think Gemini there and behind the scenes what I think is kind of going on is there's a race to become the defy Bank right so we talked about what would it take for companies like Gemini to be compliantly integrating something like a maker dowel volt or any sort of other financial services based on the protocols found on aetherium so that's really where the we end up in this conversation but we go through and kind of get the history of the the Winklevoss twins Ryan you did a really good job expanding on the metaphor of building out their rowing team in the in the town that no one had a rowing team in and then using that as an extrapolation for how the Winklevoss seemed to be ahead of the curve so really fantastic interview in fact it was such a great interview that we have decided to cut the big picture segment out of this particular episode and we will be releasing that as a its own standalone episode on Wednesday there was a ton of stuff that has happened in the etherium and crypto space and me and Ryan go on for almost an hour talking about it and so we didn't really want to have a two and a half hour long episode so we broke that part of the episode out and are releasing it as a standalone episode coming this Wednesday as a bonus episode so stay tuned for that a little extra bank less content coming your way this week before we get into the interview though let is let's talk about our sponsors our first sponsor is monolith if you guys have your assets inside of aetherium but you also want to live your life monolith for our European customers might be the product for you they have their defy card which is a Visa card connected to a smart contract wallet on aetherium so that when you go to the store you buy your coffee you buy your groceries you swipe your monolith card and then your die gets deducted out of your smart contract wallet sold for dollars and then you make a both a transaction on ethereum and a transaction on the visa Network really crucial infrastructure for people that want to live a bank list life but don't really want to compromise and be that weird friend that doesn't have any real money [Laughter] like that so you can download the app at monolith dot X Y Z to get your bank list visa card today and then you can get some of the world's economic activity placed onto the etherium network all right guys I am super excited to introduce you to our next new sponsor ramp what is holding crypto back it's really getting fiat into the crypto system that's what's holding defy back the problem is a new user has to create an account with an exchange to buy some crypto they have to wire funds they have to go through a whole bunch of steps what's holding defy apps back the exact same thing users drop off in the signup process and it really limits the defy market to hardcore crypto people but no longer ramp solves that ramp has a delightfully easy Fiat on-ramp service so it lets users get crypto eath dai us DC in five minutes or less that's right five minutes or less no exchange needed and a new user can have crypto right into their account and start using the app so if you are a developer this takes about 10 minutes to implement they've got very easy-to-use api's apps like defy apps like zarion aetherium tourists are using ramp you can visit ramp network to see how easy this is this is really an opportunity for defy developers to 100x they're addressable market size this is like the ultimate growth hack and here's what's cool if you mentioned bank lists they will on-ramp the first 100k from your app of USD three so that's a hundred K free when you mentioned Bank lists go to ramp dot Network and check it out ra MP dot network mention Bank lists and check it out all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini exchange okay we are in for a special episode today David and I are here with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss they are the cofounders of Gemini partners at Winklevoss Capital rowing Olympians they were involved in the original idea behind Facebook you may have seen them in the social network these guys have done a lot including sea crypto extra-early my first question Cameron to you is how did you get at Winklevoss on Twitter before Tyler man it's a great question the simple answer is Cameron Winklevoss doesn't actually fit Twitter doesn't give you enough space for that handle so we figured someone will take we go Bob better be one of us because someone else yeah nice Tyler do you ever ask if you could you know share that account or is it all Cameron's it's definitely Cameron's a lot of people sort of taught me on Twitter and say oh why do you get it and not you and I guess cause like yeah Cameron's reasoning my name fits by default and his doesn't which i think is actually the cooler thing but I guess so okay so speaking of reasonable minds we want to start here because something that I think is super fascinating about you guys is you tend to see things early like that's been the case so seeing Facebook before Facebook in the early 2000 and they're really Ott's pretty incredible but also seeing crypto before and Bitcoin specifically before most of the population saw it like back in 2012 my first question is how do you guys see these things so early like is there a recipe is there a formula can you teach us how to do this you know it's a it's an interesting question and I think we've definitely asked ourselves that before and I think part of it comes down to just a lot of curiosity and we tend to approach problems with a total beginner's mind so we don't have all these like preconceived notions or idea or assumptions that we bring with us when we're evaluating a new thing and that was definitely true with Bitcoin when we found it in 2012 and it was also true with social networking in in the early 2000s most people were not did not believe that people would be readily sharing information and photos online it was not a popular concept at all in fact most people online we're using avatars to basically cloak their identity or have some level of privacy so this idea that people would be themselves and really want to establish their online identity and Link it to their real-world identity that was novel and I think we just thought that you know we believed in that concept that that your your real-world identity will eventually be mapped on to your online identity and it was definitely not a popular belief at the time but we we sort of you know it made a lot of sense I guess instinctually to us and we we sort of shut out the noise in that regard because if you look around everywhere else people are always looking for for identity and belonging in a group whether it's your college you're an alumni of the university or high school or sports team so it felt like that's pretty common human behavior that's existed forever why would the online world be much different and so we weren't I guess distracted by a lot of the noise out there do you guys think that's a problem like is that why people miss crypto I've heard so many stories about you know people seeing it reading an article in 2011/2012 and then just dismissing it at the time picking it up maybe later we even saw like Goldman released a report today where they talked about Bitcoin being too ups you know or our favorite analogy we're back to the tulips again like yeah it's that the problem are people you know traditional finance people who dismiss crypto are they're just not looking at this thing with a beginner's mind so I think there's a couple things at play here one of them is absolutely the people are not approaching it with a beginner's mind and sort of this carp launch and open thinking and ability to say okay wait a second this is a totally new area what are what are the what's the promise behind it what is the inherit benefits or whatever but stepping back why do people not approach problems with a beginner's mind and I think a lot of that could be because you became the master of the universe in something for decades in the traditional world of finance and you're forced to basically disrupt yourself and challenge all the things that you hold dear and that you understood and you have to reinvent yourself and it's costly and time-consuming and takes conviction an effort and a lot of people just don't want to effectively disrupt themselves and reinvent themselves and those that do and are willing to kind of challenge that over and over again are the ones that are able to see a rep you know the next wave the next future so there's a lot of that behind their inability to you know see the promise here or unwillingness because they have you have an existing franchise and customer base and you you people like what they know so I think that's a large part of it it's also why you see you see crypto there's sort of the breakdown on the believer is versus a non-believers a lot of it is just an age thing and not because people who are older can't get these ideas but because like Cameron said they've acquired this experience the skills they have an asset that all of a sudden may not be relevant in the New World Order of crypto and so whenever you talk to millennial like they they're totally bought in you never convince a millennial about Bitcoin because they ultimately they have very little to lose if you're 18 in high school just out of high school even a college student you have like- Deleuze right you have like student loans so it's not like you built this whole career and you have like real estate and mortgages to uphold and you know this whole life in this system that you all of a sudden have to give up so that's definitely part of it why you know I think why a lot of people don't get it I think believe it or not people a lot of people are inherently pessimists they they don't see maybe the new opportunity or they're not motivated by it we've always been motivated by increasing choices you know in trading new alternatives and this kind of goes back to even our days in high school there was actually no crew team at our school our next-door neighbor went to boarding school he's a little bit older learned how to row and was successful we heard about his exploits and we decided like we were tall we knew he kind of had to build we didn't really know what that meant but just like some of those tall knows that maybe they could be good at basketball we understood that being tall might be good at rowing so we found a rowing club started rowing from this amazing coach really liked it and then went to the headmaster and started the team at our school and effectively we manufactured this opportunity for ourselves to become athletes in a certain way that didn't exist and it's simply because we we asked the question like why doesn't this exist there's plenty of water there's actually a rowing club 30 45 minutes away all the elements are here we can do this and of course we manufactured we created that opportunity we joked that it was very much our first startup we wrote in college and then wrote in the Olympics that never would have happened if we had accepted the world around us and the options that were available to us and so I don't know like is it thinking outside the box but we really were like curious and like like Cameron said and we wanted greater choices and we just didn't accept we asked the question didn't just accept what there and we've continued to do that whether it was social networking hey let's we go to school in in Boston this you know and there's so many universities there's so many students yet we're coming into our junior year we don't really it doesn't feel like everyone's in their bubble and everyone's busy and we want a better way to connect with students so we thought there was like a better way for possibility and social network was that sort of way to express it and then taking that further to to money when we saw this idea we didn't dismiss it like skeptics or pessimists we're like okay what is money today and what's wrong with it and what is this thing and why does it have merit or doesn't and like we weren't completely sure at first I think Cameron said to me this is either complete or the next big thing but let's let's take a look let's at least like take it seriously and give it some credibility because the smartest people in the room are so passionate about it they're putting every penny of their life all their time and so that dedication was was really interesting and we we sort we we decided to look more which isn't saying that much but I guess it's a lot more than most people did that's not some great background with you guys in the the story of how you got started the rowing team I feel like is a preamble of what's to come or what came with Gemini so before we get into Gemini can maybe you guys can illustrate what you saw in crypto that really brought you into the world of crypto like and maybe some of your pre-existing beliefs about the world like were you guys Austrian economics or did you believe in the Austrian school do you did that change your mind coming into the crypto space or how what did you see in crypto and how has that changed you guys now that you guys are in the world so we both actually majored in economics in in undergrad at Harvard but I think that it wasn't really until least for me personally when I saw Bitcoin when I really started to challenge my understanding and belief of money and I think we look at Bitcoin from a lot of different angles and I'm not sure that necessarily all fits under one school of thought there's elements of a lot of them in there but I think the you know the store of value properties are clearly obviously very important right if you're trying to create a hedge to fiat currency regimes which on average have a lifespan of 27 years and people who live in the US we never really challenged you know the idea of the dollar it's what we've known it's been a very pretty good medium of exchange and store value for for a long period of time but that's not true of many in most parts of the world and so fiat currency in general creating alternatives like stores of value are very important to protecting people's value and then there's the elements of censorship resistance and all these other interesting ideas around payments that Bitcoin comes along with so I'm not sure if it was like one thing for us but we love the idea of like a new system that is essentially enforced by a cryptography in math and incredibly transparent and open you there's no inside baseball with with the with Bitcoin there is no sort of Federal Reserve behind closed doors people making decisions and then explaining to the rest of us what's going on it's all open kimono and open source now it doesn't it's not necessarily the only system but it you know it's it's amazing that that system and that opportunity at least exists in addition to the you know previous system you know it's really interesting you say that so like something that that resonates I think about about your story and how you purge things like philosophically and escaping your mean bubble and disrupting yourself and all of these things but you also seem to think in like nonzero-sum games like win wins right so a lot of people in crypto I think are here to disrupt the state and tear down the existing system but I get the sense that you guys are a bit more along the ethos of well like this system is new and different it's not necessarily going to completely disrupt the old traditional system but we're going to create this new system in parallel that's going to have its its advantages so it's a little bit like rowing right when you're growing up you added rowing to the roster of other sports that were offered in your community it didn't take away from those other sports it provided a new alternative is that how you see it yeah I mean look we didn't start the rowing team to just destroy the football team we created it to create more choice more independence and more opportunity and I think the same is true with crypto it's another system another choice you know another opportunity and interestingly if you actually spend a lot of effort trying to destroy the previous system or the existing system you are actually you know reducing one option for a choice yes you're reducing a system or eliminating or trying to eliminate a system that a lot of people still use and plus you piss off all the football players and they could be on your side they could be good rowers exactly exactly yeah and you'll see some athletes will change sports like that just like some a lot of people in Wall Street have our leaving Wall Street to join crypto you know did email disrupt completely snail mail no you know and sometimes you have to actually physically send something through mail an email it doesn't quite work so you know I think we we view crypto as as like a new color as opposed to like trying to be better you know better at read a better read or something a different shade of red and you know the the the are like gold for instance I mean people yeah this this us versus them I think the 0 something is definitely not our our style just like the argument that gold disrupts us you know a share of Apple stock doesn't make a lot of sense to me like do we really believe in a good in a world where you know gold is the only asset or the only currency like gold can be currency but generally people have shifted to to fiat currencies and and it's been a currency and money has been this ten thousand year old experiment and ultimately there's so many different ways to express yourself there's so many different definitions of money and crypto is just the latest iteration of it but like if people if they're going to stir up something it's gold or if it takes away but I think it's very hard to be all things to all people you know at least you know you have to be I think focus is super important and I think ultimately assets and what they do and how they perform is very specialized like if you look at the different go to the Olympic Village and you'll see how different different athletes are the physiques the sizes the shapes the tall short you know LeBron James is the best basketball player in the world but and Nadia Nadia Comaneci was maybe the best gymnast of all time they're the world's best at what they do they're both athletes but they'd be terrible at each other sports so I think I think there's a there's there's a a big spectrum of like of assets of currency of money and it's hard to be everything so in Bitcoin there is a wide spectrum of people that have different stances towards you know Authority or the state right like you have the the ultra libertarians who want nothing to do with the state believe in crypto anarchism but I believe what you guys are saying where there is this zero where there's no zero-sum games between Bitcoin and legacy systems and there's actually room for more people to kind of have one foot in both camps I see that reflected in the ethos of Gemini where you guys are very strongly making your brand about how Gemini is like a very compliant very regulated following the rules type of financial institution where people who are perhaps maybe nervous or scared about crypto can start to actually look at the Gemini company and see a lot of familiar features there can you guys talk about the ethos behind Gemini and if that reflects reality or not sure that definitely I think is a good assessment of what we're trying to do and and we grew up in the Wild West of Bitcoin the early days when it was a Bitcoin world we bought a lot of Bitcoin on Mount Cox which famously imploded a few years later thankfully we weren't injured in that implosion we you know when we purchased coin we pulled it off exchange shortly thereafter never really wanted to be exposed to the counterparty risk of an exchange being run by two Frenchmen in Tokyo that was a pivot from a magic the online gathering exchange didn't feel like safety and soundness was was a core principle of mal Cox and through that experience we said look as amazing as this technology is or might be if we can't build and earn and maintain trust in this new asset class and demystify a lot of the things that are you know that people have questions around then it's never really gonna go mainstream and I don't think you can point to a market a viable thriving market anywhere in the world that doesn't have some element of thoughtful regulation it just doesn't exist maybe you know some people have this view that it's perhaps possible with the right incentives but but we just haven't seen it and so when we started thinking more about okay how how do we really get Bitcoin mainstream we thought about investing in an exchange and ultimately decided that we should just go build one because most people were thinking about the problem from a technology lens or solely from that that narrow perspective saying you know I can build a matching engine that's more reliable than mal Cox and has more uptime but there's there's a lot of key considerations one of which is security of course and we've always sort of operated with a security first mentality with Gemini and then there's a big piece around compliance and licensing and you can't get a bank account or get banked as a business if you don't have licensing and a compliance function and those are hard problems that are not a lot of fun to solve for but are really necessary and important to getting a license and also to a large number of people who want to enter the space of crypto so we you know I guess the the way to sum up the ethos of Gemini is we started by asking permission not forgiveness we went in the front door of regulators engaged with the New York Department of Financial Services and decided you know we want to pursue a trust company license in New York not just for institutional customers but also for individuals the entire spectrum and we want to create the highest bar of compliance and regulatory oversight available at the time so that people when they enter this new asset class which is kind of a scary thing for a lot of people and I think a lot of people stayed on the sidelines like they understood conceptually and they loved Bitcoin but they didn't think there was a safe way to get involved and and that's that's a fair assumption when you look at the history of you know behavior in the space it's been a lot of unfortunately there's been a lot of hacks and and problematic behavior that doesn't engender trust so we we really said you know we've got to help correct this narrative and let's see if we can start building and maintaining trust with people yeah I think a lot of people who are capable in the space and you know even memory fade people but people forget how crazy it was back in that era of 2012 and in 2013 I mean most everybody was dismissing crypto as this tool for drug dealers basically right you know Silk Road yeah like it was we didn't even we didn't feel comfortable going public with our investment for about sick right it was embarrassing what are you like India like yeah yeah exactly Road I'm like no that's not like listeners here like who are new to crypto I mean the the the largest crypto exchange in the world was formerly a Magic the Gathering card exchange and just pivoted to crypto like that's where we were back in 2013 right mt.gox is the you know the acronym for Magic the Gathering online exchange that was that was the base I think it was the only I mean there was probably other exchange at the time but it was about 95 percent of Bitcoin USD volume and they actually had a lot of other fiat currency pairs too that was the price discovery mechanism of Bitcoin for years that and and and was the main ability to source back in 2012 it's pretty bad yeah and it was it was also like if you people in storing big point I'm not gods was super difficult and if you actually this is a shame but if you if you pick up a copy of billionaires there's a chapter that goes through of how we actually stored a lot of our Bitcoin on paper shards in different banks and safety deposit boxes and this whole sort of Mission Impossible type endeavor and we just knew that that was like not feasible for for most people there's just not that many State people positive boxes in the world or in the country so we had to make it easier and more yeah yeah absolutely I mean it's really a process of you guys making the infrastructure to go recruit the football team you know to rowing basically that's what you're doing with Gemini and it it totally makes sense hey guys just want to pause the interview real quick and talk about our sponsor Ave Ave is a defy lending and borrowing platform with a COO with some new cool features that you might not be used to compared to other borrowing and lending applications on etherium first and foremost the feature that stands out to me the most is their fixed interest loans and so you know variable interest loans can get pretty hairy right so maker Dow launched at 0.5% and then it slowly Sky Rock it slowly ramped up to 20% which is which is a very wide range of possible interest rates and it's not really sustainable for you know some of the more typical things and so that's where Ave comes in with their stable non variable interest rates where you can lock in a specific interest rate and borrow against borrow assets using that interest rate and being able to depend on that fixed interest rate really important a really important money Lego that we need in the dphi space to really have dphi grow and mature in a dependable way but that's not all you can do you can also do flash loans on Ave which is also a brand new money Lego where you can borrow you can borrow assets at without any collateral so long as you also repay it back in the same transaction so there's a lot of potential here if you want to pay back collateral but open up a different loan with different collateral you can do that all in one transaction without all the slippage costs so Ave and there won't allow you to do that they are the number four biggest application in defy coming in at 70 million locked in defy right now the banquet community really loves Ave and and we've just been watching Ave climbed the ranks of the of the defy market cap so check them out at of a calm deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any aetherium wallet will work so try it out I want to introduce you to a new sponsor on the Bank list podcast Malta's Malta's is a way to run your business without a bank so we talk a lot about the bank list lifestyle from a personal perspective but what if you could run your entire business without a bank that's what Malta's provides it's the first-ever bank 'less bank account for entrepreneurs who want to use crypto and traditional staple coin currencies to run their business so it has a multi signature wallet that means you can give teams access controls one person can have the ability to withdraw from an account set limits so it has a multi signature wallet that means teams can get involved here you can set access controls you can take your stable coins and some of your assets and you can earn interest with various money protocols well you have them parked inside of the multis account you can streamline payments there also adding Fiat on-ramp so there'll be a bridge to traditional finance with US dollars and euros you can open an account this is super easy to do we've actually featured it and written about it on bank lists we will include an article in the show notes but what you need to do now is open an account and try it out at wwm Altis co so that's M ult is Co and of course we've got something for Bank lists listeners Malta's is brand new their newest releases is is new they're on waiting list mode only now but listeners of the podcasts can jump the queue when you enter Bank this podcast in the forum when you sign up so make sure you do that enter Bank list podcast and you'll be able to skip the queue you'll get a one-month free trial of Altice if you are a business trying to go bank list this is the way to do it at small Tesco check it out okay let's continue the interview with Cameron and Tyler so so there's this like evolution though in exchanges that we're starting to see you know we call sometimes exchanges crypto banks and they're really turning into full service offerings that are doing more they started out as custody and trade but now they're starting to tackle some of the other money verbs like staking for instance or like lending and borrowing and some of them are even going like you know the by Nance hundred and twenty five x margin option that you can trigger how do you see these crypto banks evolving and is that Gemini's path to are you going to start essentially offering more of the money verbs and you bring you folks scriptor that way so I think long term I think that is one of the most exciting parts of crypto and why I think ultimately were we're in this space and we really are super passionate because when you look at the world there's a billion plus unbanked people out there in this country alone there's millions of unbanked or underbanked individuals and if the banking community and system could could Bank them they would and there's a lot of problems around identity that's part of the issue is how do you like identify and authenticate and verify an individual because that's obviously an obligation in a requirement I think ultimately we're headed in that direction and Vic you know Gemini started out as a is a very straightforward sort of spot Bitcoin exchange by cell store and that actually involves multiple businesses under sort of one roof because in the typical world of equities for example you've got your brokerage like in each raid you've got an exchange like New York Stock Exchange you've got the DTC sea which clears the transaction and then you've got a custodian like State Street there's about four major custodians State Street being one of them Bank of New York and JPMorgan and Northern Trust and and these businesses are well over hundreds years old and so in the existing equity market you have all these sort of pieces split apart in crypto one of the cool things I think it's most people don't quite realize is we've been able to build greenfield and and imagine and actually collapse or sort of integrate the full stack at least on the side of virtual commodities like Bitcoin and whatnot so we think there's a lot of interesting efficiencies there it also makes it kind of challenging to say what we actually are we often say oh we're a Bitcoin exchange but it's really a lot more than that and so I think the right word is platform we are effectively a platform and we will be adding a lot more services over time and and I think we'll continue to do more and more services that look and feel like a bank now whether we actually become a bank that that's a you know an open question because there's a whole new regulatory regime you know that is involved with with providing banking services but there's a lot you can do with a trust company so this is really interesting because I you know I I have some mixed feelings about this I think folks in the the Bank list community do as well so on the one hand what we love is the fact that you guys are going and recruiting the football team and bringing like Wall Street traditional finance closer and also protecting users making it easier to buy lots of people aren't going to self custody as you said they need a an easy Fiat on-ramp at the same time there's a worry in the back of our minds that the crypto banks could start to become a bit more like the traditional banking system that we just left right so not necessarily Gemini but we look at things that that maybe by Nantz is doing and but there was a there was a recent fork on the Steam Network and it seemed like finance and the leaders of by Nance got involved and actually made some decisions as to which fork they were going to support it was a really a political decision essentially and some folks on the the fork that lost ended up losing their steam tokens so what's your take on that how do we make sure that the the new crypto banks of the future don't become like the old ones how do you maintain neutrality in a cryptic exchange like Gemini yeah I think I think it's it's also you know I'd start first by saying finance is unregulated I'm not aware of any licensure they have so so there isn't a sort of a stakeholder with oversight insuring that a company or organization does what they say they're doing they're you know bought it effectively auditing or providing an additional assurance to that so it's hard to it's definitely not an apples to apples comparison and I think a lot of people sort of they don't quite understand that difference a little bit and that is one of the major benefits to regulatory oversight is that we have somebody who's verifying and we also have legal obligations around our customers and consumer protections in privacy with that said I think that you know I think that it's important what's what's interesting is is a lot of people got into the internet through AOL America Online which was effectively a closed system the walled garden of the internet and AOL did a phenomenal job of onboarding millions of people into this crazy new cyberspace world and and then people eventually they sort of migrated beyond a while AOL did not keep up with with the times and it was you know for many reasons the the internet move it's it's become more closed over time right it's sort of it's open then it gets closed then it sort of opens it seems to be closing again and I think the innovation tends to push push that you know open again and I think we're now that's what we love about crypto in many ways is is that Bitcoin offered a blueprint to decentralize the world and so you're we're going to see projects especially around web three that are decentralizing decentralized services so what I what I think is and perhaps to go may be a little more specific to your your question or the thought is that a lot of people you know will will onboard into crypto into an exchange like Gemini and and they'll be perfectly fine and happy with that but but there may be people who start with Gemini and move into a more defy world and it's also possible you know we I mean we are very interested in defy that we continue to move in that space as an organization as well so I think that you're going to see a lot of evolution and and taking a snapshot today is not going to be reflective of where we're we're gonna be in five or ten years from now yeah and I think another thing to note is the different needs of different people customers there are engineering trade-offs between a decentralized exchange and centralized exchange you just couldn't have the volume liquidity and price discovery today at least on a Dex as you could on a centralized exchange so the big market makers the big high-frequency algorithmic traders are used to centralized finance and Wall Street is really it's the the street in in downtown New York City is really symbolic Wall Street's actually a bunch of servers in the parking lot in you right now and every inch that the server moves closer to the exchange matching engine matters and it's probably like you know centimeters matter the kind of thing and so but the more just centralize you get the less speed and less of that performance that you have to it's a trade-off and so like there's been a movement in capital markets and Finance over the last quarter quarter century to actually move things together for that performance obviously that comes at a cost of decentralisation so going back to sort of like is there one currency to kill all to be all currencies you know it was Bitcoin can it be everything to everybody and right now as like an exchange custodian platform it's hard to be everything to everybody because of these engineering trade-offs and the different needs and demands of customers so I think there's like the future where there's a couple of different versions of Gemini and if you really need like the high performance and you love the regulated centralized part then we'll have a stack for you if you want to you know decentralize the clearing and settlement part or the custody then there may be like a hybrid stack and going to the other extreme there may be like a pure play decentralized stack so I think there there's there's a future where where you may see different versions of Gemini and it sort of like depending on the customer pick your adventure and this is how I sort of think about like the Gemini dollar which is a centrally issue in regulated stable coin versus let's say something like Dai which is a decentralized algorithmic stable coin if you're JP Morgan you may love and thing that dye is super sophisticated in the future but you may not be able to do business or handle a stable coin that isn't centrally issued and regulated by a regulatory you know you just may need to know the counterparties and so they're different they're different things they're both trying to be stable value mediums of exchange and in decentralized finance on the blockchain but depending on who you are as a customer your compliance department your needs like one may just be a non-starter for you yeah Tyler since you mentioned JPMorgan I yeah I got a ask so jamie dimon a few years ago made the statement that your bitcoin is tulips what's a fraud it was going to crash to nothing captain the football team right now JPMorgan is actually banking Gemini and coinbase you know that just happened I think this month how is that a big deal or like beyond the headlines is that a really big deal for traditional finance to essentially start servicing and working with with crypto exchanges it is in our opinion at least so the process of opening a bank account with JPMorgan took over two years which included extensive due diligence of our compliance program we had to go through risk committees reputational committees and ultimately what you saw there was an a Wall Street Journal article that we got the baking relationship is the culmination of two years in the making so in sort of going back to Jamie diamonds comments like look really smart brilliant people get things wrong all the time you know none of us are perfect we sometimes make mistakes that way but I think it shows how good of a leader he is that he was able to you know look at the technical merits of of crypto ultimately get it and and get behind it or even if he you know I don't know if he's what his public statements have been but even if he doesn't he allows people in his organization to to get it and to understand any lets them run with it and yeah I definitely would seem like a big deal to to us into those on the outside sort of traditional finance plus crypto exchanges and that bridge being built you know I've I've kind of somewhat joked in the past that and I just used the name coinbase we could be Gemini coinbase is either going to get acquired by an Amazon or JP Morgan right so all I'm saying there is that I feel like big tech is going to enter this space in a big way and so is big banking how do you how do you kind of look at that with with the stable coins and Libra entering the market and then you've got traditional bags so you guys have bridged both both worlds you know social networking in the early 2000s and now now crypto and sort of on the banking side who wins is there a battle between big bro a big tech and Libra and big banking like the JP Morgan's of the world coming and who if so who wins well it's it's a really interesting insight that you have and I think what we're going to see is is crypto is really an intersection between finance in many ways and technology and cryptography and a lot of the you know existing financial institutions they don't have a technology game they don't have technologists in the organization who could build out readily no platforms and so the likely strategy may very well be to partner and/or acquire the technology that you can't otherwise build and it does make sense you know for a large financial institution to be looking at companies in crypto but it also makes sense for big technology companies to be looking at companies in crypto and it will be interesting to see who ends up doing more M&A work and and maybe they're both competing at these two different sectors competing on on the same companies which is obviously good for her price discovery and those companies to have more suitors running after them but it is you know we're seeing that intersection and and we saw the intersection with with with technology and other places like music and and movies and so in the you know took iTunes to come along to basically solve the Recording Industry of America's problems when it came to digital piracy they really struggled to move from the physical formats to mp3s and this goes back to what we were talking about in the beginning around beginner's mind and willingness to disrupt yourselves the Recording Industry and all of the record labels were unwilling to accept the future and the reality and to the point where they didn't just not accept it they fought it and they fought it aggressively for for a long time and technologists need just moved ahead of them and so you had Napster centralized piracy then you had Kazaa and BitTorrent and it goes on and on and on and it was always you know a step ahead of the of the actual recording industry and it took a company like Apple which is you know famous for always challenging the status quo to say you know what I there's a better way to do this there's a fair way to do it and when they when they invented iTunes and created songs Alucard for $1 apiece and it was fair consumers were like you know I'll I will pay for something that I feel you know is fair that I'm not getting ripped off I don't actually want this piracy experience I don't feel good about that most people don't we do want to support artists but we also don't want to get you know we don't like highway robbery so I think that um you saw that intersection there and then with with streaming and movies Netflix Apple TV Amazon Prime Hollywood the the biggest buyers of content in Hollywood is big tech who would have thought that right and you know you go to Sundance the film and and there's three people that you know there's three groups that are important and they're not from southern Los Angeles there you know Southern California Los Angeles though they're all now building I think studios down there and and they're gonna have big big presences so I think that financed the you know what you're saying about this intersection of finance and technology is going to happen in a big way and it's it's starting to happen but I think over the next decade it's gonna get really interesting going further on that note we've seen a lot of you know tech companies try and become banks in a way right like so Apple just has the Apple card now Starbucks has a billion dollars in loans from their from their their cards that have balances on them all these different tech companies are turning into banks in a little bit and a little bit of a way and then all-in likewise all these banks are trying to become closer to tech companies and turning to D Phi D Phi is really this perfect split between finance and tech where all these these D Phi teams look like Silicon Valley startups but they're building out what you would find in the legacy financial world so as we we're opening up the D Phi can of worms here so as we get down into that further into that rabbit hole how do you guys think that D Phi and crypto exchanges like Gemini intersect into the future so I think you know starting off what you're saying about banks and technology companies I think you know we work really well in concert together as we were mentioning just shortly before we're super excited about our partnership with JPMorgan and the fact that they're banking US banking is their core competency it's not our core competency our core competency is obviously crypto and I think that you know centralized exchanges in D Phi there's going to be a lot of great sort of partnership and working together in that in that area we just listed died on the Gemini platform we're super excited about it that's obviously a fundamental building block so we're we we think yeah we think we think it's awesome and we want to you know start we're starting by supporting projects and then continue to look at like how else we can integrate with projects or into that space it's obviously a newer space you know it almost reminds me where dick coin was many years ago but super exciting to see all the smart people and teams moving in there yeah so I'll just I'll just throw out there so I feel like we've had a lot of like Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin banks right and you guys pioneered one of them it feels like right now and I think I speak for the Bengals community and certainly David feels this way too we want a d5 friendly crypto bank right so a bank that is going to start onboarding the masses to defy protocols and Gemini listing dye is a fantastic start to that because the I of course is an algorithmic crypto backed open finance stable coin is that is that going to be you guys are you gonna is Gemini gonna be the defy friend friendly bag for us well we're certainly not gonna be defy unfriendly but we I think it's sorta lis possible we want to support defy projects we want to support web 3 and all of that exciting promise and so we're gonna be working hard to continue to support that and and it's sort of hard to predict what that might look like a year or two out from now because the space is evolving and moving quickly but we think it's a very important system in the crypto world but really in the world in general and what's going on there and so another project that we just listed on Gemini's link and bringing real world data into the blockchain and you there's so many interesting applications around that and building smart tracts with parametric information so for example an insurance contract where a lot of times people buy flood insurance and it you know you can set it to if the tide for example rises to this level the insurance pays out and it may or may not actually destroy the the building or whatever you're trying to insure but because you've picked an objective thing there's no question around it so to speak and it's a very kind of it's an efficient way to price insurance and make a determination after the fact but if you don't get the information into the blockchain then it it doesn't really work so putting that information into the blockchain and defy and smart contracts is super exciting because then you can just write contracts based on objective information so there's there's all kinds of possibilities it's really quite frankly unlimited at and endless in sort of going on to that theme a lot of times we think about Gemini as as a protocol company or rather a bridge between the old world of Finance and the new world of Finance and I think a lot of people don't understand how hard it is to speak to these protocols the different signing out algorithms like understanding deposits withdrawals and block chains they all have their own communities sometimes there's Forks that are planned sometimes there's sports that are unplanned just a lot of different things happen and if you list and support a bunch of different tokens for custody in trading you have to be up on current events at all of these different block chains and networks and the the idea of like a bank being able to attract the tech talent to be able to interface with these protocols is really hard and some of them have tried some of them don't they try and partner with like JPMorgan you know partners with a Gemini writer builds a relationship the Gemini we also have a relationship with statestreet to actually be the software sub sub custodian provider for them and their clients and they actually I think hired a bunch of blocking or engineers maybe a hundred fifty people to do this mission and decided like hey this is not really core to what we do let's let the the tech companies do that we'll take care of the banking so these massive companies State Street is a second oldest company in the country I think it's 225 years old have tremendous distribution networks in customer base is built in and so if we can connect those those portals to our bridge or portal into d5 that's incredibly powerful the other thing that people don't quite realize is that when you're a bank it's very hard to grow at the speed of tech grab tech multiples and in fact like if you have like more than 20% like year with your growth the regulators find that suspicious it's sticky drips when a bank grows too big and the FDIC who's the backstop and sure so the OCC and the Fed both regulate but the the the FDIC as well is really the final gate to get through for a banking charter you you you really wouldn't get the green light if you have like tech growth multiples because it doesn't really it's an odd bedfellow with the concept of growing a bank with with safety and soundness as your primary principal and objective and that's ultimately what this is what what bank regulators are concerned with is safety and soundness of institution so running fast and breaking things and moving at the pace of innovation is incongruous with being a large financial institution so there are so many different variables it's very hard for a zebra to change its stripes and I think a lot of people don't understand these distinctions and how specific they are to different players that maybe overlap but cannot play the same role so I think that like big finance is better off partnering collaborating with tech companies conversely like it's hard for big tech to come in here because they live in a world that's completely unregulated if you look at the like GDP are is sort of like these things are coming down but social media companies there's no regulation if people are upset about Cambridge analytic ah are these things like there were no rules broken you could disagree with philosophy or like that's not how I would run my company but they didn't do anything wrong in the eyes of the law whereas if you are actually regulated like a bank like GDP are is not like a new thing because you've been doing that for forever like you've been KY seeing people you've having you've been having their personal identifying their PII information and protecting that like like it's sacred for a long time you've understood like data and data protection so building a business that's like basically completely unregulated with respect to information and data and then coming in and all of a sudden having to like bolt on kyc is probably like also more difficult than it sounds so like once you get in motion and you build like these this philosophy like growth hacking run fast build you know break things and then you have to sort of like have the the act a little bit more like a regulated company I think that's also very difficult gem and I we've been we've been truck we've been trying to marry both from day one we joke we've got you know a hoodie on one supply on one side and we wear a suit on the on the other on the other side and we've been trying to marry the ethos of like Silicon Valley tech chops with East Coast like financial markets in regulation and threading that needle other companies that have had to do that and I think I've done that quite well for instance might be asked where they Silicon Valley visionary company led by a visionary leader but they also have money transmission license they just got an industrial loan bank charter so they've lived they've straddled both worlds and quite well and quite effectively and built something great and and it's much easier to start from day one saying we're going to you know have that formation and that's gonna be like our DNA then to come from you know one far side of the field or the other first side of the field and make your way into the middle I want to I want to bring up a subject that me and Ryan have been chewing on a lot recently this is a thesis that we have which we've been calling the protocol sink thesis and the concept is that you know blockchains things like Bitcoin and etherium offer these incredibly neutral protocols for everyone to use massively scalable found all over the world and you know all the good reasons that we love them and institutions or companies or services like Gemini but also others can tap into these protocols and use them as they see fit for their benefit and like just using Bitcoin and being an exchange on top of Bitcoin as they may be a very early example of this but with defy and the etherium aetherium is like this protocol of protocols right and what we call defy apps are really just individual protocols on top of aetherium each one offering its own level of credible neutrality or dependability that centralized companies like gemini can can leverage to better improve their product that they offer for their for their customers so you guys just listed die which is could be perhaps viewed as the protocol sync thesis where things companies centralized companies can leverage dependable protocols on blockchains like Bitcoin and cerium and because they're dependable in the same way that the internet is dependable because you can depend on die being there it's a good business decision for you guys to offer die and die trading on your website the thesis is that centralized companies like Gemini or crypto banks at large will use more and more of these protocols over time and the more dependable the better and so like if this thesis is correct we would predict that in the future Gemini my list might make available the die savings rates so not just having died on the platform but also being able to put it inside of the maker dabbe protocol and get an interest on it and then we could go even further and like maybe you guys just build out a an interface for the complete maker Dow protocol not in just including vaults but also governance and then there's so many other protocols that we could also talk about as well like compound of a any type of protocol can just be built in and have an interface built on it by a extreme exchange like Gemini and that makes Gemini a better exchange it makes Gemini have more better products for their customers so how do you guys feel about the protocols sync thesis and and and do you guys resonate with that future I think it's a very smart one and I think I think it's correct in many ways and I think that the more that we can offer to our customers the better and I think the more customers we can offer to a protocol I think it sort of benefits both sides or all parties involved if you will and I think you know it's almost like this this you can create the internet was a hard place to navigate free web browser and pre sort of search and so the more tools and experience you can give people to navigate these protocols the better and and if you can create a good experience because I think one of the challenges with a lot of the projects out there is it's like so hard to interact with them and that's just because it's early right it was hard to interact with Bitcoin eight years ago when we found it it was it was really tough you had to be highly motivated to to go buy it and then you had to be you know motivated to figure out how to store it and that's of course changed dramatically in in a short period of time and and I think that the same is true with defy and and and web 3 so i i i agree and a lot of that resonates with us yeah i was i was gonna choke like it sounds I feel like you've been sitting in some of our roadmap brainstorming meeting but uh but definitely love that you know obviously fate like phase one of Tripta was by sale store but I think earn or used you know all these other use cases have to look for herbs if you will have to happen and have to be a part of the gem my story and so yeah it's really hard to interact with tcp/ip and SMTP but then people build applications like Gmail on top of it and if Gemini is this application that can onboard people and help people in a user-friendly way interact with these protocols whether it's earning money which is a great it's a great environment right to have the die savings rate or something like compound because we're going we're a zero net or zero interest rates right now and Fiat world land and potentially going negative so but you know I love this idea of like yet like what we're talking about here is protocols and plug into protocols self-driving cars like the Internet of Things when it arrives like really arrives it will be able to plug into a protocol like a self-driving car but it will not be able to open up a bank account with JP Morgan and so my prediction is that one day Gemini maybe may have more customers they're actually not humans but actually machines now maybe a human has an account and sub-accounts off of their account where they run their fleet of self-driving cars but ultimately like will will be like KY seeing machines because machines need protocols and interact with protocols and can do micro payments on the blockchain when you know cars on the road it wants to pay another car to move ahead of it that's gonna happen in the protocol world so I'm gonna happen in ACH credit card you know Fedwire banking system and so that's the world that Gemini's the future the Gemini's built built towards and we're translating between the old in the new and we want to bring people into that new world is ultimately like I think that is just undeniable the future Gemini as a bridge to money protocols I've got to say is a really compelling vision for where you guys are going you know it part of that bridge that you brought in the past is obviously the the user experience you know that's kind of the the Fiat onboarding that sort of thing but it's also been the the regulatory aspect of it the regulatory clarity this year defied just past a billion locked inside of it right so that's a not an insignificant amount but that is definitely not the institutional money yet so it seems a little bit like you guys made the analogy to it's like it's kind of defies like kind of like a really Bitcoin and that the institutions aren't yet comfortable with it what kind of regulatory barriers are there to say you know depositing something in compound through the Gemini interface what sort of legal barriers need to be overcome there before we sort of get there I think that's an interesting point of how you sequence people getting in to crypto nobody is first I don't think anyone's first foray into crypto is like I'm gonna go buy some dye I think it's like really simple right it's like I heard about Bitcoin I've been hearing about it for ten years oh my gosh the Fed is printing so much money maybe it's time to inoculate myself from the month the money printing disease like I buy the big old thesis like okay let's buy some and when you know a hedge fund like Bridgewater AQR they're gonna go to a regulated institution or path to dip their toe in it's a big toe because this is huge money but they're gonna try and they're gonna start with buying bitcoin and then you have to bring them along right but nobody like people like you experienced crypto it's hard to explain it once you get into Bitcoin you feel it you get comfortable and then you say oh what's this ether thing right there's this evolution of people getting in and and we need to meet them where they are right if you're bridge water or a queue or a massive hedge fund you're used to calling up State Street or something like straight street or you know you do business in the regulated world so we have to get them bridge from you know where they are to to start getting them in and then one day down the road I think they can get behind I they can understand that they're very brilliant sophisticated people but I think it's important to focus on like the initial battles that we have to win first I also would just add that it's possible that defy you know the the elements of defy are really attractive to individuals who otherwise can't get access to the existing system and so a lot of institutions you know they have access to US equities but there could be people in the unbanked population for example who don't have access to US equities but some synthetic contract on defy all of a sudden gives them that access so it's something that they need but it's not relevant to a large institution in the US or Wall Street so I think that's probably it could very well be a story where the people who need it really really gravitate towards it at first and I think we saw that with Bitcoin a lot most of the world was like hey I'm I'm okay Gold I can buy a gold ets and and I don't know if I need this new store of value and so it's it's you know ironically started off as a as a very retail individual based market and it's one of the few asset classes maybe the only asset class in the world where Wall Street will be the last person to the party on a recent interview you guys did I believe it was with Camilla Russo you guys talked about your your eath holdings which everyone in the etherium community was surprised surprised and happy to hear that they are sizable according to what you guys said in the interview maybe you guys can give us your guys's value accrual thesis for ether the asset sure yeah I'm actually surprised a lot of people might have missed that maybe we've never talked about it before I thought we had but uh either way yeah we we do own a lot of ether and and have for for a long time and I guess our thesis stepping back is really etherium is this amazing decentralized computer or operating system for lack of a better word and like any operating system it provides an environment where you can run applications and creates a sort of unbounded opportunity of a building so that was our initial like oh you know aha moment this is this is really really interesting yeah like if you're him when it when it was launched and we looked at it just the smart contract aspect the turing-complete nature you know if bitcoins digital gold it seemed like ether was going to make a really good run at digital oil you know if it to use the metaphor so incredible community again very passionate and it felt like a real project so we were very big we are very big supporters and have been for a long time and we're actually I think the first u.s. regulated exchange actually lists ether for trading in custody back in 20 maybe it was 2016 so even before the ico craze so so yeah big fans of ether and have big ovens as well yeah it's really cool you know David and I are from the tribe of you know as money as its it's starting to be used inside of its ecosystem as a collateral and as economic bandwidth it's it's starting to accrue this monetary property too this sounds like you guys are seeing something similar but I want to ask this and this this can kind of close it out for us guys because you saw rowing in kind of your community growing up before anyone else did you saw Facebook in the social networking before anyone else did you saw a crypto very early as well what are you seeing today like now that other people aren't like because because we want to buy it whatever it is [Laughter] yeah we could tell you but no so I think one of the things that I would I would say in response to that initially is also sort of the time horizon of seeing things and then determining you know the the lifespan of that particular thing so so when we look at social networking it really it's sort of peaked and and at this point it feels like the centralized social networks are pretty well baked and you know they're growing probably at the pace of the internet at this point and so is there a lot more to do there I'm not so sure probably not but I think when you look at crypto I would I would I would draw more of a parallel to to the Internet and in the late 90s early 2000s and we're still you know 20 25 years into through that modern experience where the internet was commercialized and and I don't think there's any sort of you know stopping or slowing down so to speak so we're ten years ish into the crypto experiment and I don't think you know I think it's literally just getting started if that we're in like the preface of the of the novel and they're there's so much to be done I don't think that you know there's gonna be any shortage of ideas so so the space as a whole I think is so early and really unbounded and I don't know if that's it's a pretty broad answer but I think that it's it's important to know when certain innovations or trends have effectively peaked and there's not much more to do and I think crypto hasn't even gotten started but I think generally like sticking to the big things that that are that that makes sense on a conceptual level we've talked about aetherium like is there going to be an operating system for the decentralized world there will probably be more than one in generally like centralized operating systems on systems there there's there's a handful of them and in the case of etherium the more apps and the more vibrant that value tends to accrue into the protocol and makes it more valuable that's a pretty easy concept to wrap your head around on a macro level I think when you look at Bitcoin you're looking at a a digital gold thesis and Gold is 10,000 years old so so we're we're year 10 or 11 into the next what 10,000 years you could stay in Bitcoin for your entire lifetime and there's still stuff to be done so these are these are super these aren't applications on on you know the internet that have become sort of mature and and and and saturated when we're talking about crypto we're talking about an entirely new network effectively or internet like these sub internets and so I think that you know we try to focus on the really big pieces and we think that there's work to do for for hundreds of years from from now forward it feels like we're still in the very much like the infrastructure phase if you go back to the internet everyone sort of like on a dial-up modem right now there isn't really fast like t1 or whatever t3 lines we're going through the analog like phone lines or people like at home can pick up the receiver and screw up during imagine like all of a sudden like I was in our long stop taking up the phone oh my god yeah like it was just it just was crushing and then she doesn't understand what's at stake you know the in these in the game this worried ultimately when the success of a project right like cryptokeys effectively DDoS is the etherium network that's like my mom picking up the phone and my age vampires game that's kind of where we are and we haven't really had the the massive application adoption use case moment if you could say that like maybe bitcoin is you know the first use case and speculation or investment is it but it's got to be it's got to be so much more so focusing I'm like what are the important building blocks to go forward to like set the stage for that moment so the etherium is to centralize compute maybe filed coins to centralized storage what other building blocks do we need die maybe one of them to go forward and lastly I'll say that I'm very interested in just JIT we we purchased Gemini purchased acquired nifty gateway which is an NF t platform and I think that you know the first incarnation of crypto as we know it was let's create decentralize gold and then maybe we can bring stock certificates or utility toad the simple block chain and they ultimately we're gonna bring art and collectibles on the blockchain we all grew up collecting baseball cards comic books some of us graduate into you know collecting very expensive art at some point and I think I think there's gonna be a push for that and ultimately I think it's just like being long human behavior it is human to express yourself creatively through art collectibles and also to be a consumer of that and I really like that the other thing I'd like to see is sort of the fusion of a gaming in crypto d gaming so big but it's also so walled garden it's like the most exciting fastest-growing sport area in the world yet it doesn't seem like it and it's like it's so everyone in that world I think is totally into crypto or would be but it doesn't seem like we we've brought it together but I'm sure we will but that when that happens when it had like the twitch cannon or the e gaming cannon comes over the blockchain then it's just up again it's like a whole other step up I'm glad Tyler sort of narrowed in on those two particular areas because they I think a lot of times we look at innovation and and we focus on the things that aren't as fun and and a lot of times innovation just comes about through people had a lot of fun through gaming it starts out pretty casual and then all of a sudden you're like whoa this is transformative and it's touching everything and I think egay mning is one of those areas where where there's all these kids that are just having a lot of fun but they you know they can't really get their their identities or you know a shield or a sword out of the game but if they could get it onto a blockchain that would really be a very interesting you know thing and I think a lot of you know it's possible the next wave of crypto innovation is around gaming or art and collectibles and it's just sort of fun stuff that doesn't have a high threshold of like require a super high threshold of trust you don't have to convince someone hey put like a super material amount of your life savings into this new asset instead of gold or whatever you're you're basically telling younger people who live online have like incredibly important their online identities are super important and you're saying hey like do you want to collect this online thing that's that's scarce and verifiable of course like why not why wouldn't I do that you have to convince them yet to tell them why they shouldn't do that not why they should and so sometimes adoption comes through those avenues that you least expect and here we are focusing on you know the synthetic Espeon defy like how is that you know how are we gonna get people into that which we will but sometimes the side door or the indirect way we may indirectly on board an entire generation through crypto not through the concepts of open finance or open defy or whatever but through this casual fun way and I don't think it's it's a it's a coincidence that Magic the Gathering you know mal Cox was the first exchange it sort of kind of makes perfect sense that that you start out as this as this exchange for for a card game and and it kind of moves into two crypto and and and we may see that again so be interesting yeah absolutely I mean it strikes me that the key innovation of Bitcoin is this innovation around digital scarcity and you heard it here first folks so the winklevosses think there are multiple waves of that innovation to to come so kind of like there was a web one and there's a web two we're just an encrypted one and a ton of opportunities are left in crypto 2.0 and 3.0 I do think that Gen Z will be all over the NFT use case digitally scarce games as you said they are more passionate about this stuff than then even Millennials so it'll be exciting to watch I want to say on behalf of the bank les community and our listeners Tyler Cameron thank you so much for coming on we learned a lot we will look to Gemini for the developments around defy we're excited that you're adopting dye and we'll look forward to more innovation coming for me in the future - thanks so much guys this was really really fun and enjoyable really appreciate your time yeah thank you so much awesome okay thanks a lot so action items guys there aren't currently many places to buy die today you can buy it on decentralized exchanges coinbase also has a good order book you should also check out Gemini's order book they recently added dye it can become a great place to purchase it so check that out as an action item it's currently trading over $1 when it trades over $1 there can be some arbitrage advantage for you to check that out also second action item what we want you to do is listen to a bonus podcast we're coming out with on Wednesday so this is Monday when you're listening to this this interview with Tyler and Cameron went so long we covered so much material we didn't get an opportunity to talk about the big picture items that we'd love to talk about on a weekly basis so we're releasing that in a special bonus edition of bank lists that will be coming out stay and finally David we need those five-star reviews right now we always need those five-star reviews that is how we get the bank lists gospel into as many people's ears as possible so if you think that more people should listen to bank lists which I hope you do and if you don't please let us know please go to wherever you listen to podcasts and give us those five star reviews so we can show up higher than all those crypto podcasts that came out in 2017 got a bunch of listeners from from people that left and then are still kind of sitting there with after they haven't produced any content for years so if you think that Bank list should show up higher than them please go to iTunes please go to wherever you listen your podcast and give us those five star reviews that's ask guys take us to the top of the charts now risks and disclaimers of course what we talked about was risky today because crypto is risky defy is risky even crypto banks like gem and I cuss to your funds and there is risk associated with that so be careful out there you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list journey thanks a lot [Music]
