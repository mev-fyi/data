[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs we have a very special guest with us today the one and only cooper turley better known as koopa troopa on social media twitter you probably know him he's like everywhere he's an angel investor in music nfts an advisor to projects like audience he was a co-founder of friends with benefits fwb he's a partner at variant and just like a man about town i feel like that expression has an actual meaning but to me you're a man about town because you're everywhere on twitter at conferences just such an og in the space cooper so happy to have you here thank you for having me i'm excited to be here and i'm so excited music nfts is something i've wanted to dive more into for a while and you are just like the expert on experts on this and so like i really want to break it down i want to take this in bite-sized chunks and really explain to people the broad ecosystem happening here as best as possible but before we dive into all that and hopefully make it really clear for folks we do need to hear a word from our lovely sponsors it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces

people as possible and as i was preparing for this interview one thing that really stood out to me is i feel like we use music nfts or like it's sort of this catch-all term but there's really a lot going on under the hood here that we want to be clear about so on the one side i feel like we have music nfts collectibles and we'll maybe break down a little bit more what that means and then on the other side we we have the use of call it smart contracts to fix the ways that the music industry is systemically broken and these are not neces these are these are two different categories would you agree with that categorization and then maybe we'll go a little deeper on on on each of these categories yeah i would say in its current form today they are very different i think ultimately it'll become one in the same and all payments streaming collectibles will all exist natively on chain but for right now we kind of have this paired system where there's new assets that are being tokenized in web3 and then we have other companies looking to bring off chain assets into web3 and so some examples of that would be a company like royal which is tokenizing the royalties from spotify and putting those into nfts versus something like sound which is a digital collectible that exists entirely on chain and has no tie into sort of anything happening off platform royal is an interesting example because it feels like it crosses both of these categories and and i'll explain what i mean there so for example we're if we start with this music nft piece and i want you to really break this down for us you mentioned this royal sells music nfts but the the music nfts that royal is selling come with some rights over the master right over the recorded works so you're entitled to a certain level of royalty as the owner of the nft moving forward which is helping to fix a systemic problem the other one you just mentioned there sound is it sound xyz what did you mean that's purely that's not necessarily quote unquote fixing the systemic problem i'm sure you could argue the other ways but that's truly just hey here's an audio sound bite backed by a smart contract is that right yeah collecting a tokenized version of a song okay tokenized version of a song does this mean the same thing as what it means in like the visual art world does this mean that basically there's a smart contract that points to an audio file that's stored on ipfs the exact same thing we had cds vinyls eight tapes and now we have nfts why do you think the collectible music world hasn't taken off the same way the collectible art nft world has i think it's a very different mindset to be able to understand what's happening music requires time to listen versus art which you can instinctively just look at for a second but if we ask the question of time i mean super started in 2018 and there was a very long period of time where people were not taking collectible art very seriously it was more of a hobbyist item i think that's kind of the current phase that we're in with music right now where it's a very hobbyist market but over time you start to see things like pfps and once there becomes that mainstream moment you know the primitive takes off but i think there have been underlying foundations that have been around for many years prior to these viral moments that we see with collectible art tonight and for these tokenized songs and music do they tend to come with a visual component as well like are our music artists partnering with visual artists or creating a visual component or like what is it break that down for folks who have never collected or seen a music nft or tokenized piece of music yeah i love that you asked this question because this was really the big shift that started quote unquote music nfts in my book you know there was a heyday and nifty gateway where every big dj was partnering with the giant visual artists to do a 15 second audio visual clip that had some 3d animation on it with a little music snippet underneath and it was cool you know musicians were getting into nfts but i would argue that that wasn't music nfts because there was not really a focus on the song itself it was more about the audio visual pairing and so what we see now is that most quote-unquote music nfts are a full song what's called a three-minute mp3 or wav file and then a cover art and while you can go to openc and see the cover art what you're collecting is the song not necessarily cover art itself but obviously the cover it adds to sort of the overall output but at its core you are collecting the music and not necessarily the cover art or the visual associated with that what do you think is there a real world analog to this like there's obviously a real world analog to visual nfts in the sense that people hang paintings in their house and that's how they signal that they're rich in canon picasso or like whatever but when i think about how people have shown off music in the past where my head goes and maybe i'm wrong about this is like again hanging the vinyl cover art there or the cd that you can physically see why are you convinced that this will actually happen that uh uh music nfts will will work i'll give you three different analogs the first one is playlist i think we can all wrap our heads around that one we find songs that we like and we put them into a collection of sounds and we share them with our friends to say that we like a certain type of music i think that's the easiest way to think about it for the more superfan relationships vinyl is exactly accurate if i really resonate with the record if i really resonate with an artist i'm going to go above and beyond to collect a rare edition of that that signals that i love that song more so than just adding it to my playlist the last one which is a little bit more obscure but really what got me over the edge with music nfts is hat pins and so in electronic music culture there are these artist projects where you would have a limited number of manual vinyl hat pins that you could put on your hat or you could hang on a poster or keep on like a pin board in your house and for me in college i was super into this culture and artists like pretty lights would drop a run of 100 hot pins and people would rush to the show to get them they would be for sale for 20 at the show and then on the secondary market in facebook they'd be selling for 50 60 100 and so during my time at college i got really into collecting hot pins i had thousands of dollars of them i was selling them all the time and so i got to see firsthand that there is a collectible market for music and specifically for super fandom but i don't think we've ever had the ability to collect songs we've always just collected the association with an artist and so what i think that we're seeing with music nfts today is taking that same mentality of trading hat pins but instead doing that with tokenized records in a fully automated always-on secondary marketplace sticking with this theme of how the the collectible part of the market is playing out and then we'll spend a lot of time talking about the the systemic fixes and and super fandom and how that can be monetized in different ways i think you are super well spoken on that and audience is doing interesting things there on this collectible front though uh you were mentioning to me that generative music and and generative collectibles are really taking off on the music side of things too of course we've seen this again on the visual art side talk to me about what's happening in that scene so the same way you open a pack of pokemon cards we're now seeing different projects explore what it looks like to open a pack of songs there's a project called song camp that's doing a mint today for a headless brand called chaos and so this is 77 artists that came together a headless brand yeah so 77 artists that came together to make one artist project so the artist project is called chaos there's 45 different songs that represent 20 000 different nfts and so when you go to the site to mint you're basically opening a pack of cards and you don't really know what songs you're going to get but there's sort of this game to be played now around collecting the rarest songs in the pack you know the rare songs in the series filling out the grid and this sort of sets the precedent for a larger movement around generative music so in the same way that we have art blocks let's call it chromio squiggles fidenzas ringers whatever it might be there's platforms like beat foundry and soundment that are doing curated drops with artists where an artist will come to the table with a certain number of stems they'll basically run it through an algorithm and then output all these unique audio visual combinations that represent a generative music nft and i think the important thing to recognize there is that beyond collecting a single that's coming out on spotify on friday on new music friday there's also a new world of creation that's happening on chain that i think is very native to the space and across the board we're seeing this very interesting experiment where artists are really challenging the fabric of what does it look like to output music that's not just a 30 second clip for tick tock and for collectors such as myself i think that that novelty kind of gives the space a little bit of an edge up over just collecting the songs that we already know and love that's so interesting let me ask because what this feels like it feels like it lends itself to really easily is sampling and and getting like stems of songs that you can then incorporate into your own music which again gets us to a little bit the utility the fixing systemic music problems and licensing and is that a component of this did you just spell that out and i missed it because you i was imbibing a lot yeah i think it's a huge component of it i believe that very soon there will be a day when people are making music with every underlying stem having a tokenized component to it let's call it a hundred collectible versions of a kick drum if i put that in my song and then i sell that song on sound xyz a percentage of those proceeds will come back to me as the producer of that stem because it all lives natively on chain i think that on-chain attribution for music is going to be absolutely gigantic so this is more than just a collectible this generative art movement is not just like hey here's a collectible version of shake it off which is my favorite song or whatever right you can tell i'm not in the indie scene i just mentioned a taylor swift song is the first thing that came to mind um so this is like the generative art piece there's a lot of not just hey here's a collectible thing that i can show off it's a hey i could incorporate this as a producer you know in my mixing of a song in a very utopian world you know i think where d5 did it really well is composability was key and fundamental to a lot of the success of the industry there was five protocols building on top of one another and it all just worked flawlessly under the hood you didn't have to think about it i think for music right now there's a lot of different players and a lot of different parts of the table and if we can create better systems for on-chain attribution where we're less reliant on humans sitting at desks in los angeles and more reliant on smart contracts operating on ethereum then i think that we're going to get to a really special place with music and help to unlock a lot more value for the space as a whole i got a shout out my friend bart diecrum who i i worked with as early as like august of last summer who was trying to do this he does like some electronic music stuff and he was like music nfts and he released his own music nfts that like were i think had a generative component and anyways i know you listened to this part so i'm shouting you out for for having introduced this concept to me very early um anything else you want to talk about on this let's call it more purely collectible side fan clubs the way that we're seeing fan clubs shift or change with the advent of nfts before we move on to some of the bigger systemic fix stuff absolutely i want to just highlight that collecting music is not that deep i think with a lot of crypto and web 3 primitives we try and act like we are creating this brand new fundamental technology it's all these new primitives it's kind of all this new exciting stuff that has never been done before but we've purchased cds for a long time we've bought vinyls for a long time a lot of us have bought songs on itunes very long for a very long time this is no different than that music nfts are simply just selling music online and i think when you take a step back and you look at that there's no reason why every single song on the planet should not have a collectible version associated with it i think people are starting to recognize that it's not subtractive from the traditional rollout process if i'm releasing a song on spotify it's better that i have a collectible version because the two work in tandem with one another and so to really just highlight that front and center um i believe that collectible music has value solely because it exists i don't think that you need to have utility on it for it to have quote-unquote value but once you can start from the framework of recognizing that collecting a song is valuable you can then start to layer on different primitives like utility and like ownership that make these things be more forward and more representative of i think the ecosystem that we've all come to know and love do you have any numbers out of curiosity of like what the market of die hard music fans are that collect music paraphernalia that do things where they're collecting music to show off but they're a fan it's very difficult to quantify because it varies relative to the artist's projects you know some of the um some of the the artists projects i would represent here would be like bts um you know in the electronic music scene fan clubs like elenium grizz pretty lights like i mentioned before the jam band scene is really really into this so bands like sts9 lotus disco business etc and i think for a lot of these different fan communities people recognize that their identity is highly attached to the artist projects that they're following and so instead of it just being me going possibly listening to a song on spotify i can speak from personal experience you know i was traveling the country going to see these bands i was going to local meetups all the time and if we think about the way that dolls are operating in web 3 today my very first relationship with quote-unquote dals was through music communities and so i think adding in web 3 native assets to represent ownership in these communities is a huge opportunity and the exact reason why i'm so passionate about it oh is there pushback within the it sounds like it's a lot of the alternative music community and that's what you're describing the way that we see pushback in the gaming community against nfts is their pushback and like the music community around music nfts absolutely i would say most major artists that have tried to do nfts will receive some form of backlash from their fan base by talking about doing it specifically on the nifty gateway wave there was a couple electronic acts that got really big pushback from their fan base but the interesting thing to highlight here is that most of that pushback came from instagram and so the fans that follow artists on twitter are very different from the fans that follow artists on instagram and so i think a lot of that pushback came from an artist posting on instagram that they were doing nfts and so we sort of saw this drop off about a year and a half ago where many artists became disenfranchised because they thought they're gonna get crucified by their fan base and so when i'm working with artists now i tell them to stick to twitter you know recognize that it's for a very small segment of your community don't try and sell to all of your fans because most of your fans can't even buy it in the first place that they wanted to and instead focus on that one percent super fan community that you have been fostering for years and try and figure out a way to get them involved because there are people out there that want to collect these assets but it is currently not for all of your fans it's actually for a very specific demographic that's willing to jump through some hoops what has the evolution of music nfts been and this i think gets us to then again royal audience and these the problems with the music industry and how we fix them like did it did this start with tokenized music or did it start with we want to fix the system it's a little bit of both you know my relationship with um music and web 3 in general started from fixing the system as a whole so i went to school for music business and i was told about smart contracts being able to expedite the royalty system and so to quickly give an anecdote here if i stream your track on spotify today you are not going to see that payment for about three to six months it's going to go through a bunch of different systems and eventually over time it's going to trickle down and come back to one of your sites that you can go and press the button to collect from when i heard about smart contracts as a way to be able to say hey i'm streaming your track right now here's one cent and it's going to go directly to your wallet that instantly clicked and made sense to me and so my early relationship with music and web 3 was through platforms like audios that really highlighted that problem very viscerally and said hey what if we made a more transparent system for launching payments for artists to fan relationships for data collection fan clubs as you mentioned and over time that sort of grew into tokenized collectible music and so i would say quote unquote music nfts really started around the days that catalogs started producing records and so there were artists that were tokenizing songs on zora zora then ended up becoming catalog because catalog is built on top of zora and we saw this wave of sort of one-of-one collectibles that very very much represented the early days of super air from there we started to notice that people were branching out and doing additions you saw platforms like sound xyz come about mint songs a couple others that i could name but instead of it just being a one of one collectible with only one fan collecting we started to see people tokenizing 10 25 100 1 000 records i think that's when these things became a little bit bigger and since then we've now seen kind of a wider wave around generative music and sort of bigger drops in the form of platforms like beat foundry soundment and now more recently a lot of the bigger artists and music entities are building their own drop sites and products and so if i am an artist that sold a couple one of ones on catalog i've sold a couple drops out on sound xyz maybe i've done a beat foundry drop but i have an album coming up you know they're teaming up with developers and basically making a site so you can mint a thousand five thousand collectible versions of your album and have this really big you know come to come to jesus moment with the release of your record that's saying like hey if you want to be a part of this from day one here's the earliest way to listen to the music and have a collectible version of it so you can kind of participate in the full riding experience of what's being what's being created yeah these extension of fan experiences from when you're at concerts and they can track you at a concert now if you have an nft that's your ticket like i think that'll be so interesting as we see how just fan experiences are augmented from conception to to end with these which is a little bit separate from i think this very sexy concept that we're all excited by which is if you identify an artist early you can invest in their career and then share in their royalties and upside for the years to come my understanding is the system is is sort of broken in a way that right now certainly for any mainstream artist who currently has a record deal that's not really a realistic future for like you're not going to make a bunch of money buying into that artist's royalty stream early because of the way that the the system is set up is that right that's correct i think there's an extreme amount of value in giving fans ownership so just the concept of ownership i think has value and if we talk about a premium that we can place on collectible assets the notion of having ownership is valuable even if the payouts aren't very valuable themselves but to your point i think the reason those are not currently super valuable right now is because spotify is just not a very lucrative system for the vast majority of artists and i think it's more important to instead focus on the on-chain native sales that are happening so rather than being able to get spotify streams i'm really excited about the idea of being able to get secondary sales so if i buy a record on the primary market i mint it on sound xyz and then i'm able to either resell it later down the line or better yet i'm able to stake it and get a percentage of all secondary sales for that record i think that things start to get really exciting and to your question earlier about the current structure i'll just finish this point really fast eventually all the streaming will happen on chain and so if i own a collectible version of a song there's no reason if that song's not streaming on audios and getting payouts on there then i should be able to get a percentage of that natively because i hold the nft i think eventually the nft will become sort of the master and it'll replace sort of this system of like master rights publishing etc and it'll all live in one tokenized version of the song and that'll be the hub that's collecting everything that's natively happening around it i'm going to describe to you what i think the music industry right now looks like and or where some of the big problems are and most of this i've pulled from your writing and your newsletters and things and so i've learned this mostly from you so i should be right but um and then and then let's break down where these solves are but you said something in that last answer that i want to just ask about you said okay you you buy this record that drops and then you stake it and you could get a percentage of future secondary sales secondary sales of what the record so if there's a like the actual cd or or just if you're staking a record aren't you hold what do you mean if they do spell it out for me there's a hundred collectible versions of a record i own one of them i stake it where is the money coming from all the secondary sales generated on openc so there's 99 other records out there and if one of them sells on the secondary i collect a royalty from the secondary of that other collectible that just sold on okay i didn't know if we were talking like irl for a second like oh the mat the record label doesn't have the same claim to like secondary sales of cds i glad we got that clarified okay problems with the music industry as far as i can tell royalties take a long time to pay out you mentioned that that's super frustrating if you're an artist and you've got to wait months to get a royalty from your streams here's the big one this is this blows my mind how little money artists are making from streaming i was seeing numbers i think ric had put out but like you'll make like three to four thousand dollars per 1 million streams on spotify is that correct that is correct and that assumes that you own 100 of your master which the vast vast majority of artists do not have so that's not even what because my understanding is is the reason you're being paid out so little is because the record labels are entitled to 50 to 80 of royalties is that right yeah so in that example there's a million streams you're getting four thousand dollars we'll keep it extremely generalized right now that's 100 ownership so if the label owns fifty percent of that you're actually only getting two thousand dollars per every million streams that you get no what i swear this rac tweet that's so crazy this rac tweet made it sound more like that's okay after you get i just misinterpreted it so that's absolutely nuts so you have a million people who are who have listened to your song and you're gonna make 2000 off of it that sounds just so incredibly low to me okay clearly huge problem uh a lack of data about your fan base this is something you've written about in your newsletter and and other places like spotify really doesn't give you a lot of information about who's listening to your music and you don't have a lot of information about who are your super fans who like who would die for your music who'd pay a thousand dollars for your music more you want to say about data in this space i would say broadly it's less about trying to create new systems that fairly value all music consumption so trying to like up the rate per stream or anything like that i think is gonna be extremely difficult in fact i actually think that all streaming will be free if we zoom out over a long enough time horizon but i think for those top one percent of super fans us having better channels to recognize who they are contact them and have deeper artists defend relationships if i'm someone who's listening to your music um a thousand times a month and i only listen to your music my spotify subscription is not only going to you it's being broken up pro rata amongst all streams on the platform so instead i think a better way of thinking about this is if i'm someone who's only listening to your music how can we get better systems where you're paying more per stream and or you're only giving that income directly to the artist itself rather than trying to create a system that's equitable across everyone with the same per stream rate across every song in the planet which i think is a very it makes sense i understand why we're there right now but i think there's areas to improve on top of that make sure really honing in on those superfan relationships so this is a really interesting point and i think what you're doing is you're connecting these two flaws right the lack of data with the the um the low streaming monetization the fact that you don't make much money off of streaming you're saying streaming is getting commoditized and i think i've heard the audio ceo make this point that basically the cost per stream is gonna go to zero can you explain that why is that why is the cost per stream going to zero spotify is not profitable and it's the biggest company for music streaming in the world streaming represents 85 of all music industry revenue right now but it's not a profitable company and the reason that happens is because they had to buy catalog rights from all the major labels in the world to be able to even put it on in the first place and so there's basically an incumbent system here that's people boxing out other people to capture the lion's shares of profit and so the labels are making money the labels are printing they're doing fantastic but the artists are not printing it's only the people who own their masters that are doing well itself and so i think rather than trying to create a system where we can say hey how do we pay more per stream which means we have to appease all these major labels and give them more money it's almost like you have to go back to the core and just say okay people are paying 9.99 a month to listen to all the music in the world what if that's just zero dollars and you're just paying every time that you consume a song or every time you want to subscribe to a different artist and if we try and restructure the way that it works i think that all music will eventually be able to be listened to for free it's how it is now i don't have to pay money to go and go on youtube and listen to it but i pay for a convenience and i pay for the fact that it's all right in front of me so we can listen to songs right now for free we just choose not to because we want to pay for convenience and so i think if we look at that there's a world in which all this music just exists natively for free in a convenient way if we think of open public protocols you know the same way that we do in web3 i don't see any reason why over a long enough time prize and all these songs will be available just to go and listen to and if you really want to quote unquote monetize it um i use this saying free to listen valuable to own and so you can go and stream a song for free all you want but if you want to really give back to the artist you can collect a version of that song and i think that collectible market is exactly the change it's going to allow us to go from fixing a global streaming problem to instead having this balance system where streaming doesn't have to be the main way that all these audits are getting paid and this connects to the micropayment you you said got you started on this journey which is you know the reason that click per article journalism hasn't ever taken off is because it doesn't make sense you know like it doesn't make sense to pay for one article and pay a few cents because that kind of micro payment the credit card companies would take a bigger chunk out of that then would make sense to even uh transact that way you're saying the same thing with songs okay suddenly it now might make sense to make micropayments for listening to one song because in a crypto world on a layer two on solano which is i know where audience plays like you can do that gas free for very cheap so that's one component of this and then the super fan piece the other way you're saying artists should be able to monetize more is on their super fans which makes total sense i listened to probably well i probably listened to more than like 10 artists on spotify but i mostly listened to taylor swift and she should get most of my spotify subscription payments um okay let's talk about this this monetization of super fans and maybe this gets us into audios a little bit and and how the audience payment model works my understanding is artists who are on audios can determine how they want to monetize their work and how they want to get paid maybe give a little bit of a breakdown of what audience is and then and then talk about how they're allowing artists to set their own monetization rates absolutely so audience is an on-chain streaming protocol the way that i would think of this is soundcloud except if it lived natively in web3 and so there was an entire generation of artists on soundcloud who made their career off the back of uploading free music getting that discovered by labels it going viral and then going to play world tours there was never an opportunity for those artists to earn equity in soundcloud instead all they got was a little bit of marketing exposure and the opportunity to make a career for themselves and so audio says the same exact thing as soundcloud except all this content is living natively on chain and there's a token called audio which represents governance over the platform and so just in the same way that we recognize all these web 3 protocols for having an ownership economy thesis being able to create a music platform where the artists can truly own the platform that they create value for is really really fascinating i'll highlight that today on audience there's not a pay-per-stream rate people aren't making us dollars for streaming it's actually just a way to build deeper fan relationships within web3 and so you can come and sign up with an email and a password you can show off your nfts on the page you can earn some audio tokens if you stream at the top of the charts or if you refer people to the platform but this sort of wider system around on chain attribution and paid per stream is a huge huge endeavor it's not one that currently exists yet but the thesis is if i'm an artist and i want to set a streaming rate of a dollar per track i can do that for one single and if i want to make my other single free i can make that free if i want to make it so that someone needs to hold 100 audio tokens to come and access a certain song i can set up a token gated community if i want to make it so that an artist needs to hold one of my nfts to be able to access my content i can do that too and so audience is kind of this ecosystem in this hub to connect all these different pieces within you know web3 creator economy monetization and create deeper artists to find relationships with people that are consuming music every day so right now what you just described hey you have to hold my nft to come listen to my songs hey you need to have 100 audio audios tokens to come listen my song that's in place right now what's not in place is just like hey you can pay me two cents per stream of my song and fiat is that the the breakdown of how it currently works there's different tiers on audios where you can hold tokens access different things it's not quite happening on like an artist by artist basis right now i would say what currently exists today is earning audio tokens for being a value-added contributor to the network in the same way that incentives exist for a lot of other web 3 platforms that we know today and so if you if i'm an artist who's put my work up on audios and it's doing really well i get i get paid out audio tokens is it audio is the token correct that's correct you get paid out audio tokens for being one of those top performing streamers and adding to the network in that way and that audio token has governance control over the overall protocol the future of audios and also like many of these gets traded on a decentralized exchanges where it can be converted into other cryptos or fiat and ultimately yep the one thing i want to highlight there is it's not like every time you get a stream on the platform you're earning audio tokens yet i think that's a really big endeavor it's basically saying hey if you're one of the top five performing tracks on a given week or if you're one of the top five performing playlists there's a fixed incentive that goes to those users i think if we zoom out over a long enough time horizon absolutely there's going to be a system in place where if you're just streaming really well you're going to earn tokens on a recurring basis but as it exists today i would say fixed incentive over a fixed epoch relative to your performance on the platform as a whole one thing that's struck me in listening to conversations with some of the audience co-founders is they really seem to be trying to appeal to a mainstream audience not just a crypto audience i think they said something around the lines like we'd rather be a small fish in the big pond of like music streaming than a big fish in the smaller pond of the crypto ecosystem so you know the the crypto piece of audience is actually very behind the scenes you can go and interact with audience as a music streaming platform without interacting with crypto or necessarily even realizing that crypto is under the hood it feels like they're making a really intentional effort that way given that it is the goal that down the line there's also fiat transactions that are possible on here where it is or or stable coins whether there's sort of micro payments per song in a more normy accessible way absolutely i think there's a very real world where you're paying a fraction of a cent to listen to a song but you're not having to swipe your credit card to pay a fraction of a cent you just have an internal balance on audience and every time you stream a track you're opting into making sure you can make that payment but it's just coming automatically out of your account the one thing i want to highlight and zoom in on there is this sort of mainstream adoption versus like deep web 3 culture because i think it's a really important point that i've had a lot of thought on and have like you know develop somewhat of a thesis around i think right now a lot of companies are looking for ways to bring crypto mainstream but in a lot of ways i don't think that crypto is ready for mainstream and so a lot of my time has been is instead of trying to onboard you know the post malones and justin bieber's and all this stuff to nfts which frankly i just don't think we're ready to support yet i think it's a lot more about creating the next post malone or the next justin bieber through web3 natively and so there's not one size fits all model and there's a lot of platforms that are operating on both sides of the spectrum i'm currently leaning more towards independent artists and artists that are natively born in the space but that's not to say that there isn't a parallel track of people bringing all these celebrities into the market which is also an extremely valuable you know sandbox in and of itself well and it's not just about crypto not being ready for the mainstream which i make sense and of course we see in a whole bunch of ways but it's also the music industry not being ready for crypto in what i was describing earlier and really making this point to folks which is that record labels have all the power here and these artists sign early with these labels before they've gotten big and so they sign away the rights to their masters the rights to their work in exchange for some lump sum up front fee that looks like a ton of money to some young artist who's trying to survive as an artist but now they don't have the rights to their masters and so all of the money is filling two record labels and so in this grand vision and where i think this can really come together for folks is when you as a fan have real ownership over an artist's future career and have ownership over some royalty streams and those royalty streams are actually meaningful because the artist owns owns those masters as opposed to owning like a tiny fraction of them or themselves getting a tiny fraction of the royalty so a justin bieber who has you know who's very plugged into the archaic traditional system you're going to be limited in what you can do with them in a web 3 world is that right more to say on that to really explain this to folks because i think people do not understand how this industry works yeah it's exactly right and i think that's exactly why you see justin bieber collecting in-betweener pfp projects instead of putting his music natively on chain you know i don't think there's a correct way for musicians of high caliber to get involved with web3 and so a lot of what i'm looking to figure out is how do we run these playbooks with smaller independent artists that we can take that to a label and say hey here's a system that's generating additional revenue for you it's not cross you know it's not taking away from the streams that you're having but if you're willing to embrace this i think there's a really cool system for other people to get involved it's going to be a difficult conversation but it's one that i think people are starting to have more and more every day are younger artists increasingly aware of the bad deal they're being dealt with record labels i think of like taylor swift being very vocal about the fact god i mentioned her for this podcast being very vocal about the fact that she doesn't own her master's and she's devastated by it and she wish she didn't sign the deal she did when she was younger is this something that people are starting to wise up to if you're a young artist 100 and i want to really give color to that last example you gave because it was extremely accurate so what we see today is an artist who's 18 year old um put a song on tik tok it goes off for 100 million streams a label comes to him and says hey we love your music what we're going to do is we're going to give you a million dollars up front we're going to make sure we're cooping against all that million dollars and then after that you're going to get 20 of the streaming rights from your song for the rest of your life essentially and so as an artist i'm getting a million dollars up front and i'm like wow this is incredible i just made a million dollars but you're not making a million dollars you have a loan of a million dollars that you need to pay back and even after you pay back that loan you still don't own the thing that you were loaning out in the first place and so i think what artists are starting to recognize now is saying hey i don't have to take a million dollar loan up front i can actually make a million dollars myself without having to give that away and instead of having to take a loan from a bank which is essentially a label if you do want to crowdfund and actually take on some capital to be able to make a music video hire producers live do the things that artists need to be able to create you can do that from a smaller demographic of people namely those super fans that we mentioned before without having to give away crazy amounts of your ownership that's not to say that you should never give away your ownership because i think there is value in bringing people to the table because of that but i think that we can be a lot more creative in how that ownership is being distributed and in the event that we challenge the model of how it's being given away you can start to have people associated with your projects that care more about it on a day-to-day basis i think the incentives can be much greater so instead of me just going and streaming a track i can now actually own either a percentage of masters or a collectible version of a song that makes me feel a lot more engaged and motivated to go and spread the likeness of this record what do you think the future is for record labels they've got a long they'll be around for a while because they've got all these huge acts that are tied to them for the rest of their lives but as more artists wise up to this where do you think it goes i think that record labels start to resemble venture capitalists and i think instead of them being able to take on deals where they're able to recoup against their loan and then also have ownership in it i think they're gonna have to compete like people like myself with other people that are in venture capital to have to partner with these artists where the artist is now the ceo of a company and the major label is slotting into that rather than the artist being a client of the major label and in the event that that client relationship is not being prioritized artist just gets dropped and there's no no business with it whatsoever yeah it's you hear this with startup founders and especially in bull markets which of course we're not in now but where you can be a lot more selective about like what vc you want on your cap table and think about like what are they bringing to the table beyond just the money or beyond this and it forces you know the vcs to be much more competitive i think what i hear you describing is just a scenario where record labels have to be much more competitive and they no longer it's only taken for granted that they need you and so you really have to make the deal fairer for the artist themselves so one of the bigger problems with music right now is that all of the pockets of music that exist around an artist are very segmented and so artists will sign to a major label for their master rights which is the money that they're making from spotify they'll sign to a publishing company for their publishing which is traditionally like when i get a commercial on apple or something like that many times they will have touring which is a different income stream that may have fees going to a tour manager or tour a booking agent but all these things kind of operate in these different silos and so i think what i'm trying to figure out is how do we sort of put those all together in an umbrella that makes sense so when we are investing in artists natively instead of investing in their masters their publishing their touring their merchandise whatever it might be all of that should be housed under one roof and i think the new form of funding and artists is not going to be only buying their masters it's going to be investing natively in that artist's equity and that artist equity should theoretically have a claim on all the different pieces that exist in their wider ecosystem does this touch on what you see as these emerging web 3 record labels where you does that connect up to this point you're trying to make about it all housed under one entity or is that something separate uh ambitiously yes i would say today what most major um what most web3 labels are doing are basically helping artists distribute their music in web3 and so if they're selling collectible records on catalog or on sound that web 3 label partner will take a percentage of primary and secondary sales i think over time it becomes you know very synonymous with what i just mentioned where they have ownership over everything but you know right now when i think of a web 3 label i basically think of a team that is helping someone sell more records on chain so right now these web3 labels are helping artists they're like consultants who are helping artists speak web3 and get them in front of a web3 audience and understand how to like go to market with an nft collectible is that what i hear you saying that's exactly right for many of these artists that are natively in web 3 they're actually releasing their music on chain before they're putting it on spotify and in many case scenarios they're making way more money from selling collectibles than they are from streaming and so the web3 label's role is basically to do tokenomics to do partnerships to do governance community management treasury management all the things that we see with web3 companies and dows except now it's just happening for an artist project and so we're even starting to see the rise of what i call metastars which are acts that live natively in the metaverse they're not on spotify they're not humans they're often like avatars like a fluff world character or like a board 8 and these web 3 labels are basically creating the lore and the narrative for them they're creating this digital brand around the artist they're producing the music on the back end and then distributing it in the form of nfts to develop super fan relationships that all exist natively in web 3 as the home base so kingship would that be a good example of what you're describing with these these metastars yep kingship's a great example of that i'm a really big fan of angel baby which is a project by hume which is a web 3 record label i've been helping out a lot with a project called roki which is a web 3 native artist project um the board brothers which is a collab between ryan teder from onerepublic and kygo both using their board apes to output some music has been really fascinating there's a bunch of others that i could mention but there's definitely this like bubbling wave of web three native artist projects and as far as where i've been spending my time from the quote-unquote management front it's been figuring out how to break and act natively through web3 do you think we will hit a point where metastars are as big as irl stars without a doubt ah this is where i'm like i feel like a boomer like i i just can't wrap my head around caring as much about a board ape act as i do about a real human act and it to me it always maintains a little bit of a fringe status but i'm sure i'm probably wrong about that i don't think you're wrong about it in its current form i think that port apes making music is definitely cringe i will totally co-sign that but i think it gets to a point where we have the daft punks the gorillas the marshmallows of the world all these major acts who are not their individual human identities but rather their artist project that same concept that exists natively online there is no reason why an artist shouldn't be able to play five shows at the same time all around the world there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to have a million people coming to a concert at the same time a million people in a discord you know there are limitations to the physical space that have value and i think exclusivity is a really good thing but if we try and think of ways to expand the total addressable market for music and fan communities we need more online interactive spaces and i think that's the exact area that metastars are going to thrive that in many ways i think a lot of artists today are not well suited to do because they just don't care as much about exploring these new digital frontiers that we're all so passionate about here in web3 living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano

some numbers there and and it one thing that i think is so striking is how big at least reportedly audiences use your basis i've seen numbers like six million active users is that accurate up to date what are we looking at numbers wise for audience yeah it's extremely accurate and it's extremely up-to-date i think that there was a ceiling that was hit with sort of the current user base on audience and there's gonna need to be like a leg up to get that to keep growing um i'll be honest with you i'm actually way less concerned with like how many average fans are using webtv right now and more so about how many fans are collecting music nfts because i think that number's a lot smaller i'd say that number is probably closer to like 2 500 to 5 000 people in the world but that small number i think is a lot more telling of where the space currently is rather than how many people are using a streaming app and i will co-sign audios forever i think they're incredible and i have nothing but love for them but i think the number i'm trying to figure out is like how do we get more people to recognize that collecting a record for five ten a hundred dollars has value and how do we deepen these artists defend relationships with smaller pockets because i think that's the thing that's going to capture the lion's share value here and the thing that's really going to move the needle for the space as a whole is it a social media play right is it how do we get people to be able to signal better that they're a super fan of an artist by showing off their music collectible in a better way than we currently have absolutely i think it's three things i think it's visibility so being able to show off your records i think it's access being able to come in and talk to the artist or talk to fans of that artist and then i think it's profit being able to make money off of the art that you're collecting i think the third piece around profit is actually the biggest reason why music entities have not quite scaled yet is because most people aren't making money from trading them and for better or worse most people are buying nfts because they want to make money and if they're not making money they're not excited so i think we kind of need to find the right middle ground where people are able to show off their music nfts they're able to come into fan communities that are actually engaging and exciting to them and most importantly they're able to see a little bit of money if i'm early to a song and i buy it before it drops and then it goes on to stream 100 million streams on spotify theoretically that record should be performing super well in the secondary market on openc but i just don't think we have enough experiments yet to test out whether or not that thesis is true i mean i see analogs to this and and again what i'd call visual nft world which is where i obviously spend a bit more time when i think about a project like aku and akutars where this is a team who's very clear they're making a movie and they have ex lucasfilm people working on the story and creating this film and i feel very bullish on their ability to create a really amazing film and maybe one of the first projects to do so and reach a mainstream audience with tv and i have no idea what that's going to mean for the price of the nft right like in theory it should mean the nft goes up in value but that's really untested because we haven't seen that happen yet is that what you're saying like you could own this record and it becomes one of those popular albums but will that mean anything for the nft that's exactly what i'm saying and i think that this is the next chapter for web 3 as a whole is tokenized media i think so far when we consume post music whatever it might be we don't have a way to capture the upside of the performance of that on social media and i think that web 3 is really just a value capture mechanic where if any of these assets are performing well a song a youtube video a podcast a blog post a tweet whatever it might be us being able to collect that adds these new incentives around sharing and virality that i think is going to be extremely important for curation and be the exact reason why we're going to see such an existential leg up in the market over the next three to five years i want to get technical for a minute we talked about the the six million active users on audience they moved last year over to solana they were initially built on ethereum really couldn't scale effectively on ethereum moved to solana i don't know if still in the process of moving components of the ecosystem onto solana why solana versus a layer two if you can speak to that i don't know layer twos were not in a good position to support what audies was doing at the time um at the time of the migration audience was on poa network and it was currently taking up ninety percent percent of the active bandwidth of that network on any given day and so it was really just the bandwidth constraint thing it was like what network can handle all of the transactions that we're processing on a day-to-day basis and so i don't think it was really as much of like a this team versus that team decision it was just like what's up functional and stable today and at that point in time mind you this was a year and a half ago island was basically one of the only places to go ahead and make that migration in the first place and for what it's worth i think that it was an extremely smart choice because there's a very vibrant nft ecosystem on solana now you know there's a an ongoing variety of tools that are being developed and a wider ecosystem that's being created there so i think it was a really smart choice you know the token still lives natively on ethereum and all of the on-chain governance and staking lives natively on ethereum but when you go to audience the platform and you press play behind the scenes what's happening is a request to selana and i think that that was fundamentally necessary to allow this platform to scale to the amount that it wants to i want to do some history talk here you mentioned soundcloud earlier and not being an analog for audience again i don't come from the indie music world that i've never really played in that scene but in doing research here what i what i learned was that soundcloud really had this dramatic fall from grace where it was this place that new artists could go and upload their work and an algorithm would help them get discovered by people who like you know alternative music and then they could build a fan base and go make money on concerts they weren't making money on the streams on soundcloud but they could have concerts and sell merch and they had a bigger fan base because of that and that at some point that basically just like fell off a cliff and the traffic died and soundcloud stopped being a platform what's the story there why did that happen what are the learnings for audience perhaps so everything you said was accurate there the one thing that i would color a little bit more is it wasn't the algorithm that was making a song go viral it was the curation of the platform itself and so there's this huge blog culture around soundcloud where a song would get shared by a blogger that blog would go on a site called hype machine and people would upvote tracks to basically push it to the top of the list if you had a number one song on hype machine on soundcloud it was going to do numbers because that was seen as kind of like the cream of the crop charts and so there's this whole system around curation and reposting and what ended up happening is people started to make collectives where they would be releasing music together there would be like five or six artists that were all sharing it it increased the likelihood of getting put on a blog and then these stories kind of started to happen where there was large narratives around the music than the song itself where things started to go wrong as people started to commoditize reposting and so they would say if you pay me 20 i'm gonna repost this song on an account that has a hundred thousand followers that primitive got multiplied where there were then repost chains where you could pay a thousand dollars to have your song reposted to 10 million followers that was all just accounts reposting song without any real endorsement and so the average everyday meaning of a repost got completely diminished where people stopped caring about repost there was no significance to it whereas at one point in time if you got a repost from skrillex or flume or diplo or whatever it might be that was [ __ ] money you know like you were going up on hype machine like it was a really big deal people were talking about it on twitter and instagram but once that started to lose its touch and people were just paying to play essentially the specialty and the novelty of that went away soundcloud basically did a huge fundraise from a major label they started policing mixes a lot more they started policing remixes a lot more and so a lot of that early collaborative discovery nature that existed in the early days of soundcloud got replaced by this desire to monetize and so you had to pay 15 a month to have all your catalog on the platform um you were getting takedowns very easily you were kind of having these songs that you couldn't stream for free you had to have a certain type of membership and so all of these guard rails ended up becoming a way to kind of segment culture and i think once culture left the room so did all the money that was being created with it damn that's fascinating what it gets to too is this the importance of curators which i know is something you feel really strongly about you've really been a curator throughout your career and love of music where do what is the role curators play in this new web3 ecosystem of music and monetization i think it is the biggest opportunity for anyone who's a fan of music today you know the reason i buy so many music nfts is not because i think i'm going to make a lot of money it's because of the curation aspect of it i think for the first time in history you as a fan of music can have a career just by liking good music which is something crazy to say but historically that has not been the case if you like good music and you're really good at finding it you could go be an a r at a major label you could go be a curator at spotify and make a proprietary playlist for the company but there's not really been ways for you to stand alone and operate as an independent curator and so for web3 i think that curators are going to be the single most important way that we drive secondary sales to these artist economies in the same way that you see curators quote unquote like ds or keyboard monkey or xenica or you know 50 other names that i could mention the exact same thing is going to happen in music i think that these people are going to be the ones that are really moving markets in a really meaningful way i think it's someone that's able to capture the culture in a very pure way and start to output that through your creation of what you're buying i think there's an entire career opportunity to be made on the back of the curation that you're doing every single day where do you show off your curations is it just open c right now it's open c i mean sound xyz has a really good page to show up their records catalog has a profile page i'll be honest with you the curation and the visibility of music is pretty bad right now there's actually not really a good place to show that off there's a lot of team working on it but i think one of the major unlocks for music nfts is going to be the social experience around it and so something that i'm really excited about is if i go and i see a halsey record streaming on spotify there's this canvas cover art behind it that's this cool visual layer i want to be able to press a button and collect that and then have a social graph that i can go and show my friends hey not only do i like this song but i actually spent five dollars collecting it because i really like it and if i'm someone that asked me like what kind of music do you like i just send them my collection and they can see what songs i really resonate with as my virtue of the different music nfts that i've collected spotify's suggested that they're they're gonna start playing with nfts are you tracking this are you excited about this is it meaningful or it's nothing at this stage i would say every major social company in the world has suggested that they're playing around with web3 by virtue of it being a necessity but i'm a lot more excited to see who actually ships something of value so that we can talk about what they're practically doing instead of the implication of them doing it fair enough uh who do you think is the next wave of adopters here you mentioned some pretty small numbers 2500 to 5 000 people who are actually collecting music nfts in any sort of meaningful way what's the next wave the next way is a combination of nft buyers so people are buying board apes people that are buying art blocks and it's a combination of average everyday super fans so someone who's really really passionate about an artist but has never bought an nft before i think the vertical in the middle there is basically convincing someone who yolos on pfps every day that they should give music nfts a shot paired with someone who's never bought an nft in their life but really loves an artist that it might be worth it for them to buy the music nft for .05 each as their first record and their first way of coming into the ecosystem i feel like we have to mention the chainsmokers who are a huge act have you been working with them to bring them on to web3 i've not been working with them personally i mean they're good friends of mine they have a venture firm called mantis which they've been doing amazing investing in the space for quite a long time now they recently did a drop on royal which i know that you're alluding to which is fantastic so they put out a new album and they basically gave away music nfts representing one percent ownership in the album for free and so if you were a vip fan who was someone who had listened to their music you'd bought tickets to their show or merchandise you got whitelisted to come and claim one of these early records and you could basically collect a version of the album that represented a one percent claim on all of the royalties from all the streaming on spotify and again realistically that's not gonna be that much money which is why i think it's great they did it for free because i was looking at some of these numbers i mean they do 34 million i think monthly streams or something as as a band but realistically that doesn't amount to one percent of whatever they get doesn't amount to all that much especially divided among the 1900 people who get to hold these initial nfts is that right that's correct the thing i really liked about it is one that they did they did something you know which is something that a lot of artists aren't doing right now they're just being out there being experimental they gave it away for free or is very clear that this was not a profit generating opportunity for them they showed providence and consistency by saying hey we care about this space we don't quite think it's at a space where all of our fans can participate but we're going to do something very light just to get started and so when i look to collect music entities moving forward the biggest thing that i look for is consistency you know it's not necessarily like how much do i think that this song is going to go up you know how much do i think that this artist is going to appreciate in value it's just like is this artist coming back time and time again are they showing up to different spaces are they supporting the ecosystem as a whole are they doing things that's moving the needle forward and if i'm seeing that they're coming back time and time again i get really excited about that because i'm actually far more excited about someone who's tokenized five different records over the course of three months more so than i am about someone who has 50 million monthly listeners dropping one nft one time and then never being seen again cash grab versus somebody who's really in it to build the space and benefit the ecosystem as a whole yeah i want to give some clarity on that because i don't think that anyone is intentionally cash grabbing you know like i've sat with so many different artists teams at this point that i want to do things in web 3 and that word always comes up they say we want to get in the space really authentically we don't want this to come across as a cash grab no one goes into it being like yo i'm going to make 10 million dollars i'm going to be out like what do you think you on board so i think that people are not misguided in terms of their intent i think that they just get really lost because they do a drop and they see that people just aren't supporting it or their job doesn't do as well as they want it and then they get scared and never want to come back and so i think the role that i've been playing for a lot of artists is really just around like level setting and expectations and being like hey people don't care about you and web 3. i know you have 10 million followers on instagram and i know you have 10 million monthly listeners but people do not care about collecting your nfts you need to really start from the ground up and show that you can sell 25 100 a thousand before you can try and sell 10 000 and make 10 million dollars and the reason why people are getting disenfranchised is because they're just shooting for the stars they're selling something to people that they don't know what they want to do what they have any expectation of doing in the future and so people are left holding the bag because these ideas were very half-baked and so i think to the chainsmokers example giving it away for free doing it on a platform like royal which is doing a really fantastic job doing it with their new record those are all things that i love and i think moving forward when they do their next nft people are going to come back and say hey i remember that record you gave away for free i think that was a really cool idea and someone like myself is going to be more willing to purchase something because of the fact that they saw they had brand awareness and consistency and i think that's the exact metric that i look for as i'm collecting any artist in the space at large does your advice to to new artists or the artists you're trying to get in vary depending on the genre of music they're in like it would feel like alternative music would play better here than like your straight pop but i don't really know no because i look at the relationship the artist has with their fan not necessarily the type of music that they're making and so i think that different fan communities resonate more deeply with specific types of music so for example i think that electronic music communities are a little bit more die-hard than um let's call it like a pop a pop act for a lot of ways but i don't know watch out watch out yeah it's not across the board into my territory they're pretty pretty serious out here but what i will say is that um for artists that are looking to get into web 3 i asked them like how in touch are you with your fans and then i say within that fan base how in touch with you are your super fans and if we zoom into that i think that's the demographic that i look to try and build for not necessarily how do we get everyone in the world to collect one of these records but for that one percent of people that have been following you for 10 years what would they want and what's something that would get them over the line and if we can design a system or a process around that i think that's the way that they can have a sandbox to experiment with that feels very safe and guarded and knows that has strong support i think over time you then branch that out bubble it up until it eventually gets to their whole fan base but it really starts with just one super fan at a time i think that's such a a good point and it's important to to emphasize we've we talked about superfans a little bit earlier but really emphasizing that to people that were in this creator economy shift that you and i have talked about it's a legion phrase which is like it's not just about a thousand true fans anymore it's it's really can be about 100 true fans and that nfts and and web 3 are unlocking this ability to monetize and really be supported as a creator with just a hundred people who absolutely love your work and that's so exciting and for people who are maybe afraid to jump in like let that be something that encourages you right is that that's a bite-sized chunk to take on hey let me just focus on getting 100 super fans that's exactly right and it really challenges you to think about the relationship with all those individual collectors selling 25 music entities right now is extremely difficult you can have 5 million monthly listeners but trying to get 25 people to buy one of your nfts is not an easy feat and so i've personally really loved the shifted mentality where people are having to work really hard just to get every single little sale i think this is why we're going to start to see artists really break out in the next two years over web 3 is because they're going to have this sort of thick skin that comes from getting 25 people individually to buy a record and i think if we have a lot more of those experiments people are going to start to appreciate how hard it is to really succeed in this space over time it's going to be easier but those people who had to go through the tough times at the beginning i think you're going to see the people who are reaping the most rewards in the future because they went through this sort of phase of music nfts where you had to work your ass off to be able to sell 25 records is there a regulatory piece of this going to to royal which i don't know if we've we've explained royal yet at this point but folks are probably familiar and again it gives you the right to buy into a project and then own a piece of the masters the chainsmokers launched on there you can own one percent of this new album they're dropping where it has a higher likelihood of being classified as a security like how is that regulatory landscape looking for music nfds i think it's a valid point to be concerned about it i don't think that it's as big a deal as people make it out to be i think that for a lot of these projects they are pushing the needle and what it means to have ownership over different artist projects you know honestly a lot of that falls into the ballpark of maybe being classified as security i won't speak to the way that royal's dealing with that because they have spent far more time with their council than i have what i can say is they're very confident in their stance that this is not a security and i'm going to go ahead and just let it ride with that but at the end of the day i don't think that we should be scared about ownership and be scared about giving rights to our holders because this is what the space needs is a whole far beyond music to move forward and if we exist in this sort of middle ground we say that every asset is valueless and only has governance rights we are not going to succeed as an industry we need to get a point in time where you can feel comfortable saying it's okay for you to earn a dividend or it's okay for you to earn some eath if you're a value-added contributor to this ecosystem and so i've been a lot more forward with trying to push forward that narrative saying lean in to the uncertainty around regulation rather than try and put your hands up and run away and wait for guidance which is never going to come in the first place if we take that path yeah you got to force the guidance to come by diving in and doing it well enough that they can't deny you one distinction i feel like i've heard as i i've dug into this a little bit is it's one thing if you are for example the chainsmokers you have a product that's out and now you're offering like an ownership stake in this existing product versus perhaps saying i'm an artist who's trying to fundraise in advance of something and say like hey you know i'm selling this up front for in advance going to make a piece of work that you're going to have a stake in there seems to be perhaps a regulatory distinction between those two scenarios again very much not being the pro but something to to kind of try exactly right yeah so royal only exists uh to release records that have already been put out so far and so royal's not doing anything that hasn't been released yet they're only taking records that already exist and giving you ownership over those masters that have already been released and are already streaming today that yeah that makes sense um okay last topic that i want to get into i think this is a term and used in your newsletter and you should you should plug that for folks because it's great and you give a lot of awesome updates about what's happening in the music ecosystem i think it was in one of your newsletters you talked about creator stock markets and this idea of like betting on artists and their careers and uh i want to set this up by saying i'm fascinated by this concept of like the financialization of everything and i think you hear it oftentimes in like very fearful terms of like you know we're going to have another financial crisis because all these bubbles because now everything's going to be a financial asset and i'm skeptical of that narrative i think there's actually some really amazing things that are happening i was in puerto rico and interviewed a tattoo artist who's selling nfts where now the only way to get tattooed by him is is to own one of his nfts which is a way to speculate on the future value of a tattoo by this artist but it's not something like goldman sachs is diving into to like inflate into oblivion and then crash the market right it's like tattoo fans and it's people who like this particular tattoo artist who are getting in on this so i think it's really exciting but i would love to hear you talk about this concept of creator stock markets and how it's playing out in music and and um what excites you or scares you perhaps about it i'll start by saying that all artists are businesses whether they recognize it or not i think that we're very far away away from the creator stock market existing in its pure form but in the same way that we want to purchase five dollars worth of amazon stock i don't think there's any reason why i can't purchase five dollars worth of jack harlow i think that that's a really difficult conversation to wrap your head around but i think that web 3 is the unlock that makes this a reality and so we've seen a big wave of social tokens right we've seen fan coins like portugal demand where you can buy the likeness of this artist but the biggest reason why i don't think this is stuck with people is there's nothing underpinning it i think the biggest change with music nfts is we now have on-chain cash flows that are going back into a community treasury and tokens represent governance over those those assets so if we zoom out far enough anyone can make a social token but i think what we're going to see happen is in the same way that only specific companies get listed on the nasdaq after they proved themselves to be a viable company in a viable business i think creator stock markets will be social tokens that are sort of curated and listed based on the fact that they approved on-chain records on-chain revenue you know historical sales and they have this sort of system underpinning it where this is no longer just a speculative bat on some arbitrary fan coin you know these are pure artist ownership in the the most real sense of the word and so that's why i've been so passionate about music nfts i think it's the underpinning for the existence of artists economies and i think if we zoom back and we look over a five to ten year time horizon there is no reason why you should not be able to buy five to ten dollars of your favorite artist and that world is extremely interesting to me and something that i hope to play a very big role in building so interesting i think of all the ramifications of this which of course you can't think of all the ramifications because i think this is a huge just cultural shift that would be underway but i i do worry a little bit about artists mental health i interviewed danny cole and and he even started commenting on he's like i feel like i'm at the forefront of this phenomenon that really hasn't happened much in history where like i feel like the ceo of a public company where what i say impacts the price of an asset that a bunch of people hold and like i'm now impacting their livelihoods in some ways and like as an artist i didn't feel like i was signing up for that like the ceo of pepsi knows they have to watch their words like i didn't eat cold and think about that um which is fascinating but i think your point of like they're already businesses right what danny cole said mattered before anyway for his artist career it's just really visible now in a way that it wasn't perhaps before yeah and i think the idea of all artists being the ceo of their own business is extremely scary i think the more likely scenario is that most artists won't be ceos of their own artist project they will be the creative lead the creative output you know they're going to be producing these incredible works but you know in the same way that any team scales in web 3 where you have a very small set of individuals at the beginning that branches out to this wider community i think the responsibility of that artist can change over time you know they're not responsible for hiring or like spending the marketing budget or determining the drop structure their nfts they can go and make incredible art they can do their thing and talk to the world in the way that they always do and there can be a sophisticated team underneath them that's supporting this ecosystem but as a whole it all comes together by owning this one token that represents ownership in that brand and i think the more that we challenge that equation the more exciting it's gonna be for curators such as myself and honestly the reason why i've spent all my time trying to figure out how it's gonna work well thank you so much cooper i mean we'll well koopa do you want to go probably god koopa troopa or cooper on this call you've got koopa troopa on your thing whatever it's about whatever whatever works i i i mentioned this to you earlier but i've like literally just been singing the super troopers i was gonna find you abbasong in all of my research for this episode um last question do you have a favorite band my favorite electronic artist is alenia my favorite independent artist is tycho and my favorite rapper right now is probably post malone or kid leroy amazing and nope no pop artist you don't have a favorite pop artist really liking the new harry styles album i think it's funny all right okay yeah you do dabble i was watching a bankless interview where uh i think david joked about wanting to be able to short country music and he's really excited for the creator stock markets that he can uh short country music so i won't ask you if you have a favorite country song or a favorite country band all right koopa thank you so much for being here this was a blast we'll have you back on to track how this ecosystem is evolving i love it thank you for the time and i look forward to doing one soon [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked
