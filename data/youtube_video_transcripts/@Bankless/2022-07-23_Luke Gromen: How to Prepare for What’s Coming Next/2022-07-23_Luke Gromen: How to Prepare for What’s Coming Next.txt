how should we position our portfolios going into what seems to be a very uncertain decade with a lot of volatility my portfolio 25 cash 25 gold 25 stocks 25 real estate and then you just adjust based on what moves the cash gives the optionality to me when i think about gold i love bitcoin in there i think the key is to be unlevered this whole process is so political i can't tell you whether the fed could come out tomorrow and grow the balance sheet something could break that'll be outgrown tomorrow or they could be weaponizing this against russia there may have been a decision made behind closed doors is we want oil at 40. we don't care if nasdaq crashes we don't care if bitcoin goes to zero oil has to be 40 anything else that breaks it doesn't matter i don't think they can do that but if they try that and you're levered you're going to lose everything
