foreign [Music] ation on the Pod today we have Jordan Hall who is a Serial entrepreneur was at mp3.com and founded DivX and on this episode we are it's actually the second episode that I've done with him we did an episode about a year ago uh entitled game B which is all about creating an omni win Civilization and um man A lot has happened since my first episode with Jordan chat CPT 3 has happened three hours Capital has happened SPF has happened and we've also seen how Dallas can evolve a little bit more so in this episode we talk about how do we create decentralized collective intelligence how do we create a decentralized neocortex um neocortex of course being part of the brain that's responsible for executive function and for coordinating resources how do we solve coordination failures but without creating authoritarianism which is you know one of the themes that we explore with Daniel smacktenberger is this idea of a meta crisis and a third attractor where we solve coordination failures with decentralized governance so I'm just really ex um appreciate Jordan's perspective as a serial entrepreneur someone who's decentralized power in organizations that he's been involved in but also as a philosopher and a priori thinker about how to create decentralized social movements that are intelligent collectively intelligent so I really just think that Jordan is this lucid and articulate thinker and I enjoy the way he breaks down problems and this is one of my favorite episodes that we've done over the last few months because it deals with decentralized collective intelligence I think that's one of the big Promises of the web 3 space so coordination I think that you're really going to enjoy this episode with Jordan Hall enjoy working in web3 is awesome but

I've been calling the Neo neocortex uh which by the way is you know one of the reasons why we're talking about is that it's at least substantially distributed right so unlike the neocortex that happens to live inside our individual skull the neo-neokortex is what happens when distributed cognition kind of finally gets his [ __ ] together maybe a final point on it um and you and I had had a a brief back and forth in the on Twitter in the context of decentralized governance which is a a part of that story and I think it'd be great to to just start hammering on that question yeah sounds good let's go down the deep end so I think that my the the Tweet thread that we engaged on and the reason why we decided to do another podcast together um was that I think I was talking about decentralization of power meaning decentralizing responsibility and so basically how do how do you teach people to be able to self-govern there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that power so I think that that was the immediate trigger for the conversation but one thing I'll drop before I hand this the speaking mic back to you is that you know and some of the work that that I've been doing with uh talking to Daniel schmachenberger and others about the meta crisis there's this idea of um coordination failure being um one attractor for human activity and and systems of human activity uh you basically have uncoordinated action that leads to things like climate change and externalization of harm biodiversity collapse and then uh the second attractor is um is is basically regulating that coordination failure so that there is no more externalization of harm but that attractor can lead to authoritarian sort of government and you know once you give people the power to regulate you how do you know they're not going to use it in a in a way that abuses that power and then so the looking for a a third Basin of attractor for human activity which is decentralized governance uh governance that allows you to solve coordination failure but not get the authoritarian outcomes that would come from handing over complete power to someone over for you and so you know my aperture for this conversation is is not only practical trying to figure out how to decentralize responsibility at Bitcoin but it's also trying to solve this game theoretic problem of how do you solve coordination failure but without creating authoritarianism how do you create a decentralized uh way of coordinating humans so that's my volley back to you what does that bring up for you yes well the first thing that I'd like to put out there is I I really like it when I'm interacting with people who have uh both sort of they see the tactic and the Strategic or the Practical big picture simultaneously empirical and a priority knowledge yeah you're getting the problem really in git coin which is to say it grounds and does it actually work for something that you're putting a lot of skin in the game in and you're contemplating it from the point of view of the biggest picture uh concerns and that you don't have both you're probably going to get into some kind of trouble because we're we are we're in the thick of it right so things that kind of work on the ground practically but if they're not grounded in something that will continue to work as the system continues to evolve and the stakes continue to go up we might actually have have sort of bought the ticket on the wrong train um contrary wise of course if all we're doing is sort of Pie in the Sky we're not actually grounding it in what actually works in reality then we're definitely um you know gonna kind of get it when it comes to the to the end of the game so another triple I put to you and I think they may actually fit in an interesting geometry is the false dichotomy of market and State so in some sense somebody might say oh yeah decentralized governance we already had that it's called the market yeah um and in some sense they're actually correct so you have coordination failure up here then you have Pure centralization or totality down here I actually call it totalitarianism even more than authoritarianism uh and we're looking for something which is and I won't say actually the middle but something that's not that like a third axis but the same thing's going on with the false dichotomy of market and state where I would say that both market and state are are the same in the same since the sort of Coke and Pepsi are both a form of sugar water and they're in a in a de facto conspiracy against water itself the market is something that has a role to play in supporting distributed or decentralized coordination but it has a whole series of failure conditions and bureaucracy or hierarchical formal constructs uh have a role to play it has a whole series of failure conditions and we've been led to believe that the the solution is in the alternative I.E if you really believe in markets they're the right answer and hierarchies of the trouble if you really believe in hierarchies then they're the right answer and markets lead to trouble and maybe you think they trade but I'm saying there's actually a third attractor that is the actual proper response and I think that these two ways of thinking about it actually fit together quite nicely um however or and one of the most challenging elements is something that I've been calling the through the Looking Glass problem and the reason why I call it that is that there's something like a a weirdly potent inversion or reorientation is actually even better remember the the scene in uh Ender's Game where um they realize they're actually in a non-gravity environment so this it's not clear what the direction of down could be and how difficult it is to actually coordinate when you don't have an orienting basis in a shared Direction and of course enters like the enemy's gate is down done now we now are reorienting in a new basis and it's something like that like an inversion of the the past 500 years or so have put us in a a deeply psychological and cultural inertia of a particular form of how we go about even thinking about what coordination means and that one of the things that's happening right now is we're going through a Looking Glass we're actually coming into something which is in many ways the inverse of that so you know I could give examples of that in a moment actually I'll give you an example of that right now um one of the things that I would propose for those who are thinking about things like Dallas like quite practically or for that matter any group is a very interesting distinction between the concept of of politics and the actual root of that which is polytea and their almost perfectly inverse to each other so politea has the sense that there is some being some wholeness like let's go with like a an ocean or a lake or a river or a forest that has its own let's say essence or its own Spirit or its own it wants to not need to most particularly values and the human beings that are called to give agency to that being are in service to that and your job is not to make choices yourself but rather to discern what that would want if you could perceive clearly and this is by the way politea Athens like Athens has a beingness and our jobs as citizens of Athens is not to engage in horse trading between each other to figure out like who gets to win what piece of it but actually to collaboratively discern what is actually the essence of Athens expressing and how do we embody that yeah and then politics is the kind of crude inversion of that when that being goes away where we are actually no longer Guided by a wholeness but rather are in fact reduced to horse trading between each other these kind of limited finite and relatively moloch um captured beings that will fall into various kinds of multi-polar traps right multi-polar is the exact inverse of wholeness so one proposal I would make is to see if there's a way for us to collectively re-awaken or return to what politea really means and no longer Endeavor to solve problems by means of politics which I would propose is in fact just sort of preordained to do in the in the moloch sense if I'm using terms that have some legibility in different sub communities if these terms like don't mean anything you just let me you know I can expand it into a different frame sure molec being the the sort of like visceral representation of coordination failure as the god of coordination failure is is sort of the shorthand they used here I think specifically multi-polar traps so coordination failure that is baked into the way that an our system is actually architected so try as you might we all can kind of sit around the table and agree that X is the place we'd like to go but because of the way that the communications and incentive landscape is constructed we will always end up in a completely different location typically a really bad one um sort of a great classic example is uh imagine that we were on an island that had a culture where everybody gave themselves a very intense painful electric shock every day obligate it was it was sort of culturally obligated and anybody who didn't do that was immediately killed by everybody else and so we could all kind of like sit around going man it should be a whole lot better if we didn't you know shock ourselves every day we're like oh that'd be a whole lot better but if you don't have the right kind of in Communications infrastructure the coordination failure um leads everybody to default to the the the local Optima of shocking yourself every day rather than getting torn apart rather than being killed um and the premise is that the notion the entire category of politics um which is effectively how do we generate a synthetic uh group that has a strong enough capacity to win some kind of conflict if you design it as a first pass the post Winner Takes all electoral system using a um each individual you know one man one vote kind of mechanism that's a conflict that has a zero-sum game and it has a certain um kind of topology that defines what winning looks like so such a system will always have two parties and they'll be maximally polarized in a finite time and and that's so that's that like so the idea is once you design the game in a certain way the end state is just a matter of how long does it take for the system to get to its track yeah it becomes deterministic in a way yeah exactly and so the premise is that this other thing polytea at the big picture is is a piece of what we're looking for let me throw some other pieces in um another piece that's very important is to say okay if you're if you're working like many of the people who I think might be listening to this um in the subdomain of decentralized governance or or dealing with governance challenges in the context of web 3 crypto even Bitcoin Etc be mindful of the fact that you're dealing with something which is part of a larger story and with this new form of governance this neoneocortex um and that's important like okay I may be solving a very particular problem that is right in front of me but I'm actually dealing with a much bigger picture I'm dealing with governance at large and therefore by the way many of the problems that I'm dealing with are because I'm trying to force a hammer to also be a screwdriver and maybe the better thing to do is just look outside of the the toolbox that I think I've got what are the kinds of tools are there in the sort of the the total toolbox of human history um that might be the proper tool so for example a good King is a very very effective form of governance and if you happen to actually be able to be lucky enough to get a good King um then you're probably going to have a very successful governance mechanism right that's actually really good what's the meme there it's a benevolent dictator so you've got someone who's got total power but they're totally benevolent in in how they use it and uh yeah I think those two things are like countervailing metrics like you have total power but you're totally benevolent and how you use it well that's that's like even Define a little bit of what would that look like because there's a couple of boundary conditions one is you actually have to have a coherent domain and in the sense of the Good King you have to have a kingdom which is a real like an actual boundary um it has to be um well say it's a coherent domain a nice example is to shift metaphors to the to the body like the heart the heart has a is a monarch right it has a single governance principle which happens to be the signaling mechanisms of the particular cells that enable coordinated like no coordination failure at all like a trillion cells all perfectly in sync and almost no failure but it's bounded right it actually is very clearly a single thing it has a raison ditra it has a what does it mean to be a heart cell and not a long seller there's a lot of stuff that tells you what it is and what it's not and so it's very clear so you need to have a well-defined domain it actually actually has to be a real actual thing in the world that makes sense as an integrated whole um it has to actually be an integrated whole so the first speaks to its potentiality the second speaks to its actuality right so if you accidentally have a um you know a cancer cell in the middle of your heart you're going to have a lot of trouble if for some reason in the way that you uh developed in embryonically your heart has three valves instead of four valves it's going to be challenging it may not actually functionalize so it has to be not just in potential um a an actual hole but has to be an actual hole right so that's that and then finally you have to have some kind of governance mechanism which is uh from a cybernetics perspective has exactly the right control capacity to deal with the inputs and outputs of that of that domain it can perceive all the signals that are relevant to the thing it's dealing with and it can issue control uh structures with the right kind of rate or say bandwidth is a good term with right bandwidth to provide the feedback so the control operates um and is intrinsically bound to The Domain itself right so the hearts governance mechanism has no capacity interest or desire to govern the lungs right so that's like that's that's the thing we're talking enough and notice that the body is a really interesting example of a quite nicely decentralized governance mechanism you know it's not like you're a single uh homogeneous organism where everything is governed by the brain and the liver does a lot of stuff a lot right and things of the brain has no awareness of it all the lungs do their own thing the heart does its own thing and the good you know got to help with the small intestine in the gut biome this is massively decentralized governance and in fact the proper partitioning of functions to domains that are well-bound that are well integrated and have cybernetically proper governance mechanisms in the context of a larger protocol where each piece is actually held in proper Dynamic relationship with all the other pieces okay now we're starting to get somewhere um so that's those like some more things to put into place and I would mention by the way access to mechanism different metaphors like I'm using the human body as a metaphor to describe governance so this so as to give perspectival insight to a different problem domain like a Dao you can do that like four or five different ways you can say an ecosystem a forest which is different than a body right organisms aren't the same as organs all right interesting I can start thinking more clearly about this um the other one I would put we talked about this actually in our Twitter feed is actual lived experience um this isn't the kind of thing that can properly be dealt with by means of what I'm going to call call it ideology or Theory it's complex it's very complex but it's like one of the most complex things in the universe is humans trying to work together in groups and um if you haven't actually done it if you haven't actually lived it with real skin in the game like real steak and therefore the consequence have failed a lot meaningfully and felt that failure deeply um there's just gonna be a whole bunch of stuff you don't grasp at all uh and contrary wise we probably should be let's say honoring or at least not throwing out in the past when you say 100 000 years of acquired wisdom in how this sort of thing works uh so there's a lot of jewels or a lot of diamonds that have been gathered by Humanity many of which aren't proper you know let's say the the various forms of domination incentive constructs were developed to govern the Bronze Age okay we're going to probably throw away thread of torture as a primary mechanism of intimidating people into doing what you want fine good and also there's lots of other stuff that was actually learned in that time frame that we want to conserve because it was hard earned and actually Deployable in our current environment yeah I think you know one of the the sort of memes that comes to mind for me there is the idea that any new system of governments should transcend and include the the previous form of governance and you know that can mean different things in different contexts uh yeah with Bitcoin going from being a company to a dow um you know hopefully my context and awareness is transcended and included in the way uh Bitcoin governs itself and now I'm a minority stakeholder um and yeah to your point you know the the heart doesn't govern the lungs and vice versa you know by modularizing a system and giving each organ its own specific form of governance then you sort of limit the scope of you know one entity being in charge of the whole whole on around it and that's a way to sort of break up um the way a distributed system can can do governance but um you know I'm wondering if from from what you just said if there's any other best practices that you know if we could come up with by the end of this episode a list of six best practices for uh doing decentralized governance for building that Neo neocortex of how a system can govern in itself I'm I'm wondering what else you would that add to the list yeah well let's just let's dance with that so the metaphor of Neo neocortex is quite nice because when you say that the the development of the human body the cortex does most of the stuff in terms of coordination of the various distinct organs of the body uh the the neocortex is actually a relatively thin um control mechanism and that's important to think about and if we're talking about a neo-neocortex interesting so if we have stuff like markets and we have stuff like a hierarchical organizations bureaucracies of which all corporations are variation on that theme we may want to be thinking about this category of decentralized governance neoneocortex in that same sense meaning what we're actually trying to do is properly modularize each of the particular well-defined domains that are part of our arcology and then creating a protocol that allows them to operate together well so the the kinds of choices that are held at the level of the at the highest level of the stack are many cases quite simple and much of the complexity is actually handled much lower in the stack and at modules that may in fact be corporations for example um okay now this is a little bit of a slice but I think it needs to land quite nicely one of the challenges that we're dealing with is that because we haven't had this kind of integrating protocol in the past um and human activity has largely been um almost exclusively being captured or concentrated in this um inclusive corporations or hierarchies uh we've had a problem that our hierarchies are in fact not kingdoms they're not well defined like Lockheed and Barton is a paperclip maximizer it intrinsically cannot help but want to expand to actually be everything I'm not pointing at that Montgomery Corporation Google alphabet in other words unlike a heart that very much is just going to heart and not at all try to liver every corporation intrinsically must expand to fill the entire space all right and the only reason it doesn't is because other corporations are pushing back against it and a proper operating protocol would in fact prevent that from happening right it would actually design organisms that are are more like organs which to say that they're well-defined well-bounded and their governance doesn't have in its intrinsics they want need or desire to expand right so what that means is like the human oh [ __ ] let me let me actually add one more piece to this because it's it's critical part and parcel of the reason why the previous period of time has created so much trouble is that uh each individual human's diversity of interests and needs have been forced through a very narrow channel meaning you worked at a job and so all the different values that you have as a human had to be squeezed through the you know director of marketing at GM um and so this this actually is way wrong because it's a mess and what it does it creates an energy inside GM for it to become an Empire right to expand and expand and expand but because in this concurrent environment that's not how it works or at least it will evolve more and more to not being the case like you will actually have many like dozens or hundreds of distinct ways that you can give and add value many of which might be qualitatively distinct so it's a much you know a wider distributed field of ways of giving value and therefore the fact that some particular sub node has kind of reached all you're doing is sort of providing maintenance and small trim tabbing to make sure it's exactly right and not indifferent to expand it doesn't bother you because you're not limited by the fact that you've been wholly captured into that piece now you're not losing your ability to thrive by having this sub piece stay exactly what it is quite the opposite um so keep that in mind that's another uh how would I say um principle is every individual should be only contributing to a particular organization uh as a partial aspect of their whole self and two degree to which their particular values are being highly if not perfectly realized in that contribution so so let me just say back to you what what I think you said which is um the uh fiduciary duty that happens in for profit uh corporations causes them to be a paper clip maximizer for shareholder value and therefore if you're I don't know the VP of marketing uh that organization the whole plurality of all of your attributes and your values gets compressed into how do I create fiduciary value for this Corporation um and a world that transcends and includes that with a like a Neo neocortex maybe that person has a plurality of organizations in which they give um larger apertures of themselves and there's a plurality of things that are being maximized for um instead of just like that one paper clip maximizer did I did I get that right yeah let me say the other piece a little bit more uh robust so the first piece totally right like share responsibility for shareholder maximization is paperclip maximizer done the other side is something like oh you know if I've got if I'm working in all of my life energy as a productive person is being poured into a single tool the only way for me to feel like I'm expanding my my potency in the world is for that thing to expand and include more of the world in it so it becomes an imperial mandate even I'm just the director of marketing at GM the only way for me to personally feel like I am growing is I have to eat more of GM or for GMD for the world um neither of which is ultimately healthy but if instead of that I actually have let's say 50 things that I'm contributing to um there's another whole other way for me to expand my capacity of the world which is I could have 50 first thing I could just add another dot on my on my graph but my network just gets more robust and the the wholeness of that no longer has a built-in mandate either from the central node the the Dow or from the individuals who are part of it to have that sort of Imperial expansion to just integrate everything into a single point of control right so this is the almost uh you get rid of the incentive for continual centralization it's the the languaging is actually quite formal and uh guys at I think I don't know what his organization is called right now but Joe Adelman and the team has been working on that sort of stuff and I can give you a link have been doing a lot of good work here but it has to do with the the ability to actually operate from values instead of purposes or goals or at least specifically to be able to actually have values be very clear and be uh kind of the orienting basis for how people operate so again I'll give you an example so if you're you're going to work at GM I don't know why I'm giving poor GM the thing let's go make it Google [ __ ] Google so like you go to work one of the consequences of going to with Google is you have to leave your values at the door now you have a job now to some extent you're going to work at Google because you kind of like maybe it fits my values although for the most part these days it's because they're paying me the most money and maybe it has some interesting work to be done so one value I have working on interesting things another value I have getting paid a lot of money those get satisfied and all the sort of like 38 000 values I have get kind of like [ __ ] can't all right so then what happens is your your incentive structure is very oriented towards goal maximization I have extrinsic met things in the world that I want to accomplish I want to get a Lamborghini I want to get you know a big island I want to get you know all the things and and by the way you can articulate values as goals we're not going to make that's a little a little bit esoteric in the current in the new natural ordinary humans don't work that way natural ordinary humans huh is that noise too much I think it's fine it's bearable um natural ordinary humans the the notion of values the term value is the the kind of being that or the kind of being that you want to become in the world are the qualities of being which is to say the set of values that are that you express into the world are the orienting basis that constrains your choices and it's profound that's living a meaningful life and if you're actually able to make your choices on the basis of your actual values you're living a meaningful life and I'm not meaning that to be like fuzzy I'm trying to articulate what that word means like it's a Concrete thing like it's an actual object in the world and in this new environment what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring that back in and we're trying to actually say okay I need to be having some aspect of my values first of all every thing that I'm doing every way that I'm making choices and expressing my choices into the world must be fully harmonized in harmony with the values that I'm making so my values are expressed deeply through this agent channel right so the Tao is a way of extending my values or my yeah my values into the world and because you can partition things quite nicely and break things into modular pieces I don't have to have anything caring more than I can actually carry this simplifies things tremendously at the level of governance and this from the notion of fluidity meaning if I'm part of a dow structure where there's not high values alignment then I should just probably go somewhere else um or maybe a subset I should drop into a different aspect you know maybe there's a certain piece of the story that with the eyes limit is very high or I should be adding value to a different construct over here where the values I want to express are actually going to be well held it doesn't necessarily mean I shouldn't be here it just needs to be there's nothing uh contrary right so it's a it's a weirdly more intense holding of principle a weirdly more intense holding of um what you actually care about as a governing principle right I'm actually saying that fundamentally that the the group should strive continuously such that the values of the individuals are actually being very well expressed by means of participation in the group and where that's not happening that ends up being a primary problem that needs to be resolved like it's fine let's figure that out like maybe we're doing something wrong or we're the wrong group of people or we're not a well-defined domain and so it's actually just intrinsically noisy because if you can get there right if everybody's able to understand here are the here are the values that are the palipaya and here are the values of the essence of this thing and my values are deeply aligned and well expressed then the kinds of conflicts that we find in the domain of politics yeah don't really arise I said do you have different problems but they're not those kinds of problems um so that's another one it's a design principle cool so I'm just going to play that back to you so say I am trying to decentralize some organization that I've been involved in I think having a holonic perspective in which you can see the parts of that organization as holes in themselves but also parts of another whole um allows you to sort of think at the right level of scope and there's probably some modularity in there where each piece has its own scope and then um maybe at the level of the ecosystem the highest hold on or maybe at individual Hollands you've got values and values alignment and as long as the values of the individuals are able to be expressed by their participation in the group um then then that that Dao will remain on track or is more likely to remain on track and where that's not happening that's maybe a primary place to to evolve um the one thing I would take and I would I would sort of extend what you've given me so far and and I'd love to hear your feedback on what I just said but like this idea of social wear versus trustwear I think is new in the Dow space so um Jordan basically the idea here is social wear um is this idea that um is that we can rely on agreements with each other for example you and I agree that um you're gonna give me an Apple uh and until we see each other that's just a social contract in between us and um trustwear is relying on uh cryptographic uh systems machines in order to deliver that so the the smart contract example of this would be uh you create a uh a one apple token and then that's you know you promise that to be on chain through a smart contract that's trustwear and so I think that it's interesting to think that some of these Dows are going to have instead of typical companies which are just social aware up all all the way down with the exception of maybe some legal uh trustwear in there in the form of the bylaws and in the governance structure with with Dallas you've got trustwear and and you can sort of start to segment out where the humans actually have power over each of these modules and scope what exact governance power they have over these modules which allows you to um I would think of it as like if if everything is social aware then there are no bumpers um but but trustwor is almost like bumper bullying where like you can't go that far off course of of whatever the programmatic set of of values that the organization has so that's probably what I would take and extend what you said about modularity and values alignment and values of individuals in these organizations how does that resonate with you yeah it's it's your business it's very highly so let me just kind of give you an example of what that looks like in a different domain what I mean is this there's bones in my fingers that's trustwear right the yeah there's a whole bunch of [ __ ] that's going on at the causal level that I have no conscious awareness of or need to control in any way it's taking care of at a different level in the stack with extremely high confidence like effectively I can assume now on occasion there may be something going on but that doesn't work and my finger breaks or something else happens but more or less that's built in and that's how it works right we actually consistently have these layers of different this notion of different layers of the stack and we always want to render onto Caesar what is Caesar so to the extent possible and appropriate that's a copy I'll give in a second um this is a big piece of the new form of governance it's actually being able to say yeah we can now render into code a whole bunch of functions that rent that make them no longer needing to be governed by this weird tweener capacity of bureaucracy or um yeah it's actually it's very specifically bureaucracy or humans acting as machines right we don't need humans to act as machines anymore we can actually have machines act as machines and they can do that job very well awesome okay now there's essentially two primary failure conditions in that design modality uh one go all the way we go back to that notion of an improperly partitioned domain and so if you're trying to do um you know build trust aware technology that causes the lungs to do heart stuff or you've got heart and lungs mixed into a single thing you're going to find yourself very confused and creating all kinds of weird errors you have to be very clean to understand that your modules are in fact modules like they're really well bound they actually make sense as a whole and that the interfaces make sense and this is tricky when you're decentralizing something that already exists because history of the Legacy that's gotten is here has produced monstrosities right every organization that exists isn't a well-defined um well-mounted thing right it's in in fact it's kind of like a Frankenstein's monster of a sort of partially produced objects you know the each distinct function in say Google and Facebook are um uh like like a weirdly bound cancer cancer cells it doesn't make any sense necessarily for Google to have a particular set of organizational functions in a properly functioned ecology but because we don't have that the boundary of Corporation is wrapped around it you've got all these things that are inside it that actually maybe should never eat it so you decentralize it a lot of that actually just needs to go away and big pieces of other stuff actually need to be reshaped until they are in fact properly modular okay that's one piece right so that's the notion of if you don't actually have well-defined domains then all of your design efforts are going to be trouble and will end up happening is that the human stuff will end up having two cluge what the [ __ ] going on like everything that keeps breaking or getting broke uh we call it wrong results are coming out of it et cetera Etc or the complicatedness of the of the mechanical structure results in a machine that is too including and therefore is error prone like crazy um the other side of it is when we Endeavor largely because of ideological presuppositions to do in trustwear what in fact muster should be done in social work and since this is a the kind of the ideological problem of decentralize all the things or when we say code is law we mean code is the whole of the law something like that and that doesn't make any sense right the the reality is is that choice is an aspect of reality and more importantly choice is the is it is part of the aspect of reality which makes reality think that we care about at all and so what we want to do is we actually want to be rendering to the machine all the stuff but only the stuff that the machine is exactly the right solution for um I should mentioned by the way as I contemplate this conversation I noticed it in myself that things like crypto and AI are part of the same domain like they're part of the same issue and uh the Machining right how do we actually deal with the Machining integrate the machine to have it uh support and Empower our choices well as opposed to convert US into very poor machines or pull from us all the stuff that we actually care about yeah my my sort of theory about well so first off the well scope domain like the point that you just made it is is very well put but just to take your um your your point about uh Ai and in blockchain fitting together uh and run with it my sort of theory on that had been that um blockchains are really great at creating heuristics so your token balance is X Jordan and mine is why um on I don't know token Z and but on token a you have balance B and I have balance C and those are like heuristics and AIS are really good at heuristic maximization uh which is just basically to say climb this hill uh if the heuristic is what's your token balance then um an AI can try to maximize that so you know what if we had a I I don't know a a a token that represented the um the amount of uh the fight against climate change so basically you had an AI this job was heuristic was to maximize the amount of the value of that token and the amount that they had and you set an AI loose on on that heuristic if blockchains can set heuristics for things that are actually good for Humanity then that's maybe how the two systems fit together um yes and no so um this is like that's a really good example because it's like the trickiest place let me flag because I don't want to forget about it uh let's go wisdom and good choices so just like let's get back to that but um there's a profound and by the way obligate there's no other way of doing it that I that I'm aware of so this is a profound and obligate way for the construct that you were just imagining AI blockchains Etc to support humans in properly stewarding the complex world that we live in um and it's it's not going to be the kind of thing where we want to or could design a finite set of metrics that are going to actually result in the solutions that we want so it's it's more like let me think of a good example well I'll give you a very simple example and then we'll stand from that expand from that one um a thermostat is is kind of what you're describing it's the simplest one of the simplest possible constructs between a token system and an AI system in this case a token system is a very simple on off in relationship to a a boundary condition temperature and an AI system that has the ability to actuate some kind of mechanism heating or Cooling in relationship to the uh flagging of the of the metric so that is actually really really good and that's a very functional thing but I think it's very app metaphor too because I think I have an AI thermostat in my house right now so what what you want is you want to say okay at the this is going to be a line there's two things there's you know there's the alignment problem um where if I'm in charge of telling it ultimately what I'd like it to do um and that and the subtlety and Nuance of what that exact means is kind of the the hard problem the challenge I'll get to that in a second yeah but as long as it's not in charge that's it one right so the thermostat doesn't tell me what temperature it wants to optimize for it does what I tell it to do um and and here's the big here's the other piece and in the context of the actual whole reality that I actually live in and so to make an example if your AI thermostat could sort of like perfectly modulate the temperature your body's in but at the expense of turning everything outside of your house into a into an unlivable hellhole you'll be externalizing something that was was wrong right so you've got these two problems right this is like this is the real thing this is actually where we are um you have to actually be able to have a full accounting for literally the whole of reality that you're affecting and the more powerful we get the more that is actually a reality um and you have to actually be able to have a full um how would I say this sovereignty right you have to have full empowerment of the center of sovereignty being in this in the singularity of the human and so those are the two points in between those two points we can't actually have very very high agency or lots of actuation happening in the Machining and now we'll sort of include all of the stuff that happens in technology uh but those two points are subtle and tricky um but let me let me speak to a simpler version of that which is is the the wisdom and good choices thing you know if you look at the expanding Frontier of what people back in the 80s were [ __ ] talking about but never feeling it of AI getting better so chat GPT killing X number of jobs hypothetically we don't know that it actually will but let's just assume worst case scenario and it just sort of obliterates a whole bunch of jobs and then let's iterate again like there's just a sort of expanding sphere software eating the world how much of the world gets eaten well my proposal is is that the boundary of that is wisdom meaning effective choices actually making the actual choices of what to do is the thing that humans are here to do that's our thing we're here to make choices and I mean free will like if you want to be theological about it that's what I'm saying um and we we must not ever and there is no way to get this right if we tried Endeavor to what's that word uh not take that responsibility like to actually drop our responsibility for making choices and Endeavor to actually have machines AI or whatever make those choices for us or in our stead um which ultimately ends up being quite nice because what that means is that we're endeavoring to cultivate and by the way at the level of simple dials for example we're trying to cultivate virtue cultivate wisdom effective Choice making in individuals so unlike corporations which have as their characteristic the need and desire to convert humans into machines cogs I need you to not be a human I need you to Be an Effective director of marketing which means stripping out something like 85 of who you are and then building a bunch of stuff that isn't used so that you can fill this particular role in the extended machine of this organization the the end point and probably not that far away but the end point of this new thing we're dealing with is actually no no I actually need you to be a whole human like I need you to be wise and I need you to be prudent and I need you to have courage right I need to actually up regulate virtue in humans maximally like really really really high quality human one because more and more and more of that other stuff is going to be rendered into the Machining domain so the fact that you were very good at X function is actually rendered obsolete on an accelerating basis and because the the the potency the power that we're wielding is increasing as a consequence and therefore the consequence of the choices that we're making gets actually deeper and deeper and deeper so profounded profundity in governance becomes the you know kind of the thing we're doing we're actually steering these monstrous tremendously powerful machines we're going to do a really good job at it so keep that in mind like next you know key principle is you're really invested I mean like really actually like the HR function of dials should be extending resources and cultivating the virtue of every individual who's participating um and one of the things we talked about by the way is that notion of boundary or membrane meaning uh a sense that like just because you happen to have been born a hopeless Homo sapiens you therefore can and should have perfectly equal rights in governance of every single doubt that you want to be part of is not true right the way I put it is humans are not born Sovereign humans are born with the potential to become sovereign all humans are born with the potential to become sovereign it's hard work to actually be able to carry the responsibility of making effective choices in the world so one good boundaries an invitation only to people who are mature and capable of actually taking stewardship responsibility for something important and being serious about reality in life and then two a deep Mutual commitment on the part of everybody in that group as individuals and as a group to cultivate that capacity further and further by virtue of what they're doing right so I'm going to add um commitment to maintaining the organization or maintaining whatever the scope the purpose for being of the organization from each individual is sort of one of these necessary criteria here no no exactly not not actually maybe deconstruct that in two ways so one is cultivating in themselves like a deep commitment to growth in their own capacities to make effective choices and to discern their own values and to express those values well into the world to become that kind of a person and then the as a consequence the the expression of the values of the of the thing the organization but it's not quite the red term not the purposes but the values of the organization into the world with increasing precision um and increasing what's right with the right word like it's like it's intensity right you've got Precision Fidelity and intensity but all three right really happening so it's really delivering what it's supposed to be doing really well um and cleanly and nothing else into the world like that's what you're real committing to do um like be a really good heart be a really good heart like heart like a [ __ ] don't ever drop the ball on Harding because the whole organism is counting on you to not skip a beat yeah well given that we're getting towards the the back half of the hour um and I just want to make sure that we're converging here we started off by asking the question of like how do decentralization how to turn company into a dow how to organize a dow such that it can be a decentralized coordination mechanism that has a chance it creating a third attractor um and that that's sort of my framing and I've got sort of a list here of having well-defined domains modular pieces for each organism defining values and creating values alignment allowing values to ex or people values of individuals to be expressed by participation in a group and like a self-correction mechanism if that's not happening a deep commitment to growth in people's own capacities um a deep commitment to maintain uh to put to create uh your own values through the the organization's values but also the hopefully that becomes a collective expression of values that that amplifies the values of the organization so if I'm looking to turn a company into a Dao it feels like these are all of the things that should be invested in and then there's sort of like a recursive infinite game in which they play out in such a way that um creates a creates a coordination mechanism or creates a force in the world towards decentralized coordination how does that resonate yeah really good let me let me let me kind of take a piece that we we hit on I want to bring out so the notion of trustwear and social wear and again like both have an important role to play and it's it's critical to actually do the trustwear well but only exactly where it's proper because the converse of that and of course this has been sort of the massive autistic Gap that is slaughtered crypto so so far is you have to actually take the human piece seriously and you can't just assume for the whole what is it SBF Fiasco people are people and we have ways of knowing that people are lying that they're untrustworthy and it's okay like it's okay to actually use the wisdom of of humanity to not give your money to somebody who's untrustworthy and it's okay to use like the stuff we've developed for the past whatever 30 000 years to verify whether or not a person is in fact trustworthy or not carefully and judiciously over time right so it's we should take the human piece seriously and then if you do that well and you combine that with taking the machinic piece seriously now you've got something that will actually work and can carry a lot of weight all right that's that's kind of the key message here like yes there's a lot of really cool powerful requisite obligate like we can't do it stuff happening in the technical domain AI crypto yes and there's a bizarre naivete around probably mostly people who just don't like dealing with the human aspect and therefore really want to not have to build that capacity in themselves um trying to pretend that they don't have to by inventing we're going to put it all in the code no sorry that's not how it's going to actually work you're going to have to actually learn how to deal with other people how to negotiate conflict how to grow maturity in yourself how to communicate clearly how to learn whether or not somebody is actually trustworthy the hard way you have to build groups you're going to have to know how to create boundaries and not let people in like it's just basically what I would say ordinary human maturity but we were several Generations from actually having that and so that's a cultivation we have to consciously we cultivate that and then extend it with the mechanical piece feels like there's a certain amount of change of self and change of system that go hand in hand here no question man we're in a new world for sure and so there has to be both yeah well I want to talk a little bit um because I know I know that we've been sort of talking in this future realm of dowels and AIS and networked organizations but I just want to ground this a little bit in some of your experience in the past um as the founder of of several successful companies in the past and I think that you said that several of the people who worked for you went on to found their own their their own companies and I think you said there's always a nod uh of of helping them but until you've sat in the chair you don't really know and and so you know I'm curious if you could if you could take us back uh over the last 20 30 years of founding companies and being an entrepreneur um in some of the tangible examples of things that you've seen that might sort of ground the audience a little bit in in what you're seeing for the future yeah I mean obviously there's a lot more than we're gonna be able to do in five to ten minutes let me just throw some things that pop up the seam call it relevant so the first is just that when you mentioned the nod um being a leader like actually taking on honestly like earnestly and honorably the responsibility of being a leader of an organization is it's no joke like there's a lot going on there and it's not quite as intense as childbirth but it's it's in that milieu meaning you can't know it until you've actually lived it it's it's you actually care I'm not a sociopath I don't know what the sociopaths do but let's just for the people who aren't you actually care for the people that are part of the organization that you are working with and you care for their thriving and well-being right you don't you don't want them to be wasting their time you don't want them to lose their jobs you don't want them like you actually care for each and every one of them and you're overwhelmed Beyond Comprehension by the fact that there's a lot more of that going on than you could possibly hold and you care about the stewardship of the purpose of the thing right your own values and how the thing you're leading is expressing yourself into the world and you're dealing with the highest degree of awareness of the complexity of the whole deal right you don't have the advantage or the benefit of looking at a particular sub piece and focusing your energy you actually are kind of feeling all of it and you're aware of all the troubles and trade-offs and challenges and in many cases you may be one of the few people in the organization who's actually taking a look at the world outside of the membrane being aware of the complexity of what you're navigating so this is a really serious burden it's a hard Challenge and for most it actually is a back-breaking challenge like you get quite burned out doing that um and you grow a lot of ways that you may not want to right you may have a lot because you have to and if you're if you're committed to the thing you're doing you will and that's you know a growth again can't happen unless it's under that kind of pressure we know this right humans know that we at the end of the day will almost never actually develop new deep rich powerful capacities just because we want to I get it usually requires some kind of of uh so potency or some kind of forcing function to just make us have to get up at six in the morning or five in the morning and just get the job done continuously um okay so one that's all real two there's something about that you're not going to be able to just uh abstract Away by building a uh you know consensus voting function because now you have a bunch of look you lose who aren't really a skin in the game who aren't living and dying and breathing and bleeding who kind of vaguely think like they have lots of rights to do stuff but aren't carrying anywhere near the full responsibility of it there's a reason why those kinds of things don't work very well um and there's a lot of kind of what was entitlements and petulance that comes from not having participated in that but kind of looking at it and I remember when I got myself stuck in being a CEO for the first time literally speaking out loud like well this doesn't look that hard I'm sure we could do better whatever 26 right um yeah it actually is really hard and it doesn't look that hard because you're only seeing a tiny fraction of them so what's the point the point is something like anything that we are doing that is actually in the deserves to be named governance is actually a lot more um honestly important a lot more yeah I'll say important yeah intent right then we kind of have been given not not we but like particularly and I don't mean to be mean but the Millennials in particular and younger have been given a life experience to actually even recognize what that means unfortunately we've built kind of like a Disneyland civilization that hasn't actually given people a lot of capacity to carry heavy weight and deal with uh real responsibility in a deep way where the choices you're making are in fact actually important um and serious and so that seriousness and the the kind of the and the soul that comes from having bad making bad choices where people have gotten hurt and knowing that choices have consequences that you can't really just narrate away or [ __ ] away um is an element of any real group that I would trust with governing anything um now by the way that's the choice making that's not necessarily the perception lots of things can happen in the context of input everybody should have input you have to know what's actually going on and I no no given individual can vaguely perceive like a small fraction of the whole of what's Happening um so that's that's that's that piece um the other piece is just to say like one of the elements that I learned the hard way is humans and human Vice you know um and how incentive Landscapes could [ __ ] things up bad and you had a well-functioning team that all seemed to be uh like a crew that were really pulling in the same direction Had Each Other's backs uh and then suddenly the stake of everybody's piece of the ship gets a lot more valuable and suddenly backstabbing starts happening in way that you would never have expected would happen or people suddenly start slowing down their Collective pulling and thinking about their own individual piece of it yeah man that's real and so more for that matter people are good at talking a good story but actually can't deliver there's all kinds of that stuff right so the the hard-earned piece of the fact that we are really building things out of humans and we want to we need to and there's a difference between buying kind of naive and ideological about how that works and being practical about how that works is what I would put into the middle of the equation that there's something actually imported and real there and the more you honor that the more you earn your Spurs the more effective the things you're participating will end up being yeah well I think there's certainly a lot there I wish that we had a half hour more to get into it but we are running out of time is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say and I'll just I'll just ground that by by refocusing the audience's attention on the original intention of this episode which is how do we build a decentralized neocortex and neo-neocortex and um how can dowels solve for the third attractor solve for coordination failures um is there anything that I didn't ask that you want to say on on the that subject yeah two things and I apologize because I've well like I apologize too much if you know anything about me this is part of what I seem to be doing so I'm gonna throw out some [ __ ] that may actually not be valuable to anybody but if it is valuable you'll like it um so one is the Degen thing um yeah to the degree that we know this like this is very well understood psychology two to the degree to which people's actions are motivated by extrinsic uh metrics meaning piles of stuff they're going to become Degen so this is the molok thing at the individual level yeah two degrees that people are in fact motivated by their values well perceived and well expressed you will have the regen thing it's kind of as simple as that so keep that in mind right if you found yourself surrounded by djens there's probably a very simple reason and you're going to have a really hard time steering that ship okay two this is two is completely different so just like frame change um there's a project that I quite like I've been following called afropolitan that is doing something like a network State although I think it's much richer than that and I was watching a video by a woman who was talking about how much the the consequences of the Napoleonic civil code form of law had wreaked havoc in the former French colonies in Africa and how the English common law system which in many ways resonated with the indigenous uh system of governance or jurisprudence um almost always proves more effective or better and and I would I would point to that right just as a really powerful thing so Civic code the Napoleonic model comes directly out of the French Revolution in the enlightenment style of thinking which Endeavors to perceive or imagine that the uh you can kind of write down a schematic that can literally take into account every possible case and produce the appropriate rule for how to deal with that case in other words it's it's algorithmic it takes an AI approach to how we do governance and it's a terrible way of doing things um common law Works in exactly the opposite direction right what it says is we have a whole bunch of loose heuristics based upon collective experience and we're ultimately going to ground things in wisdom so we're going to have try to have so we're trying to cultivate wisdom in individuals I'm going to try to find the Wise people and we're going to try to use our sort of hard-earned collective experience which is context relevant that actually understands the context all the Deep context of what's Happening and use that to discern really effective choices that are going to be relating to the prac the actual reality of what you're dealing with um I keep hitting on the same theme but in different directions this is the same thing right that's important like it really needs to sink in that if you're running a network State your jurisprudence should be common law I'll simply put it like that um and this is the same thing this is the the there's stuff that can be rented into the machinic yes do it do it cleanly do it well understand where where it works what it can carry and then take that other piece seriously and we can we can point to history of what that looks like and we can copy that we don't have to reinvent it um but avoid the enlightenment mistake and avoid the mistake of thinking that humans acting like shitty machines are the right way to govern anything well it seems like a great place to end Jordan thank you so much for doing this episode with me I really enjoyed our Twitter exchange I enjoy um How Deeply you've thought about some of these subjects and as an operator in the web 3 space I think that um some of these lessons are quite useful and uh tangible for people who are trying to create dials and try to create successful dials at that and it just feels less lonely to hear someone like you talk about it so thanks again for doing this episode with me well you're super welcome I'm glad I'm glad to hear that yeah um yeah any parting thoughts or um where can people find you online before we break oh I hope they don't find me online okay there we go all right well thanks again Jordan okay bye foreign [Music]
