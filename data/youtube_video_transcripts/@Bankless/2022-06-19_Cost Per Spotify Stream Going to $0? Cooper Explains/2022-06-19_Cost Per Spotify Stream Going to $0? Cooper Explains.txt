the cost per stream is gonna go to zero can you explain that why is that why is the cost per stream going to zero spotify is not profitable streaming represents 85 of all music industry revenue right now but it's not a profitable company and the reason that happens is because they had to buy catalog rights from all the major labels in the world to be able to even put it on in the first place and so i think rather than trying to create a system where we can say hey how do we pay more per stream which means we have to appease all these major labels and give them more money it's almost like you have to go back to the core and just say okay people are paying 9.99 a month to listen to all the music in the world what if that's just zero dollars there's a world in which all this music just exists natively for free in a convenient way if we think of open public protocols you know the same way that we do in web 3. i don't see any reason why over a long enough time prize and all these songs will be available just to go and listen to and if you really want to quote unquote monetize it you can collect a version of that song and i think that collectible market is exactly the change it's going to allow us to go from fixing a global streaming problem to instead having this balance system where streaming doesn't have to be the main way that all these others are getting paid
