[Music] welcome to bankwest where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bangless david this was an exceptional interview with jeremy alaire what were some of the highlights for you yeah jeremy alaire founder of circle and usdc uh really a timely episode because of how much regulatory action there's been especially in the last quarter of 2020 and 2021 shows that there's no signs of that slowing down and usdc and crypto dollars seems to be kind of at the forefront of that regulatory conversation so that's one of the big topics that we get into with jeremy elaire as well as of course usdc inside of d5 usdc replacing the commercial banking layer and all the benefits that public permissionless blockchains like ethereum can offer the world using things like usdc yeah it's interesting because he seemed pretty bullish actually on the regulatory side that we're going to kind of come out ahead uh and i'm not sure that he'd always say that um so there have probably been times where i've seen him in in various uh ways frustrated with the regulatory bodies of of the us and kind of their handling of crypto but he seemed pretty optimistic this time around what's interesting to me david is he knows number of these regulators on a a on a first name basis so he's very plugged into that world and kind of fighting for for crypto uh in dc at that level so it's good to see him optimistic on that yeah one of the most interesting components of this interview that was my biggest takeaway was um the relationship between coinbase and circle and usdc uh there was a little bit of unexpected protocol sync thesis conversation to to have there where the the center consortium uh is kind of this neutral layer for producing usdc that coinbase is a part of and circle is a part of and i i thought that was a pretty interesting takeaway yeah absolutely and you know for those of you who are wondering you're saying like usdc guys that's not that's not bankless you're right it's not completely bankless this is kind of a crypto banking uh type product however uh we did talk a lot about how this is the gateway to defy essentially for a lot of people this is the gateway to non-sovereign stores of value commodity monies like bitcoin and like ether and jeremy talked about how he was bullish ultimately on that future this is another bridge into that world and another path to get here i think it would be a shame if people stopped at usdc on coinbase and didn't do anything else um but i don't think that's likely david i think once they get a taste of crypto you know you got to go all in you got to explore the frontier you got to go into where the the action and excitement is which is which is d5 so this is going to be a gateway this is not a replacement of crypto native systems to me yeah and bankless maximalism i don't think is for everyone right so it's not just you know ether and defy tokens in your ethereum address you are using usdc in your ethereum address is way more bankless than wells fargo dollars in your wells fargo account it's always a step in the right direction and the more usdc on ethereum the more financialized and monetized ether the asset and ethereum the economy is so i think it's it's long-term bullish for ethereum no matter what guys this was a fantastic interview just a reminder for bankless paid subscribers there is a 20 30 minute debrief conversation that ryan and i have at the end of every single episode that's where ryan and i just hop into zoom and we discuss the episode right after we record it that is available to all bankless paid listeners as well as well as all the other debriefs we've ever done and some of this is some of the best learning that i get done just having these conversations with ryan after the episode and i'm i'm happy to make these uh conversations available to the bankless paid subscribers as well so if you guys want to access that there is a link in the show notes so you can go and hear those debrief conversations we will jump into the interview with jeremy in just a minute but before we do we've got to tell you about the fantastic sponsors who made this bankless episode possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted it's really a fantastic tool that lets you use ethereum for what it does best which is holding and managing your financial assets but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on unit swap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips but with monolith so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop go to monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today bankless nation we are here with jeremy elaire he is a serial entrepreneur he's the co-founder of circle he is also almost the king of stable coins in a way he's definitely an advocate for the us crypto industry in washington dc jeremy it's fantastic to have you on the podcast how are you doing sir i'm great thanks ryan uh and david really awesome to be here with you guys you know okay so uh can we start with this question uh nomenclature wise is it stablecoin or crypto dollar what do you prefer you know it's really funny when we got started uh working on this uh we we we sort of called these fiat tokens but like that that obviously was like what they were uh and then sort of stable coin became what people started referring to these as and um you know you know i i think like now basically like people call this stuff stable coins in the broader sector like if it's in like policy or or or you know financial institutions you know big fintechs um in crypto obviously stablecoin is is pretty well known i like crypto dollar as well um but um but i think the you know what you know usdc is is both a stable coin and a crypto dollar but there are going to be stable coins that are not crypto dollars and so i think the category is is still stable coin ooh i like this okay so what is the distinction what is the difference between stable coin versus stable dollar well i mean you could have a euro stable coin or you could have a yen stable coin or a single per dollar stable coin and those are not crypto dollars because they're not dollars okay and then i also would not fit into the category of crypto dollar right because it's also dies not a dollar right i mean that that is a is a is sort of this kind of collateralized uh you know issued uh instrument um it's a little bit a little bit different i mean we're getting into semantics obviously but uh uh that they're you know on a spectrum there's you know different ways of of working with this stuff okay well let's let's start this by talking a little bit about um last year 2020 it was really like the year of crypto dollars it was the year of of stable coins we want to get into usdc and the role that it played i have kind of a question before we get into all of that to you which is um i'm not sure it's totally clear for our listeners or or for myself what is the relationship between uh circle and coin base with respect to usdc because sometimes you kind of hear about um circle and uscc other times you hear about kind of coinbase and usdc uh can you tell us about that relationship does does one of you own usdc versus the other do you both issue how does it work yeah so um so just a little bit of history here um we we've been at circle you know very interested in in models for how you can kind of represent uh fiat currency as digital currency um and we've experimented with different ways of approaching that over the years and then in 2017 we made a decision to kind of work on what we thought of as like a protocol layer for fiat tokens and uh and with with with us dollar uh tokens being the the starting point for that um but really importantly um when we thought about it we really believed and and obviously continue to believe that the the right long-term approach for something like this is to have a governed standard and um and to really build a governance model around it um and there's a lot of analogies to other things that are standards on the internet whether it's you know the world wide web consortium and and the standards around the web uh or or the ietf and standards around different protocols uh that exist on the internet but in in particular with like fiat protocols and and the kinds of things that you build around them you don't just want that to be from a company you really want it to be something that can be um you know multiple issuers multiple companies multiple geographies and actually have a governance process around it so we created something called center and coinbase joined us in the in the founding of center and um and basically from uh the fall of 2018 until you know today circle and coinbase both manage center consortium um and we can talk more about that in a little bit because it's growing independently of either circle or coinbase and there's a new i think incredibly strong ceo that is going to be building out that consortium uh in a very significant way with a lot of different types of firms getting involved we i think as circle and coinbase together saw an opportunity to build a standard and govern a standard um that could work uh as a high-quality kind of trusted you know dollar market infrastructure in the crypto economy um technically you know circle operates as what's called the minting issuer of usdc and coinbase operates as what is called an issuer of usdc um and um we have we kind of jointly govern the evolution of the smart contracts the open source project we all contribute source code to that and implementations to that we make decisions together about where that standard goes there's other policies like the governance of the reserve model the compliance and regulatory model all those things we do together so that's something that has been a really really close partnership between circle and coinbase over the years what would you say would be the advantage of the dividing up of responsibilities of of uh usdc and is that how you would kind of characterize what um it's not so much a dividing up of responsibilities meaning um there are a lot of pieces to this i think the the first is that um you know stable coins are are regulated as like a stored value electronic money um technology and payment uh technology in in the united states and that's increasingly how they're being regulated in other parts of the world and in that model there is sort of uh you know a a company that is doing the issuing um of that e-money if you will and has the fiduciary responsibility that has to manage the the the reserves uh and is ultimately on the hook uh as the licensed and regulated entity that is that is doing that now on top of that you can build all kinds of different arrangements around the technology standards around distribution and that's what center really established um but i think the best way to think about this and the way we think about this is you know essentially every kind of major innovation in electronic money um has been consortium of private sector actors that are working together on technical standards and interoperability uh and and they and then they build kind of governance models around it that's what swift is swift is a consortium of private sector actors they happen to be systemically important so major central banks also have a supervisory role uh if you look at what most people think of as the sort of most popular forms of electronic payments like card networks would probably be what you think of card networks are associations of members they're consortiums they define set of technical standards they define interoperability and that way you know not every bank is issuing their own proprietary system for processing cards they all can get interoperability with each other and in a sense they're it creates a fungible electronic money unit so stable coins have the same potential and i think will be far far larger in scale ultimately in terms of what what they what they handle uh compared to those um more more proprietary models but um that's a little bit of a way to think about it and so success over time looks like lots of crypto finance firms uh large consumer fintechs banks others that are part of a consortium that are involved in this and involved in governance and involved in the standards and that's when you know as that happens we think this gets into you know trillions of dollars of scale um that that are issued in these digital currencies you know it's funny people would not have believed trillions of dollars of scale was possible before a year like 2020. we'll talk about the numbers in a bit i i just want to make one comment what you're saying with consortiums uh quite famously visa was a consortium yeah right the largest payment network um in the world came out of the like 60s and 70s uh and that that was a consortium the same way you're talking absolutely we use this term uh jeremy called um credible neutrality a lot on bankless um the idea that more credibly neutral uh protocols or organizations or institutions are more scalable because for the simple reason that they are um unbiased they're neutral so if you as circle are competing uh against you know um like other exchanges like a coin base or a gemini right um like they're going to release their own coin to kind of compete with you right because it's sort of a winner take all market you're all competing but as a consortium you could scale much larger because no one has no single entity or company has the governance power to uh bias you know the coin in their favor or not so the circle model uh it it seems to me and the center model that consortium underneath you know usdc is far more scalable and um it does seem like we could grow to something as large and as fundamentally important as like the visa network here on top of something oh absolutely i i mean i think you know i i have this philosophy and this is sort of a an internet philosophy in some ways which is you know as we've uh as we've enabled sort of these um decentralized protocols and distributed systems that kind of connect people and machines everywhere um that you know whether it be for sharing of data sharing of content communications like all these kind of layers that have been built up over the past decades every time you do that and you enable global connectivity into standards like that the the actual volume of what happens ends up being orders of magnitude larger than in the prior uh more closed network systems and so like my view would be that like the the the you know gross scale of transactions uh in the world will just be radically larger because as costs approach zero which i think inevitably they do the the economic the the unit economic costs approach zero then the velocity can be even larger um and so you know sort of the net output of payment volume um in the world will will grow larger and larger um and then you know it comes back to you know people wanting to store value um in these digital currency units because they have greater utility value and so that leads to you know trillions of dollars in in market capitalization over time yeah it's totally true like what you're saying is open networks win right we've definitely seen that with ethereum being an open network and all these stable coins being deployed on top of it i hope we we address that in a moment i want to talk about uh growth for just a second here because stable coin supply uh is up from 6 billion in january 2020 to 34 billion now right usdc itself 500 million to five billion last year yeah um just insane actually yeah i mean it's it's it's been wild yeah i mean we're at we're we're just across just about to we've just crossed 5.4 billion i mean it's it's just were you surprised by this are you surprised by this really i mean at one level i'm surprised at another level i'm not because obviously as we built this and we thought about it we thought okay this is this this has this potential um i think everyone was caught by surprise in terms of how rapidly the pickup of this happened in in 2020 and it was really interesting i mean i remember obviously extremely vividly to basically early march uh of last year and um it's it's really interesting you can correlate the growth very heavily to the the the impact of the pandemic on the economy and um you know we saw issuance start to spike up as crypto markets came alive in asia in response to covid and then as the pandemic took hold globally uh just the the volume you know started to really really take off um so there was this interesting correlation but i think back in in early march we were actually just launching a whole new suite of of services built up around usdc and we didn't know you know what what the demand would look like uh for that we had a lot of ideas and and i remember sitting with my board of directors it was actually literally like days before the lockdown in the united states and and just saying like geez i don't know what's going to happen is the economy are like our do we need to like you know you know cut our company in half like what's going to happen here as a lot of people kind of thought about it and then you know literally it was it was just um just all of a sudden that just the growth just started kicking in we were like oh my god you know what's going on here um and so it really did take us by surprise um in the abstract it's it's sort of we've always felt some inevitability to this and so i've always thought yeah this can be really really big um but even you know throughout the year the way in which uh it sort of tended to compound no pun intended it it really uh it far exceeded certainly what we had planned one of my favorite tweets that came out of 2020 was brian armstrong's tweet a couple days after the 1200 stimulus check went out and he tweeted out just a graph of different deposit sizes going into coinbase and the 1200 deposit size was just through the charts would you say that usdc benefited from similar tailwinds as coinbase deposits into into their their uh their bank i mean um i think there's some correlation there i mean overall i would say i mean this is sort of the crypto markets as a whole right i i it's been it's been perceived to be a uh an asset class that has benefited from the enormous amount of uh of of inflation that's taking place in in real world dollars and so that goes into risk assets it goes into crypto it drives script to market growth drives demand in turn for stable coins um you know crypto market growth drives demand for d5 borrowing d5 landing drives demand for stable coins um and then dollarization as a theme uh crypto dollarization but dollarization more broadly is driving demand and that's a direct impact of economic conditions around the world currency devaluations things like that that are happening and so all of those seem to kind of feed each other a little bit uh as well would you say that that's the main reason why there has been such an influx of usdc into ethereum is it just serving those demands or is there other forces at play as well yeah i mean i i think the the overarching drivers are there's just continued significant growth in in individuals and institutions participating in digital asset markets that's one um the the second which is very much related is this incredible growth in d5 and d5 protocols which really heavily rely on on stable coins um both as collateral and as the as borrowed assets and and for liquidity and other things um and um and then what we've seen which has been really fascinating is this really really interesting growth in businesses not just crypto native companies but a lot of different types of organizations who are basically realizing wow this is a really powerful settlement medium uh this actually has a whole bunch of advantages compared to the banking system and so we're just seeing really really nice growth in in businesses that are adopting this for international global transactions we're seeing demand for this that's coming out of africa latin america southeast asia other other parts of the world which is really interesting and so i think one of the phenomenons and this relates to the actual kind of market cap growth as well which is um what's been really interesting about usdc and and i think also for tether as well is you know the the net number in circulation continues to grow now what what people don't know is with usdc is that it's redeemed on a massive scale as well um it's you know it works both ways right it's not like a roach motel um it works both ways and and so you know it that's that's incredibly important right this is this is valued as a dollar because it's always redeemable as a dollar and there's great retail infrastructure for that through coinbase there's great institutional infrastructure for that through circle and and so there's enormous there's billions of dollars of value that's redeemed as well but the net amount in circulation continues to grow because people it's sticky people once they start using it and holding it they realize well why would i want to get why would i want to put this back into the ach form of money or why would i want to put this back into the swift form of money i'd rather keep it in a blockchain native form because it's just more powerful that way and so we're seeing that stickiness and that's creating flywheel effects of people who are realizing that this can actually be used for a much broader range of payment use cases one of the the bankless theses is the the ethereum protocol is one of the great disintermediaries and specifically of the banking layer and specifically the commercial banking layer and you just said it but like so many people are seeing the advantages of using usdc on ethereum to settle payments and transactions between them what do you think how do you think these uh forces are going to impact the commercial banking industry like how will the commercial banking layer of the world pivot to answer to this new payment infrastructure with like for example usdc on ethereum yeah i mean there's there's so many dimensions to it i mean one of the really big pieces of news um was just a couple weeks ago right which was that the the occ uh which is the you know banking regulator for 75 percent of the of the of the national banks in the united states um you know issued a whole set of guidance around the use of stable coins in public chains as a payment infrastructure as a settlement infrastructure as an electronic stored value mechanism in the u.s financial system so that's a really big deal because it basically signals that you know banks and financial institutions can can rely on this in some ways the same way that they rely upon uh you know the ach network or or other other types of things so in in some ways i think there is this kind of convergence that happens which is uh this becomes a really powerful you know payment system um and and and banks and consumer fintechs and crypto firms and commerce firms and others will kind of connect to it and utilize it so i think that's extremely positive for ethereum obviously um uh and uh and and we can talk about you know other you know layer one layer two type issues as well but i think you know that becomes something that uh gets broadly adopted but i think over the long run and this gets to i think a core issue is we believe that you know as kind of third generation blockchains and i include ethereum two in that and there are certainly other interesting layer one projects out there but even just say successful layer twos on ethereum as as that infrastructure gets widely deployed the cost of payment transactions falls to zero and for traditional um you know uh commercial banks you know it depends on on the given institution but there's a big chunk of money they make from charging fees around storing money and transmitting money and then there's a big bunch of money that they make from loans and from risk-taking essentially and i think over the long run um you know the the ability to extract fees or or achieve profits from the payment settlement will just go to zero right it's sort of like no one charges for long distance telephone calls anymore uh you know or so many different types of services like we can have these free video calls with anyone anywhere in the world no one's making any money on that per se um so i think that that happens um there and so i think that that impacts any any business whose core business model is charging a fee to collect or make a payment um and you got to kind of pick your time frame there but it's inevitable um uh and so i think that has a big impact i think the more interesting and i think obviously a huge set of topics that you guys explore all the time is um you know what does the disintermediation of other kind of financial contracts other types of financial market activities that becomes protocol governed and protocol facilitated what does that do uh to those business models and that's a fascinating area obviously uh and and one which we're we're quite excited and bullish about uh ourselves which i think we're in the very early stages of that um you know we talk about total value you know locked we talk about the growth there but when we look at the the total amount of capital that gets deployed into borrowing and lending or you know that you know is issued against collateral and other things in the world it's in the trillions of dollars right it's it's in it's enormous and so there's a tremendous opportunity to transform uh to transform that they're obviously you know um i had a conversation uh with robert lesner last week and the topic i i kind of laddered off of um brian brooks editorial in the ft about self-driving banks and what that looks like and so we were just playing off of that concept and you know right now a lot of the protocols that are there that interact with stable coins i mean it's fully collateralized uh you know borrowing and lending um the critical thing about commercial banks is that they they take risks they basically say we believe that there'll be future cash flows from from you as an entity whether an individual or business and we're actually going to create they create money they create new money they create new money by creating new deposits and it's an extension of credit and it's a it's built on the premise that there will be future cash flows it's impossible to do that uh right now uh with crypto by definition you can't create money um and so i think it's an interesting interplay which is is do we move into a world of full reserve banking uh and and we live within the limits of of kind of fully issued assets whether it be a bitcoin or a usdc or what have you uh and and and then ultimately what is how does that interact with that traditional banking business model of money creation and credit yeah it's very interesting uh d5 has not built out its credit primitive yet that is something that is is certainly yes yet to come yeah i i was thinking about this so bankless of course is believes in the thesis that this technology crypto will completely disrupt the banking system and i think a lot of people like so bankless is a group of of users right we actually we don't just um talk about crypto we actually use crypto and i want to underscore this this point for for for someone who's maybe a little bit new there are like three types of digital dollars that you can have right now uh or there are three three types of dollars you can have one is like physical dollars in your wallet right that has obvious limitations not very poor it's like not in the digital at all it's not internet um then you have like dollars in your bank account like these wells fargo dollars sure um and and they suck too because anytime you want to actually do something with your money there's a limit on taking how much out or there's ach transfer i was yeah i have to show up at a bank with my id physically to wire some funds that's with my local bank like how crazy is that and then you have this third category of dollars uh which are crypto dollars or stable coins usdc right is is one of those and what i found personally jeremy on my kind of crypto bankless journey is that like stable coins like usdc are so much more valuable than the wells fargo dollars yeah right so like you were mentioning that uh usdc is sticky oh my god yes like i want all of my my us dollars out of wells fargo and into at least something like a coin base where it's in usdc why because usdc is like dollars with superpowers yeah right like always plus software it's dollars plus software and and it it has exposure to crypto rails so i can generate more yield on it i can send money to david in like two minutes right any amount that i want i don't have to i don't have to show up at a bank in person like that's what this is that's what this is providing people it's dollars with superpowers yeah we actually i actually have have used that phrase talking about it uh in in the past um yeah yeah you're sort of super powered turbocharged uh uh kind of kind of dollars yeah i mean i i think one of the one of the really interesting um other differences that i think is more subtle is you know because usdc it's a full reserve uh you know digital currency unit it's fully reserved against underlying dollars um you know it it it has some different attributes um i think you know a a commercial bank money as if you think about it in the in the classic sense um you know your your dollar at wells fargo if that happens to be the bank or whatever that you're using that dollar is is a claim on their balance sheet um it's an iou it literally is right and so you know that they they might you know have uh you know uh they might have let's just say 10 you know 10 billion dollars of of actual you know kind of deposits of base level m1 money um and but they're their their obligations uh you know that are outstanding might actually be 100 billion um so you know the the the assets to to kind of um uh deposits ratio can be like eight to one um and and there are standards for that that basel bank of international settlements and and the the basel standard set for banks um and so it's they're they're a little bit different in that sense and and that's that's the classic you know fractional reserve money uh uh you know um kind of kind of concept and issue and that's obviously subtle for people to understand um but uh yeah i mean just the utility value alone obviously is is significant one of my favorite mental models about this industry is is that the cryptocurrency industry is like speed running through the history of money and finance right like bitcoin is our digital gold uh ethereum is turning into our banking layer and you know one of one of these uh landmarks one of these stops along the speed running of monetary history is um fully reserve banks and then in the future after that is fractional reserve banks which kind of implies if you want to calculate that out that fractional reserve uh crypto dollars perhaps might be coming to ethereum one day um why not usdc and maybe you can talk about just like where you see the evolution of crypto dollars um going uh into the future well i mean the the critical thing is that if you move to a fractional reserve model um for digital currency then it is it is you're talking about you know banks i mean that's that is what a bank does that is the business model of a bank uh is to take deposits and then issue credit against deposits um in the form of deposits that they create either in their own institution or at other financial institutions um it's a money creation uh kind of kind of role um and you know i i've actually i've done some interviews myself on this topic and i i think one of the things if you think about crypto philosophically sound money principles uh sound money principles uh are you know in bitcoin is is certainly an expression of this and it's grounded in austrian economic philosophy uh austrian economic philosophy also extended to really the chicago school of economics in the in the 1930s and and and later but basically the idea is a fixed supply um you know money uh that has a fixed supply um is is better money uh that than money that can be kind of created uh by fiat and that is a really important principle when you move from full reserve to fractional reserve you are basically embracing the money creation that humans create money and i think one of the really important foundational components to bitcoin and ethereum ethereum as a as ether as commodity money um has this has that same sound money principle as well it has a predictable supply it has a predictable inflation rate it's algorithm algorithmically determined um but it is fundamentally more or less a kind of fix of by model that gives rational economic actors a basis to make uh decisions and it forces people to make decisions in the context of those capacity constraints um i mean the basic premise of the chicago school back in the 1930s there's there's um the chicago plan is is a famous set of work um from many of the most prominent economists at the time in in response to the great depression which was this collapse of fractional reserve banks you had a run on the bank and guess what they didn't have the money because they had lent it out and they didn't you know everyone came to get their deposits at once and it was just running the bank and there was a really significant argument made that we should move to full reserve banking that banks should be there there should be essentially you know essentially deposit-taking banks that also facilitate payments and then you know lending activity is only based on that fixed supply money you can't create new money you only have that fixed supply money and crypto i think inherently supports that philosophy uh and i think that's i think that's important and you know we people can argue about it i think most modern economists would say oh that's hogwash like credit creation is really fundamental um and obviously what's happening with central banking right now is is an enormous amount of money creation um and and you know that that is obviously has its own challenges um but i think the the the belief of of the authors of the chicago plan was that if you had full reserve banking that you would actually smooth out the boom and bust cycles you would actually have net increases in economic output and it would force economic actors whether it be a corporation or government to work within fiscal constraints uh as well and that that's ultimately advantageous to the to to economic activity in society so i think um a move of you know attempting to reintroduce money creation literally out of thin air money creation into crypto would be very inconsistent with many of the underlying philosophical tenets of crypto itself ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit

not the vision right like the vision is a non-sovereign store of value and non-sovereign money but what i think is it's a little bit like um subtle here is that this is exactly how we bootstrap non-sovereign monies yeah so what people don't understand is that um just as usdc is sticky it's also a gateway to the rest of crypto it's also a gateway to bitcoin and ethereum and d5 right so it's like a nice smooth on-ramp and the interesting thing you talked about ether being sort of a commodity money right well every every time uh there is a settlement transaction of usdc on ethereum right it requires ether and eventually with other things in ethereum like eip1559 a portion of that ether gets burned so what are we doing we're using the banking system to bootstrap our own store of value asset this is all very synergistic in my mind yeah no i i completely buy that i mean i i think um i made a very strong believer in non-sovereign store of value commodity money um i'm quite long on it myself and uh and and have been for a long time and um and and i think there is very the you know fiat stable coins uh such as usdc are very synergistic with that over the long run you know i i take a very long term view on some of this i think 10 20 30 years out what might this look like and i do think over a longer period of time um will will move towards um essentially synthetic digital currencies that are you know they're synthetic they're composited out of multiple uh reserve currency stable coins and uh allocations of commodity digital money like ether and bitcoin as well and effectively it's almost like it's not necessarily a peg but there's a a basket if you will and there's a balancing that will continue to go on and eventually we'll you know for everyday transactions in in the economy most people in the world will rely on that global synthetic unit but increasingly uh uh the the amount of that global synthetic unit that is based on non-sovereign money will increase over time um and maybe over the very long run become predominantly that so jeremy uh another question here i'm curious about is uh do you think fintech is going to join the party this cycle so it it seems to me that like that they they're sort of the flashy user interface layer on top of the ugly like fax machine that is the existing ach banking layer right um but it's always struck me that like do they really need the banks i wonder right like what if they just swapped out that dusty old infrastructure for this new crypto rails infrastructure we're building are they going to get this at some point are they going to join the party absolutely absolutely um i i think i mean we're already seeing you know really interesting indicators of that and i think that will accelerate a lot over the next couple years um i think um you know it it um you know it'll be fintech so it'll be other types of financial institutions um as well um i i think very much so uh we'll move towards that i mean you know there is sort of like this kind of convergence at some level where you know um you know really broadly adopted mainstream stable coins um you know might have a supervisory relationship with banking regulators um but are they it's not this it's not are they the same as what you think of as traditional banks or these um you know crypto and self-driving banks jeremy it the last quarter of 2020 i think was perhaps the most regulatory active in crypto that we've ever seen and we saw some really awesome tailwind news like what we talked about with out of the the occ but then we also saw some very bearish you know very uh uh conflicting news that's that's less than ideal for this industry specifically with what we saw coming out of uh secretary uh the treasury uh minutian which actually just got struck down today i believe or if not yesterday but then also with the stable act uh so there's definitely some tug of wars going on between the positive and the negative regulatory news uh and my opinion is this is just the beginning and then 2021 is going to be just a more regulatory fight maybe you could give your opinions to our to us and the listeners about what you see coming in the regulatory horizon for crypto dollars and for public blockchains yeah i mean it's a fascinating time for that i think um you know the more that this lurches into the mainstream the more that um you know uh policymakers are gonna are gonna have opinions about not just opinions that are gonna legislate or they're gonna come up with rules um and that is it's a double-edged sword because on the on the one hand it really means you're you're achieving like super scale like this is going to be something that everyone in the world is going to use and that's really exciting like wow the idea that our transactions are going to get mediated on public chains and and and enable that um is really exciting um it's a double-edged sword also because you know you know policy can can be a blunt instrument uh rules can be ill thought uh or or can have specific political motivations that are based on lobbying my established industries and so on and so it's complicated it's it's not it's not straightforward ultimately my philosophy has always been work with work with policy makers because you know in in the march towards global scale adoption like you know the notion that you're just going to route around governments i think is is is not not realistic um what has to happen though and this is something i've said a lot is at the end of the day regulators you know are there um because there are real risks and and and they're there to kind of create guardrails and the guard rails are designed to make sure that people are not defrauded to protect individual uh individuals um and uh into you know effectively limit illicit activity limit crime um or to to ensure that the financial system is not uh you know abused uh you know by crime now we know obviously that there are tons and tons and tons of of financial products and services that have not been good for consumers um that have been utilized very very broadly by by criminals um and that's a that's like a tug of war that goes on and um and there's i think really good people in government that are focused on these things and so i think you know the critical thing is industry has to engage on this now the other perspective that i have is that it's really actually incumbent on on on creators and on entrepreneurs and on technologists to solve the problems that are the risks that policymakers care about and solve them in a better way than regulations ever could solve them themselves and so to me something like you know um you know the the the record-keeping requirements uh on identity associated with public chain infrastructure um there's an underlying set of risk there which is wow uh if people are are self-managing their their their crypto they could be criminals um or they could be abusing this in in these other ways well we clearly want to be able to have decentralized financial market infrastructure we clearly want to be able to have individuals and businesses be able to connect to that and participate in that um are there other ways to think about solving those problems and and it's it's here that i think for example you know blockchains are actual blockchains and crypto provide a lot of the answers themselves one of the things that i'm most excited about is self-sovereign identity i'm very very excited about self-sovereign identity i'm very excited about identity protocols that can be built on chain uh that are built on you know crypto on zero knowledge proofs on verifiable claims and identity attestations and all these kinds of things that are these really important primitives that crypto makes possible and blockchains make possible that can actually lead to an individual being able to say yeah i'm actually who i say i am i actually am someone who's whose identity's been verified by an identity issuer and i can actually take that with me and control who i give that information to and get and have the rights to do that and actually ultimately have like d5 protocols that know okay if you want to participate in this transaction you need to prove that you're a person uh or or what have you and these are the this is the kind of infrastructure that i think needs to get built no regulator's ever gonna say here's what you need to do um they're gonna say how are you gonna deal with these risks so i i think i i tend to sort of put it back on industry um and say okay well how do we solve these problems that's a really good take right so um i think the challenge though sometimes jeremy is that um the good regulators might say okay here's here's what we need how are you going to solve them but um sometimes not all of the the regulators take that open-minded like there's a solution here to solve it so oftentimes what they'll do is they'll just come up with these heavy-handed kind of regulations like you know like famously the staple uh you know the stable act is basically like oh you can't have any stable coin denominating us dollars the remember that's not regulators that's that was a an academic uh who got the ears of some uh we had we had rowan gray on and we talked very much about that um i i don't view that's not regulators but even like the even the proposed rule coming out of kind of minutiae that was somewhat problematic and it didn't offer the opportunity for industry to solve it what's your confidence that the new administration this new set of regulators um under biden uh might how will they work with crypto in a different way are you optimistic are you pessimistic on this well i mean look um you know the new head of the sec is someone who's intimately familiar with crypto um he's someone who i know reasonably well i've kind of helped co-teach his crypto blockchain course at mit and i i think he's a pragmatic person who understands the issues the innovation but he's also a regulator he's someone who is going to be focused on like we this is not just some unencumbered thing that's just going to go you know flying around so by the way this is this is gary gensler yeah okay yeah um and and michael barr who is uh apparently gonna be the new head of the occ is someone who also has been um involved in crypto and blockchain um in his career um and that's helpful so i think people who have some awareness and education that that are in these critical positions that's really important there will be a new head of the federal reserve that will be appointed at some point in the next you know year or two um that'll be a really interesting question as to who who that is and and how what their disposition is around this i mean look when i step back and i look at you know the biden administration i mean you can look at individual regulators i don't think this is all about just individual regulators i think this is about what is the united states government's posture going to be to this critical strategic technology and infrastructure area and i think there's a tremendous opportunity for the us government to actually realize that this is a major major area of infrastructure that is going to be fundamental to the future of economic systems to commerce to many other things and we'll we'll figure out ways to support that industry at the same time i think there is going to be much more precise engagement around certain things like criminal abuse risk um consumer protections and this is where i i i think you know i'm very hopeful that there's like meaningful engagement um and and meaningful dialogue and ultimately um a kind of collaboration with industry um to to ensure that you know if there if there are regulations that get introduced they're cognizant of the fundamental differences in how this technology works and the innovation that it spawns um for example i mean d5 is just a totally profound example that this is just doesn't fit the the model of how you think about financial market infrastructure this is software that is that that runs on the internet that is you know just machines that run this financial market infrastructure that's a really really different thing but it's here and it's got incredible power and it's a really significant innovation that opens up a lot of opportunities so okay well how do we think about that um so i cautiously optimistic is ultimately what i'd say jeremy i'm wondering to get your opinion on the interaction between what me and ryan are following which is kind of the rise of mmt and crypto dollars and and using ethereum to host and facilitate payments with crypto dollars we've we've seen uh janet yellen who is uh joe biden's uh nomination to be the the cabinet uh secretary uh the treasury yeah and she she's made two statements uh recently one saying that you know they that she's interested in making very big moves when it comes to corona virus relief which kind of is an extension of mmt using the ability to mint coins help facilitate relief and then also she's made uh you know some of the the common criticisms of bitcoin we would call this flood that bitcoin is used to serve terrorist financing which to my mind kind of is like why is janet yelling yeah uh yelling excuse me why is janet yeah uh yelling talking about bitcoins facilitating terrorist financing we know that's not true that's pretty baseless to me the incentive is is that she's trying to protect the brand of the us dollar to help facilitate mmt and we saw some of this energy coming out of rohan grey and the stable act this was that was very much a mmt inspired initiative do you have any thoughts about the perhaps the collision course between public payment rails and mmt yeah i mean i think um there is there is a major a major you know challenge here which is i think in particular i i i would say i'm less focused on stable coins in relation to that and more on non-sovereign you know non-sovereign store value commodity money like ether and bitcoin and and many others that sort of fit that category but use those as a reference here um i mean the rise of that um on a global basis i mean it is absolutely a direct threat to monetary sovereignty in the current modern form um and um you know there is uh there are a couple ways it can go right it can go the path of okay it actually becomes so big and important that you know it continues to be regulated as property which is how it's regulated today but it actually becomes a balance sheet instrument of governments themselves and not only is it a balance sheet instrument in terms of you know holding it in reserves but actually governments make it a national priority to participate in mining and participate in network validation and say this is sort of systemically important infrastructure and we actually want to be active market participants in it and that's actually necessary strategically competitively and from a national security perspective i think that's where it goes um i think that's i think that's ultimately where it goes when at the end of the day people really think about it um that that will be um that would be the path um but there could be you know in different parts of the world there there could be very rapid harsh unpredictable interventions um that could be very negative for uh for that that form of digital digital assets um i mean obviously in the history of money during the great depression uh the federal government made holding gold illegal and seized all gold from everyone um you know because it threatened monetary sovereignty and and it affected how fiscal stimulus worked in a massive economic contraction i mean could that happen could something like that happen uh conceptually it did then um so i mean there are these are tail risks right but um but i uh i i think um ultimately you know i don't know i don't know janet yellen um but i hope to have a chance to spend time with her and i think you know there's a lot of educating to do because i think the simplistic oh this is used for this or this is used for that those tend to be very simplistic understandings and so when you actually get down to the staff level you get down to the actual you know people who work in these agencies and in the regulatory community they have a much more sophisticated view on this like fincen which is actually the financial crimes enforcement network that is in charge of how to deal with terrorist financing how to deal with uh financial crimes and the abuse of the financial system they're incredibly savvy about this uh and they're very very great to work with i mean you know they really are i think they're they're an agency that is part of janet yellen's remit now it's part of the treasury department but i think when you when you get in and you get working with with the actual kind of career civil servants and and and the established entities they have a much much stronger understanding last thing on this jeremy and then we'll get to d5 but just to tie off kind of regulatory and government so you're talking about how maybe in the in the more distant future um with mmt these non-sovereign store values may be threatening to something like the dollar um but in the the short to medium term uh let's face it the dollar is the world's reserve currency and it's quite strong we even see it saw its strength as you're saying earlier during coronavirus there's this uh you know some people have called it the dollar milkshake theory this like sucking of of capital into dollars itself um can you talk a little bit about the wins for the u.s government in in crypto right so the u.s from uh from a adversarial perspective you've got china developing its own central bank digital currency making pretty good progress from all we can tell what is the us's answer to this and could it be something like usdc on ethereum yeah so i have a i have a pretty strong view on this and that is that um historically in the west the major advancements in the financial system have come from the private sector and it's typically been consortiums of private sector actors working together to define standards and infrastructure that then is is built out and utilized at a large scale it's technology innovators it's financial sector innovators and it's standards and that's sort of been what has worked and i have no reason to believe it'll be any different in the digital currency world in the west i do not believe that a giant r d project out of the federal reserve with a contract with iom or however you'd want to think about it is going to be remotely successful in competing with the open internet internet entrepreneurs public open source infrastructure and private sector actors building on top of that like the innovation is just night and day it's just going to be far far uh more competitive you know on the open internet and private sector side of things i think that the government will realize that and they'll say actually that's how we're going to compete we're going to compete like we've always competed by having open networks by having you know sound supervision of way private sector actors that are innovating in this space and we're gonna let that drive innovation um and i think that i just think that's likely and i think ultimately what that translates to is i think the us government and many other governments are going to get very much behind adoption of public blockchains as fundamental strategic infrastructure not just for economic activity for a wide range of other types of record-keeping activity transactional activity and the like um so i it's extremely i'm extremely bullish about public chains um i think ethereum obviously i think very very highly of ethereum um and uh and i think that that's that's where we'll get to um is is a model like that and um you know i i think something like usdc could evolve to have a lot of other major market participants involved in it could evolve to a place where it has uh you know there there is some kind of of relationship with with central banks as well um but um that's that's still a ways off do you think these regulatory headwinds that we have seen in the recent in the recent times actually turn into regulatory tailwinds once regulators realize that the key to competing with the chinese digital yuan or the the fact that russia is now purchasing uh petrol in euros uh instead of instead of doubling down on a central bank digital currency out of the fed is actually just much more aligned with the interests of regulators to just promote public use cases public blockchains usage of us yes absolutely makes sense to me yeah yeah so jeremy let's let's uh let's conclude with um talking about d5 for a moment so we we've been talking very much about kind of um disruption to to banks in the banking system um how big of a deal is defy i think you you talked about brian brooks from the occ he penned penned this uh fantastic piece uh like equating it to self-driving cars um which i think probably is an analogy that works for for a lot of for a lot of folks but um is defy overrated is it underrated how big of a deal is it in in the future of crypto and the future of finance for the world yeah i think it's totally underrated right now um and i think like i said i think we're in the opening innings of this and just you know financial market infrastructure you know is fundamentally about providing certainty providing mechanisms of risk management uh and and dealing with you know uh you know clearing and settling things but also dealing with counterparty and counterparty risk and so much of of of what the financial market infrastructure does you know deals with that for the first time ever you can actually create systems of that that do not have humans intermediate intermediating it that is totally public and transparent to all market participants that is extremely efficient that is open and global anyone can connect to it that has you know ultimately radically lower kind of unit economic costs to market participants in it like that is just so profound and i think you can take almost every you know dimension of finance and you can imagine ways for that to happen you know in these on-chain protocols now there are going to be you know you know oracles uh i think uh identity identity attestations so entity attestations things like this those become really really critical because the the real world and the defy world do need to interact but as those primitives come into place this i think this can get you know enormously larger and can disrupt more and more dimensions of of what um you know is currently run by banks currently run by other financial market infrastructure providers as well you know uh so there's there's a tremendous amount that can happen there and i think it's underrated right now there's a a common thought that you know the cryptocurrency industry and d5 especially uh exists because it lives on the margins of what is perhaps legally or legally acceptable or compliant right hazu i know famous uh cryptocurrency thinker uh is it iterates that he thinks that the one of the main use cases for cryptocurrency is skirting regulation and yet and usdc is flowing permissionlessly through d5 which you know some protocols are total probably totally compliantly fine other d5 protocols are probably more legally dubious how do you think about this tension between usdc flowing through perhaps legally dubious d5 protocols yeah i mean i think that um this is a place where you know we talked about kind of what regulators care about and where they're focused and you know that some of this has to do with um you know abuse uh you know by potentially criminal actors things like that this is you know this is going to be the the vexing critical issue that faces dpi um which is um you know how can uh defy um essentially interact with real world identities and how can real world identities interact with public protocols in a privacy preserving way in a way that um you know is is puts greater control into users hands so to me that's how we answer these questions it's not a usdc thing it's it's actually kind of these identity meta systems how are they built for the internet you know when we were getting started with circle uh and i was you know really excited about blockchains as an innovation you know the the view from my perspective is wow like this is the technology that solves two of the fundamental issues two missing layers of the internet one was money the other was identity and um i think you know the the identity piece is going to come later in fact it needs to come in response to the development of decentralized finance and uh and money on the internet and so i think that will be one of the next major phases that gets developed and that's how we'll that's how we'll face those issues um at a high level jeremy it's been a pleasure to get your thoughts on all of these things one last question for you a prediction question how big do you think stable coins are going to get this market cycle in particular in usdc and where are you guys going to flip and tether [Laughter] [Music] yeah it's a good question i mean um uh so if you say this market cycle um uh what do you what do you have in mind we have in mind that we are in a bear uh excuse me a bull market a beautiful head bull market uh and so we're thinking you know that could last the next year the next two years sort of and all assets will grow along with the the bull market so that kind of time horizon one to three years yeah i mean it's interesting i mean um i i think usdc over uh over say two years um you know could could could easily uh well i think it it easily exceeds like 50 billion um i think um you know there are scenarios where in particular if more mainstream financial applications integrate to this and start to utilize it in different ways it could exceed you know 100 billion um but um uh you know it's it's it's hard to know i would have given you a different number six months ago so jeremy do you think uh tethers here to stay i i do actually um i mean i i think um a you know there's the classic kind of uh uh kind of offshore dollar market kind of euro dollar market type type role uh there's significant demand in asia for shadow banking for dollar shadow banking those markets exist they're large they will continue to exist they'll grow uh and so i expect tether to play a critical role in that um and um and so i would i would expect it to absolutely to to have staying power and continue to grow absolutely well jeremy it's been a pleasure to have you on bank list thanks so much for joining us thank you guys really enjoyed it bankless nation some action items for you today one is something that you can do which is if you haven't already try out usdc it is fantastic i think you will find yourself wanting to move more and more of your funds out of the traditional banking
