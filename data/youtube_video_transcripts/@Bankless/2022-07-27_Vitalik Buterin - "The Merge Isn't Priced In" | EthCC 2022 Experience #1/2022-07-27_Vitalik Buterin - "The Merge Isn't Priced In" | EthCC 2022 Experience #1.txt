welcome bankless nation to the eth cc experience i just got back from ecc and i've got over three hours of content with me that i recorded with all stars from around the crypto ecosystem and we're bringing them to you all at once right here right now each episode is about 20 to 30 minutes long and because they were all done in person they are particularly exceptional and fun each one of these conversations is candid and also for some reason during in real life interviews i just asked questions that i wouldn't have otherwise asked so for example um y'all remember when like kane warwick and suzu were fighting over reasonably sized houses on crypto twitter well we talked about that with kane uh there's also been controversy with the starkware team about whether or not they'd ever do their own layer one or migrate off of ethereum well i asked that to uri and ellie of the starkware team i also asked vitalik about developer morale his vision for the ethereum roadmap and why he's got the best drip in crypto each one of these episodes is being released separately for optimal content candy to you the listener we usually do our pre-recorded ads for these but instead i'm going to do them right here right now so here it goes and we're going to start with rocket pool rocket pool is ethereum's decentralized validator network where you deposit eth and you get r-eth in return and you can take that re into it defy and if you run a node you let other people deposit their eth into your node and you get to charge them 15 for staking rewards as payment for your node operating services and then you can take that reef and use the across bridge to join over 2.3 billion dollars in the arbitrary ecosystem across of course is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge and one of the safest ways to bridge your hard-earned assets in the world of crypto and of course arbitrary is where you want to be with over 35 000 contracts and 1 million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of rollups you know how i know these numbers because i watched the arbitrage talk at ecc which you should also go watch but not before you're done watching this but when you do watch that video make sure it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web 3 wallet and it puts the user first the web3 way you know what else puts the user first ledger hardware wallets and the ledger live ecosystem i know ledger is a great product because i have literally nine of them and i have 99 of my crypto assets on my ledger wallets and the ledger live ecosystem is all you really need when it comes to living a bankless life such as buying with fiat swapping and staking but for the rest of you that are sitting on stable coins because the market is scary right now make sure you're using a decentralized bankless stablecoin may i suggest dive from maker down the most tried and tested stablecoin in existence but with maker you don't have to hide your stables on the ethereum layer one maker is building die portals so you can mint die natively across all the layer twos so you can make sure that your assets don't go down another ninety percent but you still get to go do all the d5 things across the l2 verse and i hope you use all of these sponsors on your request for going bank list and now i bring you my in-person conversation with vitalik buterin what's up vitalik how's it going ceiling how are you ceiling took me a second um okay vitalik last year at ecc you gave a talk which was about uh the non-financial use cases of a blockchain uh and then like the industry sat on that for about six months and then all of a sudden uh lens protocol the decentralized social media protocol uh came about and then after that we had this like fervor and soul bound tokens and it really like kicked off a new shift of focus in the crypto space uh and you're about to go have your talk here at ecc in about like 30 minutes or so are you gonna what's the new meta gonna be after this talk well you know this time i'm actually gonna talk about other stuff like basically yeah kind of a longer longer-term future of the ethereum protocol and uh my hopes that we yeah you know do the upgrades that we have to do but also don't normalize or just constantly adding more and more features because that'll like make the protocol super complicated after like 20 years um so yeah just kind of thinking about you know what is the vision for the medium term what's the vision for the long term how like how can we make sure that we sort of shift gears into that into like actually valuing decentralization more and like uh you know not just at a slogan but like that's something that gets a lot of development effort certainly and uh coming out of the mania that was 2021 back into a more depressed time in the crypto space depressed usually it's kind of a you know assumed a bad word but there's a lot of people who were here before 2021 they were like oh thank gosh uh thank god we're like we're finally like quiet how do you feel in the in the middle of 2022 with the state of just like the attention of crypto yeah i mean i'm definitely relieved that um you know things are quieting down a bit um i mean i think i mean it is important to remember that um you know the these uh bubbles and boom periods like they have costs like on the one hand they attract lots of people uh which is good and they get people excited but on the other hand you know they sometimes give lots of people like way too much of an impression of what the space is uh promising and that leads to people getting disappointed sometimes they get attention from unsavory characters they get attention from um you know governments that decide that because it exists it's their business um and uh i mean he gets tension from a lot from a lot of places and uh there's a benefit to kind of quietness and there's a benefit to i think the crypto space kind of being its own little land for a while and uh only yeah really breaking out once it's actually yeah kind of fully ready too and uh i mean i think uh you know this and this the scalability stuff definitely didn't come fast enough uh for this cycle but i think um you know for when the next one will uh comes like you know it all will be right like uh we've already been seeing lots of improvements in roll-ups uh we've been you know proto-dink sharding is uh advancing um you know volidiums are advancing the zk roll-ups and zkvm stuff is um advancing um a lot of the stuff that i was like yelling about uh for the last a few years people seem to kind of finally slowly be taking seriously and so like one example of this would be yeah i remember i remember just yelling at like i think both optimism and arbitrary people for a while basically telling them hey guys like you need to care about compression you need to care about bls signature aggregation because like those are the two things that you need to do to actually bring down the data cost of a roll-up transaction from like 100 to 200 bytes down to 16 bytes and um you know that stuff's actually happening right like uh optimism within a couple months ago added uh like basic zero by compression which knocked their fees down by like somewhere between 20 and 40 percent um i think i'm not sure what arbitrary status is but i think they either like have some kind of compression or they're close to it and and then erc 4337 the account abstraction eip right i mean you know that that stuff because i've like yelled about the need for social recovery while it's on bankwest so many times as well but you know there's like actually a really great and kind of exciting community around that now and it's even kind of branching out further so one of the things that's been happening in the rc4337 land over the last month or so is uh they're static starting to add uh like built-in signature aggregation and so like smart contract wallets would be able to like basically specify and say like hey this wallet uses i mean like bls signatures or uses like snark aggregation or some signature aggregation and um you know miners or nodes that are kind of gathering those transactions they wouldn't just be packing transactions they would actually be taking the signatures aggregating them and like it would all um you know actually add up and the aeration would work and that's uh really nice because uh then you get like you know you get all the see the space savings like you know we're talking about like the 60 bytes and 65 bytes of a transaction like going down to one byte um and then once you add some more compression then it goes down even more and like basically you know we're talking about roll-ups getting potentially another five times cheaper um well with just the gear c437 stuff like you know it'll be another three times cheaper but with that and more compression it'll be like somewhere between five and ten times cheaper and that's uh that just like really amazing right like there's that happening and then there's prototype shorting happening and then there's full tank shorting happening and then there's volitiums happening and then there's uh just ongoing improvements to ethereum software and uh but you're finally getting to the point where the system actually will be able to um you know handle the just incredibly massive amount of usage that like an actual i mean no quote mainstream adoption cycle is going to demand so say what you will about the state of the crypto markets a lot of every first cycler comes in and they're probably focused on the pain of prices but as soon as you stick around for more than a single cycle you start to get a little bit deeper and you focus on well how how fast are we building more than like how fast are the markets moving and i i'm wondering since you've been here since the very beginning uh the iteration of ethereum building seems to in my opinion i've only been here for one cycle only gets faster and faster and faster and now it seems to be there's so much ethereum development that's happening in parallel beyond what i can even like comprehend and keep up with uh and so i'm wondering what's your what's your take on the rate of development of not just like the app layer but actually like straight up the ethereum protocol like are we getting faster at this i think it's like both faster and slower like i didn't i do think that our results have been pretty mixed so far right because uh if you compare the process of getting the beacon chain out the door to the process of getting eth 1.0 out the door like the ethe 1.0 took 20 months right from like myself writing the first version of the white paper to a launch uh but here like we're looking at a merge that will take like maybe about 22 months or 21 months after the original launch of the beacon chain and of course the original launch of the beacon chain itself happened after a development process shorting's still taking a while um you know things like account abstraction or taking a while efp but on the other hand like eap 1559 that's something that was like a huge economic reform and it's one that's had like actually pretty very significant consequences right that's been great for fee stability it's been great for fast inclusion it's been great for lots of things um but you know that took like three years to get through but you know now it's finally there right so i think there's kind of these two opposing pressures that we as a community have to deal with where one is kind of this uh pressure that speeds things up because there's more awesome researchers there's more awesome developers there's like a lot more effort going into all these problems uh but then there's also the pressure slowing us down which is like the uh desire to um you know not break things uh the desire to kind of implement stuff across multiple clients to make sure we have all of these uh test suites uh and also the desire to kind of simultaneously build all of the surrounding infrastructure right like when ethereum launched and did not have like this massive ecosystem of block explorers and like side infrastructure that the beacon chain has already so i think like both of those pressures exist and like to some extent that's um healthy and like to some extent this uh actually gets into stuff that i'm going to talk about in this presentation which is that i think it's like healthy for ethereum to have a bit of a move fast and break things attitude like specifically over the next couple of years because like you know we do need to radically change stuff right like switching the consensus algorithm moving over to sharding uh moving over to like a very different model for how transactions get included but at the same time there's kind of this longer term desire where you know we do want l1 to kind of settle down into something that's like very stable independent and it's uh like it's it's not something that kind of wins by out maneuvering the alternatives it's something that wins by lasting the alternatives certainly yeah and so it's i guess we're both uh you know doing all of the good work that needs to be done to kind of get the role of these kind of big stages at the beginning and uh at the same time like there's also this question of like you know how do we properly set ourselves up for in this longer term future where the layer one starts to become this a bit of a more static thing um and you know the improvements are more incremental or more kind of you know technical and safety oriented uh and once that happens then um you know ethereum will just get slower and that's fine right but then you know layer two work is only gonna get faster i think like we've seen already there's like five zk vms now you know there's so many uh zk evms that um we yeah they're starting to care like almost uh as much about debating which one of them is a real zka vm as they do about actually building the products which is uh in some ways actually a great place for an ecosystem to be um yeah i know so you know i think you know you know things are going well um and um i think uh you know and if the recognition that stuff like the merge does actually actually need to happen on a timetable like i think that's also something that's picking up the recognition that um you know things like scaling are something that needs to kind of happen on a timetable right and um you know as i think i've sometimes like like said before like you know you can lose a billion dollars from a hack but you can also lose a billion dollars from everybody just needing to pay way higher fees than they have to and one is uh less what one is more flashy and uh glamorous but um you know the other is uh also actually yeah a really a really serious kind of drain and attacks on the ecosystem um yeah i know so but but i think you know people are working on that and uh it's uh you know there's constant good news every couple of months and um you know i'm confident that we're actually getting to into an ethereum that's pretty great that is something i've certainly noticed lately i think it started before devconnect but it really felt very very vibrant at devconnect in amsterdam just morale around ethereum development and around the ethereum developer seems to be really high um and like i i'm only seeing this from you know a periphery standpoint because like i just like talk about these things and hear what the developers are saying but for somebody who's a little bit more tapped in like how would you how would you illustrate the morale around the developers at the moment right i mean it's sometimes hard to tell because you have to like distinguish between sort of like forced time morale where everyone kind of realizes that you know they are the elites and if they present an attitude of lo morel the whole thing breaks and so they gotta have to kind of you know keep off everyone else's spirits versus like genuine really high morale um and i do think we have had periods of the first kind right sure like uh the a lot of that time in um you know 2018 in 2019 maybe um you know the time uh around like the dow fork and the dos attacks i mean there have been definitely periods where people have been kind of disappointed by soil progress but now i think it's definitely like all genuine and you know it's uh the merge is like looking more and more in the front view mirror and it's looking more and more like hey this thing is going to actually happen and once the merge actually happens then um you know i expect like more i was going to go way up right like i i basically expect that the merge is going to be kind of not priced in um by which i mean like not even just like market terms but even just kind of like psychological and narrative terms like pretty careful with that word yeah right right yeah like in kind of like like in narrative terms i think it's not going to be priced in like pretty much until like you like after it happens like there's like you know we see even even today like a lot of people kind of act as though you know this uh environmental issue is this fatal flaw and yeah sure ethereum mobile some noises about proof of stake but come on they've been saying that since forever and it's not going anywhere but like no no no it's gonna go somewhere right and uh i at this point i think the only way to just convince a huge number of people that it's going to go somewhere is just by actually going there sure you know once that happens it's going to change a lot of minds vitalik are you ready for like 17 crypto media publications to quote you and say the marriage is not priced in oh fine the media is quoting me now i wonder what other fun things i can say [Laughter] um you everyone should buy bitcoin satoshi's vision the the best crypto out there yeah oh yeah it's got the vision in the name yeah vitalik how does it feel to be the best fitted person at ucc the best fitted person yeah your outfit oh i see it right because i yeah i got the the the uni socks and the shirt um and i guess the kitty watch i know they're fun um i wish uh you know we should have more fun socks and more fun shirts at some point i will say if there's something that crypto conferences have it's definitely socks we have a lot of shocks here this is yeah socks are actually look good right i mean the thing with the shirts is um like one is that you just get so many of them and like for me you know i've got my backpack and i have like a centimeter cubed budget of eight shirts and like i'm already over by one and uh so you know i don't actually necessarily want to kind of you know keep shirting around right uh but uh oh and then also there's this other issue which is that like i really like those i mean you know the ultra thin uniqlos that are like actually like a big improvement both on centimeters cubed and on kind of you know ability to kind of go outside and inability to kind of survive 40 degree heat right then like even this like this is like made out of like fancy athletic fabric but like that's even better than that um so uh that's an east temperature right it is indeed it is a uh buffer um oh this is this this year it's the most recent year yeah yeah i know let's see what what other fun uh swag can we do we can do hats um we can uh well pants ants are under swag i don't think yeah the crypto industry has not delved into pants yet yeah yeah maybe you can include that in your talk so that we can have some in six to nine months we'll have some good good pants from now yeah i mean i tried to you know advertise those um i get like fox or shiba yunu or whatever they are pants but um let's talk about um the app layer for a little bit because the app layer is where a lot of lessons get learned i think every single cycle yes um the app layer was where the ico mania happened the player was with the defy like if food farms happened right uh what would you say are the biggest lessons that we've learned in the app layer in 2021 right i mean i think the one of the big lessons for the community has been around the kind of stable coin and luna stuff sure like i think uh we actually got to a point where what um what we might call principles based thinkers kind of got a bit demoralized right because i mean if your principle is based thinker then you're going to say anything that offers more than ten percent is like basically uh unsustainable out at best a scam at worst uh because uh you know nothing in fiat lands can stably offer 10 percent returns with like very little risk of losses so why the hell do we think that crypto space can do better especially given that there isn't really kind of much of a real economy backing up those growth rates um and uh the but at the same time you know in 2020 2021 we just saw this kind of ongoing um you know yield farming craze and you just regularly get like you know 90 apys on guild farming usdc or whatever and it just kept on getting crazier and like that's demoralizing right because like i think a lot of people even started thinking like wait okay you know maybe we're in a new paradigm and maybe this whole like sanity and logic thing actually is just a fiat world web 2 prejudice um and then um you know boom and uh luna suddenly taught people that like oh no no no principles actually do matter and we actually do live in reality uh so i think you know i'm i'm very happy that that uh incident happened just in time i mean i i wish that it had happened a few months earlier and blew up like five billion dollars instead of 50 but uh you know even still it's better that it happened now than if it happened later when it could have blown up 500 billion right because like you know when something blows up five billion dollars it's like okay fine it's a bunch of uh rich computer geeks and they're kind of playing around and it's their fault at 50 billion dollars you know people get more scared but at 500 billion dollars there's just a huge pressure for you know all the big mainstream actors to consider the events to be their responsibility and then like krypto is just going to completely lose its room to maneuver um so i think this is one of the reasons why like i've also never really joined this kind of enthusiastic desire to get a bitcoin or an ethereum etf uh because um i think uh like we're not ready for it yeah just to some extent and like like i think like in these phases like crypto kind of deserves to have a longer period of time and no one needs to have a longer period of time during which like it is an ecosystem where um you know this is this is the frontier this is the west all of those i've heard this before indeed you know this is not financial advice you can lose everything that you put in um and all of that and once you start kind of plugging it into mainstream infrastructure where like funds representing random 72 year olds um start throwing money into this stuff by default then you're just entering a different ballgame and like that's not really a volleyball game that we should be trying to answer that quickly um yeah like like basically yeah like if you have to choose between kind of two regulatory evils where one of those evils is uh you know regulators coming in and telling the industry what it can and can't do and the other one is the crypto industry gets freedom but it gets fired all firewalled off of mineral reality then like i choose the second over the first like any day um and so fortunately um i think you know luna broke before it managed to kind of get to that level of scale where uh it really started kind of you know jumping outside of the firewall but uh it's uh you know even still the the collapse kind of reminded people that like yes reality matters that yes fundamentals matter yes principles matter um yes this thing that you're throwing your money into that promises six percent returns uh and has been consistently giving you six percent returns for the last like two years might actually be something that's worth getting out of um and that's uh you know good that we learn those lessons certainly uh six percent year over year over year definitely beats out 20 in one year but zero going to zero at the end of that year yeah exactly the like the question i sometimes like ask myself with like all of these weird opportunities is like uh taking a long view right what is the probability that nothing bad will happen to this thing over 10 years right and let's say maybe the probability is like 75 percent okay if the probability of 75 percent that nothing bad will happen over 10 years 25 chance that like you know it drops to zero that's equivalence to an interest rate of negative two and a half percent right are you really like is the difference that you're getting really worth uh a different two and a half percent and often it isn't right uh so that but um yeah so that's like this sort of uh thing but like i think in order for it to be kind of like easy for pian to kind of like for people to start thinking in that way you know like sometimes you do need to just have like memorable examples of like the bad thing actually happening but you know the good news is now we do i mean maybe um i guess the uh you know sometimes uh the blood of sanity has to be refer or the uh what's the that us quote about tyrants them you know the the blank of sanity has to be refreshed by the uh the blood of people getting wrecked essentially um but uh the are we ever going to like break out from that meta that's a good question i think i think we will i mean i think we are slowly getting into it yeah i think basically what's happening is that like the the fact that there is a permanent frontier is and the fact that the permanent frontier is permanently risky is obscuring the fact that the frontier actually is moving sure and the number of specific things that's been de-risked and it's because and a safe is actually increasing all the time right like back in 2014 just in exchange was part of the frontier right right right yeah and now you know like that's totally not true right and people just know like hey yeah you know unislav works and it's safe you know keep stuff in your wallet and you know just do as you just probably need to trade things and otherwise when you need to move between fiat like in exchange it's just to pass through like you can use it but you don't want to huddle stuff there um the ability to just roll reliably hold your coins has been improving right like we've moved from uh you know lots of crazy stories of like coin theft in 2013 and 2014 and now we're things are better off with hardware wallets and um i think two years from now things will be like even better with uh more social recovery wallets um multisigs for organizations have been quietly getting mainstreamed multisix for individuals not quite yet but i think that's a ux problem but multi-sector organizations i actually remember when multi-sig smart contracts on ethereum were part of the frontier right yeah yeah yeah so you know and you know the parody yeah was parody in multisig yeah it was uh but it was a non-gnosis multi-cigarette yeah yeah they made their own multi-stick and and uh remember it was like someone made that bug report it was like a subject line anyone can kill your contract text oops i accidentally killed it and i just said one transaction that blew up a library and 450 billion dollars became inaccessible but like that was the frontier then and like now multisigs are just totally trusted right so like you know on the one hand it's like this is the frontier this is the west and but on the other hand it's like the west is moving west right right um you know this like it's not like i'm you know the west in america where you get to california and you're done it's like you know singapore where like yeah or where like they've literally they literally just keep on building land that at this point 20 percent of their country is like stuff that they've built yeah yeah so we can you know we can we can keep like biddling safe here as well so i think uh you know that trend is going to continue and i think like the set of things that you actually can do safely is gonna just keep going up more and more and uh it's the sort of thing that we won't notice because like the sign of that happening isn't use the sign of that happening is a lack of news but like if once you kind of get that kind of skill of uh learning to pay attention to lack of news um it's an interesting skill to acquire by the way like if you uh just try to get up-to-date information about like any event where there's a lot of propaganda and a lot of like highly incentivized uh discourse uh going on like listening to what doesn't get said is often like one of the most revealing things and i mean i hear like well what's not getting said while there's industries that or like some parts of crypto that used to be completely crazy that are just actually settled down and doing quite fine today vitalik there's there's something i'd actually like your advice on because this happens most conferences where like you know i have we have this podcast people a lot of people listen to it and so like therefore we get pitched a bunch all the time like people like oh like i'd love to show you what i'm building and then i i have this game that i plays like i i rate conferences by like the number of seconds it takes for somebody to start like in a conversation start pitching me i'm sure for you it is a hundred times worse how do you survive this how do i survive this um i mean guess like you know don't want to actually spend too much time conferencing you know like it's uh it's the conferences arrive it's actually more like an ethereum city for a week yeah examine if there's stuff that you want to talk to you can get people you want to talk to you can actually go and talk to them um and so like the yeah like the presentations are almost not even there for the presentation they're just there to make a shelling point you know right and you know especially in this kind of reality where it's like 10 000 people want to come but a thousand people can come it just sort of turns into that by default right um yeah but you know there's also well just it's good to also go around and talk to people and it's good to kind of get the general vibe um and just like get a feel for what kinds of things people care about what kinds of like problems people are working on uh what kinds of things you know people think are solving and what kinds of solutions people think are important and so no i think i know it's a good to get that but you know we also don't want to get too much of that certainly um vital we've we've already talked about uh what the developers are up to and and the importance of having a timetable for example is uh uh uh perhaps a takeaway from this but just for the broader ethereum community and perhaps like the non-protocol devs and encore devs maybe people in the app layer but also you know people like me and ryan who aren't builders but still do stuff what would be your general request for the broadest part of the ethereum community what do we need to do to just be a better community in 2022 and beyond i feel like my advice is the same as my advice has always been which is like elevate uh meaningful stuff um like uh there's just all of these uh projects like even you know the erc 4337 team right like they don't they don't have a token they don't have a glamorous marketing department they're doing stuff that like i think could be revolutionary that i think could um you know greatly improve the state of wallet safety and could even you know make optimistic roll-ups are three times cheaper sure and you know people like that deserve some love uh people who are like activists in random countries um for whom crypto actually is a lifeline to avoid being de-platformed um that like i've just like gotten to know more and more of those from you know all kinds of places uh over the last couple of years um and you know like i mean like i talked to a bunch out of russia obviously but you know there's like lots of different places and you know people like that are part of the community um people trying to um you know me like even make better social better social media platforms where the goal isn't just like hey you know this thing's going to be magically better because it has a token but they'll like have some interesting perspective about like you know hey you know what in particular makes twitter unproductive and toxic to the extent that it is and like how do you remove that and how do you replace that with like some positive mechanic and uh look there's just all of these different kind of corners of ethereumland that are doing interesting stuff and i think they yeah mean sometimes they need funding sometimes i think they just need kind of attention and they need help in kind of finding other people who care about the same thing um and you know they they need moral support so the more that we can do to help them i think the better certainly um vitalik there's a a talk that i have to go get to uh it happens to be yours so we have to conclude this interview so thank you for joining me yeah thank you too cheers bam all right [Music]
