lot of what i've been doing with the vibing as you call it it's just trying to manage my mental state through this extreme volatility and i do see so many people in the crypto space attach their identity and their sense of self to a company that is you know change their their life and i think that's really dangerous i think that's setting yourself up for disappointment inevitably so much around what we do what we're doing in crypto is around sort of memetic transmission right we're turning memes and into money and we're also creating these cults of belonging these cults of personality these cults of belief because just as quickly as those cults can create positive momentum they can turn negative equally quickly and there is in a certain amount of work that has to be done and where i start to get concerned is when i have conversations with people and they're not doing the work there isn't actually any intellectual grounding there has to be a analytical intellectually driven approach to what you're doing it's challenging for that to be sustained long term
