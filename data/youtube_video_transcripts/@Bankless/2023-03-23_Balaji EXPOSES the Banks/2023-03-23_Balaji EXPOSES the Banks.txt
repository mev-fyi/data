plan looks something like this the US has debts it can't pay saddle all of the banks with these giant liabilities have tons of them go bust and swooping as a hero printing the money so people are like thank you fed you got me my money back and then also have them all centralized at the big banks in the process and then amidst all the chaos you've got like four banks in the US and like One Bank in Canada or whatever the number is and now you just roll out of cbdc and now the banks that were too big to fail are too big to escape
