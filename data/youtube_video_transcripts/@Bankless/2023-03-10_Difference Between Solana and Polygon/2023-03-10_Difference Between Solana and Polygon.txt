what's the difference between Solana and polygon the polygon ecosystem feels today is just a lot less built out honestly than where Solana is at because Solana's been forced to just rebuild everything that existed on eat in terms of a lot of infrastructure so I think the biggest trade-offs at a high level are just polygon feels a lot earlier today in terms of the community and the culture side of the pfp ecosystem where Solana's definitely gotten its own brand and I think oncelona projects focus more around utility more around like Builders has definitely been been the main narrative
