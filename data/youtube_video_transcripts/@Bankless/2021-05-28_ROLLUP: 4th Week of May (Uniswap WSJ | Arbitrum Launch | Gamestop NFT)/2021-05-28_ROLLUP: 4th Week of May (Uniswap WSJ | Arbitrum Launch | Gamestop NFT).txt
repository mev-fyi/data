[Music] happy friday morning thankless nation david what time is it it is a friday morning weekly roll up time where we take a whole entire week in the crypto cycle and put it right into your brain as fast and densely as possible which is an ambitious endeavor in this industry yet we try to do it every single week and we have fun doing it left and right markets releases news takes we end with what we're excited about no we don't we end with the meme of the week of course every single week so stay tuned for that wow a lot going in going on in the bankless nation as always a lot going in crypto this is the last week of may we are excited to get you downloaded david you ready to get started let's do it ryan all right man we gotta start with the market the markets have been crazy these days david absolutely insane crazy uh last week around this time ish did it feel like a bear market to some people it felt like a bear market suddenly are we out of the bear market people got spooked last week people got real spooked um like on twitter last weekend david um a lot of anger i would say even about this market like the sudden drop uh anyway we'll get into that let's start with bitcoin what happened yeah from the start of this week at its lowest low bitcoin touched right below three thirty two thousand five hundred dollars and is currently trading just above forty thousand dollars people uh seem to be kind of comfy with bitcoin being at forty thousand dollars people i think are signing and breath breath of uh relief um but when bitcoin got below 33 000 people were freaking out um and there's a bunch of news to go along with this which we will be getting into uh but people are starting to get bullish and you know not let's not say too bullish but people are starting to to i think believe that oh yeah this this bull market is not over this is not the start of a bear market uh and so there we are uh bitcoin trading right above 40 thousand dollars uh if it can hold the forty thousand dollar level i think that's gonna instill a lot of confidence in the people that got spooked last week and yet some people are still saying this is a dead cat bounce of course we don't know for sure until the market plays out but tell us what's going on in uh ether price yeah ether got wrecked coming down from forty three thousand dollar uh four four thousand three hundred dollars at the top all the way down to seven ten hundred and thirty three dollars which is a big drop off the top over the 11 days between 4 300 and the bottom at 17.33 now trading at 2 810 so a huge rebound over a thousand dollars off of the bottom just the fact that ether is moving in thousand dollar increments is absolutely insane um and i would say an ether has it has a bigger bounce off the bottom than bitcoin did uh we'll get into looking at the ratio in a second but uh the the bounce off the bottom was definitely an ether's favorite which is pretty interesting i gotta say on sunday people were freaking out david at these these prices like ether price went 66 with 66 off all-time highs bitcoin was over 50 something like this like it's one of the biggest drops in crypto history if you think that this is normal this is not normal this is a huge drop it is a huge drop but but also uh not unprecedented at least on ether side and again last week we talked about you know 2017 right so this dropped from 420 all the way to like the 130s or so again this kind of feels like that and it's even fitting the uh the rhythm of that where there was a strong recovery not back all the way to all-time highs but a fairly quick recovery from those 130s lows of course some people are still thinking this is like dead cat bounce and you know we're gonna go lower still that might play out that might be the case what's your take happiness i mean it would it would be just what would seem to be a really premature end to this bull market but again you're you're the listener is listening to two like critics would call it i don't trade permabulls critters were always bullish uh but to some degree there's always so many fundamentals right and and this is going to be a theme for the rest of this market section but like there's still so much energy left in this in this allocate reallocation towards crypto this this is why some people were um some people were angry about this move on um on twitter because on sunday i i said something to the effect of like some of you seem to feel entitled to crypto gains every week of the year that's not how this works and i wasn't trying david to downplays anyone's stress or suffering with a 66 like lost drop um that is a big deal right but like the reality is also david we just moved to prices of like 45 days earlier right so if you bought more than 45 days ago you were doing okay and if you want to take the like 10x gains you have to be comfortable with days or weeks where you know you're getting these kind of dips 66 dips or more it just goes with the territory so at some level like if you're a unicycler this is your first uh bull market you're not used to these things but also get used to them right like the market doesn't owe us anything we're all along for the ride this is what volatility looks like this is what you signed up for when you bought even good blue chip crypto assets like bitcoin and ether this is what happens like it's a commitment to like this is world-changing technology it will absolutely change every single paradigm that we know and love and that's why we're all super bullish on it that's why we there's a thousand x over the next like x number of years and you're getting 60 drops every now and then like you don't get 1000x upsides without like you know huge massive pull downs like you're gonna have to take you can get you you've got to take it you just gotta take it also david we're gonna have a bear market someday too sure i want these folks to be ready for that right like we're just not going to go on a straight march to like you know a million dollar bitcoin and like 100k eth like there's going to be some uh some bumps in the road as well anyway people have to get used to this but let's talk about this david but no before we move on ether went from 730 at the end of january almost almost straight up to 4 000 at the end of may and so like people i think people got really spoiled be behind just number go up it's like oh yeah it literally was up and to the right with very minimal dips and everyone's like oh making money left and right and then all of a sudden we dump 60 if you are making money left and right for months and months and months dips dip's coming like it doesn't work like that like you're getting you're going to get punched in the face yeah just being real of course and you got to be in this game for the long term for the long run that's what uh that's what we're about that's what the bankless journey is all about so anyway guys i i know it's painful um you know we'll get through it just uh zoom out expand your time horizon and um don't panic sell right like don't give in to those don't give them those immediate reactions no euphoria without pain all right david let's go to the ether bitcoin ratio this is doing some stuff what's it doing definitely definitely doing some stuff that's for sure uh there was some commentary about how well the eth btc ratio was holding up while btc kind of led this downtrend btc started to to dump out and like uh you know trade off sell off sooner than everything else and eat btc held up uh and then the rest of the market started to sell off too and then and then it went from its high of .08 which is really high in each btc terms all the way down to 0.057 which in the grand scheme of things still pretty high and it's still pretty high and but you know each btc does sell off when the market sells off so you know if ethers if bitcoin sneezes you know ether ether is sick in bed i would say overall though it didn't really nuke as we've have seen it before and it recovered pretty pretty strongly and so that we hit the high earlier while we were super bullish while everyone was talking about the flipping and flipping was in uh it was at point zero eight now we're at point zero seven um so i would say really strong recovery by the btc ratio still feels like bull market stuff i don't think i don't know you never know could be a dead cat but it still feels like bull market stuff lots of people saying dead cats but uh yeah between you and me ryan it's just you yeah it's it really i'm the only guy okay all right ryan watkins uh eat volumes have been exploding recently have surpassed bitcoin volumes this might be some of the reason for that healthy uh eat to bitcoin ratio here so this is actually spot volumes on centralized exchanges and bitcoin has always led from a volume perspective now ethan's taking the lead that's something new we we haven't seen in the past i'm not sure if we've ever seen this david right um what does that tell us yeah this is a big narrative shift for for bitcoin right because bitcoin talks about itself as one of the world's most liquid assets right you can make bitcoin buy large bitcoin buys themselves from anywhere in the world anywhere in the time and one of the reasons why that's true is because the bitcoin volume is insane it's always been the largest in crypto ether has been taking the lead since i would say the last two weeks i think is where i'm looking at on this chart where ether has had surpassed bitcoin and trading volumes uh that doesn't necessarily mean that ether is more liquid but it definitely over the long term if trading volumes are higher then overall liquidity follows that and so this is what it takes to become a money is significant liquidity globally and that's what we're seeing out of ether in the last two weeks it's also interesting maybe starting to position ether as a reserve currency for crypto which bitcoin has still been king of we you could argue that eth was the reserve asset of defy but bitcoin has still led all of crypto maybe that's changing as well um yeah you have to wonder about the how this how this shakes out in the future and this is what the flipping looks like by the way if the flipping is is one big flipping which is represented by like a thousand little flippings and this is one of them yeah i agree that's an important one um okay let's let's talk about d5 for a minute so the first is total locked value down and then up as the market went down and then back up we are sitting at 65 billion total value locked in d5 protocols at this moment what does this mean uh i mean it basically looks like the ether price chart which makes sense because everything is super correlated right now more eve uh you just keeps going down though in d5 i wonder if that's going to be a uh a long-term trend that that plays out here and cycle up to oh only still definitely in the short term only in the short term yeah we'll see short term noise okay d5 tokens we measure that by the dpi which is many of the top most blue chip uh d5 tokens out there how's that how's that held up i'm going to scroll to the uh the weekly here except for that one brief moment in time sunday night where like defy tokens got like cut by 60 they've rebounded pretty well and they were doing pretty well like kind of resisting the the bitcoin sell-off pretty well and the ether sell-off uh and then the market just took everything for a ride um you know um friday through sunday uh but rebounded down up to 420 dollars relatively again still relatively flat over let's see the the one month period i would say download a little bit how about the three month period ryan yeah flat over three months uh in the grand scheme of things but if uh you know coming off of what was a pretty strong high at just like above six hundred dollars yeah year to date we're still definitely up 421 and you're the date that's up almost like a three or four x so not doing too bad on the year what about the dpi to eat ratio that's so important god here we are and i haven't actually seen this chart since the last time we we talked about it but i called the bottom at each dpi at point one three holding back and it's barely holding on it barely held on but the bottom is still in on dpi uh and so yeah i almost i almost didn't call it i almost got uh became wrong but so far we'll see we'll see there's some more weeks left in the year david yeah i wonder what happens if we enter sort of another uh defy summer time period but like we certainly haven't yet um ethan has been performing very well defy tokens have yet to follow we'll see what happens in the future um all right let's jump to raul paul this is a really interesting take uh you lead with his stake david and i'll throw some comments in yeah i think we should put put the uh the frame of mind of 2008 into the the listener as we read this thread so 2008 was cascading liquidations that like set up the set off the global financial system to the point of just like we need the world's largest institutions to take action or else the world is going to explode that was well the bankers bail out the bankers print money like fix it fix it fix it like things are broken things are things are dried up uh so let's use that for context granted d5 is not the world world's largest like industry or an economy so this is microcosm but let's use that as a frame of mind here's what raul says something to get your head around headline a major asset class class crashed 42 in 14 days wiping out a trillion dollars in value in an orgy of liquidations of people up to 100x leverage with very low regulation many tokens fell up to 70 percent including unregulated lending and borrowing businesses beneath the headline headline by the way is what people freak out about right right mainstream media i saw as like how can institutions buy uh such a volatile asset this is not ready for mainstream all of these headlines came out right beneath the headlines though so this is what raul says but you know here's the real through line that you should pay attention to crypto had a major major uh v var do you know what that is ryan v a r v variance i guess volatility something i don't know um and and nothing happened it had a shock test and nothing happened leverage liquidations was offset by over collateralization over collateralization is fundamentally safe no one was left holding the baby no firm went under the fed didn't need to step in defy didn't break and carried on near normal the markets cleared the markets worked defy apps worked nothing broke that is absolutely fantastic and like nothing broke and it dropped 60 percent in 11 days in 2008 it didn't drop dropped 60 percent it dropped like 40 over like two weeks or something i i don't know my memories i would you know i was like a kid during that um but the point is it's like it took a harder punch and it came out you know came out swinging it did it did i think people uh overestimate the risk of d5 sometimes not that there isn't smart contract risk and red pull risk and theft less risk but all of this lending at least right now none of it is credit based all of it's over collateralized so that that is a very open honest market you could see all of the activity on chain as it happens uh so yeah i mean good for d5 good for crypto for sustaining some of this it shows that it is possible to do so in an open unregulated market maybe this is what open markets really look like if the if if the fed and regulators like peeled off the veneer and stopped moving all of the dials around maybe that's what we're seeing here and he continues saying there was no daisy change of collateral losses stable coins remained stable a few centralized exchanges went down for an hour or two no exchange big losses occurred no protocol failed mainly no protocols went down overall just like people get spooked by this 60 and like a lot of people just aren't ready to see the val the value of their investments drop by 60 and that's that's their that's their thing but things worked right and so to some degree there is less risk and things that can take a 60 drop and rebound without completely dying like that's not something we've seen in the world before good acid test uh here's another take on this um on defy decentralized exchanges had an absolutely incredible set of days this is actually from may 20th so it's before the sunday the big sell-off but look at these volumes decentralized exchanges david i mean they held up they supported the trading that needed to occur uh for this volatility and they like crushed it in terms of volumes like super impressive over 10 billion in in decentralized exchange volume on uh may 20th i bet there's even more on may 23rd the sushi swap plus uniswap dominance is absolutely insane and just the amount of straight up pink on this graph and for the listeners pink means uniswap is really really strong uh i wonder how much extra volume came into d5 because all the centralized exchanges were shut down agreed super interesting anyway uh that that's the story of the dip so far i mean we'll continue to cover it see what happens next week i don't know if we'll be lower or higher no one knows this uh of course but uh we'll continue to keep you updated on the markets and this is an interesting take while we're talking about numbers david uh from amine tornado cash maybe you can explain what that is but tornado cash is within 10x of flipping z cash in terms of uh total locked value of eth uh versus market cap of z cash what does this mean to you yeah so z cash is a eth tumbler that's a eth mixer and so you deposit z cash tornado cash yeah oh is that what i yeah i meant to say tornado cash tornado cash is a mixer right and they also are working on uh dye and usdc mixers but right now just eth uh and so you deposit lots of one or ten or one hundred ether into tornado cache and then you wait because you're waiting for other people to also do the same and when you deposit it you get this note right you get a note back which is a just a cryptographic hash and you kind of you save that on your computer you save that not on the ethereum blockchain you save that in meat space right then then you wait for other people to come in put their ether into the tumbler you allow entropy to happen so you just are patient then you come back with your note at a later date and time and then that note is a right to claim an equivalent amount of what you deposited into the tumbler and you can send that to a different address elsewhere and so it's a it's a privacy mechanism right so one of the biggest pain points about ethereum and d5 is that like if you need to pay someone or transfer money to someone or just like if you need to do something like you no privacy there's no problem and you have that with cash with cash money you have privacy in the real world exactly right and so like uh if i if i pay you on on for my wallet right you can go and check out my wallet and see what else i've been doing in the world of crypto right it's just like giving you complete uh inspection abil inspection ability into my personal finances and we don't like that uh and so what tornado cache does is it lets you put eth in and receive like a note like think think of literally a piece of paper but just like in digital form like a note uh and you can i can pass that around and that just passes around in meat space uh but then you can come back to tornado cache and redeem that for actual ether send it to a different wallet and uh you don't you cut off that connection back to your og wallet zcash does a similar thing except zcash is an l1 it is a it's a native currency to the zcash ecosystem and they have similar transaction capacities but the difference is if zcas is you know something non-native to ethereum and so really the through line here is is privacy an l1 asset or is privacy an application in defy i've always been of the opinion and i'm pretty sure ryan you agree with me that privacy is an app not an asset uh privacy is something that you can bestow into assets all assets not just one specific asset and so what amine is saying is that tornado cash has 2 million 200 million dollars of eth deposited into it versus z cash which which has a two billion dollar market cap and so what he's saying is he's keeping an eye on the um the tvl of tornado cash in ether terms versus the total market cap of z cash which is an l1 uh and this is a really good comparison and i expect tvl and tornado cash to pass to pass zcash over the long term yeah i mean for for those who weren't here in like 2017 2018 uh this was very much an open question right there was very much the the idea that we would if we wanted to have privacy in uh crypto we would need privacy chains essentially completely separate l1s and so the valuations of many of these privacy chains were based on this and this looks like ethereum is just kind of swallowing up the privacy use case and if there is a flipping tornado cache to zcash i think there's like some conclusive evidence that privacy is better off as an app not as a whole separate of layer one nothing against zcash i mean that team is fantastic they're doing great work um putting out pioneers of research pioneers of cryptography but like we're just putting on kind of an investor hat and sort of a thesis hat of how this space shapes up and it looks like ethereum is like swallowing up some of these apps so we'll continue to monitor that the thing is in this also talk is a really awesome tailwind behind ether the asset right because not only is ether the asset ultrasound money but if it can match or exceed z cash in market cap inside of tornado cash it's also ultra private money right like literally ether gets all of the features uh and that's why we're all bullish on ethers because every single app that def that defy comes to build benefits ether the most yeah absolutely okay so uh let's look at this too this is an interesting tweet i thought was worth pulling up wi-fi trades at a price to earnings ratio p e ratio used in stocks of 12 currently 12 with analyzed annualized earnings of 85 million based on may data price to earnings of 12. david you don't see that anywhere anywhere like in capital assets nowhere even in the normal stock market 12 is low what about a high growth industry like ethereum and d5 i remember in 2017 we were all talking about how prices got so far ahead of like their p e ratios people with p e ratios of like these stupid like 2017 tokens were like in the bajillions and yfi which is generating a ton of revenue is sitting at 12. like what it's just it's just a reminder that the we have real capital assets this cycle that are producing like real revenues and profits that you can easily track on chain totally different than 2017. now some people will say yeah but david um like these earnings are based on um you know token valuations elsewhere right and so like yields coming from all of this token farming incentivized farming and that is temporal that will dry up at some point in the future um and like that might be true right like i certainly understand kind of that that take uh but yet we're still at 12. like if you're going to compare this to you know something similar that happened in dot com where yahoo had a crazy valuation it's based on advertising generated from all the other dot coms it was all a big bubble anyway at that time yahoo was not trading at 12 p e ratio it's trading the hundreds if not the thousands so i don't know it doesn't feel like a bubble to me and these are real capital assets these are undis undiscovered assets if you ask me pretty impressive and importantly uh yearn is putting on its balance sheet both its own equity right the yfi token but also eth right so it's a p e ratio of 12 for ether not for dollars right and so like that hits different at least in my mind yeah and we're going to get to that and it takes a wi-fi governance proposal um that is going to do that let's let's take a look at this from david mihal this is uh money movers which blockchain is settling more value we've got ethereum here now surpassing bitcoin uh and i think this is just stable coins david so stable coin value on ethereum has now passed bitcoin value settled uh on bitcoin for the first time since d5 oh i see i see right okay so what's going on here is not bitcoin's uh stable coin settlements because they're used there used to be and prep still is omni on bitcoin transferring stable coins what this is saying is stable coins being transferred on ethereum is equal to volume the volume of btc being transferred on bitcoin wow that's crazy yeah it's crazy and it's huge like it's this is very much ethereum becoming the kind of the settlement layer for the world i will say although i will also say it's not quite an apples to apples comparison because we make this distinction with bitcoin on bitcoin is a bare asset it's completely trustless right stable coins on ethereum some of them are maybe like liquidy the protocol we talked to earlier but some are usdc and tether and their settlement doesn't just happen on ethereum it also happens in meat space so an interesting comparison i think also not quite apples to apples but maybe yet another flipping interesting i kind of think that's beside the point um i said beside the point of this particular take this particular take is that ethereum is being used to settle value we can talk about the nature of that value and like the banklessness of that value being settled but i actually think that's a separate conversation to some degree it's just like dollar settled versus dollar seller i actually think we'll get into some of that conversation uh when we talk about um like simple layer twos that are popping up because i see a lot of this transaction settlement activity for low trust stable coins or for less trustless stable coins might start to happen on layer twos anyway we'll get to that all right guys we're going to be back with the hot releases next but first we want to thank the sponsors who made this episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools could be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success bouncer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange here we go guys it is release time david we gotta start by talking about layer two layer two summer layer two just like it is the night before layer two and all through the house it feels like if everyone is stirring and waiting for it everyone's talking about when's it coming when's it coming i feel like it's actually about to hit us like a tidal wave and let's talk about why that might be the case the first is arbitram okay launching maybe today today as you're listening to this not the day of recording the day of you listening to this the day of you listening to it may 28th was supposed to be the day of course we have arbitram on state of the nation on tuesday so we'll get the full update there make sure you tune into that but why is arbitrary interesting david uh because it is one of the two big l2s that uh is really true to the values and ethos of ethereum right so we got optimism and we got our arbitrarium there are other l2s as well but those are really the the two um pioneers in the world of cryptography that are extending the base layer security of ethereum into the l2s with uncompromising decentralization and security uh and there's about to be in my in my opinion a just rush to grab new real estate right like we've already seen applications deploy on a polygon of a sushi swap really competing with each other to get like tvl and liquidity inside of polygon and polygon isn't even really the complete version of l2s that we all have been talking about for the past like six months that's optimism and arbitrary and arbitrary launch is tomorrow for dev developers and there's just going to be a race to get in and start deploying on arbitrom and the the magnitude of how this is going to change the user experience for the general defy user is can't be understated everything is about to change everything is about to change yeah i agree with that so this take a new scaling project has entered this sidechain chat arbitrary is not a side chain interestingly enough so coindesk that not quite right um arbitrarum is what we would call a layer two that means it is secured by the ethereum maynet uh similar settlement guarantees and economically secured by eth the asset first one of these to launch with an evm so that means all of the d5 projects you know and love on ethereum mainnet can be fairly seamlessly ported over to arbitram and i think they're not just launching like hey we're live they're going to be launching with a whole bunch of projects so what and we'll find out more i guess tomorrow or today maybe for the listener and then also on tuesday when we talk to them but this was interesting from hayden adams the unit swap community has spoken and with overwhelming support in favor of an arbitrary deployment of uniswap v3 uniswap deploying on arbitrage trump david it was not uh too long ago where we talked to hayden about his lair two plans and unit swap was was very much of the opinion that like hey we want to maximize for decentralization so roll up solution is the way to go they were thinking optimism at the time that is definitely still the path forward but now it looks like the community is pushing them to explore arbitram as well and uniswap's going to be there very exciting what do you make of this i mean to some degree you literally have no costs few costs to deploy on everything viable l2 why not plus let the market decide like deploy everywhere let let the market choose but you can't let the market choose without deploying to every single possible spot and arbitrary is a very viable spot to deploy you literally have no reason not to and maybe they both they both work out and and it's only beneficial to uni token holders to have surface area on optimism and arbitrarium and polygon for that matter wherever people are just allow the market to express itself and so i think defy apps are about to be deployed everywhere it does seem uh uniswap so far has opted to deploy in the most decentralized chains only which means like roll-up chains optimism and um and arbitrarion but maybe polygon at some point too um a little like it's less polygon is of course more of a side chain less of a layer two at this point but they're moving in that direction as well um this kind of brought it home to me that optimism is coming as well okay so like optimism on ether scan david i know you've used polygon right so like th this is also why it's so exciting to see these roll up solutions because like defy on polygon with no gas fees is awesome like it's really fun and it's great like you can experiment it just works with metamask you know the same defy tool used to it's great no cost for experimentation because transactions are basically free in instance like oh do i want to try this thing out like i don't even have to think twice because it's free i'll do it i'll do it if i don't if i don't like it i'll also do it like no cost so yeah the people who are priced out of ethereum can use a polygon but it makes some trade-offs of course and but but like to me polygon is sort of a proof of concept like will there be demand for an evm um roll-up chain yes absolutely there will why because we've seen polygon we've seen even binance chain with the evm massive amount of demand on both of those chains so to me we've got product market fit anyway this is about optimistic um roll ups on ether scan so when you use polygon you don't have the ether scan block explorer which i personally really like really annoying yeah but here it is right you can click here and this is this is what the ui of this of roll ups are going to be right if with your meta mask if you want to go and use polygon you go to metadata mask and instead of using the ethereum main chain you take the drop down bar and you hit polygon it's going to be the same exact thing for both arbitrarum and optimism you're just going to select a different network and the fact that you can just fork ether scan and do like oh yeah the optimistic ether scan which ether scan is like one of the great blessings and the fact that we can just have the same thing on optimism is so awesome it's so exciting this is why we're excited about layer two summer this is why david i feel like this is coming like a tidal wave because it's not this stuff is not just going to launch it's gonna launch with actual d5 projects that we use today that already have product market fit um let's go to the next take here oh here's a question that came up that i think we should address and before we do uh listeners if you have questions that you want us to address and they're good questions we will address them so that's the through line here yeah here's a question love what you guys do at bank was my question how can eats value benefit from layer twos wouldn't scalability decrease gas and therefore also the coming deflationary burning of gas compared to current state so that's the question david is like are these layer twos actually competitive with ethereum and with ethereum block space why don't you take a first step at this question oh yeah this is a this is a really awesome conversation uh first off there is this concept of induced demand right and so this is one of the big reasons why bitcoin with its scaling debate with bitcoin versus bitcoin cash and also ethereum with like raising the block size too much is also relevant here if you just scale up the ethereum blockchain you actually don't you don't actually relieve fees at the base layer because people just become to use it more like the more scale you have there's a basal level of what people will pay for and people are going to pay for that no matter what and so if we scale the base layer people are just going to use that more and so like moving volume activity off of the base chain onto l2s means that other people are free to use the base layer because there's more freedom there and so there's just going to be this induced demand and that's why we just don't like skyrocket the block size to infinity to allow for that transactional capacity that's why we don't do that because we know the fees are just going to come regard or the uh transactional demand is going to come regardless the other thing is that if you are on an ethereum l2 like optimism or arbitrary you are still committed to the ethereum base layer right your transactional activity then and optimism and arbitrary and all these l2s the volume of economic activity can be really really hot but it's still like locked into the ethereum ecosystem right if you ever want to get off of the arbitrary l2 you're going back to ethereum and so uh we talked about this uh with nick carter and he uh on his block space cycle podcast article which is really good article and podcast to understand the ethereum gas markets he used this concept of a governor and how a governor a governor is a mechanism not not like a governor of a city governor is like a tool and a governor is how the steam engine began to work where if the steam engine gets too hot it puts a bunch of energy into these weighted spinning like metal balls that have a lot of mass and they spin around really really fast and that's how a steam engine can self-regulate and that's the metaphor i use for the ethereum base layer where like if the ethereum base layer is getting too hot and fees are getting too high it expends energy by putting it into the l2s right and then the l2s suck up some of that demand to to transact then if the ethereum base layer starts to cool off those spinning like the spinning governors uh the spinning weighted balls those are allowed to decrease in energy and put potential energy back into the main chain and so once the fees on the main chain come down people can come back from the l2s and because the fees are cheaper and so they come back from arbitrary they come back from optimism and they say oh the fees on ethereum just went from like a bajillion gas to a much more reasonable amount of gas let's go back to the main chain right and so it keeps economic activity on ethereum really really sticky and it allows for a much broader set of economic use cases overall right and so like arbitrarum and and all these l2s where transactions are going to be free and instant all of a sudden that opens up a brand new domain of economic activities that we have never been able to do before on the ethereum base layer and so it's creating new economic activity uh and it's it's stuck on ethereum it's sticky to ethereum uh and so overall just more activity on aetherium that is ultimately secured by ether the asset at the mainland chain is always good there is maybe there's some relief of gas fees and there is literally less gas feeds being burnt but the stickiness and the centrality of this economic activity to ethereum is the through line and that's what we should be focusing on i'll note also that uh chains like um arbitrarum and and optimistic roll-ups uh optimism they literally require eth in order to as a bonding mechanism in order to have them operate and for some of their security guarantees we'll talk with arbitrary team about that next next tuesday but because of all you said david what tends to happen is this important concept of economic density right like there was a time when really ridiculous transactions occurred on bitcoin when i say ridiculous i just mean like very low volume low value uh activities occurred on um bitcoin like there's kind of like a bitcoin pixel type game where you just like select a pixel and that would be a bitcoin you know transaction satoshi's place um yeah satoshi's place right eric did eric voorhees was he behind that no i can't remember it that's satoshi's dice that's uh that's right but same point like weird weird like low value transactions that are just lock space was cheap why not now it's permanently on the bitcoin ledger we would never imagine a satoshi's dice game like today similarly like it doesn't really make sense to have low value transactions on ethereum today like the idea of breeding a crypto kitty the way that we did in like 2017 and issuing that on um ethereum like that would not work does not fly today so what tends to happen is what will tend to happen is higher economic density transactions will occur on ethereum these are the transactions that are high amounts like high value and also require high degrees of trustlessness and decentralization and so um the transactions will get like more and more and more dense over time until you might be left with like entire like transactions that occur on ethereum that are compilations of pull-ups entire chains like activities of entire chains i think of this kind of as the suburbs versus cities analogy to david it's like when new york city starts building other suburbs right it doesn't take away from new york city it actually is additive to new york city and like the metropolitan inner city in like inner city type area and economic activity of that so people are so committed to living in manhattan even though they can't that they just live next to it exactly exactly so i i i think that um all of these even the side chains david like even binance smart chain is actually additive to ethereum right because like it's using the evm it's like you know onboarding people into d5 and like they eventually graduate into ethereum or another rollup it's like all additives so great question hopefully that answers some of it um we'll we'll see how it all plays out but i'm excited at the end of this conversation is the protocol sync thesis right like the reason why finance smart chain is additive to ethereum is because things settle down to the most uh secure and strongly settled strongly held settlement assurances in the planet uh and that's where ether and ethereum is and so the more things we could do that's proximate to that the more things fall down the protocol sync we haven't talked about the protocol sync in a while right we should we should kick that up again we definitely should guys we'll try to include some resources on that in the show notes too i'll talk about it another time david another thing is polygon has released some really interesting news they are announcing a polygon sdk and here's why i think this is interesting is because this sdk allows you to build other polygon side chains so david we talked earlier about ethereum kind of eating apps like eating privacy as an app one other interesting concept that was birthed in you know 2017-2018 was this idea of uh the cosmos um is which is a separate uh chain and it takes a different approach than ethereum you have sort of um all of these different side chains essentially um that pay for their own security right and that um essentially are transmitted through the cosmos hub um that was a really interesting project i think remains an interesting project there are some cool stuff being built on that essentially what polygon is doing here is giving you an sdk so if you're a developer you want to create your own app chain you can create your own app chain as a side chain so there might be the idea of ethereum through polygon kind of eating this whole app chain cosmos idea except settlement occurs through ethereum rather than a cosmos hub that's why i think this is this is an interesting move for um for polygon we'll see how it plays out yeah the uh the there's a famous through line that was originally created by bitcoiners which is anything that's actually useful will ultimately become built on bitcoin some some bitcoiners still say that that's actually becoming true on ethereum uh we talked about zcash zcash is being built on ethereum in the form of tornado cache eos was was built on on ethereum as well with this loom network but neither of those things worked out the thing is like if it is a good idea the whole point of what vitalik calls like um functionality escape velocity if it can be built and it's useful it will be built on ethereum and that's the power of the evm that's what the evm can do if it's useful you can deploy it on the evm and if it is useful you might as well deploy it onto ethereum because that's where everyone else is yeah this kind of reminds me of the cosmos model except with the evm basically and so you get some of that network effect all right david let's uh let's move a bit faster here so we get through the we're selling releases git coin just released a git coin dow governance token we've talked about that a ton on state of the nation go check that out any any words on this release yeah kevin owaki is really pioneering what it means to dow uh and i think the cool thing about uh get coin token and maybe i'm biased here but like get coin is a off chain dow in the sense that like uniswap yearn sushi swap those are unchained dowels they have protocols that they operate with git coin uh bank bankless dao meta factory these are off chain dowels these are different kinds of dowels where people collect in the meat space world usually on discord and they figure out what to do and they figure out how to progress and so these are really just digital organizations that don't necessarily have smart contracts on ethereum yet still operate as a distributed organization uh and so i'm really optimistic about the future of uh git coin dow there is a ton of reasons to be really really excited uh it's kind of like the dow with daos in the sense that like git coin as a platform funds other public goods and dows are kind of like public goods uh there's there's a whole incredible like these bullish thesis that will never ever come out of the git coin team because of you know reasons but i'll say it yeah absolutely and by the way a quick psa if you've ever given to a git coin grant or opened one yourself you should go check out uh to see if you're eligible to receive gtc tokens as well um all right last release here coinbase institutional is announcing the unveiling of some new offerings here david what's this about yeah basically they are i think this is kind of like there are some real products here but more more this is just a rebrand of coinbase's traditional products in like an institutional package uh all of coinbase's products are just being like kind of reorged into a little like box and then presented to institutions and like oh we have coinbase institutional now i think really the main feature is like this integration between deep cold storage with insurance which gives institutions peace of mind but allowing that cold source to fluidly interact with coinbase the exchange right and and so it allows for like safe and secure and insured custody but also liquidity when the time comes for it uh and so this is now coinbase institutions like next to coinbase pro and coinbase custody and coins yeah look they want to be the the crypto bank for institutions right so they want to replicate michael saylor's uh we're buying bitcoin for our treasury success over and over again with every single institution and company powered by coinbase institution exactly yeah so it's a definitely good play we'll get more institutions into crypto all right david that is it for releases let's switch over to news man i think the leading news this week is two billionaires carl icahn ray dalio talking about crypto and also china china but maybe not uh unrelated to the building what's going on china unrelated two separate topics let's let's talk about the billionaires first this is carl icahn so he is a famous billionaire activist invest investor corporate raiders someone call him um you know i i just remember times where he has basically like invested a whole much bunch of money into companies and totally shaken them up like remove the ceo install new management team write a letter to shareholders like he he is an activist investor now he's talking about ethereum and now he's talking about bitcoin and some of the quotes here are pretty phenomenal pretty crazy so he says with ethereum it's the underlying blockchain so ethereum has two things you can use it as a payment system and you can use it as a store of value payment system and store value ethereum he's talking about not bitcoin so he says so ethereum and bitcoin are different bitcoin to me is just a store of value wow he's getting into the store of value versus like what's a blockchain and you know can there be more basically the through line that i'm hearing there is that ethereum has an app layer and it's a store of value right that's what he's really saying the blockchain is like oh yeah there's things to do there and there's a native store of value that's that's like the through line that i think he's uh clueing into he also says he wants to get into crypto in a relatively big way right so what's he say i mean a big way for us would be a billion dollars a billion and a half dollars i'm not gonna say exactly which at least the question right carl i can't i i operated in these markets for who knows how long knows how to manipulate media it knows how this game is played if carl has not already bought a billion dollars worth of ethan bitcoin like already why in the world is he announcing that he's about to do something big in crypto and maybe like hinting by a billion dollars worth of ethan bitcoin are you saying that this is like psyops and he's actually already done it or what are you saying like the guy's not yes that's what i'm saying david like he's if he's on media tv doing this i don't know for sure like sure he's got to have positions in some of these assets why why is he saying this same thing i mean incentives would align with your thesis right like why why who who has the incentive to chill before they filled their bag incentives but also like this is what this guy does it's his playbook right right like he's an activist investor implying that over a billion dollars of buying demand is going to be coming into these assets even though it maybe have has already happened look i'm just asking the question you know who knows what carl's done maybe carl filled his bagged uh bags during the uh the sunday drop when everyone got spooked and and he bought their spooked bags some some are predicting that he plans to manipulate it further so like he's just saying that and then he's gonna like game on you know we we've already seen a 66 drop you can't scare us carl let's talk about dalia this is a bit more of a long-term thinker investor a lot different uh different class of billionaire i guess than carl i can um but he came out i watched his presentation coin desk on monday and he said this i have some bitcoin you talked about crypto he talked about bitcoin he talked about bitcoin being a better buy than bonds man dalia is one of my favorite thinkers in the space right like because he thinks historically about um money and how macro currencies right like have changed over history right so like he goes back to the british pound and and um and before and then he talks about fiat as like sort of a passing regime all fiat monies have failed eventually and so he thinks we're in a late credit uh debt cycle late debt cycle basically and that fiat and the u.s is the world reserve currency is on its way out about to be replaced by something else so his message is like position yourself historically the positioning has been all about commodities and gold but now he is getting crypto friendly uh he also talked about defy being very excited about defy and he also mentioned ethereum in uh that conversation and he was like asking to be educated further on defy and ethereum so he also said he wasn't convinced that that bitcoin could win he said bitcoins um could be a victim of its own success so he was worried about uh bitcoin and other crypto assets becoming large enough to start threatening nation states and the nation states reacting to them in a very negative way of course the crypto response to that is like yeah when that's a problem crypto's gonna be really big right like so maybe you should still buy now right um but anyway really good conversation with dalia and i it feels like he's definitely warming up he owns crypto that's pretty crazy it sounds like uh dalia is ready to come on banquets uh it sounds like it's it's time it's time for us to finally talk to ray dalio i know he's been answering to come on i'm sure he has been yeah i'm sure he's listen i'm sure he's listening so dalia if you're listening we'd love to have you on bank list love your thesis for this space david you should i think he bought bitcoin a while ago i think he bought bitcoin before he accepted being a speaker at consensus and that was like months ago yeah i mean got to be i don't know if his fund has though she's different bridgewater i don't know if his fund has if that's personal or what um all right let's talk china so david you know more about this you start right okay so there is this meme of china bans bitcoin uh it happens in bull markets it happens once every two to three months happened like seven times in 2017 it's already happened like two or three times so far this cycle this time apparently it's different uh and not specifically not bitcoin but uh bitcoin mining i think uh and so the rumors are and if you really want to dive deeper into this go follow nick carter and uh listen to what he's been saying but uh bitcoin miners are leaving china uh out of fear of uh fear out of fear i guess uh and so bitcoin the bitcoin mining hash rate has been noticed to have been migrating out of certain areas in china elsewhere uh there and that's perhaps one of the big reasons as to why bitcoin uh fell off and dumped off because bitcoin miners needed to liquidate their positions to uh fund their cost of moving entire operations uh so this is a big deal like it's not just like there's a lot of hash power in china uh and so getting moving to hash power out of china is a it's a costly endeavor just because of the magnitude of where are they going david i don't know i don't know elsewhere but the through line is elsewhere um and so uh bitcoin miners are are leaving and this has really changed the the narrative game the bitcoiners are trying to change the narrative game with this and and rightfully so uh this is this is words out of uh nick carter uh where you know uh hash power leaving china is really bullish for for bitcoin from the american u.s united states perspective because hash power gets cleaner because we are killing dirty hash power and it's migrating to cleaner sources and it's also uh influxing into the united states and so chinese mining hash power dominance is coming down and more decentralization more decentralized hash power is rising up and then it's also green greener is is the through line narrative uh and so uh this is uh cause short-term pain but long-term optimism for the world of bitcoin mining and green mining um and there and that that's the tl dr um so okay all right here we go you know it's what's interesting about this of you know of course uh i i could see bitcoiners wanting to get ahead of the narrative and you know saying this is dirty hash power going to clean of course we've made the point that like hey you know it's super clean is proof of stake is not consuming 9.9 reduction in energy use um but that aside what's interesting about this is it is a a regime a nation-state-led regime cracking down on block validation through minors um what would this look like in an e-2 staking sort of world right right where you you you don't have these large servers like you know mining facilities consuming bundles of energy you've got a staking rig maybe at your house right like does the nation state does an authoritarian nation state crack down on that it feels a lot different to me right rather than a handful of companies you can go target like you're actively targeting your citizens crazy dystopian stuff to think about but like right there one thing to take away from this is that the footprint of bitcoin mining is always a liability it is never it is never what's the opposite of liability an asset it's never an asset it's it's a liability through and through and not only is the foot the physical footprint but like the energy consumption it doesn't matter if it's green or whatever or if it's like literally solar powered coming from a dyson sphere it's a footprint either way how many people are googling dyson sphere right now anyways energy consumption liability um that's why we like proof of stake because you can stake your ethereum node through tor and i mean if you're a computer science expert you can stake inside of china and they'll never find out um not advice though this is not don't listen to me is it like this is not a big deal though for bitcoin i don't think like miners leave from china they go elsewhere right there's a hash drop maybe but we get some um more decentralization out of it all good sure all good seems like good good trade but like not an asymmetric trade just like positive linear trade but it's not moving the needle over the long term there you go all right let's talk about this ethereum stuff cuban is investing in polygon that's our friend mark cuban who's been on the podcast before i was a polygon user and i find myself using it more and more he said an email so what does he do he invests it's a pretty big name to draw into a sidechain layer two type project kind of cool yeah and again once again it's always really cool to see mark cuban using this stuff and i i kind of feel like that's been the through line of polygon over the last month is like oh people just find themselves on polygon because of reasons uh you know they buy it cheaper gas fees like you know ave on polygon poly like matic token yield farming and then all of a sudden like oh i guess i should just buy this because it's real estate it's real estate it's a suburb of manhattan and if people are there people want the real estate and so that's why they're buying matic token that's definitely the narrative uh let's talk about this you see that wall street journal front page like i i don't even think it's the headline the headline is upstart peer-to-peer crypto exchange takes aim at coinbase who are they talking about wall street journal finally talking about uniswap right but this picture dude is hilarious describe this picture for people it's not the headline that's the headline it's the picture that's the headline and this headline the head the real headline is uh bankers meet your worst enemy a nerd a nerdy work looking white guy in a in a unicorn t-shirt hayden adams is coming to destroy your banks like oh my god yes like me i hate your worst enemy a software developer on top of ethereum it's good didn't ask for permission just built this thing yep you know two years later it's already threatening the banks making the wall street journal doing hundreds of millions in transaction revenue annualized how many assets on there 50 000 different assets like crazy stuff i love it i love these types of headlines hayden adams is like hey banks that's a nice tvl you got there it would be a shame if somebody came and took it yeah hey nasdaq nice volume guys oops oops it's all on you to swap now [Laughter] ah too fun all right this is fun too nft.gamestop.com.gamestop.com it's the url gamestop is entering the nft game entering the blockchain game they're doing so on ethereum it looks like with ethereum branding what's this why what's happening here do we yeah i i copied that address and i put it into the ether scan and it's got a gamestop token that people are trying to interact with a contract address but uh nothing's happening i don't know what that is but importantly this is just a landing page nfc.games.com and it says we are building a team we welcome exceptional engineers solidity react python designers gamers marketers and community leaders if you want to join our team send your profile or something you've built to nft nf team okay nftea at gamestop.com out to matt finestone for leading this goddamn charge with gamestop congratulations for landing that gig matt feinstone formerly at loopering is the guy that is leading the nft charge into gamestop fun fact gme is the only asset that i own that's not a crypto asset and the reason why i buy it was 100 a political reason i bought it i i bought one share at like 330 which is like literally the top when it first pumped and i was like oh i like clued into the story right like you know the hedge funds that's what we got after the headshot right yeah literally bought it as a like i'm doing my part uh and then it dropped to like a hundred and like thirty dollars and i bought you bought two more bought double down and now right in this moment it's time the short squeeze is on again and so the the price of gamestop right now is at like 240 or something uh and the fact that it's happening during this nft release is so perfect it's so awesome let's see what the actual current price is right now 240 dollars right this is david getting addicted to the wall street bed stuff different show it's no longer going to be d fight game stop we're adding a game stop section back into the weekly rollups anyways uh uh matthew feinstein congratulations for leading this nft team if you like nfts and you want to help out gamestop uh squeeze the out of some shorts uh go sign up for them and help them build out nfts in the world of gaming you know whatever it's going to be built on if if matt's involved it's going to be on a roll-up of some sort so we got that look to look forward to and maybe the gme community will start to wake up uh and wall street bets community will start to wake up and join a defy i think there's a kindred spirit there that hasn't been tapped into all right let's talk bitcoin stuff michael saylor did he buy bitcoin this week no that's not the headline he probably did but yeah he probably did but he is uh hosting with elon musk a bitcoin miners in north america sort of council i guess yeah mining council not cartel sir not council different differences different okay so uh what's this about this is like a handshake with elon musk sort of thing from michael saylor i get that what is the mining council overall i'm wary that like elon musk is still talking about bitcoin stuff and dabbling in the bitcoin world but i'll i'll patiently wait to see this play out elon musk says spoke with north american bitcoin miners they committed to publish current and planned renewable usage to ask miners ww don't know what that is to do so potentially promising um world uh ask miners worldwide to be more green so this is a this is a rebranding exercise like hey bitcoin miners like we're going to get f'ed by mainstream media and public opinion about the dirtiness of bitcoin so we've got to do something about it we got to get green and so then michael taylor retweets this and says the miners have agreed to form the bitcoin mining council to promote energy usage transparency and accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide this is in my mind a capitulation on the green energy narrative where we have people like green nick carter who is fighting and saying bitcoin mining is way more green than you think it is and it's actually going to incentivize like completely renewable green energy really tall order for trying to get that narrative to stick and i can't really even though nick carter has been doing a valiant effort and like praise nick carter like saint nick carter it's not working it's not working uh and so michael and elon musk are capitulating and say like all right we're going to have to take bitcoin mining and not passively just say that the narrative is green but like we're actually going to have to make this green okay well the council of bitcoin miners is somewhat disturbing and different throughout yeah okay here's another through line then this is from uh mariano so i think he's doing some satire here but like maybe coming to a future near you is sort of the angle in quotes after careful consideration your address has been flagged as suspicious by the north american bitcoin miners association unfortunately for you our decision is final and cannot be appealed thank you for using bitcoin trademark powered by tesla registered trademark this is mariano's take clown like a possible like future right like you may not disagree with this but the fact that a uh cabal is forming of bitcoin miners that is like not a couple of council ryan accountability council sir sorry um where did cabal start do they start as councils i don't know it's just blurry line they they start i mean star wars has taught us in the star wars was there like a council that showed evil yeah okay all right anyway this is not an evil council but mariano is not sure where this is going and it would be not a good thing if a set of miners could start censoring transactions or colluding in some way to make bitcoin a whole lot less decentralized right is that a possible future here or is that kind of i guess overplaying it yeah absolutely this is exactly going back to the conversation of footprint is a liability right because now my now miners are under the the nation state purview because they are completely just like open and known to the public entities by the nature of proof of work like you have kind of have to join this council and be a part of it right and all of a sudden that's a all these like decentralized minors are coming to become part of one single council like where's the decentralization there what that is just an attack vector it's like oh the united states government like wants to interact more aggressively with the bitcoin blockchain it'll just go to the bitcoin mining council and tell them to do exactly what they want them to do look man the problem is because you can't run a minor in your house can't run it's not profitable to do that so like like readers should know the same thing could happen with ethereum if we were only staking through crypto banks for instance coinbase and kraken and gemini and and uh binance and there was no ability or appetite or interest in running uh validating nodes like on a consumer laptop or maybe even the blockchain didn't have that capability be the same sort of attack vector same sort of attack vector that's why decentralization of these networks is so important mm-hmm anyways good job mariano there you go mario we made it not funny but it was funny all right it's not funny it's a funny joke it's not funny though like it's an existential threat to our industry i agreed yeah agreed um all right let's talk regulatory traditional finance businesses need to report crypto transfers that's what the us treasury is saying if you are an exchange or some sort of crypto business and there's a crypto transfer of more than 10k you have to report that to the irs a lot of tax news in the headlines it's tax season but the irs is definitely trying to crack down on people who are not reporting their gains or their crypto transactions i think that's partially where this is coming from uh this does not extend to individuals right now but it definitely does to businesses right this is like necklace always says like pay your taxes guys like it's all in the blockchain they're gonna find out don't fight that don't screw with it don't fight that fight but um yeah maybe a mark of things to come irs getting more serious about crypto definitely getting exchange transactions into the mix right the i want to draw this important point it's just ten thousand dollars in and out of reporting entities like businesses right so ten thousand dollars to coinbase to gemini to cash app whatever those entities have to report that ten thousand dollars uh you sending ten thousand dollars to your buddy directly peer-to-peer that's not what this is talking about um however there is uh there is something to say about this ten thousand dollar level i think this is also true for banks right so if you come and deposit ten thousand dollars into banks they they do a report as well saying like hey this person deposited ten thousand dollars wait do you have a bank story this week no you want to tell that story okay never mind here's a story i do want to tell and once again it's another nick carter story um the ten thousand dollar limit was set in the 70s where the real value of ten thousand dollars in like the 60s or 70s or whenever this law was created uh was roughly 65 000 now right and so this is a story of inflation as a hidden oppressive force upon the people where uh privacy used to be up to 65 thousand dollars in real terms just the big transactions just the big transactions 65 000 and like 65 thousand dollars not a lot of people send 65 000 even even people that like are you know just you know the average citizen at some point will send a 10 000 transaction yeah that's a car man you buy a car right exactly yeah yeah oh yeah i bought i bought a car earlier and it was over ten thousand dollars and so like that is now a reported transaction right because i bought a car it wouldn't have been in the 60s or 70s because i wouldn't have been buying a 65 000 car uh and so this is a hidden hidden oppressive anti-secrecy force by the nature of inflation because the threshold for what is getting reported is nominally the same ten thousand dollars but meaningfully it's getting lower and lower and lower and again we just printed like 29 of the outstanding us dollar supply in the last year and so if inflation picks up again like all of a sudden it's going to be like 500 not in real terms 500 transfers everything gets reported to like the all-seeing eye of cyron which is the the you know the nation state well let's see where this goes too right the fed possibility of a central bank digital currency i'm showing some like breaking news as of may 20th from cnbc they've been talking about a central bank digital currency for a while but like david what's different here is like this is coming directly from jerome powell like he issued a statement about this so it seems like the u.s is getting serious about it um but even if you don't think the us is getting serious about it if you're like yeah sure whatever um china is definitely serious about it and like i don't know i feel like it comes down to this david there's only going to be two types of money in the world both are going to be digital it's going to be central bank digital currency it's going to be crypto and one is going to be completely controlled non-sovereign by the nation state the other is going to be free and open and like those are the only two monies that we're going to have um it feels like it's all inevitable you have a different take i think the whole possibility of issuing is like oh yeah okay like i'm going to continue to sit on my hands we've been we've talked about this the last time we talked about cbdc's on the weekly rollup which is like over a month ago we haven't talked about in a while but like again like at some point this is a meme like point taken that jerome powell is saying this but again possibility of issuing whatever i just think china makes the u.s react in some way but there is a different take on this which is the brian brooks uh take and he said this even coinbase earlier this week he's like hey the us approach is not going to be to develop a central bank digital currency it's going to be let the private market do it right like his take is let usdc and consortiums and like crypto bank digital currencies thrive and there shouldn't be a centralized um like federal reserve back digital currency so we'll have to see how it plays out it's almost like de facto kind of happening right with some of these stable coins preferable to crypto dollars crypto dollars crypto dollars all right this is interesting uh crypto fighting back um banks coinbase hires a former goldman sachs executive as chief policy officer we've seen exchanges in crypto banks hiring people from washington uh now we're seeing them hire literal bankers to run their policy offices what does this have what's happening here old boss same as the new bot or new boss same as the old boss right like that that's why the hayden adams on the front of wall street journal is so deadly because that's the new thing that's what's new thank you crypto banks buying regulate like bankers and regulating bankers whoever regulates bankers same thing same thing we've seen since the dawn of time like buying your way into into just like a positive regulations that's beneficial for your industry like same same same like new banks same as all banks cool i i don't trust it and i totally don't trust it um yeah that's definitely the take i do think that crypto banks and exchanges are super useful now they can serve as a bridge some some will uh benefit decentralization but others will actively take it away and try to centralize and we'll become a new boss if we don't fight back with this decentralized money system hayden adams on the front page yeah that's what we like to see that's the new stuff protocols not bankers software developers not regulators cipher punks not nation states let's drive some ultra let's do some drive-bys here paypal is going to let people withdraw crypto that's a big step hopefully we get robin hood on board next robin hood let's get with it yeah they're not listening though they don't listen to bank lists they definitely don't what's this one apple looking for crypto experience in alternative payments job post apple payments unit looking for a crypto savvy biz dev specialist to lead partnership efforts i i know apple is really doubling down on their apple pay ecosystem and the problem with payments is a lack of settlement assurances the reason why there's like two like one to three percent on visas and mastercards is because they don't have settlement insurances and one of the reasons that uh one of the big um benefits of apple pay and google pay is that you have you have some sort of assurances that the actual payer is who they say they are because they own the device positive settlement insurances as a feature of crypto assets is really really awesome and beneficial towards all payment providers everywhere so apple doesn't need to depend on visa they can use what like stable crypto dollars on ethereum or on more likely on ethereum l2 um that's that's my take that maybe that's completely not what's happening here but that is a logical conclusion of where this could go they definitely will get here eventually um a vc firm one confirmation whom we've had on the podcast great great folks raised another 125 million for their third fund they are now an 800 million dollar asset manager super impressive best of luck to one confirmation uh that's going straight into d5 i know that it's going straight to crypto i know that and what's this next one david goldman starts coinbase coverage with buy rating sees more than 30 percent gain uh coin did not really do so well since it initially got listed it's taken a beating it's down in the 200 price range where it started it opened up at like 350 or something um but goldman sachs says coin is a buy and i would agree there you go all right guys we're going to be back with some hot takes and of course the meme of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency

breninski he says this the more vested interest in existing systems a person has the more likely they are to be in quotes skeptical of crypto keep this in mind as you read expert opinions david is chris talking about bag bias here that's what that's like the colloquial crypto name for it bag bias right like you you only care about your bags and you only talk about those and seems like he's saying that hey people in the traditional finance they have bad bias towards traditional assets what's your take right yeah so this is just cognitive dissonance uh classic uh if you and your industry is about to be disrupted by crypto you're gonna hate it and you're gonna talk it and you literally can't buy it you can't buy the thing that's going to disrupt you because you can't legitimize it right so you have to talk poorly about it and i see the same sort of effect when people miss out on bitcoin like going from like a hundred dollars to sixty thousand dollars and they say it's a ponzi scheme it's like bad for the environment i'm never gonna buy bitcoin because of these reasons and and like the real answer is like you're just upset that you missed the run and you're refusing to buy into it now like and so now you're justifying why you're not buying it right uh chris is talking about something more like institutionalized right like so bankers uh you know what all the all the industries that crypto's about to disrupt you literally can't leave baby boomers right don't lose all of their money in the stock market like warren buffett charlie munger those types of you can't listen to the powers that be because literally crypto is about disrupting the powers that be with new institutions so you can't listen to the old constitutions let me flip that on you though okay because somebody from outside would say yeah shut up david because you're talking your bags too not what you do every week on bankless absolutely movies it's a giant ponzi it's a giant ponzi game you just want people to buy they have a point there totally totally bag bag bias through and through you guys listen to bank list you're listening to two no literally no one can not talk their bags but to some degree like the reason why i'm invested in ether is for reasons and i think they are good reasons and so to some degree there's at least one person or like one realm of thought that is the correct thought and there are bags to go with that thesis there is a correct thesis out there and there are assets that fall in line with that that thesis and that's why bankless is a thesis first media company protocol sync thesis uh you know legitimacy uh money legos like we believe these things why would we not hold eth right like we would be we would be biased in the worst direction right if every week we were talking about bitcoin and ethereum and d5 and we didn't have any skin in the game in these assets right like that's bad bias working against you i think what you want to have is long-term bag bias here not short-term games not pump and dump long-term bag bias that's what's that's what's called for here the other thing i'll say david is like people like one thing i say is you know um first buy some bitcoin and eath spend the next six months figuring out why they're useful and some people have said well like why buy first shouldn't you figure out why they're useful first like actually no buy a little bit first because once you actually purchase some you become more interested in learning right right like so i'm not saying go all in right away these assets but you have to have some skin in the game you have to have the incentive to learn you have to have the incentive to learn and uh crypto economics price number go up number go down provides great incentive to do that right so you can also have bag bias work in your favor if you want to learn about something right and like spend the time actually make it worth your while maybe go buy a little first yeah and figure out why it's why it's going up why it's going down like figure that out yeah totally the the best way to get over your cognitive dissonance about crypto assets is just to like capitulate and buy some uh i i had a friend who was uh giving me resistance as to getting into into ether like when ether was pumping from two thousand to four thousand dollars uh and so i i sent him like point one eth and i'm like okay here here's a small little gift you you can have this eath and he like loaded him up with metamask like put ethan in his wallet and all of a sudden his resistance to buying more eats just went out the window and so then he started dumping money into ether i'm like okay fine like that that's a it's a sacrifice the point one east sacrificed to the gods yeah no now we have converted an eighth person it's just put money it's not it's not a bad plan right like so even use this for defy tokens right okay defy defy uh protocol you like go use it see if it works oh cool it's useful it works well now maybe i'll buy a little bit and then i'll learn about it but like just a little bit you don't go all in on something but then that gives you an incentive to to learn more about the protocol i think that can work in your favor but uh yeah chris is right on there don't believe the media that you hear yeah so yeah tldr all the expert institutional experts that i know don't listen to bank lists just just by a little bit just by a little bit there you go um volatility volatility bad volatility good here's uh mipo crypto might be volatile but at least it doesn't need 120 120 billion injected into it every month just to function of course the the treasury the fed puts 120 billion these days into the us dollar market into the fiat the banking system crypto doesn't need that equity right and the reason why crypto functions is because no one can do that and that's why it works that's also why it's volatile it's also why it's fires yeah feature not a bug except the volatility uh oh here's here here here's an interesting take so okay uh this is for me but like i saw this from a proposal somebody in the wi-fi community basically put forward ban tag put a governance proposal forward in wire and yfi saying that hey guys we should use our wi-fi treasury to buy some eth because we want to own the land in which we operate and i don't know if you read this proposal david it's really great like goes through uh if you're a restaurant right you don't just want to own the restaurant necessarily you also want to own the land like around your restaurant right right that's like a develop only real estate foot traffic surface area like first like optimum real estate for where your restaurant is it's a one thing to have good food but you want to be where all the people are exactly and so he's like hey since we're here we should actually invest in real estate too what is that real estate for yfi well they're on ethereum so the real estate is eth so he made the case for the uh wi-fi community to go buy some eth put that in their treasury and my take was on on top of this is oh my god d5 protocols are going to be the michael sailors of eth david we're going to like buy all of this real estate a successful d5 protocol on ethereum then on ethereum's rollup uh infrastructure they want to own some eth in their treasury right so this is almost like the reverse ico remember the icos they would raise an eth and then they like so many of them would sell it this is like these aren't icos these are successful d5 protocols now they're going back to ethan they're like oh we want a piece of this ethereum economy we want this real estate too and we're going to pack our treasury with eth kind of cool i have there are so many takes to talk about uh first off here's some some uh recent cryptoculture uh that many people might not be familiar with the whole few understand meme came from uh i think it came from pierre richard when pierre richard who's a big bitcoiner was like uh owning owning btc is owning a piece of internet real estate few understand and people were making fun of him because like how ridiculous of a comparison is owning btc to owning internet real estate because you know in bitcoin maxi land literally uh bitcoin is the internet right is the currency of the internet so if you own a bitcoin you own a piece of the internet what ethereum is is literally the decentralized internet btc is an asset on a proof of work network ethereum is the internet tech stack in a decentralized fashion and is literally a piece of the internet and so the whole so many things that the bitcoiners say about bitcoin are actually true about ethereum it's crazy but like ether as an asset is a piece of internet of equity in the ethereum network which is literally the reconstruction of a decentralized internet literally real estate yeah i i feel like that's true like what the corners say about ethereum is like but it's also true of of bitcoin too it's just like more true of ethereum i think somebody asked you recently david like um i i saw this a tweet from you i asked about like hey uh david um okay because we're gonna have somebody uh preston press and push preston push from the bitcoin community we're gonna talk about bitcoin and ethereum and like uh differences and similarities between the networks and somebody asked you like hey uh you've had your your bitcoiner hat on to you before you have a podcast where you regularly talk uh to a bitcoin or you're sort of the theory and he's kind of the bitcoiners like david what are your takeaways from that and you just said this it was like one line like bitcoin is dope eth is doper it's kind of that's it that's it bitcoin's great ethereum's just really cool and it's a little bit cooler like it's fine it's kind of how i feel too okay take takes on this take are not done because i want to uh show some uh a pre a piece of uh david's uh previous writing and ryan do you have that that pulled up next is that um i can which one is it oh the uh money money money game okay yeah set this up for us yeah okay so i wrote this piece in uh in 2019 uh this is not too long after d5 pulse came out uh and so i wrote this uh this piece called the money game landscape and talking about how defy apps are all in heavy competition to put eth on the balance sheet balance sheet right and uh did i did i have is there a screenshot of d5 plus yeah okay so here's here's og defy pulse um and i use this as a as a metaphor of like this is literally the leader board of ethereum is like you know at this point in time maker had 1.9 million eth in it so maker at the lead of 1.9 million points and what is money other than a point system of who is owed what value right money is money is a point system and of the all the d5 apps on ethereum are competing to put ether on the balance sheet because ether is the most credibly neutral points on the in the ethereum world and so we now see yearn which wasn't even an application when i wrote this piece saying like hey we wanna we want some of that ethereum real estate like we're gonna put some eth on the balance sheet and i'm like yes this is the money game landscape every single application is in a competition to get high scores and that high score is scored in ether it's scored in both uh total locked value of ether but then also like purchasing it on their on their balance sheet so like yeah both these places um that article is held up by the way 2019. david you're thinking ahead man it's coming true all right the other way that that held up is yield farming uh big game to collect tvl yes now we're seeing that game on layer two i think pretty soon player two summer later two summer happening all right this is another take tyler reynolds eath is circled on the left non-cash flow alts circled on the right for people are listing on the podcast you might need to describe this what are we looking at david yeah this is a pretty classic chart in the crypto space it looks like it's the classic here's what a classic bubble looks like right and so we have like this stealth phase where you know things are you know only true believers are there but then like things start to bubble up and then there's this awareness phase and there's a mania and a blow-off top phase and then there's the absolute crash this is the 2017 bubble this is the 2013 bubble this is the tech.tech.com bubble uh and so uh what uh what was circled on the left is ether in its first sell-off slash a bear trap phase but then on the right is like you know the non-cash flow assets i will always also say these are like the doggy tokens right doggy tokens are in their bull trap phase as in like there's like this uh you know blow off top uh small crash a little bit of a recovery but those things are those things are dying those things are not coming back non-capital you don't think they're coming back meme coins uh i mean i'm not 100 convicted in this but i do believe that uh there's a different there's a massive discrepancy between tokens with real underlying lying value and real cash flows versus you know doggy tokens uh doggy tokens could have just had their day and then they're never coming back ether is in a different phase of the cycle and the reason why we say this is because there's a significantly different cohort of people that are putting money into crypto right now institutions and big money are not putting money into doggy tokens they're putting money into btc and eath and defy assets all all the meme coins like you know cardano's like you know dentacoins like whatevers those things are not getting allocations right now like not for or or ever and so that's what there's a completely massive fissure between the two cohorts of people that are buying these two classes of assets this reminds me kind of of the uh the super cycle asset the crypto super cycle thesis that the three arrow skies were talking about which is like you might have bulls and bear markets for specific classes of assets right but crypto their thesis anyway or this idea is crypto is never going to globally go into a massive bear zone where you've got like 80 to 90 off all-time highs i don't know if i believe that but it's it it's kind of the idea similar idea of what you're saying is like yeah some assets might be in uh crypto assets where the general market calls all of these like all of this crypto might never come back after this most recent crash while others well to other assets it might be just a temporary dip and then a recovery so on different timelines is sort of the idea here totally all right let's go to the next one rethinking work is this a job description what is this job description yeah this is i think this is uh originally pioneered by amin solimani who made a job posting of forever go for spank chain for a meme lord uh and get coin is following in the suit meme artist slash poster plus community manager remote full-time job 80 to 120 thousand dollars and the uh nat uh nat is retweeting this image and goes this is a six figure meme making job at a legit company no matter how silly your kid's interest seemed don't ever tell them that they should give up give them up for a real job rethink what work is work is different now like memory and memes like c cmos chief marketing officers are now chief memory officers right like get get your company with the times get yourself a meme lord on your company's marketing team and a community manager uh that's rethink the future of work it's being done at home is being done from the comfort of your own computer and is being done with memes and community management and just engagement with your with the people that pay attention to your company this is just it memes are powerful right it's like i remember when the job description of like um i'll have to remember this social media manager came in vogue and people were like what paying to do facebook and paying to tweet like what is this it's not a real job well now meming is a real job apparently fun fact episode number five of the bankless podcast is all about memes one of the most underappreciated banquets podcast there is i think that is a fun fact a lot of fun all right this is udi our friend what's he doing he's tweeting about ether light is this new york times billboard new york square yeah billboard a billboard for etherlight.org don't times square don't go there to because th this is this is uh the reason why we're talking about this is because this is a psa of a there's a warning uh it's very scammy looking uh it's advertising basically what is an ico this is like 2017 ico nostalgia if you want to go and look at what an old old like 2017 ico kind of looks like that's what this is uh this is ooty calling them out by the way not advertising i'm just gonna make clear he's calling them out like this is sketchy this is sketchy as and they're advertising in times square right and so they're they're latching on to the tailwinds of ethereum and they're using a lot of ethereum words right so etherlight's network uh native token etl is used to run the network starting with the adopted proof of state consensus mechanism whereby etl is necessary for one to become a public validator node in addition etl is used for network governance and payment of fees very much in the using similar terminology as ethereum proof of stake it's got ether lite as the name it's got is trying to get you to deposit your ether in order to get etl i'm willing to bet that it's actually an erc20 token on ethereum don't fall for scams like this scams like this are coming they target new people who don't know what they're targe listening to they they think that they can get a thousand x gains this is what this is what an ico looked like in 2017 that was scammy and terrible so psa there are monsters out there and they're trying to gobble up your ether be wary of people that are trying to convince you to part with your ether and your other monies well said david be careful out there guys it's time for what we're excited about david let's start with you what are you excited about man what am i excited about uh oh yeah swap you're gonna swap v3 you thought v3 is sick as  okay so we have uh amin solomoni who tweeted this week we're not gonna we're not gonna um pull up and pull up the tweet but we're gonna talk about something else in a second where amin solomoni says uh i j uniswap v3 is lit af earned five thousand dollars on a 350 000 concentrated position a 250 range between ethan uscc in 16 hours so he made five thousand dollars off of 350 000 in 16 hours earned about the same on 10x the capital with ethiopia on a wide 4k position over the same period this is definitely the future robert lesner is just talking also about how uh unispot v3 is cool af i love uniswap v3 he says and here here's what is really cool about unispot b3 ryan go to that liquidity page right next to it this is this is what so many people uh is it not letting you do that there you go there you go this is this is why so many people are uh excited about unit swap e3 yeah let's zoom in on that this is like uh this is the new order book this is how you order back yeah like the cn tower right it's like mm-hmm except just one pinnacle up instead of order books looking like a v this looks like an upside down v uh and you can see where people are placing their liquidity on at different price ranges and so ryan if you press that plus sign you we can even like zoom in more and more and more but this is the game that people are playing so this is the new liquidity profile for each usdc in unit swap v3 because each one of these each people have different uh ranges that they add liquidity to uh this like this kind of chart where there are specific liquidity across different ranges get used to that chart that's the new future this is a new paradigm inverse order books uh based on on concentrated liquidity positions inside of amms that is the future of liquidity it worked v3 just surpassed v2 you know swap v3 surpassed v2 this week uh in terms of trading volume pretty impressive man and i keep i keep on using unison i mean i use uniform almost every single day and more often than not i'm continuing seeing more and more times where the better price is on unit swap v3 people are figuring it out and they're figuring it out quick yeah absolutely ryan what are you excited about you know what i'm going to say layer two summer later i'm excited about i'm excited about summer time i you know we we said this a little bit in the last podcast but i i think it's absolutely true finance chan polygon showed the appetite and is showing the appetite for evm scalability enterprise virtual machine scalability defy scalability now we've got arbor trim coming optimism coming in july this is summertime all of these side chains roll-up chains they're going to have liquidity incentive programs the the major d5 program protocols will have liquidity incentive programs on top of that it feels very much to me like it could be a setup of the previous defy summer where i remember that in may uh we talked with uh dan elliser about this new thing what was it compound governance token oh interesting question field farming yeah and then explosion right um there there is a setup for layer two to absolutely explode and i think it's because this time it's not like a hypothetical how how should we scale ethereum type of of solution like like do you remember plasma in 2017 it's always like plasma's coming state channels are coming this is how we'll scale ethereum no this time it's different these rollups are launching with partners with d5 protocols right like it might take some time to get the king cell but i think some of these launches will happen this summer and it's setting up for a pretty exciting summer like a tidal wave tsunami type of summer layer two protocols mt solution and importantly uh optimism and arbitrary they have tokens they are going to have tokens that control over this system and everyone's gonna have tokens and this is real estate right this is really important critical real estate that everyone's going to want a piece of and it's important both optimism and arbitrage are very very true to the nature of an ethos of ethereum and decentralization and crypto at large and so they need to figure out a way to get these tokens that are in extremely high demand out and proliferated and have high entropy and get that the ownership of the asset also decentralized you know that the way they do that ryan yield farming distribute it exactly exactly distribute it so get like bankless nation get your farms ready because like here's the thing yeah your farms will have farms this summer farms on farms on farms but here here's the thing that also will happen okay guys before you get too over hyped is um if player two summer happens d5 summer happens it's going to like uh shoot way higher than it should like valuations and token prices will probably overextend like things always do in crypto and then maybe months later i'm not sure uh there will be a crash there will be a pullback as well right so like again you gotta approach these things from a long-term perspective as well but i think it makes sense to get started try these protocols out this is the next frontier right so like we have bitcoin first frontier we have ethereum second frontier we have d5 third frontier uh next frontier fourth frontier is layer two go explore on layer two yeah yeah defy on layer two go explore guys that's the message i'm excited about that get your farms ready and and i think the alpha that i think is true is that it's going to be much better to farm these tokens than it is going to be to purchase these tokens farm that go farm them don't buy them farm them except for taxes is that true yeah oh yeah because you can tax on income right mm-hmm anyway yeah not fun anyway all right memes david which meme are we looking at we are looking at a four panel meme we have an angry pigeon being offered a cracker and that pigeon is yelling at that cracker and that pigeon is btc maxis bitcoin maxis and that cracker is defy and the pigeon is yelling get that thing out of my face and then of course because it's a pigeon it eats the cracker and so it noms on the cracker a little bit and then it has this uh-oh moment this awakening moment these eyes go wide moment again all of a sudden it falls in love with the cracker uh and you would you might think that this is a political meme as in we are we are telling bitcoin maxis that they need to love defy it's kind of true but they can still be bitcoin maxies you can still be a bitcoin maxie and use defy and in that same vein that we were talking about cognitive dissonance where like bitcoin maxies want to on on d5 because it's a threat they feel it as a threat to bitcoin you don't have to you don't have to feel that you can use defy your i know that you're not the only asset that you own is bitcoin you also have cash in the bank see what it's like to go lend out that cash and return an interest rate while also yield farming matic tokens on polygon or something right you can use defy and still be a bitcoin maxi it's not blasphemous it's okay also look guys bitcoin is the original defy like i believe that i see that all the time peer-to-peer trans you know uh no intermediary transmission of value that is defy right but like don't just stop there right go try out the full spectrum of defy and i think what this meme is saying is like you might fall in love with it might fall in love with d5 plus you can you can use some versions of i know it's compromised wbtc like run btc whatever you don't have to use all of your bitcoin bags but you can still have bitcoin denominated yield farming on d5 go try it out bitcoin bitcoin could still be your store value all right guys we are going to lead out with a moment of zen clip so stick around for that especially if you're on youtube but first disclaimers none of this was financial advice eth is risky bitcoin is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot and now the moment of zen guys these scam coins are getting so out of hand someone just showed me this today 27 trillion in circulation unlimited supply cap there's only one node so it's completely centralized 25 of the supply has been minted in the past six months and last but not least the top one percent of holders own 30 of the supply now i'm just kidding that's not a coin that's the us dollar hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how
