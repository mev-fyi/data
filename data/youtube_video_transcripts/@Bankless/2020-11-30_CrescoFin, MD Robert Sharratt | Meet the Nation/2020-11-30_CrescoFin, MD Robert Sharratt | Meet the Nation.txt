robert sherritt robert is the managing director of cresco finn and cresco finn is a very interesting project that me and ryan have hopped on the board of advisors for so we're very excited about the future of this project it is super aligned with the bankless thesis it's super aligned with the protocol sync thesis and so we are we are interested in seeing cresco finn come into the world successfully because um it is an instantiation of the values that we talk about on the bankless program so robert welcome to the nation that's great thanks for you know thanks for having me here so robert maybe we can start at the very beginning uh before cresco finn uh how did cresco finn come to exist and and why as a project and as an endeavor does it interest you well it started essentially because um we didn't like banks very much you know i mean like most people don't but you know my partner and i here in switzerland and you know bank interest rates went negative a couple years ago and you know nobody likes their bank anyway but then to be told by your bank that they're going to charge you for holding your own money in the bank like in addition to all the fees and everything else like you know basically you're going to lose money every day i mean it's like it's just it's just shocking right i mean negative interest rates are here in switzerland in europe japan i mean you know could potentially be coming the united states as well so so the two of us thought like how can we live without banks you know so that was that was the start of it i mean you know it wasn't just kind of coincidental that it uh it really ties together with your your bankless philosophy so robert um just curious because you've called yourself a uh a banker before or like maybe you're a reforming banker maybe a recovering banker we might say can you tell us a little bit about kind of your background in banking both yourself and uh your fellow co-founder and how like that's kind of shaped how you think about banks today and what you're trying to achieve with cresco yeah you know i definitely was i mean i started i spent most of my career as a banker you know and it uh you know somebody joked they said it takes a thief to catch a thief so i don't quite see it exactly like that but there were some shocking things when i was a when i was a young banker i mean like i just graduated from business school and so i was in my mid-20s and i was working for my big global bank in russia which is like a long way from home and we were making a loan to to a russian company and there just wasn't enough money in the subsidiary to make the loan like suppose the loan was like for a hundred we had like five in a subsidiary and you know i'm a young guy and curious and i i just kept asking like where does the money come from like does it come from depositors i mean but it can't really i mean do we send it from london does it go through the russian central bank and finally the treasurer like pulled me aside and he's like he's like listen kid like i make a you know i open a loan account and then i create a deposit account for the borrower and then i type in uh the amount of money that we're gonna give them and that's their money and i was like you know you you're kidding me like it's like it's just shocking like it's it's you only see it i think if like you see it really in raw places like if you sit in like new york or london or or here in geneva you know the money just comes from treasury and and people don't even think they don't stop most people don't stop and think what is money and to see it so like you know just transparently which you only really would see in a you know in an emerging market you know it was was incredible for me to see i mean i was doing emerging markets investment banking and so i saw repeatedly in russia and china like just how money is created by by banks and you know it's just that's what leads people eventually to things like bitcoin right because you realize it's hard money it can't just be printed and it leads you to the idea that we've got which is essentially doing more than just holding hard money but actually trying to compete with deposit banking and and the way to do that is is through smart contracts running on ethereum so that's the that's what that's the genesis of it i guess and so at one point did did defy kind of work its way into your brain and you and your partner's brain like how did how did you guys when you guys first saw defy was that like the the golden aha moment as like oh this can replace banks or like what did it take for really understanding like the relationship with defy and and what you and the problem that you guys are trying to solve well d5 did for d5 did for sure but just in general like open permissionless you know blockchains that's that's just so different than the siloed black boxes that are all proprietary data and you know the only way i mean banking is like kind of the last industry essentially to be touched by technology like some fintechs have done a a great job of you know nibbling around the edges things have gotten better i mean you know but it's still built on the old text stack i mean once you see like you know once you see the possibilities of the new technology stack like like building on ethereum like it just it just blows you away right and and things are happening so quickly so you know i'm not i mean i'm i'm a little bit technical i do some you know coding but i'm not like a hardcore programmer and so i came across this because i was looking for a solution to how how to basically replace banks and there's just there's no option there's no possibility to do it other than in crypto like the the banking guild is essentially built with moats around it over hundreds of years you just it just can't attack it you you have to do something different so this is where i'm excited the two of you will come on board and advise us because you need people from outside the industry who can reimagine essentially a relationship with a money and a relationship with banks so you know we we built on we built on this new on this new tech stack on on crypto allows us to go global essentially we have this way of making our money that is in the real it's in the real world and we get it insured because the only way you can compete with banks is to have that psychological advantage neutralized because everybody thinks it's safe in the bank i mean it's not really safe in the bank if you if you really really delve into it but everybody thinks it is so we use we use essentially matched funding plus blockchain plus insurance uh to compete with banks okay so cresco finn is not a bank however it does feel like a bank right like that's kind of it's a it's a supposed role to its customers it's supposed to like act act and feel like a bank but in in the background something totally different is happening so maybe you can just go into details about you know let's actually let's start at the very beginning like what is cresco finn and how is it similar or different to a bank well i think you know that's absolutely right and you know what what we do what we do essentially is we provide the same benefits as as a bank so but it's just much better with us because we cut out the bank so we make sure the risk is the same because with us the risk is insured and by cutting out the bank essentially by using you know a blockchain stack we were able to offer much higher rates of return than a bank can and it's only really recently been possible like you talk about the rise of d phi and you know crypto it's only in the last few years that you could actually really do this and then you need to be in you need to be in a place that's properly regulated as well because switzerland has very clear stable like regulations in terms of crypto and it's it's very welcoming so what we did is we we do essentially a similar thing to banks do but it's matched funding so we don't create we don't create money and so we match together essentially excess capital with you know uses in the real economy and we do that by our um we do we do it by matching contracts so contracts that exist in the real economy basically one of the amazing things that we do is we convert them into smart contracts that can run on that can run on blockchain and so we use what we have is called a proof of delivery mechanism so it just ensures that whatever is being sold essentially by the seller to the buyer is proven it's written to this you know it's written to this you know giant open record book that anybody can anybody can look at and verify and both the seller and the buyer agree that if it's written essentially to chain then that's the truth and they pay on that basis and if they don't pay we've uh we've got insurance so we've actually we've spent a lot of time between our regulator and lloyd's insurance in london and you know the people that we have essentially using this because we only deal with major companies like investment grade investment grade companies so anyway we we squeeze a lot more out of the financing and it it helps people make their money work harder for them that that was our original idea like we really sat down we're kind of like we're pissed off savers basically we're like sick of like the bank like telling us that they're going to charge us to have our money in the bank i mean it's it's ridiculous when you think about it we thought like you know we thought we'll try this ourselves we'll build this ourselves we try and make it work with our money so we invested a lot of our own time and money into this to make it work and then we tested it with our own money to make sure nobody else would would be at risk and you know it worked really well we got a bit of a track record for it and then we opened to swiss institutions in the spring in may of this year 2020 and so you know it turns out you know it turns out like david and ryan that a lot of people don't like their bank like a lot of people are happy to go bankrupt not just like you're you know not just like you're individuals but like when you deal with like money managers and whatever you know the you know banks are nice in a sense they screw everybody equally unless you're kind of the one percent but you know if you're a money manager in geneva you're looking for yield just as much as like your average you know depositor holding an accountant like wells fargo in the united states so if we if we set up kind of the problem statement of what problem does cresco finn solve it's basically this it's it's uh if you are trump if you are trying to save money in particular your first market is kind of larger institutions swiss institutions money managers you're trying to save if you're trying to save your money and get some sort of yield from it you can't just deposit in a bank because as you said earlier you get negative rates you get almost nothing when you do that so people are hungry for yield and so what they can do with cresco finn at least on the institution side today is they can deposit their funds with you guys and you are able to generate a return uh for them and that return ranges like it's not a 10 or 20 return you know but it's a it's a three percent return let's say uh and so essentially you are providing a high yield savings account and there are a few things i guess you know i want to to dig into to make sure we understand it collectively at bankless is you know the first is it's an interest-bearing product right so that that kind of begs the question i think you were getting into it a little bit where does the interest come from so that's one question the other piece is it's also insured as you said robert so that's part of the value proposition so on the insurance side where does the insurance come from and how does that work so could you get into that for our our uh viewers how is the product actually generating interest uh and then what does insurance look like those two components appear to be the the primary value proposition here yeah that's a really good question ryan and you know you started off by saying who's it for well it's for savers we built it for ourselves like if you could build a bank just for savers you know or a bank alternative this is this is what you would build and you know we started essentially here in switzerland because we're based here we got it regulated here it's just easier to test it with like you know with a few people who have larger checks to to make sure it works but you know we always had in mind that other people are probably also going to be also going to be interested in it so we we wanted to do essentially what a bank does without being a bank with doing it in a much healthier way so we we do match funding we it's not fractional reserve like you know most people in the bitcoin ethereum crypto communities like you know when you talk about fiat and fractional reserve banking like that's put into the eagle category and quite rightly i can tell you as a former banker like it's just like you know it's very unhealthy for the economy it's very unhealthy for society so we thought like what if we design it differently because technology now allows us to operate differently so the idea is to be very safe we want to be we want to be a money lego that does one thing it's like safe it's really safe high interest savings and high interest compared to the traditional world so it's not like designed to be like something you put your money with us and you make like 100 x or something like that it's really the base layer it's uh we're competing with like deposit banking and globally that's a 60 trillion dollar market i mean it's just it's just enormous and so then we thought like this is our own money we we want to you know we want to get a return on and how do we do that we'll do the same as a bank does so you could consider lending your money but i don't really like lending because it's basically just a promise to repay and you have to trust somebody else that they're going to repay i mean what's what's much better in our view is to have an asset and so what happens at the start of any business relationship is that you have a contract between a seller and a buyer and so we thought that could be perfect and so what we did is we we worked together with the tech team essentially to apply smart contract technology to old world contracts and so what happens is you know in the industries that we work in which is like staffing we do some commodities we do trade stuff we do telecoms we do a few of these industries which are actually can have very simple inputs and so the input to the smart contract is basically has it been delivered and so that's our proof of delivery that's written to chain the seller and the buyer agree that if it's written to chain then it's been it's been delivered and then the buyer pays typically in 30 days i mean it's just it's just a very standard business contract like rather than waiting like the old world has sliced things up into different tranches of like you know debts and equity and whatever and we're just like forget it like i just want to own an asset and so we essentially produce the invoice ourselves our technology does so you can't fraudulently create it because it comes from us and then we buy it at a discount and so we own it like we we actually physically own that right to be paid by you know the big guy by the by the major company in 30 days and if they don't if they don't pay uh the insurance pays and so it turns out that if you if you combine this if you combine match funding with blockchain technology within with insurance you know you you cut out all that fat from the bank and you just do it in a you do it in a technology way like a real crypto way so and and we do it in the real world so it it actually provides a bridge we hope between traditional finance and and crypto it's just it's just such a better model than than the legacy banking model like i mean it's safer and savers get a lot more out of it so so that's the that's the that's the whole idea behind it and insurance you ask where does it come from it comes from it all comes from the lloyd's insurance market uh in london so they've done a deep dive of how we work and obviously so is the so is the regulator and yeah we're really we're really pleased that like once people get into it they're like oh this this this this makes a lot of sense you know so got it so you know to to my attempt to summarize that robert is basically like um you know people think about accounts payable or accounts receivable like invoices in general right so one company might invoice another company and uh say it's payable net you know 90 days essentially right that is the asset in the case of cresco finn you guys sort of own this um promissory payment note as it were essentially and uh you provide the funding to the company in advance of that net payment term and that's where you generate the interest and that's the interest side of things and then they purchase it right they purchase it yeah the the right it's more than exactly that's right it's a bit more than just a promissory note it's actually legally owed to us so it's our asset and so so you own the asset yeah and you purchase it at a discount right and that's kind of where where you can generate yield right so you purchase it maybe maybe the invoice is for and three dollars and you purchase it for a hundred dollars is that right yeah that's right yeah that's right that's it that's it exactly and you know it has two things that we really love like one is we're the asset owner so if you make a loan to somebody and they don't pay then you have to go sue them you got to go to court you've got to go whatever we've designed this with our proof of delivery on chain that it's just crystal clear like it's all reported it's intended to be a legal contract on chain which is which is where i think ethereum is just amazing i mean i i think that is the radical advancement that we've got you know i think of it as kind of like nick sabo's original idea you know the cypherpunk who was like you know it's sometimes described as like the vending machine like you just put in your quarter and you get you get whatever the candy bar or something out of it like there's no discretion to it do you mean it just it happens automatically so we strip out all the old world like issues that you could have disputes you could have fraud you know i mean and and we own the asset and then the second thing that's really amazing is that it's um it's not like a loan so it's it's taxed differently i i mean it's it's genuinely the purchase of an asset and then the asset increases in value from say 100 to 103 like you say and you know so for tax purposes it's it's more advantaged it's it's better for it's better for us it's better for the depositor one because you're you're a legal asset owner and then in tax terms here in switzerland um there's no capital gains tax so uh so so and what you're also doing robert is you're putting these real world assets on chain effectively and then when we say on chain is that um are these assets on ethereum yet or is it more sort of a private um ledger that will eventually be on on ethereum yeah so we started we started doing it ourselves so we started we started with hyperledger fabric because it needed to be permissioned because we're because we're regulated we're transitioning it all over to uh ethereum now but it also still like it needs to be permissioned in the sense that like the seller and the buyer and the insurance company can see all can see all these details yeah what we're gonna do what we're gonna do on so anyway we're moving that we're moving that to ethereum it was a good it was a good test um and we're we're putting that on ethereum but on the depositor side we're also going to have accounts on chain so that's going to be and that's going to be in stable coins most of our businesses in is in dollars so we were starting with like us dollar stable points and we're really excited that like you know some like really serious d5 projects seem to seem to like our idea so we've got a partnership with ave and stani from ave who's just this you know super impressive guy amazing what he's built uh he's joined our board of advisors as well and he's uh he's i'm really i'm really so humbled by it he's been a great supporter and so yeah we've got a proposal in the ave governance forum essentially to create a regulated insured money market and so the idea is that it brings it brings the deep eye essentially like something that's very safe and it's something very it's something you know very very secure and it you know it pays a pace and it pays a decent amount of interest so yeah that's the plan so so let's uh let's talk about ave in in the background and so like you've got you guys are issu the governance proposal for ave is um trying to get a certain collateral or a certain um uh currency onboarded into ave right and so if this uh proposal goes through the ave governance then the uh what what happens for cresco finn like how does that change how you guys operate if this governance proposal goes through well what we're really excited about is essentially it's a it's a way it's a way to bring our real world assets that are also insured on chain into dde5 so it would create a money market in in ave that would be secured by these tokenized real world assets and also would have insurance coverage so there's obviously like you know there's obviously this movement from off chain to on chain that's why we've entered into a partnership with chain link to help us secure all that data and present it uh and present it on chain but the idea is that people will essentially be able to send in like usdc for example and get like a insured three percent rate of return which you know which is fairly favorable compared to like you know the die savings rate or some other savings rates in in crypto it's also long term so our rates stay the same they don't change day-to-day because they're based on long-term contracts in the in the real world or contracts they keep renewing so they they go on for yeah for for a long period of time so we're and because they're insured we're really hoping that it leads essentially to um the creation of a benchmark you know a benchmark rate like a benchmark yield curve in uh in crypto so the i the i crest token is that is that where you guys call it i crest yeah because it's insured okay so that's a that's a stable coin uh no that's the um that actually represents the insured collateral so essentially if we have like um but it is matt i mean it is essentially uh matched to the usdc so it is it is stable and so and now can it leave the avo ave ecosystem and just go around d5 maybe it could be collateral for for maker dao and if it's always if it's one token's always worth one dollar and it's a worth or or worth one dollars worth of claim on a real world asset to me i see a stable coin that seems like a stable coin to me yeah i guess that's right and we didn't particularly design it exactly as a stable coin but but yeah that's the that's the price and it's and it's 100 insured so uh and yes it is it is designed to be composable i mean it's really designed to be used throughout um yeah throughout defy so robert in the first time it's ever been done so it's you know it's got it's it's got its challenges to it but it's um you know we spent a lot of time working on it with ave and chain link's been amazing and um yeah so we worked on it for a long time before we presented the proposal and i think it's really exciting so this is a it's kind of a new primitive a token primitive that you guys are introducing you called it a money lego uh robert this i this idea of an eye crest that's backed by this real world collateral and in the future are um people going to be able to kind of dig into icress itself and look at all of the various collateral that is backing it on chain yeah that's absolutely the idea so that's that's the intention so that's where chain link is helping us with their proof of reserves which essentially allows you on chain to look at exactly what you've got so you know we designed the company from day one to be totally transparent and that's why it was all you know it was all transparently written in the chain the seller could see it the buyer could see it the insurance company could see it it's it's totally different than when you get in the you know in the old world of of banking where everything's a total secret and so the eye credits essentially what we're putting on chain is design that you can see exactly what that's matched to so you can see that you have like you know that you have fully collateralized assets that equal one you know usd uh c essentially and give a three percent rate of return and not only that like not only can you see the assets but you can also see that you're you're the beneficiary of the insurance policy so if there ever was a problem uh you wouldn't be you know you'd be fully covered by buying insurance so you you almost have like a double security you have security because you own the because you own the assets just like in the real world you have the security that the the major investment grade company is going to pay for that and then you have a double level of security because if they don't pay then yeah then the insurance market pays so this is this is what we've developed as the you know the best we can come up with as an alternative to traditional banks so one thing that's so cool about open finance and d5 we say it's it's kind of like the ability in your browser to go right click and view source right and then when you do that you see all of the code of the website that you just loaded um open finance and defy if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and device producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well that you just loaded open finance and defy brings that functionality to assets so i can like right click if you will on icress and do a view source in the future and see all of the collateral that backs icress in something like ether scan right so i get to see it's fully transparent the source collateral is fully transparent to to anyone who is who is looking up the asset i and i think we've seen like hints of that already in um in d5 and the ability to do that i want to get back to the the insurance really quick just to tie that off so you said you'd be able to also see um the insurance information on chain as well and that an owner of icrest is the beneficiary of that and like so how does how does that part work how does the lloyd's part of function if i right click and like view source of icress what what what do i see from an insurance perspective so the idea is what we're going to do is we're going to put a summary of the insurance policy on chain so if you right click you can see you can see it and it makes clear that you essentially as the as the owner are named as the lost payees that's what they call it an insurance so basically you have like that you're the beneficiary of the insurance policy so if there's a problem with the assets that you see you you're covered as uh as the laws pay and it's basically it's attached together to the yeah to the token so that that's the that's the concept so the friend of the podcast nick carter uh beats the drum on proof of reserves except he does it for bitcoin right because he think he understands bitcoin as a cryptographic technology and exchanges like coinbase or kraken they have the ability uh to do proof of reserves where they can attest to their reserves and make sure and to signal to the world that they are fully solvent i listened to a podcast on on the on the brink podcast that he did of this team that was trying to do proof of reserves for bitcoin and they had this technology stack where they would do these merkle trees and these cryptographic signatures and just these attestations of of uh cryptographically approved attestations of their reserves and after understanding ethereum ethereum is a bunch of merkle trees with cryptographic signatures except the difference is it's in the chain rather than external to the chain and so this is what me and ryan get really excited about is like natively on ethereum we can do proof of reserves and that's what gets us really excited about cresco fan is cresco finn is a inherently solvent by design institution with the ability to verify that as the individual which to me is completely aligned with the values and ethos of this whole entire space and so that's that's why we me and ryan get really bullish on ethereum is because like inherently in these protocols is solvency right like is is the ability to pre and the ability to prove that as well and so like what really gets me excited about cresco finn is like they're really leveraging the capabilities of ethereum to the to the maximum extent right and that's just the competitive advantage i think that's right david and you know basically cresco finn is kind of like the anti-bank like i mean there's no i mean it's like a it's a bank i guess as an alternative because it just in a sense but it like because it brings together capital with like you know productive use of it but it does it it does it in the exact opposite the way a bank does because a bank thrives on information asymmetries like they don't want you to know what they're what what you know what's happening with your money because you freak out right like you'd like if you really knew that like your people think that your money goes into like they think they put your money in the bank and it's like ocean's 11 that somebody takes it and puts it in some like giant like safe somewhere and then closes up the safe and like that's your money and it's very safe and it's just banks are just databases it's just it's just they suck as databases and that's why if you build it on ethereum it's like open transparent and and this is what it's designed for and this is why it's going to blow away the the legacy banking system because people will just insist on the future i mean this is where it's so exciting because you know this is what we're doing with ave in the future we're going to develop our own like you know on chain essentially deposit accounts for individuals globally and the idea is that like you say you know you should be able to click on it and you should be able to see where your money is like what what your money's doing like you know in this case you know your money that's not i mean if you wanted your money just there on uh on deposit it doesn't earn any interest because it's just sitting there but if you put it into like a savings where it's like overnight or it goes a little bit further out you you earn more and more and more with your money and you can see it's attached directly to like these invoices and the great thing is it's very crypto the way that we do it because it it uses this proof of delivery smart chain thing that like cuts through the financial structure and makes it very simple it's a contract between a seller between a seller and a buyer and you know it's insured so you don't need to spend like all day saying am i happy with this risk or not i mean we just we just insure it but you know you you've got it absolutely right and i'm really excited about it that like it's going to be totally transparent like you can actually see where your money is on chain you know in real time and you know and that is the proof of reserves that that's where your money's living so robert one thing that's cool is um you guys are are sort of uh you know you've you've got you're you're doing the splits let's call it right so you've got one foot in d5 over here and then you've got another foot on the traditional like financial legacy system so you're doing kind of a a split type maneuver and you act as a bridge across those those two things and we're all very familiar with bankless with kind of the defy side of things and i think you've summarized it fairly well in what you're doing with icress and where the yields come from the insurance on the other side of things you're also tying into the legacy traditional financial system for instance so i understand that you have the ability to have assets listed on like bloomberg terminals for instance could you talk about that and then could you also talk about the regulatory ties and the setup in switzerland and uh how you're kind of tied into the the legacy infrastructure that way well it's a good it's a good analogy that i'm doing the splits i guess i mean i sure didn't feel that i sure do feel like that song you feel the stretch you feel the burn i do but you know you have to be just very honest with people because you know you know people say like where's your yield from and you know if you turn to people in so i spend most of my life in the you know in traditional finance in the in the real world and you just need to say to people like it comes from crypto like it's it's enabled by ethereum it's enabled by the blockchain and you know you're going to lose a bunch of people right because it's still early days you're still gonna get a bunch of people that think like oh this is for like you know this is for like dark web criminals my institution can't be like associated with that but it's you know it's surprising how much like negative interest rates changes your moral position on that right because i mean there's been a war on savers for the last decade it's horrific here in switzerland 75 basis points on your money so think like almost one percent you you lose every every year just by being charged by the bank to have your money sit there in the bank that's before fees or anything else so and like i said that affects everybody the little guy and the big guy so there was actually a funny story in switzerland like when rates got very very low like and they eventually went negative that a regional asset manager who had like a couple hundred million you know dollars francs in in cash went to their bank and said look we've worked out a better plan like rather than rather than having our cash sit in your bank and you charge us we want to take it all out we're going to put in a secure armed warehouse and it's just going to sit there and the bank said no you can't you can't take it out in cash i mean it's just you know when you're in the traditional world though it has also its own you know has its own protocols but uh i'm just so pleasantly surprised that like 2020 2020 has been a terrible year right but i mean for for crypto and acceptance like since for us in particular in the spring since we noticed that since paul tudor jones basically said he was buying bitcoin for his fund and then you saw michael saylor you saw like you know when you look at it like fidelity's doing it quoted in like you know different exchanges like you know on ice and the cme so there's a lot more there's a lot more interest in crypto and it's really amazing and you know the most forward-thinking institutions we found are family offices so those are people who are really principals right they're not just managing other people's money it's their own money and they're they're really really willing to look at crypto and ethereum and so now like i'm in switzerland also is quite advanced like like you know you ask about the regulator like the regular is very supportive like you know you go to the train station here in geneva you can see bitcoin you know i mean it's like you know there's machines and there you know i mean you know it's we try essentially to bridge both worlds because you need to focus on the benefits i mean in the crypto community we we don't do such a good job of really talking about the benefits we we're really into the back end because that's like everybody's obsessed with attack and whatever but for normal people they just want to hear like why is this good for me so if you can say like look it's three percent it's insured how much do you want i mean it it's uh you know you we get a we get a much better reaction than kind of talking about the back end i mean it's like it's like the internet right i mean you know people just want to watch you know netflix and be entertained they don't need to hear about like how you're streaming packets and the transport layer and and stuff like that so that that is that is coming like i'm i'm really you know i'm i'm really really excited about it because i think that i think in the future the more that you explain that the benefits of the bank alternative built on ethereum defy you know i mean that it's global i mean it's really like you know i think the space is like is is primed to take off and and that's because mainly i think people are looking for yield yeah absolutely and so what did you have to set up in switzerland from a you know regulatory perspective what hoops did you have to jump through to get where you are now well that's not that's not easy i mean unfortunately it's not for everybody i mean you know it's like it's a long process you have to have a chief legal officer compliance you have to have you know in-house staff who can look at things i mean the the fact is that traditional investors they're not likely to you know to to really get into the riskier end of you know defy stuff because they they need to see typically that it's regulated to get into something so we're really hoping to be a bridge from from the traditional world to crypto because there's a wall of money i mean there's just so much interest and you know but there has to be a way to it there has to they have to have a root into it so they're not gonna typically farm yams or something like that you know they're they're more likely to go through a regulated entity i think that took a long time to get you know to get set up but but you know it was a it was just it was just the process stuff there was never any rejection of crypto like the radar regulator my regular actually has a guy who specializes in crypto and so like i talked to him other day and he's like he's totally up to speed with everything that's going on in crypto it's really amazing and then you know in the traditional space just like in any space they have their own ways of looking at things information lingo and stuff so we're we're really excited to be like the first kind of open finance product that's like quoted on the bloomberg terminal we got an is in securities code which is which is basically if you're an asset manager and you want to buy something for you know portfolio or client um it it usually the rules are that it has to have an isin number so yeah so that's why so we have that and that's also you know it's also a hassle to get but it's you know it's helpful and it's like for for us it's the route it's it's a it's a route to crypto you know switzerland is a safe stable place where people can imagine sending their money the regulations very clear like we we do do kyc on on people for the products i mean not for our equity tokens but for the actual financial products we sell uh we we do kyc but it's it's very simple it's you know it's very you know it's it's very easy and common sense so you know if you're not on a swiss government you know sanctions list then then you're accepted it's not it's not arbitrary so right now if someone wants um to deposit with you right now as i understand it robert this has been only open to institutions at to this point in time um but is that going to change in the future and at what point does that change yeah you got to start you just got to start somewhere you know derek my partner and i we we started on the 1st of october 2019 and we had built the system built the software we were hiring the team and so we've been we test we've been testing with our own money since october 19 and it worked we really didn't want to risk anybody else's money in case you know there were problems and bugs and you know like anything there was some early stage bugs that we had to work out we didn't want to take any vc money we we financed it all ourselves because we wanted more freedom and it's kind of our we're we're just so passionate about the project so in the spring of 2020 we opened to like a few family offices here in switzerland and they all started kind of testing it now they've all increased the amount of money they put with us which we're you know we're really excited about and our plan for 2021 is to take it to individuals like to take it retail and to do it global and it's also to do this you know this money market proposal uh with ave so that's the yeah so that's that's that's the coming plan we're we're not taking individuals at the moment because it's just been easier to build it when there's like a family office here who can write you a check for like you know 10 15 you know million dollars or euros or whatever and so that's that's where we started but you know it's tested and we're building we're building it out for individuals and you know our goal is to be uh bigger than any bank in the world that's the that's the goal i mean you know it's amazing when you cut out the bank and you and you do this on you know an open public blockchain your your costs are like a fraction of what they are in in a bank and uh the benefits go to savers so the the bankless thesis predicts this right and the protocol sync thesis also predicts like the arri the the coming of some sort of like you know bank in the front defy in the back institution right and so i didn't expect it to happen so soon david did you just describe a mullet my friend uh i i think that's what i mean but yeah yeah you know business in the front party in the back like that's that's that's cresco fan let's get let's get the the fun defy code stuff in the back and just have the traditional comforting insured you know interface uh that that people are used to engaging with and so you know ryan and i pound we beat the drum on the protocol sync thesis and the bankless thesis and this seems to be like playing out in cresco fit and so that's that's why we are super interested in following this story and and seeing you guys rise to success robert it's really it's sorry it's just really amazing to like you know see because it's why crypto is so exciting like there's two things that that i really love about crypto like in addition to be able to compete against banks one is that things things happen so quickly it's like you're on speed like it's just unbelievable how fast it happens and you know the other thing is it's like it there's so much cooperation like i mean i know there's also people who like you know throw fat and stuff in the community but i mean i've just been shocked at like how cooperative was like coming coming from traditional banking it just wasn't cooperative at all but dealing with like chain link dealing with ave we have people in our community that have just come up with ideas and then just done it i mean it's it's really amazing so sorry to cut you off no not at all like with that that's the that ethos about in the culture of this world is is why i'm particularly just excited about it kind of just turning into the new status quo because i think the world could use a little bit more cooperation these days um robert if people if viewers want to learn more about cresco finn and kind of like peek behind the scenes and and check you guys out where should they go yeah sure but just before i say that just to finish on bank list because one of the reasons why i was so curious about you guys is you know i was a subscriber of course and and red bankless and then i was at a meet up like a dev chain meetup here in geneva and some guy came on you know it's all online today but this guy came on like from his student association at like switzerland's mit and he had a little black flag and i kind of was like what is that like i mean and then he's like oh he's like i'm part of like the bankless nation club here at my university and i was like you're kidding me and this you know and he's like and he said like you need to join our like telegram chat group and we have others like for for uh bankless uh in france so you can join it and follow it in french i'm like that's amazing like he's actually yeah he's like you know there's a full community of of bankless like french-speaking people so i joined it there's like hundreds of people like onto in french speaking switzerland and france and probably other places as well like canada belgium whatever but i mean who are talking about how to go bankless so anyway i thought this is perfect like this is this is exactly what we need on like you know to to help us to give us give us advice i mean so anyway we're at the moment the side is defy dot cresco finn dot ch and our yeah our plans for next year are to try and take this bankless type product uh global and you guys also have a discord and twitter as well which we will have linked in the show notes below for you guys if you guys are interested in joining those as well yeah that's great thanks robert thanks for coming on and meeting the nation excited to see the future of cresco finn yeah it was a real pleasure thanks a lot guys nice to chat thanks robert
