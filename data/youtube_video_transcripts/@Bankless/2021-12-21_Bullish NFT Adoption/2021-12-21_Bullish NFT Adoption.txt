what happened in nfts is incredibly significant for ethereum as a network in 2021 and in particular if you go back to the beginning of the year the community has expanded so much since then i mean in january there were not that many people talking about nfts and then really in kind of the march time frame that's when they started to take off and what i've seen over the past year is a tremendous introduction of new participants into the network and these aren't people who are in other cryptos before necessarily they came to ethereum and other networks as well because of nfts and i think that that nft momentum has really pushed ethereum in a way that it hasn't been in before and it's starting to gain more recognition among people who are not that deep into crypto like bitcoin has and i think we're gonna see that continue frankly into 2022
