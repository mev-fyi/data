[Music] hey guys welcome to this episode of meet the nation today i speak with yaron velner of bee protocol bee protocol is a system that arose out of black thursday which uh many of many of you will unfortunately remember as the day where a decent amount of maker dao vaults got bid on uh for zero die and uh what this means is that black thursday was that event during when when the markets finally reacted to covid and ether price dropped like 60 in 24 hours loss of liquidations happened um and this was really one of the first examples of so much congestion on chain that broke things broke uh and what one was one of the things that broke was maker dow vaults no one was bidding on these underwater vaults underwater loans uh and so somebody figured that out somebody saw that and they bid on these underwater loans for zero dollars and since no one else was bidding on them the maker dao protocol accepted that zero dollar bid which it wasn't a bug it wasn't an exploit it was just a market inefficiency and this is where b protocol really uh was arose from this event right um b protocol is like this wrapper around your uh vault inside of maker doubt or your vault inside of compound or in the future ave and it makes sure that it gives it gives the rights of liquidations to the b protocol and the b protocol will liquidate you first before other liquidators but importantly it will do so according to the rules of the protocol that you deposited your money into so it doesn't change anything it just redirects the rights of who can liquidate and this has a lot of benefits a lot of ways to redistribute value back to the community from those liquidations uh so i i thoroughly enjoyed it this conversation with aaron valner so let's go ahead and get right into this meet the nation but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited bunny goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics all right bankless nation i'm here with euron velner of b protocol you're on welcome to the nation yeah thank you thank you david nice being here so we are here today to explore what b protocol is so maybe you can kind of give us that the high level elevator pitch what does a b protocol do yes actually we protocol you know target two levels of uh you know different users the first of all is users who are using uh the standard lending platforms so actually if you're a compound user or maker user we offer you to use them via our interface and in return share some of the liquidation proceeds now this is b protocol from the user facing side from the more visionary and you know more longer term goal side what we aim is actually to be a backstop and take care of different liquidations so these are two sides where different liquidations are important you know also uh to keep all the learning platform uh solvent and also to eventually allow users with better leverage random platforms okay so just to make this clear so if i want to use a typical d5 borrowing or lending application like maker dow or ave i can actually use the protocol through b protocol and then you guys uh like add on your services or products because i'm using ave or maker dow through your guys's contracts is that correct yeah yeah so right now we support maker and the compound actually have it still will come soon er again basically it's not like we provide your service but we provide you an incentive to use use them via us and in return what you actually give us is a priority in liquid liquidation okay so you as a user get exactly the same conditions you get in maker or in compound but in return you get something a bit more from us what we get from you is the priority in liquidation so we have our own desktop of liquidators uh who get a priority in liquidating you so i think uh the maker dow black thursday back in march which was almost almost a year ago now that i think about it um this is probably a great uh piece of context or or historical context to talk about so if um many of the people that got for context uh there was a very very rapid drop in eth price uh during when the the coveted pandemic really hit the markets and that caused as you would imagine a bunch of on-chain liquidations and unfortunately with maker dow there were some vaults that were liquidated for the value of zero dollars and so they had ether in their vaults that because of the on-chain congestion and the on-chain gas fees no one was bidding for the value of this collateral and so somebody bid zero dollars and then that bid was accepted because of the maker dow protocol said well no one else is bidding for it so i'll sell it to them for zero dollars uh if these vault if these unfortunate vault owners had been using uh b protocol how would this have played out differently yeah so technically yeah technically very likely that they would have been liquidated at market price uh but actually you know the problem is much bigger than that so as a user this is one of your concerns okay get liquidated zero price uh but maybe somewhat of a bigger concern which very few speak about is the protocol you know becoming vertically insolvent so you know you put your collateral and other people bored right so if there's no one who will be liquidated properly eventually you will not be able to withdraw your collateral right people will get i mean the protocol will get bankrupt in a sense so yeah but black says thursday was definitely you know part of the motivations of starting his protocol we started already so basically around april april 2020 like a month after black's thursday uh but me personally you know was in the liquidation space ever since december 2019 already [Music] and actually we kind of already back then so that you know the liquidation systems in dfi is very sub-optimal very sub-optimal to liquidators and you know but basically we're always discussing what will happen in big liquidation event and we always thought you know that there's like a contingency plan or some backstop that maker though and others keep beyond the same [Music] and then it turns out they don't have uh but black says the you know in some sense if i did get more mature since then uh but still you know like the whole exhale eventually of learning platform is to allow people to leverage their funds right i mean and to achieve better capital efficiency so make it also compound you know you can get short and long positions over assets and because the liquidation process is so sub-optimal they they allow users to know only very poor uh leverage ratio yeah so you know put some numbers and so in traditional finance in even in crypto and centralized arenas you know you can go x hundred long on a bitcoin position right in bit mix by bit when maker now and compound you can go x3 x4 and the main reason there is that you know they're afraid to allow more because they don't have a good liquidation process uh so right now be protocol from the user side so we are not able to offer you better liquidation because we offer you exactly the same conditions so you get the same ratio but we do incentivize you you know to use our platform and give priority to our liquidations to our liquidators then we form a big a big deck stop and eventually the goal and the holy grail is to use this backstop to support other you know all of different liquidations which will allow them for a bigger leverage so just just to reiterate with their maker dow has a 150 percent collateralization requirement so if you want to borrow a dollar you need to put up a dollar and a half and that's that extra 50 cents that offers you the buffer which is why maker dao feels secure in the in the value of die because it has this massive buffer and that massive buffer is nice because it's it's a buffer we want buffers to be big but it's also bad because there's not much capital efficiency there and what you're saying is that you know maker dow and compound and all the other borrowing and lending applications because that they need that buffer we actually reduce capital security and you're saying that the buffer must exist because they don't have strong assurances about the liquidation process is are people actually going to come and liquidate this thing appropriately or are they not and not having strong assurances that the liquidation process will occur as according to plan means that they need to increase that buffer but what you're saying is that b protocol can offer better assurances to these d5 protocols like maker dow or compound about the liquidation process can you go into more detail about how b protocol offers stronger liquidation commitments yeah yeah but maybe you know like to make some recap so again we we will uh you know secondly we do have like more committed liquidators but at this point we don't offer higher leverage so so maybe it will be best you know maybe less confusing if they'll just make some demo and show what the protocol actually offer now to the users sure absolutely yes yes so i know if you're a compound or maker user you you can just go to app.bottom.org [Music] and manage your position from there so this is the compound screen we have and we have also the maker screen so let's let's focus on compounds so you know you can do all the standard operations deposit a borrow etc okay exactly the same way you are used in compound moreover every operation you do here eventually goes to compound okay so it goes to our smart contract and from there to compound and in addition of course you also okay so you get exactly the same you know ap y for borrows exactly the same interest rate for for boring the comp you get as usual but in addition you get to share a java okay you get you get users you get our score the people to call scroll and you get our java and the gel is composed from the profits of the liquidators so with compound naturally we only went live yesterday still not much there in in maker there's already sixty thousand dollars there in the jar that maker users will share so again you as a user you know you get exactly the same guarantees as in compound or in maker but in addition you get to share the liquidation scope uh and actually moreover if you already have an account in the medicare or in compound you know we offer a single transaction import where you can import your existing account and to our system and so when you when you deposit your assets into b protocol and not into b protocol but into compound or maker using b protocol are you allowing b protocol to use your assets for any particular reason and no no so so yes and no i mean but basically we don't have any custody over your funds we are not allowed to do i mean we cannot move your funds not even our governance can move it no one can move it but if your assets according to the compound conditions are subject to liquidation then we get a priority in the liquidation okay so we can only liquidate you instead of compound but again exactly under the same conditions as compound so you know other than the usual smart contact risk you don't have anything to lose by using us only to gain more okay so you so you get better assurances um maybe compound as a system doesn't get better assurances it's only the users of b protocol that are using compound get better assurances of their liquidation process is that correct so first of all you know we offload some of the liquidation pressure from compounds so yeah we do see it is compounded mega also you know in the long run get better assurances as a user it's not only about assurances you get you know you you get some control uh disco give you control over the protocol and you get to share eventually some of the profits right so it's you strictly profit more right putting all assurances aside okay so and you know if we don't liquidate your compound will right so there's no risk here that you will not get liquidated so where do those where do the profits come from in in the jar and why are they given out to users of the b protocol yes so they are giving out to users you know to incentivize them to use a compound variable protocol and not compound directly they come because a compound liquidation penalty is eight percent uh encountering compound all of it it goes to the liquidator and actually part of the problem okay all of it go to the liquidator but almost half of it go to the miners of the ethereum system right because you have huge gas law you have mev minor extractable value which take very big chunk of the profit so so what we offer to our value proposition to liquidators here is okay eight percent is quite a lot so it's not about because of all the gas competition and everything but if you come to b protocol you know we save you the gas competition so now instead of eight percent you get only five percent but the other three percent will go to agile and it will be distributed among all the users okay so let me go through this again so b protocol depositors uh give the right to b protocol to liquidate them first before compound does and because of that they don't there isn't the gas fight for liquidations because b protocol has first first dibs at the liquidation process and so because they're not saving because they are saving by not being in a bidding war for the arbitrage transaction that savings goes into the jar yeah yeah yeah you know exactly [Music] and moreover you know so they give like the first priority to our liquidators but it is important to say that liquidation happens exactly under the same conditions and then they are not liquidate being liquidated earlier uh and we actually have this i know definitely lego trick that allow us to get this priority and you know if you you want to dive in more into technical details later you know i can explain it as well uh but but yeah so to sum it up you know so like the users profit because they get the job they get the user score that eventually uh actually two months is from now uh we'll get them a vote at our first governance vote and decide on the governance model of the protocol uh the protocols at the end of the day you know we bring liquidators they didn't participate in default liquidators before so they do enjoy you know more committed liquidators and you know it's not only about gas wars because the liquidators are more committed you know they they know that this priority for the long run they have better incentive you know to construct a system uh which is robust and being able to you know to handle blacks thursday like events and big liquidations so the living platforms also benefit for me the user benefits from it you know the miners lose a bit but eventually it's really like a win-win across you know both the landing platforms and the users hey guys don't go anywhere there is so much left in this meet the nation with erin we finished up this conversation with how the b protocol will be a community run protocol b protocol really could become a public good for ethereum and that means that the community needs to direct it so i asked him about the future roadmap for b protocol what could be done if we really extend this out into the future i had a really fun time talking with aaron don't go anywhere because we've got to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemiini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless i do want to get into how you guys get first priority liquidations and how the how the mechanics behind that works first i want to ask about that user score what does that user score mean yes so basically the users go and you know okay so we just went live yesterday so the balance job balance is very low and make it it's already sixty thousand dollars but user score uh so the jar will be distributed in april and of april uh so you get your proportional uh part of the gel according to the user score but moreover this user score will be used also for voting for the governance right now the user score you know just a record on the blockchain it's not even a valueless token it's just a record you cannot transfer it or you cannot sell it to anyone uh but and the score is being distributed you know proportionally to how much you use the protocol roughly speaking you know how much you borrow and land [Music] over time uh yeah so this is a score and then we have actually cisco you know for compound in m score for maker and and technically you know at the smart contract level uh they have full control over the smart contract uh but by full control here i mean mostly about governance not about the use of funds i mean even a majority of of score cannot you know compromise funds etc but they do decide what they do decide is about the future gel distribution they will decide on you know the conditions uh with the liquidators how much liquidator will get how much users will get in the future you know they will decide on how to incentivize new users etc okay so this is really just a this is a community governance tool and so this is a way to make sure that the only only people that are guiding the future direction of b protocol are people that have actually used it will your score go up faster if you deposit more assets in through yeah through b protocol yeah yeah so if you deposit more and borrow more than you will grow more faster so this is just yield farming this is what yield farming is but you're saying it's not yet a token yeah so this goal is it's not only the disco it's not a token you know whatever the but to give full control to the users so you know they can decide later how to move forward and and incentivize more users so in that sense it's not i mean okay the farming right now is that you get this jar which you know even if it gets to a hundred thousand dollars it's still not you know the 50 apy but you get you do get to decide you know on the future governance and in the future instead of modeling for the new users very cool okay so so b protocol captures some of the value of gas auctions by prioritizing its liquidation process first so that there isn't this race where there's just a bidding war for gas and then it captures that value and puts it into the jar and then it distributes the value that's collected into the jar amongst the users that have this high score from the b protocol and the users that have the high score from the b protocol are the actual users of the of the system that have put capital real capital in through the b protocol i think that's pretty cool yeah yeah and moreover it's not only the uh you know it's not only the value of the miners that we capture we do believe that you know efficient desktop uh you know has much higher profits than liquidators for now you know like to give you some ideas so you know like professional desktop and buybate and bitmex get premium on liquidations while indeed it's in the order of five to eight percent so so there's a huge you know excess profit here that currently defines introduce so it's also because of miners but also because of you know this fierce competition between liquidators and in flashback liquidators and we believe this is also an issue you know with different liquidations is that it doesn't give you any incentive to prepare to a real liquidation event right it only gives you incentive to operate some flashlight boats and take only the easy liquidations then when you have hard liquidations no one will take them so we believe there's also excess profit there you know a professional liquidator who gets some commitment from the platform will be willing to eventually settle for much a smaller profit than eight percent you know in the long run even one on two percent and this is also something that you know we can capture or the jar will capture from the long run do you think this liquidation premium that b protocol is able to access will that actually in the long term represent the bulk of the revenue over the the gas efficiencies yeah yeah i think you know eventually oh you know it's not only about gas efficiency i mean gas efficiency you know i i i know let's put it in different worlds you know compound or maker they don't really care if miners take all their profits right or they care if they have liquidators or they don't have liquidators right but but i think like the fact that you know compound has to offer or doesn't feel comfortable to offer less than eight percent premium which is very high is because of the miners and is is because of the you know uh sub-optimal liquidation process and i think eventually yeah we'll be able to capture you know like big part of this eight percent and you know i i just see a future that as a result you know we have a very efficient backstop landing platform will come and say okay we don't no longer provide eight percent a premium you know we provide only one to three percent premium but but actually we see it as a good outcome because you know this will eventually come with very high increase in the volume right i i mean if you take buy lead only offer one percent but they did you know i think that last week when there was this like 10 to a drop they did something like half a billion in liquidations right i mean so so basically the smaller the premium is eventually there will be more liquidations you know platforms will be more competitive so even if this eight eight percent shrinks to something smaller we see it actually as part of the goal you know to allow liquidations with smaller premium but that's more for the long run yeah makes sense to me all premiums trend towards zero over the long term and you're totally right it's just because it's matched by an increase probably even more so an increase in volume um i'd like to get into the how uh how b protocol gets the priority with uh liquidations how does that happen yeah okay so we have some explanation for it in our website is so if you're able to see this diagram with me yeah so so basically this is the architecture the high level architecture of big protocol we're in the core we have the learning platform say compound okay and we have a user that you know simply deposit borrow and replace borrow from compound uh now when i use the er when i use it okay but instead of depositing directly to compound and blowing from compound the deposit via this sim wrapper that we provide which is the b protocol so we deposit some funds for some funds and then our liquidators have the permission to actually repay part of his debt by providing this question okay now from the user side you know and they they repay it directly to compound via our interface of course but you know they paid directly to compound so let's say you know a user had a one million debt and they pay you know they paid you know for the sake of example they paid half of it already so now compound will say user date is half a million dollar right well so here you know in this call uh in this core module the debt is only half a million dollar well you know protocol knows that okay the liquidators paid half of it so the real debt is one million dollar right [Music] so because of it you know b protocol will liquidate according to a one million debt one million dollar debt which is the real debt of the user right and this is when he would have been liquidated had he you know initially deposit directly deposited and bought directly via compound so this is you know this is exactly what the user will get in compound now the rest of the world the compound liquidators only see half of the debt so for them the account is safe and it's not eligible for liquidations uh so yeah but basically this is how it works and you know in maker we are actually live since november last year and already did so 100 000 in liquidations so yes so it's really working so basically you know the example i gave is million dollar half a million it's not really very realistic right in reality they will put like one percent or half a percent there just to get you know some small advantage over the rest of the world very cool very cool so just to reiterate the b protocol has uh it's its own uh its own deposits as a protocol into compound and then when a when a b protocol user gets liquidated it uses the b protocols assets was that correct no no no no no not really no no so that's only protocol users do not share their assets every user is responsible to its own asset but let's say and something about the process it's about the borrowing so let's say you deposited you know 1 000 and you borrowed 1 million die okay so so now uh right and it is so now the system register one million dollar debt on your behalf now we have a set of liquidators and the liquidators are default traders who are not part of the users okay there are separate categories of users or or of players in the system and they have the permission to repay some of your debt now if why would they want to do it they want to do it when you're getting close towards liquidation they want to get the priority so they repay part of your debt in the compound system but in the protocol system we say okay you know we ignore the replace say this is your will that right which is only fair because this is you will get to be protocol uh so what we get now is that you know in compound you have only half a million dollar debt but your real debt in b protocol is one million dollars so your account is not safe anymore okay and you in in your account was not safe if you were deposited initially and borrowed directly from compound right so it's only fair that we liquidate you at this point okay so so here's my next question so just to just again clarify some things so i i have my own compound account let's call it a vault uh even though i don't think they call them they're they're things faults and so if it comes time for my compound like vault to get liquidated the actual liquidation doesn't happen in compound it's not the compound protocol that liquidates me it is the b protocol that covers my debt and then pays itself back so i'm not that there's it isn't actually my uh debt isn't actually auctioned off by compound it's just managed by b protocol is that correct yeah yeah manage baby protocol but by exactly the same conditions right would have handled it yeah so for compound exactly the same conditions as compounds for making exactly the same conditions as the original right and so you guys just provide that wrapper that shield so you don't actually get liquidated by the original protocol you just take those same rules those same parameters and you copy them and then that's where the prioritization comes from that's why b protocol is able to liquidate before compound or maker because they you because a user of the b protocol has probably given b protocol permissions to do this it's like hey make sure i don't get liquidated and manage my funds as as you see fit to make sure i don't get liquidated and then b protocols says we will do this and it will be according to the same rules of the underlying lending protocol yeah yeah and and just know that you know manage the way you see fit it's not really the very fit you can i give you the permission to repay part of my debt right i mean you don't have anything to lose but i give you the permission to repay some of it and you know take the portion you repaid in case there was no liquidation right so it's not really do what you want try to stay [Music] very cool that's very cool so let's talk about the future roadmap so you i saw the ave coming soon uh icon so it sounds like ave is coming soon uh when can we expect ave and then after ave what can we expect down the line yeah okay so actually down the line so i might be like in two or three months from now but dandelion so so first of all in end of april uh you know the governance will be formed so so right now basically no one controls the smartphone that right i mean it is the users but we have this reason until end of april so right now we don't control it i mean the the contract is just you know being freezed or you know like the governance is being freezed until end of april uh so that will come soon in two months from now uh but but like down the road even later and eventually the objective is actually twofold one uh right now we use professional liquidators right so if we go back to this diagram this uh liquidators here are a strong defy market makers uh so our goal here is to bring more strong players but also to allow user-based desktop and our vision here is that you know right now we have uniswap with billions of dollars in tvl and and it's actually quite okay for in no liquidations of few millions but again if you want to go by bit or bit max levels you need much more now it's not very likely that eventually you know [Music] even if uniswap will end up with a trillion dvl you know it will not get you to buy bit liquidation sizes so we want to do user based backstop which will be kind of adaptation over unislope so that's one one goal and then once we have that on top of our backstop which is formed by professional traders then our main goal is that you know instead of us integrating with other and compound and all the rest is actually to offer this backstop you know as a service to new learning platforms uh you know starting maybe with the smaller ones then you know going all the way up to the big ones and there it's not only to prevent black sales day like events but also you know defy right now of a very poor valuable position in leverage if you compare it to center centralized finance right so x3 to x5 as opposed to x100 uh so i think this is like you know like the backstop primitive is a piece of d5 lego that is really missing and you know no one no one wants to take care of it no one you know it's like kind of defy little little dirty secret right i mean people just say okay yeah the community will liquidate us uh which might might work okay you know with this very bad collateral ratio that currently offer but in order for d5 to become you know by bit and bit next level then yeah we think you know like backstop is a primitive is the missing piece so one thing i've been hopeful for to see in d5 is to have like the same d5 financial services uh be integrated into like front end uis that would could be spun up by like coinbase or gemini right so like we could have a compound borrowing and lending or a maker dow vault accessible through gemini and that can be like the gemini product and perhaps one of the reasons why we haven't seen something like this is that we haven't really been able to provide these centralized uh entities which have you know responsibilities to their customers we haven't really been able to provide them with really strong assurances that nothing is going to go wrong do you think like with the integration of b protocol that we might actually be able to get these centralized companies to leverage defy better in their back end because they have better assurances that the b protocol can offer yes actually speaking you know some of the leading protocols speaking with them and you know they're all trying to now approach institutional entities and all of them told us that you know they are being asked okay i i you know i i deposit the money who actually take care of the liquidations you know if something goes on et cetera and then they start you know giving funny answers telling them yeah the community will liquidate you which is not a good enough answer you know for the institutional players especially for traditional ones so yeah this is like one you know like very important aspect and i think here you know it's not really about you know okay vb protocol is a company as a nice people we will not be eventually the ones who liquidate uh you know the company everyone but but we are the one who are building you know a protocol that give better incentives you know in the presence of gasol and other different considerations give better incentives for a backstop and four liquidators and we also been you know able to bring strong defect players to be the backstop all the so that's one side you know for institutional players that are really concerned about you know the insolvency of learning platform and then the other direction is maybe more of the game players or you know like the average users who even if they don't want higher leverage you know giving them higher leverage will make the position safe right because they will get liquidated at later stage so everyone wants eventually a bigger leverage even if you don't plan to use it so yeah these are the two aspects that you know uh backstop primitive will be able to facilitate [Music] that that's really cool and to me this is just a story of d5 maturing right d5 just being more secure in solving its own problems so that gives me really optimistic uh euron if if anyone listening anyone in the bankless nation wants to learn more about bee protocol uh where should they go how can they how can they find you and how can they find the community uh yeah so first of all we have a twitter so you know i know later we can put some links maybe there will be a roadmap of links in the show modes absolutely yeah yeah so we have our twitter channel discord channel a medium post and of
