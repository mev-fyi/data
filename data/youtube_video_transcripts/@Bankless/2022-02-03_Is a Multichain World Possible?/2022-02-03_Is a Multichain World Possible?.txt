are we going to live in a multi-chain world or will there be one chain to rule them all in the last year i've been chatting with lots of folks who've come into the crypto space who are brand new and don't know about any of the prior art for all these conversations that like you guys and ourselves have been having and they just come into this world they're like okay i keep hearing all this stuff about solana salon is the future of you know crypto isn't solana just gonna eat everything and isn't this just like an open and shut story i realized that it was very difficult for a lot of folks who are entering into the space to wrap their head around a good mental model of why isn't it that a blockchain that's just faster and can fit more people into it and fit more transactions into it why is that not obviously going to win and in most technologies that's the case it doesn't officially understand the nuance of why it is that blockchains are what they are if that were true then you know bitcoin would have been superseded by bitcoin cash and by bitcoin sv and by litecoin or whatever right like we know that these things don't happen in things like bitcoin why don't they happen for ethereum
