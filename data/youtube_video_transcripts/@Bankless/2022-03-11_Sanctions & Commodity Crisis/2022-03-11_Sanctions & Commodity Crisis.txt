war in ukraine sparks a commodity crisis in april of 2021 we had 60 a barrel for oil we are currently up above 120 a barrel so like oil has doubled in the last like six months jim bianco made a tweet where like every time that there's been a 50 increase in crude oil has triggered a recession like the hit rate is a hundred percent corn and wheat setting basically new highs again that really matters because that's food prices right corn and wheat food prices and it's not just like food prices going up like 20 to 25 at home but it also means just like perhaps famine for africa so much of the african continent is dependent on russia and ukraine for wheat that they have to are going to have to rethink where they're getting their wheat from because there's absolutely zero way that a cycles worth of crops is coming out of ukraine right now
