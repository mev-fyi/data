[Music] welcome to banquets where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bank-less david how you doing this episode really really optimistic about the future of ethereum is specifically from what jessie talked about in this podcast and i think this is going to be another one of the bankless podcasts where you can take it to your friends and family and show them exactly what it is we are doing here because in addition to the d5 dj and yield farming that we're doing we're also doing something much grander much more meaningful and that's the thesis that jesse brought in this bankless podcast today so this is this is a great episode just to illustrate like why we are all here i felt like this was an entirely new lens than what we usually talk about on bank list which is more a bit more like you know um like finance and economy economic right like like more more money related i suppose but this one i think you're right did feel like it has something for people who aren't finance geeks and don't really care about yield and return and all of these financial terms they'd rather have their you know cpa handle that for them and like this is talking about the the real economy the ownership economy on on top of this banking layer and this property management system that crypto has essentially built so i think it's it's super exciting and also a lens that we don't often see on on bank list i'm going to be thinking about this episode for a while what were your takeaways david yeah my big takeaways and this is just a fantastic continuation from our previous episode with amin and kevin about moloch because the mohawk conversation is so relevant here as well what's what jesse is doing with his fund variant he's trying to solve coordination and he thinks that what we can do with d5 what we can do with tokens specifically is coordinate among a wider set of participants and this is where the legacy financial system and the legacy you know startups of silicon valley and the gargantuans of silicon valley have really broken down is that they haven't been able to coordinate a larger and larger group of people and so what i got specifically out of this episode is that what we are doing when we are yield farming and what we are doing when we are issuing and trading tokens is we are figuring out ways to get and coordinate energy and labor across a wider pool of participants to focus in on something that like that could be something that would replace facebook that could be something that would replace twitter or that could be something that could also replace your bank some financial institution uh and and it seems to be that we have the tools to move forward with actually trying and achieving some of these goals yeah this paired with our nft episode a couple episodes ago feels like it's making a case for how ethereum how bitcoin can go mainstream through real world usage right it's always the question that we that we ask is like what's going to be the catalyst that makes crypto go mainstream that makes bank let's go mainstream is it stable coins is it the institutions coming is it just this bankless economy saturates the world in areas of the world that don't have banks and the answer that question is is yes but there's also an ownership economy answer to that question as well and jessie provides the thesis for that it almost feels a little bit like you know our uh episode with vance from framework you know if we had talked to vance from framework in in 2018 and kind of developed his thesis before it was you know proven out this episode felt a little bit like that it's like this thesis of the ownership economy just a little bit ahead of it being totally proven out so there might be some alpha there that listeners can uh can realize from this episode absolutely a while ago on the bankless newsletter i wrote a very quick market monday piece talking about how uniswap moved the overton window of capital right and what we were what i was discussing was how uniswap has an application really just purchased the loyalty of anyone that's ever used it ever right a retroactive airdrop of twelve hundred dollars that distributed ownership and governance over the protocol to the people that are incentivized to be good stewards of the protocol what jessie's really talking about in this podcast is copying that same model and using it on a grander scale and really kind of getting ownership into the hands of the people that actually produce the value of these systems and including them in financial upside right so if there's ever going to be a face a new facebook that's 10x better or a new twitter that's 10x better jesse thinks that it's going to have some sort of compensation model for the people that are actually contributing the value that make those platforms valuable all right guys so you're gonna love this episode you know david before we get into it you've got some interesting news to announce right you've got a speaking event coming up yeah coindesk is getting hot on ethereum and so they are throwing an ethereum invest economy conference virtual conference on october 14th there are going to be a ton of d5 all-stars there like vitalik has a keynote there roon christensen from maker dow defy dad hugh carp from nexus mutual stani from ave fernando from balancer haseeb from dragonfly there's going to be a fantastic lineup with a fantastic set of spots which and i am also speaking at this event i'm talking about why ether is such a compelling and unique asset that is not any found anywhere else in the world you know dave those names you mentioned all of those almost all of those have been on the bankless podcast previously it feels like a bankless conference almost yeah it's gonna be a bankless reunion uh and i guess all the ones that we haven't gotten on the podcast i think probably will be on the podcast in the future if you guys want to tune in to all these different people talk about d5 talk about ethereum go to the link in the show notes and register with the code bank list to get 25 off of your coin desk invest conference ticket so i will see you guys there all right before we get started with jesse walden on the ownership economy and ep episode you absolutely cannot miss we want to tell you about some of these unique bankless tools from our sponsors bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focus on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in d5 wyon's various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer urn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset wiren employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment why iron is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wide iron system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that wire has to offer at yearn.finance that's y-e-a-r-n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing all right guys let's get into the interview with jesse i want to welcome jesse walden to the bankless nation he's a crypto investor former a16z part of their crypto fund uh he influenced many of my mental models on all things crypto and i feel like he's about to do it again today now he runs an early stage vc fund called variant which focuses on today's topic the ownership economy jesse how are you doing today doing well thanks for having me all right hey are today's big tech companies taking advantage of people's free labor is that is that what's going on yeah well it's a loaded question but i mean my short answer would be yes i think i think um if you look at you know internet platforms today i think it's fair to say that much of the value is of course created by their users whether that's content or products in marketplaces um and um you know those users of course get tons of value from the platform um in in in the cases where they're able to reach an audience or um or you know sell their products or services um but i think we're sort of starting to hit an inflection point um where the value that these platforms are able to extract is is a little bit disproportionate to what the users are able to get out of it and um the ownership economy and and what i see happening in kryptos or presents uh an alternate model that that i think is going to become the dominant model in in the near future because um better economic alignment with users is likely you know the way to uh to win market dominance in my view so we we can get into that but the short answer is i think that users should be able to capture more of the value that they create on internet platforms yeah so really want to talk about your thesis around what you call the ownership economy and as we dig into that maybe jumping off of what what you just said to sort of tee this up so david and i are we're content producers right so on behalf of the bankless nation thanks for everyone listening and reading our stuff but we use platforms like youtube and twitter and facebook uh for the distribution um and it feels like a lot of times as content producers we we don't necessarily a have very much power in the interaction so you're creating all of this um all of this value right all of these resources but we actually uh can't stop youtube from say blocking us or twitter from like putting us in twitter jail for a while and we also uh we've realized like some of the upside i suppose but uh it very much feels like facebook and youtube are are you know setting the terms here is that kind of what you're talking about when you talk when you're contrasting like the future ownership economy to the world that we live in largely in social media and web 2. yeah i think that's that's it's sort of a good a good place to start the discussion so i i think um most of these platforms social media platforms marketplaces they they follow a very predictable life cycle and my former partner at andreessen christix and wrote about this in his post why decentralization matters the life cycle they follow is is sort of an s-curve of growth where um at the beginning of the s-curve um you know they're they're very cooperative with their users they invite you know content producers you know media media publications in the case of you know facebook and youtube to join the platform they do everything in their power to help them out and reach a large audience once that audience is there and growing really quickly um you know the the the s-curve starts to go up into the right but eventually it it plateaus um eventually you can't grow any more organically and and so that's where the final turn in the s-curve comes at that plateau and at that point many of these platforms um start to become more extractive of their users and and they're able to do that because they've sort of locked in network effects now they've got you know the creators and they've got the audience there and it's very difficult um for for each of those parties to move because you know classic network effects there's more value in staying than in leaving and being in a room by yourself and that empowers the platforms to go and start extracting as much value as they can from their users and returning that value to shareholders and and so i think when when you say you know youtube sets the term or terms or facebook sets of terms on how you sort of interact and monetize your audience i think that's that's very much true and you're very much subject to the whims of this s-curve so if if youtube decides you know they need to to extract more value from from for shareholders um they can very well do that and and and you're kind of powerless to fight them as an independent creator right so um the the ownership economy um sort of posits an alternate model where these platforms no longer have to follow that same s-curve um and and that's because i think platforms of the future will be owned and operated by their users and what that enables is a much more cooperative economic model where the platform remains aligned with users over time and in turn that allows for unabated growth and continued innovation as as the platform continues to serve the interests of users rather than the interests of shareholders so i remember as a kid growing up uh facebook came out when i was something like you know 12 13 14 right when i was starting to become like a social individual right and facebook was really viewed by by me and everyone around me as this sort of like public good on the internet it was this platform for keeping in touch with your friends for being able to share experiences and really to be able to live a social life on the internet and i think that's kind of where a lot of optimism about the future sci-fi world that's coming came from because these silicon valley startups kept on producing these awesome awesome public goods that would produce value for us you know twitter is the same thing it's a common square for conversation youtube is the same thing it's this place to get out free content and to capture attention and to have conversations and that was really exciting back when back when i was a kid in the early oos right but what you're saying is that as time grows on like facebook and just the value that it provided to everyone as a social as a public good platform to share social experiences kind of it grew and grew and and it continued to grow and then it grew into such a a wide part of the world that as a publicly traded company on a on the us stock market the only way where it could get the share price to grow was to start you know becoming more and more extractive right and so we it hit the limits of growth in terms of adoption of its platform and so it started to in order to grow what the ultimate goal is is the share price on the stock market it needed to become extractive and that's where we kind of see the disillusionment we know we see in facebook today where people are all all but aware that you know the facebook is creating you know more and more polarization from various different parties left and right and and i think uh jesse with trying to not put words in your mouth but you might uh ascribe that polarization created by facebook as a result of the business model of the silicon valley startups is that right well well yeah i would uh certainly in in the case of facebook and other social media platforms i think um yeah the the business model may be to blame for um you know the nature of the algorithms that drive polarization and then but then i think the root question here is why is the business model that way right and and to your point i think it's to drive um you know advertising dollars and which trickle into share price um now um just thought experiment imagine facebook was actually owned by its users instead right well then users might optimize for something other than share price they might optimize for utility that they get out of facebook and maybe part of that would mean reducing the number of ads that they see in their feed or reducing the amount of polarization that the algorithm suggests right um you'd have a different mandate if the platform were owned by its users today you know the since the 1970s really since milton friedman proposed that the sole purpose of corporations is to maximize profits for shareholders um we sort of lived in a paradigm where each um each internet platform has strived to do exactly that um but now there's there's sort of new tools in the toolkit to build internet platforms that don't just maximize profits for shareholders but maximize benefits or utility to their actual users um and and i think the first early examples of this are crypto networks which i'm i'm sure we can get into but um that's that's what sort of got me excited and down the path of thinking about the ownership economy and how it can enable a more equitable future that also results in better products for consumers so for me jesse this brings up two questions i'm gonna ask the first so uh why doesn't everyone just switch right so so david and i and a bunch of other content producers we're sick and tired of a platform well like why don't we switch to another platform yeah it's it's network effects again it's it's it's hard to coordinate um a large group of people that are at a party to go to another party somewhere else right like there's going to be you know there there has to be a tipping point a critical mass of people willing to move uh to the next party uh for that to happen and and so there's a social cost there's a coordination cost of getting everyone to exit and move somewhere else um and and that's that's the result of strong network effects that these platforms have and you know the the classic um problem in building any new network any new marketplace is solving this chicken and egg problem how do you get people to fill up the room um such that it becomes more valuable um more attractive for others to come and join in and one of the key innovations that that you know networks like bitcoin ethereum and others have employed to solve that problem is giving users that participate a direct economic incentive to join the network and and help see it grow um and so that's the new you know earlier when i mentioned there's new tools in the toolkit a new way to build platforms that are better aligned with users that's exactly what i'm talking about you know david this sounds so much like uh our previous episode where we talked about uh moloch the god of coordination failure right so jesse what i think you're saying is that uh basically the reason we can't all just switch is because we can't coordinate very well with our other laborers right so the reason we we don't as laborers go unionized and then try to negotiate with capital or switch platforms or exit something like that it really comes down to a coordination problem and i think what you're getting at is that um crypto helps solve that a little bit but i i let's get to that in a minute first i want to ask my my second question around this which is just like all right so um let's say we go back to your example where you have um facebook but instead of shareholders owning it only who are like just like maybe users maybe not um it's owned primarily by its users perhaps primarily by its heavy users or something else or something like that doesn't kind of the equilibrium in this sort of thing just turn users into into capitalists over the long term so let's say you just distribu distributed everyone uh facebook shares and you said look we're we're getting rid of uh our cap table there's you know and we're distributing all of facebook capital uh to the users don't doesn't over time what what happens is kind of the users just sort of um become the capital uh or or some users sort of decide to sell their capital um others acquire it and they essentially become uh you know like the capital in the market so so it sort of becomes like you know yeah new boss name is the old boss over time what are your thoughts on that that's that's definitely um a possibility but i would i would um answer that with another question which which is what what's wrong with that right um so so imagine um a new platform gets off the ground and it's early power users end up you know earning a large ownership stake in in the network um and that's you know it's very much the case of what happened with with bitcoin and the early bitcoin miners um and and developers that were part of the community that got it off the ground same same thing in ethereum um the you know i think the the question is what what's the problem with those early adopters being large owners you could argue that they will try to extract rent from others that join later and and that may be the case but maybe that's not the game theoretically optimal thing for them to do rather you know maybe they can see um see beyond that and see that there's potential to grow the network even bigger um even larger than web 2 networks have grown by virtue of giving you know additional users a slice of the pie so to make this a little more concrete um i think i think there's a good analogy to be drawn in venture capital financing so it's usually the case that early stage uh founders and investors in a startup get diluted as the company grows and takes on subsequent rounds of financing in other words you know as the company's growing and it needs to raise more money the cap table expands it inflates and the original shareholders um have less total percentage than they did at the outset now why would they agree to do that uh they agreed to do it because they see the additional capital coming in and the additional growth that that enables as a way as a way to grow the pie for everyone and and so while they may own less on a percentage basis the percentage that they do own will be worth more and so i think there's you know that same analogy um can can be uh used as a mental model in crypto networks where smart capital or smart users will see the benefit of continuing to grow the network in a way that is aligned with with additional users joining um and and so that's where you get into um monetary policy and i think that um the most successful networks in the crypto space and the ownership economy space will be adaptive um and they will have a monetary policy that encourages continued growth over time and if if that's the case i think it's likely that um users as capitalists uh it is not a bad thing in fact it's it's the driving engine of growth jesse i think your answer there was more along the lines of you know we we've previously seen uh companies uh on the on the public stock market companies like facebook companies like twitter where they will dilute shares uh to reward uh you know uh new employees like new team members because that's just a smart incentivization model and that has also worked out just well that work that's been a great model but i think your answer was that specifically with you know erc 20 tokens on ethereum or the token equity model that is issued by smart contracts we can expand the uh inflation of the token of the governance asset the share of the protocol to a new cohort of people which are the users rather than the employees and so not only are we incentivizing you know early stage employees with equity but we are also now incentivizing early stage users and as a different cohort of people receiving the governance rights over a system that new core cohort of people wasn't really included in the previous model in the you know web 2.0 or company equity model but now that we are able to get equity or ownership into the hands of users that a different sort of social contract can emerge as a result of the inclusionary environment that this new system that this new substrate offers and that new social contract might be able to expand these new products these new protocols to be far greater and far more inclusive than their silicon valley cohorts was that a different summary yeah i think that's absolutely right i just want to distill two points that i think are actually separate but but kind of interrelated the first is um that uh you know the the the model i'm describing where users own the network is very similar to um you know uh traditional venture capital in the way i described where you know there's there's um inflation of the cap table and that inflation is um used to bring in new talent new investors and grow the pie for everyone that's that's point number one and so very similar to uh to you know vc funding or you know stock option pools that grow over time so the second point which is a point that you made david is is that we have this new tool in the toolkit which are tokens and smart contracts and and the way i see tokens effectively are packets for value so we can now move value on the internet and the way we move information instantly to anyone anywhere in the world and the result is that we can sort of expand the pool of talent that's able to participate in value creation and that and value distribution so instead of being a w-2 employee of a company and earning stock options when they inflate the talent pool um you can be a user of a platform and contribute to the platform's marketing or contribute to its development and in return earn a digital token um that gives you some of the value that you've contributed and and so the fact that this is now digital and native to the internet is is a i think a really you know important shift because it expands the the talent pool to literally everyone with an internet connection um and and that's why it's now possible i think to build platforms that are built operated and owned by their users this is this is so interesting this idea of a permissionless and global talent pool you know david and i often joke but it's not really a joke that we work for protocols we don't work for people right so um there's no boss at bitcoin or ethereum of these crypto networks that we talk about and you know formed kind of like like uh media properties around um but we do it because we're passionate about these systems and also because there's an economic incentive right so you know we we believe that by talking about these crypto systems that more people will be onboarded that um it's better for our world it makes our world more more bankless gives us a new financial um financial system that's open and accessible to everyone and also because these tokens go up in value and that's a good thing for everybody so i think that's what you're talking about right like so you know um i quit what i was doing it's really interesting kind of the startup space and doing things in healthcare because i was just sucked into this ecosystem and now i work for a protocol is that what you're talking about exactly yeah and what i would what i would add is that you know i think that networks like bitcoin ethereum um and and others in the d5 space are the very first examples of what i'm describing right these are networks that um were built operated and owned by technologists developers um and enthusiasts who are sort of naturally the first to recognize the value of these digital tokens right like it's it's no wonder developers were sort of the first to grock it um and technologists like yourselves and and and so we are seeing this in real time where you guys self-describe work for a protocol right you work for the growth of the network um this i think we're just in the very early innings of this becoming sort of a very mainstream phenomenon where they're they're in the near future i think with one or a few breakout successes that are more consumer-facing this will become the dominant model for building new internet platforms because um it's it's just the most market-driven strongest way to drive network effects and growth so we're going to talk a bit more about this new crypto toolkit and building out the ownership economy in a minute but before we do jesse can we talk about some of the old tools that we have because i think there's probably uh some folks that are listening who are just like yeah but you know do we really need blockchain for this a little bit right so uh a couple of things one is we have this idea of the the passion economy that's kind of been kick-started in uh web 2. right so platforms like kickstarter like patreon like substack which we use for bank lists where instead of it being sort of an attention driven type economy that is the base business model for youtube twitter and facebook we sell ads for your eyeballs for your attention um like patrons effectively can start to support content producers so that's one but but we also have other elements i mean you mentioned employee stock options but we also and i know you talked about this before we also have co-ops like rei that are kind of like companies but instead of owned by shareholders they're actually owned by like members who are users and purchasers of like rei products say can you comment on some of the old tools before we get to the new tools here definitely yeah so so first on passion economy platforms um i see um passion economy platforms is very adjacent to ownership economy platforms i would say the ownership economy is a very linear extension of the progression of of the internet as a whole and so to answer this question i'm actually going to rewind the tape a ways back before the passion economy and and first just note that one of the most surprising things that to happen in software you know generally speaking in the last 20 years is the success of open source software um you know if you 20 25 years ago if you told um the average computer geek that the most you know valuable companies in the world were going to have been built on top of open source software they probably would have laughed at you that would have seen like a crazy idea but having grown up having grown up in the 90s with windows dominance i totally agree with what you're saying that's that's totally the case right and and so the remarkable thing about where we are today is that open source does power trillions of dollars of economic value and open source software is software that's built by a community of developers all over the world it's crowdsourced um and then with that open source software we've gone and built you know these valuable companies many of which crowdsource their value again from their users so you know content products we talked about that and just now we're getting into a phase where um people are starting to recognize the value of those contributions and that's what the passion economy is about right so the passion economy is enabling people um on the internet to pay for for you know the work of creators that that they want to see more of and that's great that's like i think the very logical next step now what comes after that is sort of what i'm interested in and i think where this is where this goes is back to sort of where we started the conversation which is the creators of um of value on platforms like kickstarter patreon sub stack are the the users the people driving subscriptions right um now why shouldn't it be the case that those creators are able to earn all of the value that they contribute to the platform so in addition to just the value from that they're getting from their subscribers can they get involved in a deeper level in and in op building and operating the platform tailored to their needs and if so how should they be rewarded for that now substack kind of did this in an ad hoc way and that they gave some of the um some of the creators stock options in the company and i think that's sort of a good first attempt but what i think that points to is doing that same thing at scale how and and that's where you start to run into problems i think if you want to start giving um stock options or equity to your users at scale at the scale of you know these large internet platforms you start to run into headaches pretty quickly because stock options are you know big legal contracts and you know there's tons of paperwork and you have to be in a certain geography and so it's not digitally native or internet native i should say to scale that up to to to the um to the size of um the most valuable internet platforms today tokens on the other hand and smart contracts enable an internet native sort of uh movement of value that can scale and that's why i think they're the right tool for the job um that said you know it may be some time before um we see that happening in in mainstream consumer platforms today you see it happening in in crypto networks um my view is that it's very quickly going to cross the chasm to consumer-facing marketplaces as well um but it may be it may be a few years out um but but that's i think that's why i think that the ownership economy is sort of a natural extension or natural progression from the passion economy now how about rei and maybe for folks that aren't even familiar jesse with um like what a co-op is yeah uh maybe you could like talk about what co-ops are and maybe like something like rei and um like that that current tool set yep absolutely so yeah so a few years ago i don't i the question dawned on me you know i'm here i am thinking about networks owned and operated by their users um and and i started to ask well what are what are other examples of organizations that aren't owned by shareholders but are actually owned by users or customers or or suppliers and and that's what got me onto um a train where i researched uh cooperatives mutuals credit unions turns out there's actually a lot of of organizational structures that are owned by members or users rather than shareholders and and so i think there's a good analogy between crypto networks or ownership economy platforms and um cooperatives for example and rei is is one of many multi-billion dollar cooperatives there's there's others like land of lakes butter is a 24 billion dollar cooperative it's a dairy cooperative i had no idea not just not just butter but yeah it's it's it's a it's a massive organization and it's comprised of uh dairy farmers who actually own um the means of production and the goal of a cooperative is to maximize the benefit of of members so i'll talk about land of lakes first and then we'll we'll go to rei but in with land of lakes um you know a bunch of dairy cooperatives dairy farmers rather at some point realized it would be more uh cost effective for them to pull resources together and you know buy some equipment that they could all share in order to scale up production rather than each of them having to buy that equipment on their own um you know they they pulled the resources and and that was a way to increase each of their bottom bottom lines respectively um and so that was sort of you know the inception of the cooperative similarly rei started as a um as a group of outdoor enthusiasts who wanted um you know very specialized climbing gear that nobody was making they were the only only ones who wanted it the only ones who knew how to make it and so they pulled resources in order to go produce it for themselves and then as they did that turns out there was a bigger market there than just them um and so they were able to scale that up but if you are an rei member you know that when you shop there um there's there's sort of member benefits namely um whatever profits are left in the cooperative at the end of the year from from all the stuff that they sell you get a distribution or a dividend of those profits so by being a member of rei um you you get a dividend which effectively um amounts to to a discount on um on your purchases there over the year um and so again there's sort of a a a benefit to pulling resources and and sort of acting um collectively to to maximize benefits to the people who actually use the the goods or services of these cooperatives and so i think there's a a good analogy there um for crypto networks and ownership economy platforms in that you know the the optimal economic model for these platforms should be to maximize the benefit of of using the product or service for the users rather than for the shareholders and that's exactly what um cooperatives like rei and land of lakes have done now just one one last point on do why why do we need a blockchain for this i'll i'll again sort of um note that cooperatives are you know traditional organizations that have tons of legal uh overhead there's a lot of a lot of paperwork in fact even more paperwork than a traditional delaware corporation because you have to sort of specify you know the the benefits that member owners get from the from the co-op in the bylaws of the organization and so there's a lot more sort of customization that needs to go on versus a plain vanilla delaware c corp and traditionally that overhead i think has been um you know difficult for startups in particular to manage now we have new tools in the toolkit that enable you to express all of those rules and and sort of values that the the owners um want in code and so the the cost to building organizations of this type i think has gone down by orders of magnitude overnight with with smart contracts and so i expect we'll see a lot more digitally native cooperatives you know and you guys mentioned malloc who you had on uh recently they're they're an example of exactly what i'm describing yeah and so like the other thing going back to your previous is that um imagine being a startup trying to do this with all this documentation but then like trying to do that globally like extranet like across all of these various nation states and their regulatory structures that sounds like impossible i don't even know if an rei orlando lakes can kind of achieve that outside of like their you know nation states right that's right it's it's so i think i think in the case of those two um they they have managed to do it but again it's it's it's a nightmare um it's setting up these like sub entities and making it all work expressing all this as code is orders of magnitude improvement in terms of you know cost efficiency transparency accessibility and and so i think we're going to see way way more experimentation in this direction because of that one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up blockfolio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zappa reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed your ethereum address is a bankless bank account but here's the problem it doesn't have a human readable name it's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem it provides a domain name for your ethereum address so instead of telling someone to send you funds to xerox e3ba blah blah blah you can tell them to send funds to yourname.crypto a domain name for your ethereum address at unstoppabledomains.com you can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs you can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your dot crypto or dot eth or even zil domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names.com.org your bankless bank account on ethereum should have a domain name too so go to unstoppabledomains.com register a domain name for your ethereum address now unstoppabledomains.com so jesse the way that you describe the the lando lakes uh you know butter co-op and then the rei co-op as well it seems to be that they are thwarting moloch right and i'm really happy that this episode is coming right after our our moloch episode with amin and kevin because what it what moloch is is human coordination failure right but humanity is is a is a story of finding different ways and finding good people that you want to include in your in group to coordinate with to produce better outcomes right and so it sounds like you know the the land of lakes uh butter co-op it was a which was a group of dairy farmers that all figured out that if they coordinated together they could have net positive outcomes for everyone at large and then the rei model seemed to increase that right you know like just to double down on that that idea and what i'm hearing you and ryan discuss is that you know if we wanted to have something like a global co-op there's no platform to enable that there's no global co-op like mechanism until crypto right until the smart contract where you know the the where there needs to be a legal system of enforcement that is internet native and globally accessible in order to produce some sort of global co-op that is fit to kind of take over what we are seeing with you know the the traditional uh legacy financial model of the silicon valley startups yeah i think i think yeah i would i would sort of restate it that you know simply the you know traditional organizations uh you know whether delaware c corps or cooperatives have relied on um you know the the jurisdictions in which they form uh for their uh their documents and and enforcement and now we have new tool tools in the toolkit and those tools are based in code and the jurisdiction is the internet and so bitcoin you could argue is the first example of an internet native co-op it's a it's a platform where there is no company it's a network that's owned and operated by its users and then ethereum is the same thing but it extends the the functionality um beyond sort of you know store of gold or digital value and with smart contracts you enable any developer to build their own organization on top and and that's what we're starting to see happen in d5 and i believe that's what we're going to start to see happening across uh more consumer-facing verticals as well and that's that's what unlocks the ownership economy okay i want to connect some dots for some crypto folks here right who uh haven't quite viewed crypto in this lens before but um you wrote a great uh ownership economy article which we'll include in the show notes which uh everyone listening to this who's into this should go and read and uh you called bitcoin the first user owned and operated network at scale and i i think you called it that because basically um the users were the were the laborers it was one in the same and they were they also owned owned the capital and then you talked about um ethereum sort of in all of the the sub games that came out from that so like the um i guess sub uh ownership economies that that came out from that maybe we could talk about some of these examples like you can even talk about bitcoin or like what we've seen with snx uh the synthetics token or what we've seen with recent more recently with uni tokens can you give us some examples as to how we're seeing this uh play out in crypto through the lens of the ownership economy for sure so so yeah with with bitcoin i imagine most listeners know but you know the um the way the network works is you have a bunch of miners who who operate these these you know big intensive computing rigs um to secure the network and you know it wasn't always the case that you needed these these kind of highfalutin rigs with with tons of electricity and back in the early days you could do this on your laptop and so the the people who participate in securing the network securing the digital gold that bitcoin wants to be are rewarded for their efforts with new bitcoin and so what that means is they're rewarded with a stake in um the platform's native asset and the platform's sort of equity value and uh so so that i think was the very first example of this new organizational model um where the people who are you know contributing the most value to the network are earning the most value now i i think bitcoin because it was the first um you know had to invent a lot of things and one of them was was this monetary policy that the miners um earned these rewards and and that monetary policy is sort of fixed in the code of of the network um ethereum iterated on this a bit um so they had a similar model um the miners of ethereum earn new ether um a direct stake in the network itself however ethereum also did a crowdsale and so people who were interested in the vision of ethereum sort of described in the theorem white paper really were able to fund its development and and those um those people who did so were able to earn uh or or you know receive a ownership stake in the network they they got ether um in the genesis block and and so too did the developers so the monetary the initial monetary policy of ether uh already sort of expanded the adjacent possible of of who you can incentivize which stakeholders you could incentivize to build a successful user-owned and operated network and i think ethereum has done you know did that um very very well and that net today they have a really robust developer community because lots of the developers own ether you guys produce this podcast because you guys own ether right you want to see the network succeed um and now we're starting to see the same uh sort of tinkering with uh ownership distribution design manifest in other verticals so you mentioned uniswap uniswap is an exchange for crypto tokens it's similar to coinbase or binance but it's important and it's different in a few important ways um and and one is that it's a it's a decentralized exchange meaning the operations of the exchange happen on top of ethereum um and the the value of the exchange doesn't go to shareholders as it does with coinbase and binance instead the value of the exchange goes directly to the liquidity providers the people who trade on the exchange and make it valuable in the first place um and so another way of saying this is that the business model for uni-swap is the same as the business model for coinbase they both take a fee on transactions in their marketplace but what's different is what each of them does with the fee coinbase takes the fee and you know gives it to shareholders effectively um uni swap takes the fee and gives it to the users trading on the exchange and um and and that's what they've been doing from inception just recently they launched a uni token um which is a governance token that could eventually claim some of those fees um and they gave those um those tokens directly to uh to users that um not only provided liquidity um but for example you know bought some of their merch right so that they they are experi uniswap is an experiment in you know different stakeholders that participate in networks and how to incentivize them appropriately and i think the big work the big challenge the big opportunity in the ownership economy space is to iterate on towards a a very sort of um fair and meritocratic distribution of value for all the stakeholders in the network and and i think the platforms that succeed in the ownership economy but will be the ones that figure out the best ways to do that i think the most obvious lesson we can learn from the fact that uniswap is directing its fees to its users versus coinbase that's that it's directing its fees to its shareholders is that if you are a system that directs fees and rewards and value to the people that produce the value you are simply a more scalable system you are more you have a bigger tent there are more people that can contribute more total value to your system because they are being compensated for that and so as a social organization as a organization of people the uniswap organization is far more likely to scale and because of their ability to coordinate more people and coordinate more value in ways that incentivize more alignment and once again this goes right back to what we were talking with amin and kevin on the moloch episode where we were saying whichever institution whichever system can coordinate better than is competition will become the new status quo yes exactly right and one thing i just want to highlight is you know coinbase is um is a company with you know a few thousand employees i don't know exactly how many but somewhere somewhere around 5000 employees it's been around since 2012. um i think at their last fundraising round they were valued around 8 billion and uh uni swap by contrast is was was initially built um by a team of of six or seven people it's two years old founded in in 2017 or sorry early 2018 um and over the last two months it's outdone coinbase in terms of the volume traded on the exchange crazy um and so i just want to add in some something that's not financial advice but coinbase is theoretically valued at somewhere between like 20 to 30 billion dollars where uniswap is currently valued at two to three billion dollars so there's perhaps some discrepancy there right and and and what what i would say the the point i'm trying to land here is that networks that give a direct ownership stake or you know a make better economic alignment with their users a feature of the product can grow way faster with a much smaller team because you you end up getting production capital or you know real meaningful contribution directly from your user so rather than skip raising a bunch of venture capital scaling the team inside the company why not give ownership directly to your users and scale the the marketplace with the help of of of those of those users rather than um you know employees and and that's i think uni swap is an early example of um that proving to be a very very effective model and there are other examples i can go into in other verticals you know i think bitcoin ethereum uni swap they're all more or less you know financial use cases and you know bitcoin is uh you know digital gold ethereum is internet money and and and then uni swap is an exchange for um for crypto tokens but you're starting to see the same model play out in other verticals that are less technical less financial in nature and we can talk about that too and before we do jesse so like um we're talking about uniswap providing possibly a better coordination mechanism and you know beating its centralized exchange counterparts who don't have this ownership economy i want to go back to something you said earlier because i think it's super insightful and i don't want us to to lose this um you talked about the biggest problem for uh protocols or even just in general networks fighting against other net networks is adoption right it's a network effect problem so we can see this in the the web world um the the reason you know people can't just switch to another facebook is because you know there's no there's no users on the facebook alternative right and so network effect is like you add a user to something uh on facebook and the value increases in a power law fashion so like a facebook with no friends has no value like a an uber with no drivers has no value that's what we're talking when we're talking uh network effect one thing that that you taught me i think that's an important lens maybe this is a little bit of a side quest but let's go on the side quest for a minute an important lens for for defy value accrual is that some d5 protocols can produce like code libraries basically open source code that can be forked right and and you talk about that not being very defensible versus other d5 protocols and just networks in general that are able to create entire networks that that have state they're able to capture value they capture like users and that sort of thing i remember early on you gave a talk i can't remember what it was but you sort of compared the difference between like a zero x right as kind of a code library back in 2008 18 versus a maker which was actually capturing state was capturing value inside of it can you talk a little bit about that like network effects and protocol value accrual and what you actually need to capture in order to get a good network effect as a protocol you know to be honest um i think since we first talked about that that framework of sort of uh libraries code libraries versus stateful networks you know my my thinking has evolved uh quite a bit and i think that's true um for a lot of people in the space so just to summarize that um that framework you know when you look at open source software and i'm not just talking about crypto i'm talking about any kind of any any open source software um the the uh value of that open source software um is not in the code itself it's in the deployments of that code and here's what i mean by that so let's take mongodb as an example mongodb is an open source database um that that anyone can download right when you when you download that code it's free it's it's like the definition of a commodity anyone can have it right and they can have it for free it becomes valuable when someone takes that code and they deploy it and they start to fill up that database with um with data you know with with users with with uh you know users photos and and then they you know the the state of that database is what's actually valuable because you know once you have user photos you can put ads there right so so facebook takes the commodity that is the mongodb database for example and makes it valuable by filling it up with state right now switching back into the crypto context right um there are a number of protocols um that are just code libraries meaning you know they um they've come up with a template for for smart contracts um and and then each um new user takes that template and redeploys it for their own purposes for example you know a lending contract between you and i we could instantiate that as a smart contract that's sort of a one-off agreement between you and i and then anyone else could could copy and paste that smart contract and use it between two other parties right so that would be an example of a library a library getting you know copy pasted two times a million times um and and there's no sort of network effect there each copy is its own instance of uh of the code library the flip side is um our networks that um are stateful right so some they're more like the facebook database that's filled with user data and examples of that are you know maker dow compound sticking with the lending example we could talk about compound what compound does is it pulls um it pulls value into a single smart contract that allows any any borrower to show up and ask for a quote and as as the pool grows in liquidity or the state of that smart contract grows in liquidity um the the the rate at which borrowers can take a loan gets better so there are real network effects there as there's more liquidity there's better um uh you know there's better pricing for borrowers and so more borrowers will show up and that'll draw more lenders now that that was the thinking of the libraries versus networks framework what we've seen though that i think is pretty unique to crypto is that liquidity is is a very fungible form of state um you know the fact is like you can very easily move liquidity from one protocol to another in fact you know there are tools that make it um one one click to do this and um and so what we've i think what we've learned since we first discussed this ryan is that liquidity is not a very defensible form of state that's an interesting refinement and like so why did you um make that refinement is it is it kind of examples that we've seen in the real world like uh say like um you know vampire mining as it was called uh where a clone of uniswap a fork of uniswap called sushi was created and started to draw some liquidity out yeah i think that's um that's a good example i think also you know compound has competition from ave another lending protocol and we've seen you know liquidity move back and forth between the two of those pretty fluidly um so so i think yeah there there's just been a number of examples where um the state of uh of these networks um has been less defensible than than um you know i once thought it might be and so it begs the question you know where is uh where are the defensible network effects in crypto um and and i think that's that's you know i'm my answer would be i'm not totally sure but here are some ideas um i think there's still defensible um defensibility in developer integrations right so there's there's a cost to a developer pointing um you know their front end at your back end and again they they are um the developer making that decision is doing so on the basis of the state of your back end right does this back end have data in it that's useful to my front end and um and and so it's non-zero cost for that developer to add additional integrations it may not be um you know uh a high cost but it's non-zero and so i do think that um protocols that are stateful um need to prioritize a rich developer ecosystem and part of that may be rewarding those developers with an ownership stake in the underlying protocol for the value that they're driving to it and so i think protocols that do that may end up seeing a lot more defensibility versus protocols that don't reward the developers that are integrating them and another thing that i think maybe is a little bit softer a little little more fuzzy is is sort of brand and security so those are two separate things but they kind of go hand in hand obviously you know if if you're integrating um with a a that sits beneath you in in your stack you want to be sure it's secure um and one of the ways that that you can build confidence is of course the track record and the brand of that protocol over time does this protocol have a a history of you know being very security minded and is that part of is that part of the brand of the protocol and so so that may be another sort of asset or or you know dimension of defensibility for protocols um and then and then finally i think um the other piece of this is when you're when you're a developer integrating a protocol that sits beneath you you want to make sure that the rug is not going to get pulled from underneath and and developers understand that very well because developers built on top of platforms like facebook or twitter only to see those platforms shut off the api or yank the rug from underneath them and so um how how can developers be sure the rugs go not going to get yanked from underneath well they can be sure if they in fact own the underlying network so again that's another reason why you may want to reward developers who are building on top with an ownership stake because they're the ones driving value and if they you know that through that ownership stake they gain control and control gives them confidence building on top so it's a sort of a a two-way street that's that's symbiotic between um you know developer integrations and underlying protocols and and i think that's something to strive for to create defensibility you know another note that dave and i have talked about so much bankless listeners will be familiar with this is uh this idea of uh credible neutrality and what we call kind of the the protocol sync thesis which it kind of goes off of what you were talking about with um like you know the first thing about you know developers uh wanting to connect to it and that being a network effect advantage and also the last with uh you don't want to rug pull right if you're a developer well it it you know the the analogy here is it's kind of like the uh the internet like tcp protocols right so um how useful would tcpip be if aol owned it or if uh the united states of america governed it right um it would be less credibly neutral for other companies other uh nation states to build on top of it but because of its credible neutrality you might call this in in your lens uh jesse like it's decentralization then uh you can be assured that you're not going to have a rug pool type event what's your take on that as a potential moat we're describing the same thing right it's credible neutrality i think derives one way to to derive credible neutrality is through user ownership in other words if users own and operate the platforms on which they build or on which you know or that they use they can develop uh trust and exercise their will to ensure that those platforms remain aligned with them and that's how you avoid a rug pull so i think i think we're we're describing the exact same thing and and that you guys call credible neutrality and that that i think is a very powerful moat for protocols if if developers feel that the platform is credibly neutral they will be much more confident building on top of it and and and that's how you you know you lock in network effects because again there is a cost for that developer to switch thereafter okay that's great side quest concluded thanks jesse like we understand about network effects now and your take on it um you also mentioned earlier that for now we've seen a lot of financial type of use cases but that this ownership economy concept is much broader than just a banking story value finance that sort of thing i guess a few examples that um i know the bankless community has some exposure to uh one is a web 2 platform a social platform reddit of course um rolling out community tokens so so it almost appears like reddit is taking the ownership economy notion from crypto and glomming that onto an existing business model another example of course is like social tokens and and david just had a grammy award-winning artist rac on the bankless youtube channel to to talk about one of uh his kind of fan tokens or a social token might be another example of that but you you do think that ownership economy is broader than than just finance right how is it going to bleed into these other areas yeah so i think the examples you just mentioned are are good sort of early experiments i think i think the reddit experiment is really interesting that said you know it's it's usually not the case that sort of incumbent platforms are the ones to break through um with a new technology innovation it's generally i think an opportunity for startups um and and so you know what rac is doing what um what zora i think is really interesting what foundation has been doing um with helping other creators tokenize their work is sort of another example and zooming out i would the way i would um describe all of those experiments are you know consumer marketplaces that are enabling suppliers in the marketplace to make ownership a keystone of their product offering right so they're they're enabling creators um to connect with their fans who otherwise would be patrons in in passion economy marketplaces patrons that pay a subscription like you know like subscribers to vancouver's um and they're allowing these creators to experiment with the intersection of patronage and profit so not only are you you know someone who's excited about the work that this creator is doing and paying them monthly you're able to actually invest in in their success and get a token that gives you access say to premium features like you know bankless users have and that aligns the incentives of the creators and their audience and i think will eventually lead to a different mode of creation where it's not the creator creating in single-player mode it's the community around the creator contributing to creation just like platforms um you know internet platforms uh crowdsource uh their their value from their users right so it's it's it's the same idea just applied to um a different sort of community that's creating a different kind of value in in sort of consumer or or cultural goods and um i i think this can also eventually happen at the platform level itself so beyond you know rac or bankless creating a token for for each of your respective communities i think we'll start to see the tools that these creators use um also start to employ a similar model where um the creators on the platform are able to earn some of the the platform value directly um and that's exactly what reddit is doing um you i think you're starting to see it in in other consumer-facing verticals for example um rowley is uh is a platform for um for games video game studios and uh and streamers um that allows each of them to respectively earn ownership in the network itself um and so you're starting to see more and more experiments in increasingly consumer facing verticals where ownership is a keystone of the product offering you're you're showing up day zero when no one else is there because you're able to contribute to this platform and earn your share for doing it you're literally able to make money in in a new way that other platforms don't offer you and my view is um once there's a breakout success here it's going to be a zero to one moment where platforms that aren't offering their users this kind of compensation for their contribution are not going to be competing on the same terms as those that are and that's how the ownership economy wins it it it's you know it's one of these things where uh everyone who's sort of not on board with the idea today is saying well look that's not how platforms have been built for the last 20 years why would it be any different going forward but once there's one breakout success that that you know um hits a home run in the consumer world i think it's going to become par for the course and everyone will will be rushing in to do it so jesse i've been hearing different derivatives and different ways of people articulating very similar things to what you've been articulating here on this podcast today and what you've also articulated in your writing there's a lot of resemblance to kind of the by the user for the user ethos that we came out in 2017 and a lot of a lot of the ethos has been kind of you know being tossed around since 2018 2019 and now it seems to be like as as a community we've really been able to focus on what we've really been talking about and i think you are the person who has really been able to articulate this thesis the the most clearly and and which is why we're bringing you on the podcast but what what have you seen in the last years or so that has really allowed you to formulate this thesis like what what has happened what are the experiments that have caught your eye that have really allowed you to formulate this thesis in such an articulate way yeah well so i i think um first off i got into this space um as an entrepreneur before i got into investing and that was back in 2014 i co-founded a company called mediachain labs and our goal was was actually non-financial in nature we we wanted to build what we called a universal media library that would enable creators on the internet to capture more of the value that they create across platforms and and so you know in short the idea was you know bitcoin is really good at tracking this digital asset this financial asset what if you took a system with similar properties and used it for a different kind of digital asset instead of a financial asset how about a digital media asset an image a video or song if images videos or songs on the internet could be attributed to their creator in the same way bitcoin is attributed to its owner then you could enable those creators to capture more of the value from platforms that distribute their work that was that was the goal um and so i've been in the space for a while with the same goal in mind i think the the thing that's changed for me is how i define creator so rather than limiting it to media creators i've expanded it to include all kinds of creators developers right that are building these platforms you know people who are marketing these platforms everyone's creating some kind of value in the products and services they use every day online and so i would say that the thesis has been you know sort of a cornerstone of my involvement in the space from the from the get-go but what i've seen recently that i think is encouraging um you know back in 2017 we we saw you know the rise of um of of like ico tokens that sort of you know pie in the sky had the same idea many of which didn't deliver a lot of bad actors um and and so that that was honestly a bit of a distraction but what did happen in 2017 that was pretty profound is a ton of developers rushed into the space right like a ton of developers took an interest um in in platforms like ethereum frankly and and a lot of those developers stuck around and why did they stick around well because you know they own ether and or they they own some token and they're working to build the value of that uh the platform um token right so the i think that was that was encouraging is seeing um how effective uh you know this model in in the case of the ethereum community has been at attracting developers to build out this ecosystem that was 2017. i think today 2020 we're seeing um experiments largely in d5 that have been very very effective at driving growth and adoption you know i think this has come to be known as liquidity mining and yield farming which you guys have covered extensively so i won't explain it in detail but you know the the in short by distributing um platform tokens directly to users uh these these new financial marketplaces on top of ethereum have been able to to grow their numbers really really quickly now i think there's a lot of problems with the distributions um that some of these projects have deployed and that they've they've sort of optimized for short-term flash in the pan growth rather than sustainable you know and defensible growth but each time a new financial protocol distributes ownership directly to their users you know they're iterating on the model and they're improving and i think we're very close to establishing some some best practices that are going to lead to repeatable and defensible um organic growth over time and and so that's that's what's you know gotten me really excited lately is i think we're finally starting to see the ownership economy thesis play out at the layer of applications that end users use rather than um you know the platform or the infrastructure layer that developers use and i think that's going to continue all the way till we get to consumer marketplaces and consumer social i want to address a question again for the listeners who are a little more bearish on this about kind of why a blockchain i know we talked about it earlier but here's something a bit more specific so when someone asked me to describe um a token from it it wasn't binance like bnb but it's it's similar to that crypto.com is an organization they have a token called the mco token they had a token and the way i described it as uh to this bankless user is like i think of it as kind of like a loyalty token right so almost similar to airline miles hotel points starbucks points that you earn for doing specific things and you know crypto.com is an entity kind of awards you for doing things it wants to incent in its platform like a loyalty point like it's like a hotel point now one key difference is of course you know the the the token itself the crypto.com token is on crypto rails so it can be like exchange in the entire d5 economy but i want to go back to the skeptic's take is like um are is what you're describing with like fan tokens with rse and reddit and this sort of thing don't we already have these in the analog world aren't they just called airline miles hotel points starbucks points that sort of thing what's the difference here yeah there's definitely similarities um but i think i think they're they're pretty different in important ways and you know the crypto.com example one that's very similar to that is you know binance has has a token bnb right um and and i think it's it's not fair to say that binance is entirely community owned and operated like cz owns that company along with you know its shareholders however you know the binance token um does confer the holders of it with a share of the platform value because they take you know revenue from the platform and buy back and burn those tokens at least last i checked in that's how it worked um and so you know i think um ownership in the ownership economy is a is a pretty broad design space right um i think in um in networks that are sort of more crypto native like ethereum and you know and uni swap and compound um those tokens directly control smart contracts on the blockchain there's no other way to do it right um but with finance you know you could imagine that you know they have a uh they don't use a blockchain for their loyalty program or their revenue share program they use legacy rails so so why are they doing it this way i think it's because blockchains are the right tool for the job when it comes to distributing value at internet scale right so there is a cost to using the legacy financial system especially when you're trying to move value all over the world right there's a bunch of non-interoperable um financial rails that that are expensive to use um and are subject to um you know the whims of of of the operators that run those those networks crypto is a credibly neutral platform on top of which any developer can build and distribute any kind of value um and so i i think you know much like the internet was an open permissionless incredibly neutral layer for experimentation we are going to see lots of experiments of you know what it means to make ownership a keystone of your product experience and some of those um will be on the crypto native end of the spectrum where there's literally no other way to do it and and others will be on the end of the spectrum where it's more of a hybrid model and i think both are valid experiments to run like social tokens are not fully decentralized they depend on the creator right but when you produce this token on a blockchain it's way easier way less costly to distribute that value um to people all over the world than it is to say use stripe and stripe probably wouldn't even let you do it right so there's there's a lot more room for experimentation there's a lot more design space by building on top of a blockchain it does seem like we keep going back to this idea of iteration and experimentation and crypto facilitating that whereas like the traditional world does not facilitate that which is super interesting kind of comparable maybe to the iteration and experiment uh experimentation of the early internet but i i want to tie this um into d5 a little bit so for bankless listeners who've been on the journey with us one of the big questions we we always come back to and ask our guests is when is defy going to go mainstream like what's the catalyst going to be uh you wrote a really interesting article jesse where you sort of defied divided the the that question into three schools of thought you know you said one the the people will come basically bank the unbanked is one school of thought one thesis for when defined why d5 will go mainstream you said secondly another school of thought is that the institutions will come so wall street wants to be part of this global casino they start issuing stock and tokens and you know jp morgan issues their stablecoin and they become all about it so the people come bank the unbanked the institutions come wall street uh you also said that there's a third path that people talk about which is an entire economy will be built around this and that includes real things that you can do that you can't do in other economies so like non-financial types of applications so similar to kind of the the the fan tokens the nft idea that you were talking about earlier and then he said something which is kind of interesting to me and maybe contrarian a little bit to um what we what we often talk about in bankless which is you're much more bullish on the third than you are on the first two can you talk a little bit about those kind of three schools of thought and um like why you're bullish on one versus the the other first let me let me just sort of qualify this by saying that i think um you know the question or the title of that blog post is how does d5 cross the chasm so it's specifically trying to address the question of how it becomes sort of like a mainstream phenomenon and and so the first two schools of thought you know bank the unbanked um and uh and sort of wall street or institutional casino i think i'm less bullish on those simply because i'm i'm not sure that's how you capture the the hearts and minds of your you know your average western consumer which is sort of who i'm talking about when asking that question right um and that's okay because it it you know it means that d5 still has a ton of room to grow even without the you know the the western consumer user in mind right like the there's a ton of room to grow if it's if it's a wall street casino there's a ton of room to grow if we bank the unbanked but the question is how does d5 cross the chasm and sort of you know get mainstream western consumers to care about it um and there i the reason i'm bullish on the the third uh sort of school of thought that you know there has to be a real economy here is is i think informed by um by the way you know finance works in in the traditional world like finance as an industry um doesn't exist in a vacuum it it exists at least in in theory to service an economy of real goods and services right the financial industry is a service industry and it's in service of um of of other real industries industries that produce you know gdp and um that's not to say finance doesn't produce gdp but you get you get my point right it's a service business and it's in service at least in theory of um of these other industries it's not um in service of itself or at least it shouldn't be or can't be um entirely in service of itself for very long and i think right now we're in this sort of um interesting phase in in um d5 where by and large um a lot of you know crypto tokens and d5 protocols are still used for financial speculation so that's that's kind of finance in service of finance itself i think it gets really interesting once you start to see the ownership economy thesis play out and you do start to see platforms that produce products and services that are not financial in nature but use these new financial rails to distribute the value of their product or service the value of their industry directly to their users and once that value is running on these rails the financial services that have been built through d5 to you know to support it get a lot more interesting and i think you know just to make that concrete imagine you know you um you buy uh you're a fan of rac you buy his token right um and you use that token maybe to i don't know you know get a one-on-one meet and greet with him um you know a few months from now what what happens if um you're able to take that token and then go use it as collateral to go get a loan um you know so you can buy another creator token and support the next creator right like i think that's when d5 starts to get interesting is when there's these these other products and services that have nothing ex you know explicitly to do with finance um that start to play in the defy ecosystem that's that's when i think consumers will start to realize wow this is way better than my bank where i can't do any of this and that you know that's where it clicks ryan i'm seeing a lot of similarities to what jesse what jesse just said to what andrew steinwald said on our podcast about nfts where andrew claimed that the nft ecosystem will be orders of magnitude larger than defy because nfts are the property that you know financial assets uh you know are used to purchase it's the actual property that we value rather than rather than the the currency and i think what jesse's saying is like you know d5 is great and defy is valuable in of itself but there's no real point to a financial system if it's not supporting something else and that something else could be orders of magnitude bigger than the defy ecosystem that underpins it jesse does that resonate with you yes that's exactly exactly right now on the head it's so cool because uh you know i i actually think i agree with your article right with with kind of the addendum that it feels like these three things will grow together so um the economy becomes much more interesting it becomes much more interesting for rac to put his fan token on a network like ethereum that has an ecosystem of banking and financial protocols basically right like it has uniswap and it has compound and it has maker and it has this robust ecosystem of like banking users too and so it seems to me that all three of those things kind of grow together like even the the second the institutions well that just lends credibility to the platform itself which again makes it more interesting to build a real economy on top of uh would you agree that's kind of what you're saying here totally yeah i i do think i think i even mentioned in the post no i think all these things are going to happen sort of in parallel i guess you know transparently i'm i'm rooting for the third because i think we need just more entrepreneurs experimenting and building the ownership economy because that's going to be that's going to be the thing that allows d5 to really hit escape velocity so i think all three of these things will happen in parallel but i think this goes exponential when we start to see tons of of goods and services um you know whose value is is tokenized and running on these d5 rails so on that if if i am say a founder and i am looking to build something with an ownership economy in mind or i'm even like a speculator looking at what you know that this token comes comes out with and i i'm putting it through this this lens what does a founder need to do to begin with this new model in mind like do they go to sandhill road and go race from vcs uh like the traditional kind of web 2 startup does or is it a little bit different yeah so i i think that ownership economy platforms are going to follow a sort of different life cycle than uh traditional venture-backed startups do what i mean by that is you know it is explicitly the goal of an ownership economy platform to distribute ownership of the platform directly to users as a tool for growth right so whereas traditional startups go to santo road and they raise subsequent rounds of fundraising to fund uh you know additional growth of their platform uh ownership economy platforms seek that growth from their users and reward their users directly for their contributions to growing the platform what that means i think is these ownership economy platforms will exit to their community of users exit the value of their platform you know which traditionally is an ipo or an acquisition they will exit to the community of users fairly early on in the life cycle of the project right because that's that's the goal that's how you grow it i think the implication is that these types of projects will not raise as much venture capital as traditional startups instead they'll raise financial capital and production capital directly from their community of users through a liquid token [Music] and so what i think that means is that seed stage or pre-seed stage even investing is some of the most important capital founders will take right because it may be the only capital that they take and it's the capital that helps them get to this important milestone of exiting to the community of users um and and that's why you know variant fund is set up as with a dedicated focus on pre-seed and seed investing i think that's that's the big opportunity in the space now there's al there's a there's other schools of thought that you know projects shouldn't raise any venture capital at all right that they should only um uh you know distribute tokens directly to users and and not at all to investors but i do um want to push back on that idea a little bit because i think um the key thing that kills any kind of startup is a lack of focus you know you have to build a product that people actually want and that requires you know focus it requires leadership and sort of quick execution and iteration and at the earliest stages of a startup i think it can be a distraction or a cause of you know the catalyst for a loss of focus if you have to make every decision about what your products gonna do what it's gonna look like um by committee i think i think what you wanna do in the very early days of a crypto project is build something that people want and then very quickly once you once you've validated that people are actually interested in using this thing start to effectuate a distribution of ownership to those users to encourage them to help you grow the platform or service so all that to say i think there's a role for very early stage financing in the ownership economy but there's likely less of a role for from you know big vc funds to to uh to uh exponentially scale these platforms through subsequent rounds of financing because all that growth is going to come from the users directly rather than the vcs and i think we've seen a ton of uh evidence for this especially in the last you know few months of ethereum and d5 right uniswap is this place where assets can come to access liquidity and can really be a good distribution mechanism and then we've also seen compounds you know go through very few seed rounds before getting a token out into the ecosystem and you know in stark contrast to you know legacy companies that go after seed seed round after seed round series a series b where there's all these investors who are front running the public stock market right like the ipo is where like all the rest of the world gets to have access to to some capital some some equity and every single seed round or series round before it gets to the public stock market are you know privileged parties getting in front of you know the rest of the people and what we're seeing these d5 rails operate as are quicker turnaround tools to getting ownership into the hands of the people and it seems to be the faster that we can get ownership into the hands of the people the sooner we can get ownership into the hands of the right people and kind of have that emergent incentive uh uh that that correct incentive emerge organically out of who wants to get incentivized quickest that's right yeah exactly right i think that's um that's that's the key to growth and that's why these platforms follow a different uh a different like life cycle i guess i just one thing i i also wanted to just add on to what i was saying is you know what i just described this process of um you know first building a product then very quickly as soon as you're ready um distributing a token directly to your users that's that's an idea i've called progressive decentralization um and you know a number of other folks in the in the community have um been talking about this idea of fair launches and a lot of a lot of folks have like put these two um concepts at odds with one another where you know you can't progressively decentralize um if you're fair launching because a fair launch sort of implies um at least aspirationally you are day zero distributing ownership to your users and then building the product um and i i think that's not um it's not the case that these two ideas are mutually exclusive um i think you can you know a better definition of fair launch is a launch that meritocratically distributes value to those that create it um and and so again if it's valuable for the team to be able to be heads down for a little while um you know building a product that people actually want then i think the team should be rewarded and separately the investors that backed that team and enabled them to go and build the thing in the first place should also be rewarded right so so i think um you know a better definition of fair launch is really about meritocratic distribution not about um you know pure decentralization and it's actually quite complementary with with my idea i was describing um which i call progressive decentralization so jesse it's been fantastic to have you and this has certainly been a journey into the ownership economy i want to conclude with this last question of what is next for the ownership economy it feels like we've got this primordial soup of experimentation and new tools but what's next and is there even a way to predict what's next when we're getting this level of experimentation yeah so i i'd say um what i'm excited about next beyond beyond you know um infrastructure platforms like ethereum beyond uh d5 is consumer marketplaces i think we're going to start to see uh platforms that you know historically would be called passion economy platforms start to lean into the ownership economy model first because many passion economy platforms are those that depend very heavily on um their creators for their their value and again you know pat one thing that's unique about passion economy platforms versus say you know gig economy or you know uber for example is passion economy platforms depend on the uniqueness of their users whereas uber tries to commoditize all drivers make every car the same you know every trip of the same quality passion economy platforms lean into you know your unique content on bankless right and so i think that's that's a ripe opportunity for for sort of cunning founders to explore um which is you know how do we give our our most unique our most valuable users more skin in the game in the in the success of this platform and again i think once there's one successful experiment there it's gonna unlock the floodgates and everyone's gonna gonna jump in on doing it and and right now i think the tools to experiment with this are in market today namely there's i think there's two important advances um that will enable this one is um we have stable coins right so you can now distribute the value of ownership in a medium of exchange that creators or you know mainstream users understand and and two um we have wallets that don't require you to write a 24 word mnemonic phrase and store it under your bed you can use tools like you know magic link or others that give you sort of a web to authentication experience while allowing you to access web3 or custody web3 assets including coins and and so you know web 2 par user experience plus stable coins i think are a big unlock for consumer marketplaces joining the ownership economy next jesse this has been absolutely fantastic it seems clear to me that all three of these things will grow together you know defy institutional adoption but the the real economy that everyone's been asking about like what like what's what are people actually doing in crypto this real economy might indeed be the ownership economy that you are talking about so thank you so much for guiding us through your thesis and this lens on the world it's been a pleasure to have you likewise thanks for the great questions it's been a lot of fun to talk about it i'm yeah glad to have been here absolutely all right uh bankless nation actions and resources so if you really enjoyed what jesse was talking about want to deep dive more there are four of his articles that you absolutely need to check out starting with the ownership economy thesis we will include those articles in the show notes as always also check out our recent meet the nation episode with rac where we talk about david talks about is a fan token that'll give you a take on that and also if you missed our episode with uh on nfts with with andrew steinwald that uh david referred to earlier we will include that in the show notes as well lastly david how we doing on five star reviews we're doing pretty good we're doing pretty good but we can always do it better as d5 grows and as the economy that that jesse cited grows we want bank list to promote that growth in the itunes top charts we are currently in the top 100 in the itunes investing and finance category and i think as the economy grows we think we can get ourselves into the top ten and the way that we do that is with your five star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts please open up your podcast app and give bank list those five star reviews thanks in advance for giving us five star reviews helping us spread the word sending this podcast to a friend as always guys risks and disclaimers what we talked about today is risky eath is risky bitcoin is risky so are some of these experiments that we were talking about in the ownership economy all of it is risky uh you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] [Music] you
