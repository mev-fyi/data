[Music] what's up coordination how you doing on the show today we have the one the only austin griffith who is a builder in the space that is building the build guild which is a mechanism for more and more builders to get into the space austin has delivered a ton of value to the ethereum ecosystem he's helped a lot of builders get their start in the space and we talk about his journey into ethereum and how he's now helping other developers get into aetherium with scaffolding build guild and speedrun ethereum.com so if you're a builder then you're going to want to listen to this episode with austin griffith he is the builder's builder we talk about his technical skills how he became an educator why he cares about public goods in this episode so if you're a builder if you're someone who's working on a d-app this is a great episode for you get oriented into the builder culture in the ethereum ecosystem really just enjoy austin's energies a deeply talented technical person just has a ton of character is super active in the ecosystem and he is creating a public good in the space of free education for builders and i just think that's the coolest thing in the world so without further ado

doing austin good i'm doing great how are you kevin pretty good the first 10 seconds of this podcast is just going to be us giggling at each other um so great to have you man you and i have worked together for a long time and and it's fun to mint a new podcast episode with you so let's peel back the onion tell me about speedrun ethereum and what you've been working on recently word heck yeah so speedrun ethereum is a curriculum after doing tons of mentorship sessions with lots of developers uh we finally kind of nailed down a curriculum of things that you should run through the the very first challenge is like building a staking app and it shows you what ethereum is good for and it teaches you through some of the gotchas so it's just a good education platform in terms of how you learn what ethereum is for and how you figure out you know the concepts in the space and and you know when people first get in they start using it like a database and it's like no no there's other stuff but this is like this cool vending machine you got to learn why it's cool right so you're uh working in devrel at the ethereum foundation speedrun ethereum is kind of like a educational course in which you can do 30-minute to 60-minute video educational stuff about building d-apps with ethereum and there's what like eight or ten levels something like that where the people can go through learning how to run be build with scaffold eath which is a development suite that that that you pioneered is that more or less right yeah exactly it starts to blur the lines there toward the end be between what's a challenge and what's a thing that's on austin's to-do list that he's trying to give off to you okay so you've created like a a tractor to get developers going down this funnel and then towards the end of speedrunning ethereum they're actually helping you build speedrun ethereum and this thing called the build guild dao uh so tell us tell us about the second layer like pull back the light on that so yeah so that so that's probably like build guild right so so i think actually maybe the first layer is scaffold eve and then the layer around that is speed run ethereum and then the next layer around that is build guild but if we look at the the layer that is build guild it's sort of like the incentivization layer right once the curriculum is there and people have the tools and they're working through things sometimes they need an extra push sometimes they need a good job sometimes they need to survive right survival funds and that's kind of what build guild is it's kind of developer ubi you're doing a good job you're learning you're you're contributing i can stream you a small amount of eth and you can survive on that eth while you learn more and either you know contribute back to the ecosystem or maybe find a product that you want to get into or i team you up with an artist and and you guys kind of like build something out so lots of different paths there but yeah it's an incentivization layer i think right so i think of scaffolding is like the ruby on rails of ethereum which allows me to rapidly prototype it's just really cool to build on scaffolding and to build a new function into a smart contract and then it automatically shows up on the interface in my id app just allows that scaffolding allows me to move faster uh in in building a d app so how many devs are building on top of scaffolding what's the footprint of scaffoldith right now it's really interesting because we don't really have a lot of analytics there's not a lot of hooks in scaffolding in terms of like uh knowing how many people are using it how many people are forking it we know that there have been you know more than i think there's almost like 3 000 forks of it right now so there's there's tons of forks of it that we can see on github but we don't track exactly how many people are using it we know that we've had you know more than two or three thousand people coming through speedrun ethereum we've seen two or three thousand forks of scaffolding but we don't have exact numbers on how many people are using it but it's it's cool to like go to a hackathon and just have like tons of people come up to me and be like yo i use scaffolding to build the thing and i don't even know about the thing but the thing is like a popular thing and it's yeah it's neat to see but we don't have great numbers on it to be honest got it so scaffolding or cypherpunk if we don't track things right there you go lazy fair or cypherpunk uh so scaffolding is basically like the ruby on rails of ethereum allows you to rapidly prototype d-apps and if you want to learn scaffolding you can go to speedrun ethereum.com and go through kind of like a level leveling structure and as you go through those levels you kind of get dropped in these telegram channels where you get introduced to austin who will give you stuff on his to-do list to build out the future iterations of scaffold ethereum and speedrun ethereum maybe we'll give you an atta boy or an atta girl on the back uh pat on the back and maybe we'll give you some tokens in exchange for building this funnel so like the externality of all this is just more developers who are building on ethereum faster and better did i conceive of that correctly even even to add on to that more products and prototypes coming out of it so like lots of developers a lot a lot of times a developer it's almost kind of a trick because a developer says how do i get hired in the space and i tell them well you should speed run ethereum and build this stuff but all the all the while i'm hoping that they don't get hired in the space i'm hoping that they build their own product and they create something new you know brand new in the space so so there's kind of like different you know levels of ejection out of the the build guild level one is to just go get hired level two is to build your own product and level three is to like kind of upgrade even farther and become more of an auditor and learn learn kind of the intricate details of the evm and and auditing and solidity right one of the things i think is so cool about scaffolding is that you've got a template for anything sometimes i dm you and i'm like hey we want to build this crazy nft experiment uh actually maybe maybe moonshotbots is a great example of this so like i have a call with uh someone associated with the get coin ecosystem in the middle of 2021 we're like hey what if we did an nft that supported public goods funding and i messaged you on like a friday and you're like yeah i use this scaffolding template and then i hack on it over the weekend and on like monday or tuesday you and i launched moonshotbots which was a way of minting new nfts on a price curve so every time you minted a moonshotbot you the price of the next moonshot bot went up like four percent or something like that and and you and i through like a weekend worth of hacking we're able to because of scaffolding we're able to launch moonshot bots and that raised like something like three million dollars for bitcoin grants and i want to say it was like august of 2021 so just like the templates already being available is like you're just starting on on third base every time you want to have a build as long as there's a template for it yep totally yep we got we have so many different templates for so many different things you go to scaffold eat and you type in you go to the branches and you just type in nft and there's like 30 or 40 different nft branches whether you want an nft that's like aging or you want an nft that uh is hidden for a while and shows up or you know just so many different kinds of nfts and marketplaces and dow tools and d5 primitives all built like they and they're kind of ugly too i'll say this like every good scavenge build usually looks like to start with because it's like a prototype right it's like this like kind of like white simple you know it looks like a html form and you can kind of get in and do what you need to do and it does the thing but it's still not like polished and ready for you know ready to be a product someone needs to take it off the shelf and turn it into that product yeah right what are the coolest branches that you have out there like you're on the frontier tell me what's the coolest thing you've seen on the frontier oh man i i think svg like svg nfts are so much fun right now so so there's probably one that i'm not thinking of that's like gonna be big in like two months and i should have thought of it at this moment but i'm kind of i kind of have tunnel vision about svg and ft's right now just like making an nft where it's all rendered on chain the smart contract itself basically draws the thing and so we've done we've done a handful of these on top of each other where we did optimistic lookies and then fancy loogies and then it's becoming a game can you explain what louise are because i know they are but the audience might not yeah that's a good point like lugi was just a really simple spg nft example we saw loot and a handful of cool svg and fts really like take off but to make them yourself it was kind of complicated so i made sure to make like a very very straightforward easy forkable example of how to make an svg nft and that was lugie's it's like a little just like a little circle and two little eyes it's like this little simple character and it's all rendered within the smart contract but the the coolest you know fun branches that i've seen around this are really kind of stretching it to the limit where you you have you have these loogies that are svg nfts but you can mix them together or you can have them all in a tank and they're like swimming around in the tank and the tank itself is an svg nft and when it calls its render function it calls the render function of all of the children inside of it that it owns so there's this weird composability stuff that you can do with this but but honestly this is kind of a like a flex it's kind of like a cool art art kind of niche thing it's definitely not changing the world and i think that like maybe maybe if we zoomed out and looked at some of the stuff we're doing around like fundraising some of the stuff we're doing around streaming to developers some of the things i don't know like even like co-ownership of things there's a lot of fun branches that i think might be more popular in the future but right now like svg nfts are hot and i think they're fun yeah yeah it's kind of fun to play with that composability like the lugies are just a very small sort of a ton atomic organism and then you can put them in a fish tank together someone could build a way to mate them with each other you could have them fight to the death they could race in like a mario kart type thing from there and so it's it's sort of neat to have that very basic building block and then see what the community does once that primitive is out there exactly yep so tell me about the other ones you're excited about you said streaming to developers and a couple other ones there's okay so let me let me just think through some of the fun ones we have like a multi-sig as a service branch which is kind of like a simple gnosis safe where you get a signature base gnosis safe out of the box it's actually hosted at multisig.lol but you can go to multisig.lol you can spin up a multi-sig uh you know disclaimer not it's not an audited contract like it's still a developer thing you shouldn't probably go do that and make a business out of it yet but you could and there's not a lot of there's basically one good multi-sig in the space right now and so this is just like kind of adding to that composability hopefully like adding to that ecosystem there's like a mobile app that you can fork of ours that's like a working app wallet like in the that that we sent to the the app store and it works there's uh just like lots of svg and fts of course uh a lot of games and challenges like the like we had someone build a dice game and then we had someone build something that attacked the dice game and it like shows how to do randomness on chain and this is this is more like feeding back into the challenges but these are like new challenges that were added to the speedrun recently from other people like exploring different uh uh kind of you know avenues of randomness we have a game coming out in a little while that's supposed to kind of kind of like crypto zombies like trying to trying to redo crypto zombies teach you the the the syntax and teach you how to build things lots of dexes and multisigs coming out i'm scrolling through the the branches the builds yeah so yeah so one of the things i so so you and i uh were co-work stream leads of a get going downward stream called the moonshot collective for a little while which was kind of like almost like get coindal meets build guild it's a place for developers to hang out and and build stuff together and and you and i kind of worked on a few prototypes together i'd love to talk about some of the tools that we pioneered there or i guess more or less you pioneered but um like the streaming streaming to developer thing i just think it's so neat how how that works because like as i understand it you get on a call with a developer and and and you like insta hire them on the spot and you start streaming them tokens and and basically you built this streaming contract where if they submit a report once a week then of what they've been working on then they continue to get paid but if they ghost you after that then they no longer get paid anymore so it's like a streaming that fills up and they have to claim it and empty it once per week and the mechanism what that does is it allows you to continue pulling them down the rabbit hole by making the hiring decision really quickly because you have that gating mechanism down down the line and i just thought that was like wow i've never met a hiring manager that will just insta hire people casually on the spot and start streaming them streaming them tokens so you know those kind of innovations i think are really kind of fun tell me tell me more about about that i think i mean it just kind of happened randomly right like i i built a stream but i realized like if the stream just flows forever then you kind of get yourself underwater by streaming to a whole bunch of developers but if you make the stream a withdrawal pattern and you have that withdrawal pattern kind of auditable and accountable to everyone then you end up with this you know there's there's probably about 50 streams right now that i have open but you know only a small subset of those are actually like live pulling from those so it allows people to kind of check out and go do things other things and come back and that was kind of something we realized about the dow is is we're going to have developers that kind of moonlight or go from dow to dao or you know come come work for us for a little bit and then go back so it's just it's just way easier to say hey you're contributing there's now this new stream pulling to you you know flowing to you you can pull from it as you need and you turn in your work and you price it yourself and it's trust based and then there's 50 other people like you and you can go see what all of them are building and turning in and they all are keeping their eyes on all the other streams so it's kind of like a social contract with everyone that you'll equally price your work and every once in a while we have some outliers that maybe don't do as much work or they turn in something that's not really priced and and maybe they do it once but they just don't do it repeatedly and i don't know if it's like human behavior or somehow we have just magically found good humans but it's it seemed to work you know pretty well we've had a couple people phase out but we haven't really had any problems with this kind of trust based model now that we talk about it a lot online i'm sure it can get attacked but people gotta be adversarial circumstances yeah so how many people you got on a stream right now i think 50. i think we have about 50 streams so we have so when you go for go into speedrun i think the number right now is about maybe two to three thousand people have started the speed run about when you finish the speed run you plop out and you land in build guild and you have a couple more like bigger challenges that you have to build they're kind of more open-ended so we have about two to three thousand starting we have about four to 500 kind of all the way through that it popped out in build guild and then we have about 50 that are on streams right now and probably another 30 or 40 that are just like getting random scholarships we using multisig.lol we basically have like a scholarship multi-sig and so that's easy for me to like yolo you know 50 bucks to someone who's just just contributed one small thing but that helps to like get them in and like you said give them an atta boy and tell them to take this eath and go register an ens address or go deploy a gnosis safe or you know spend it on gas or deploy a contract to make an nft so 50 i guess is the answer to that but there's kind of like a soft another probably soft 50 of like just little scholarships here and there to folks right okay um are there other ways that you're compensating developers in in the build guild that are sort of like augment the streams or like are you guys doing any tip parties or any sort of like inter-subjective tools to get people paid we tried we tinkered around with that we're just so async like we don't really get together that regularly we get together maybe every two weeks and it's just people showing off their builds so it was just a little bit too formal to to have like a coordinate model of like let's get together and pay people based on everyone voting we tried it we tinkered around with it it didn't it was just like kind of too hands-on for for build guild builders we're a bunch of like introverted nerds that just want to kind of we don't want to be in meetings we want to be working and building things right so so the in terms of like extra revenue other than the streams now and then there's maybe like a scholarship here and there but uh what i try to do is push developers toward the end to deploy their own nft like build build a small low limit in ft make make some cool art and i'll be the first person to buy that i'll buy a couple of them right so there is like this kind of like graduating them to building their own products that can raise funds for themselves to kind of keep keep going on their own right okay got it um it's it's like how many how many developers total do you think are like actually in the build guild right now it's the number is 400 and some but there was like a quick point where there was maybe like a civil attack where we had like maybe 20 or 30 come in like we we tried to program we we try to do as much like okay it seems like we need to reward folks at this moment i'm doing it kind of naturally in chat but let's try to build it into the system and there was like one time we built a function into build guild where you get to a certain point and it just gives you 50 to 100 blindly and someone immediately was civil attacking that so it was like well i guess we can't do it that way so so there's a small civil attack that led us up to maybe 450 450 people but i would say there's about 400 people like actual real humans uh in the build guild but i only honestly have seen about 40 of them face to face so it's a lot of anonymous folks that are just going through that i don't know anything about but that are kind of like right on the edge now of like possibly getting funds from a stream or from a scholarship or building something so we'll see right well where is this all going it seems like you've kind of built this like you're like the pied piper of ethereum developers over here where are you leading your troop of developers well hopefully uh honestly like hopefully there's not like hopefully it's not a traditional top down structure we're trying to build like a hyper structure of education and building right i think what you you even talked about a lot with moonshot is trying to build the machine that builds machines right we want right we want you have kind of a a self-fulfilling system in a lot of ways where there's more and more developers coming in and they love to contribute like all of them are just like this was such a good program how do i contribute back how do i do more and it's like go build something and let's turn it into a challenge that i think the overall goal is lots of devs coming into the space having the right tools in education to go on and do their own thing but if they do want to contribute back having a system that allows them to do so in a way that kind of keeps the machine going kind of builds more challenges and builds more community right so it's almost like it seems like it's almost like conway's game of life in a certain way like it's composed it's like building itself but there's no specific direction other than just having more developers into the space and they can go off and do whatever they want but they can come back to the build guild and have not a fraternity but like a camaraderie with other builders it's like a club that that that you're in it is the most introverted club ever too like when we got out when we get on the calls it's like me and 20 nerds in a youtube and it's silent is that why you're always you're always like bringing the energy level i got to bring the energy for all 20 of us here yeah okay yeah yeah which is i mean those are my people right folks that are quiet and want to build things so yes it is kind of like a fraternity but a very quiet fraternity right seems like there's a lot of just kind of like dry powder there from an intellectual and engineering perspective that could do a lot of good for the space um i'm curious like with these builders you know we've just talked so much on on twitter about the market being down and sentiment being down but are you seeing as many builders come into the space and if so has the sentiment changed at all over the last couple months i think i mean like for sure just my own ability to fund developers has shrunk right like like i i used to be able to yolo these streams a lot quicker and you know i used to have enough money that i could just be like yes go here you go go you know and so my own ability has kind of shrunk a little bit uh i i would say that like maybe some of the bs has gone down and there's more builders that are like a little bit more focused uh on like creating cool things rather than creating things that make money uh but yeah i don't that i don't know if we've even really felt the effects totally of the market going down yet in terms of these these like these numbers of developers coming in i i don't have a great you know uh feeling about how how it's going it seems like people are still continuing to stream in i mean uh influencers are getting like less likes and stuff like that but i would say that we still have tons of builders quietly building i don't know the market overall only only affects my ability to pay people more than anything i think right okay the dry powder thing i want to pull that thread though you talked about dry powder i think i think it's so true i think there's all these introverts that are building these cool things that are basically making prototypes and you've seen it too and i think it's something fun for us to noodle on a little bit some of these prototypes aren't really ready for mainstream sometimes some of these builders are building things that have been built before or aren't aren't quite products themselves and that's something that i think the build guild needs to do better at we need to do better at going pro if if we want to really like you know uh use this dry powder and and really like build a cannon and fire some cannon balls i think that we have to focus on going pro and and as a builder comes through and they kind of ship one or two things it's fine if those things are ugly and kind of do the thing they need to do but don't look professional but i need to start transitioning builders from building prototypes to building products and that takes a an extra thing and you you know it too right you you really have to polish something up and that last 20 takes so long to get it right and finding product market fit and all that kind of stuff so that's something i definitely want to noodle on with you just because it's something that we've kind of maybe even butted heads about a little bit in the past how how do i get these build guild builders that build things to 80 to to have a few things that go to 100 and knock a few things out of the park and that's that's kind of an open question right yeah building legos versus building totally polished product projects can be really tough but you know one thing i think get coin fell ass backwards into is an audience that already understands metamask and private keys and transactions you know we're building for developers and you just get so much when you're just building for an audience that has a computer science education or equivalent because you have to explain wallets to them and and so you know maybe that's like we're spoiled by our own and buy our own building for developers and that and another thing uh is the the the fact that now and then i'll have multiple teams working on the same thing i feel like when we first spun out some bitcoin dow stuff and we were building things there was almost this like maybe people even thought that we were like having two teams compete like like fight to the death style or something right and it's not at all like that it's more like you know go go fast alone or go far together when you go far together sometimes that means that there's going to be two or three teams trying different things in the area of this this particular challenge and so that it looks inefficient right you're talking about this bottom up emergent structure rather than a top down you guys do this you guys do this and we'll meet in the middle it's more like we need to get from here to here y'all y'all try to figure out what you can figure out we're going to try to figure out what we can figure out and you know there's funding to to try to work toward that so another like strange thing with the build yield other than you know we're getting a lot of 80 of the way there is this idea of there's a lot of redundancy there's a lot of developers building things that have already been built just to learn but there's also a lot of people building products that are maybe just like you know to add to the ecosystem but not necessarily become products so remember it reminds me of client diversity where you've got basically four or five clients that do multiple things and so just having different approaches creates anti-fragility in the ecosystem not just at the client level but oren and i did this this uh podcast episode about practical pluralism taking the idea of client diversity and bringing it up and down the stack and it seems like you've kind of stumbled onto the same sort of thing yep exactly and in prototyping basically like it's totally fine for multiple people to be trying out different prototypes and let's see what we end up getting and then let's use them and play with them and see how it goes refi summer has arrived and

like any decentralized society did soulbound stuff because it seems to me like that's that's kind of why one of my predictions is that the intersection of identity in web 3 is going to be pretty huge any any builds going in that direction or is is that not something you're excited about too it's like we're tinkering with it i don't think i agree though i think that there's a lot of cool stuff that's happening both like cross chain and off chain there's a lot of narrative that happens with an account that isn't always written on chain or it's not always written on mainnet and and there's a lot of different i mean like we're we were around back back in the day when did you say yeah back in my day we had the ids i remember them things yeah exactly like we were around for those i i've heard people talk about dids for like six years now and i feel like maybe finally someone's actually gonna like build a production level thing that uses them and it's gonna be a thing so it seems exciting but it's not something that i've tinkered much with but i'm super i'm all about it like the way the way we're working as prototypers is we're watching all y'all do cool things and as soon as vitalik says something about soulbound nfts and there's like four different prototypes of sold-out nfts coming out of build guild right so i think that maybe we're maybe we're not ahead of the game we're behind the game but we're watching for y'all to signal that this is something that's interesting and then we dive in and start building a bunch of prototypes around it well what i'm really excited about is is like soul bound nfts are like the i think that their soul bounds or tokens or dids are like the trees and you got to see the forest so i'm really excited about this idea of decentralized society which is basically you know i i issue you an nf a soul bound nft you're a vac that says austin has the best dance moves of any uh developer that i've ever known and you're and get coins issuing these nfts that say that you contributed to get coin grants and so basically what you're doing is you're creating these little uh intersubjective identities in which we're all attesting to each other and at scale that that that really liquid uh reputation system allows you to do a lot of interesting things with on chain identity because like basically you're building up these reputations over time you're accruing them and then you can do things like under collateralized loans to these people because like you know who they are or unless you know something about that where they are so there's like a network effect to build where more soulbound tokens dids creates more utility for those kind of things and more utility means that more people will build them and it's just about spinning that so i don't know i'm excited more i guess the tldrs i'm more excited about decentralized society than i am about slow down tokens and and that's why i'm sending some cycles there dope cool yeah and i one thing that like is gonna help with that is all of these layer twos and being able to make some of these attestations at a much cheaper rate and a much faster quicker you know a network that still has the same security as as l1 ethereum so i think that like we think about you know some kind of social app where we're able to communicate with each other and we're able to you know measure our trust between each other like that is really hard on mainnet ethereum but i think it's it's a lot easier on an l2 when those attestations are cheaper yeah totally are most of the builds or deployments that you all are doing are those on the main net or those on optimism or another l2 these days uh so whenever we need to do like fundraising things that's usually on mainnet ethereum just because that's where people are used to yellowing some eth but whenever we do something fun that's like a neat composable nft that requires you know some game mechanics in it that usually lands on an l2 uh the the lugies and the all the games around the louise ended up on optimism and that's kind of one of our favorites but we really shouldn't pick favorites there's a lot of great ones and we'll as long as they're evm compatible i'm an evmaxie as long as i can deploy using scaffolding then i'll i'll do it yes you know i was curious for you as a builder that's on the frontier i i read this post on youth research by vitalik about a rollup centric scaling roadmap for ethereum and i feel like i'm constantly explaining to people when they say oh the eth main net has had high gas fees that oh you can just use an l2 today and it's a thousandth of the price but it's the same security and people are saying i don't know what that is and i don't care if their aim is slow and so um what i'm really excited about is the builders on the front line starting to use l2s to deploy their apps and i think one thing that needs to really get better is bridging so basically being able to get your assets from the main net to the to the bridge in order to be able to use them on the l2s will make that modular blockchain not just scalable but as usable as a monolithic blockchain and if you look at like rainbow one of the wallets it's kind of hard for a developer to use sometimes because you want to be able to switch networks but you'll notice that there's not a lot of network switching a lot of the network switching is abstracted away from the user and that's probably what the future looks like in terms of am i even storing this on an l2 or l1 i don't even know i'm just hitting store and it's working and it's fast and cheap and like you said in the bridging and all of that stuff and kind of happens under the abstraction and the end user just sees quick and fast transactions right um i guess i'm curious you know how did you get into doing education i think you mentioned like your your parents are educators is this just like your web three hipster way of continuing their legacy of teaching people about how to be competent in the world possibly possibly like i i did have like both of my my parents were school teachers and my dad was a school administrator eventually so i i like educating i i have like an i feel like an empathetic brain that that's that's okay at doing the education stuff i think i got into the space at first i mean if if everyone if you if you don't say that like programming money obviously sounds like something you can make money doing then you're lying to yourself like a lot of people a lot of people get into this space because there's financial aspects to it right but i got in i started building games and building things kind of assuming that like oh wow like i'm a full stack developer i can i can be a millionaire overnight and i got in and just like built things and honestly i did not i was not a millionaire right and so i kept trying things and one of the things that really resonated with the space was when i built tools or when i showed off those tools so i i would say that the space selected me as an as an educator rather than me selecting education it just kind of happened to i got rewarded by the space for putting out tools and i got rewarded by the space just in terms of eyeballs and likes for for creating educational content and i just kept doing it like it seemed like it resonated with the space and so i just kept kept doing that thing right do you know how like every school teacher has a story about how like they ran into one of their students at the grocery store and they're like you taught me how to speed wrote a theory of thanks mr griffin yeah yeah you have that a lot oh yeah oh dude like every hackathon it's crazy so it's it's it's really really hard like i said we don't track any numbers with scaffolding it's really really hard to really provide anybody with metrics about how effective we're being but just like walk around with me at a hackathon sometime like eath new york was the latest one and it's just like person after person super nice coming up i you know i i got in i used scaffolding to build the product that we now have or at east denver this dude was like i was frying chicken and i went through speedrun ethereum and now i'm making six figures or something like that like that really was like someone quoted that that was like a real quote like people come up to me a lot and say that like it was something that was very useful for them and and you know that was the point i'm trying to make this thing like super sustain succinct and quick and obvious that like you get you get through the stuff that is most important and it gets you straight to building as fast as possible so i try to curate this thing as much as i can to make it good but i do get a lot of like really nice messages and and i really like lots of lots of hugs and handshakes when i go to a hackathon like a lot of random people too like i'll just be like walking down the street two blocks away from the hackathon and someone i've never seen before would be like austin what's up and like give me a high five or something like that like i just want to thank you for what you do and i don't know who they are or what what what they did or what i helped them with but there's a lot of those moments which i don't know that's awesome that's that's validating to me nice yeah we talk in the green pill book about regen web 3 being things that have an impact on people's lives and you know we can talk about how developers being in the space is a public good for the space because it increases the total like basically the number of d-apps in the space at like the systemic level but i think that once you get to that personal level of someone was working at subway or like frying chicken and now they're making six figures uh they're effectively you made them into a middle class person that can support themselves uh and commit code into the space i think that that's that's really what makes speed run ethereum and bill guild a regen project is the impact that it's having on people's lives i hope so i hope so we could even rewind a little bit back to the the birth of the uh the the meme of quadratic freelancer okay there was a time yeah go ahead i was gonna say if we're gonna rewrite we gotta make a like uh the sound effect for it like screw yeah there you go so wait you were a quadratic freelancer i sure was yeah i think i have uh let's see where is it i have this this machine back here is my my ethereum uh validator yeah you're really flexing that for those of you watching the video there's a terminal behind austin and it's it's minting blocks on the beacon chain but the the keyboard it's not this white keyboard there's another keyboard there the keyboard was a gift from you i think that you gave me at east denver a couple years ago it's the keyboard i uh i i built the git coin mvp with and uh you said it's still got some of the cheetos oh yeah beard hairs there's some i hope the beard hairs it's it's that's so we named it clacky and she's yeah there are many like her but that one was mine and uh i think that i gave you that that keyboard on stage at east denver 2019 2020 because you had made you were the number one person on the get coin leaderboard you'd earn this the most amount of money from from the bitcoin from the bitcoin grant system and vitality 750k yeah vitalik called you the first quadratic freelancer like when i when i graduated from college i had a master's degree in electrical engineering and the first year out of college i made about 70k and that was a shitload of money for me at the time a few years later i was just writing open source software for the ethereum ecosystem and i made the same amount through bounties through the git coin platform and that like that was the shift and then i came and worked with you guys came and worked at consensus for a while like that was the shift from i was working at a at a job where i was building this really cool piece of orchestration software that ran on top of docker and i couldn't open source it and i just wanted to find a new job that was more you know open source and ethereum related and that's how i found you and and those that that early 70k was like the thing that kind of kept me alive and kept me going and so yeah i was the first quad freelancer no big deal nice so vitalik defined that as someone who is uh living mostly off of donations from the crowd supported by quadratic subsidies so basically once you cross the threshold of not having to get a to get a job uh and being able to spend most of your time working on open source then you're a quadratic freelancer and and i think that you were you were the first early early adopter of get coin grants this is back before you're at the ethereum foundation and and so you made 70k that year and so that means two things uh you probably did pretty well in the gtc air drop you got a lot of governance tokens and then you also got clacky out of that that's true that's true of equal both of equal value in my heart equal sentimental value yes and there's no value that's right that's right there is no value to those governance tokens owaki will tell you um the uh yeah so so so it's kind of like really makes me happy to to hear that bitcoin supported you during your winter period during that bear market and you know like the fractal impact that you've had on all of these people in the space because you're still in the space so like the generator function of public goods is creating other people who are generating public goods and hopefully like they those people that met you at a hackathon are paying it forward from there yeah and what you do if you're like wondering how you do that go to speedrunatherium.com run through the curriculum at speedruneetherium.com even if it's like simple it'll take you two hours if you're a good programmer maybe longer if not but like it'll take you a while uh just to get the mental model but do speedrun ethereum get the mental model and then get in the build guild and we'll we'll start helping out or don't and just go build some stuff but the key is build things show it off give back to the ecosystem and repeat and kind of get in that loop of just like building random prototypes like you said lens is hot right now right go build a little social app with lens and scaffold ether show off you know foundry's a new tool right now go go pick up foundry and do a cool build with it and show it off to the ecosystem that's how you get started with this stuff yeah yeah and you'll make a lot of mistakes your first time earlier yeah uh you'll look like a jabroni for sure my first uh contracts when i when i built the mvp of git coin i put the json for each bounty on chain instead of starting an ipfs this is back with gas was like one gray so yeah get away with it yeah but it's just it's funny what you learned by doing things wrong the first time around and you you have to do it like you have to make the mistakes like if you if you're petrified and scared and worried about making mistakes you may never make that first step and even if you fall a few times on the first few steps like eventually you'll get it going and it's just about putting one foot in front of the other and getting started do you find that people have different learning styles because i find that i can like sit back and i can read a book about solidity programming and it doesn't register the same way as when i'm like banging my head against the compiler and or the the the processor and trying to get it to work like do you find that most people learn by doing or are people visual learners like what you're an educator how do you what are the distributions of different learning types people have i like i don't i don't know if i know the distribution amounts i do know that there are different learners right i know that for visual learners uh i made ethe.build and i have a lot of people reach out that like it resonated and it really helped them get over kind of like like tutorial hell or whatever right and and hopefully speedrun ethereum really gets people over tutorial hell but like you said if you're just staring at if if a book is just giving you all the answers and that's what you're staring at it makes sense and you get a good context of things but until you have to apply that and actually build something and you're challenged like it's it's not sinking in there's there's a moment on speedrun ethereum where you're on the first challenge and it's walking you through it and you get right to the point where you need to write a staking function you have to write the function and there's nothing there helping you other than write a function that allows people to stake and keep track in this mapping and at that moment your brain has to start creating and and if it doesn't then it's it's stuck and it's not and so i get everyone to that moment and push them as hard as i can to like make sure that blinking cursor starts typing stuff and they start building stuff i so different learners for sure if visual learners there's a lot of visual learners that learned uh kind of from ethe.build and they're able to get the concepts down i would say that scaffold eath is good for most there's there's a there's a couple folks that i've had come through scaffold eth that were definitely like a different a different type of learner where they wanted more text they wanted more um they wanted it to be more verbose and i was like okay make that like make the verbose thing and we'll give that out also and so there's there's also like versions of the speed run that are you know like pages and pages of text that can help you like really like really explain things but the way i built it on purpose was like a quick one-liner you know build this to do this and watch out for this and that's all i say and hopefully like i kind of get out of the way and let them work on it so definitely different types of learners i don't know what the cross section is of shape rotators verse whatever but but uh like trying trying to get the right material in front of the right people takes time and you got to try a few things before you see what resonates with folks it's a meme i've been heard a lot in a long time shape rotators versus words yeah but yeah i think it refers to visual learners people who can kind of like process things spatially in their mind versus verbal which is a slower circuit yeah and i think there are also some like kind of garbage memetic things along with that too that we're not supposed to be talking about so yeah maybe throw that meme out i think right um uh last question we only have like 10 minutes left how do you keep your optimism alive like you're one of the most energetic people you've been building through bear markets before how do you what makes you like wake up and want to do this every day you change a lot of diapers you do too probably there's nothing more fun than finally getting to my desk and getting to do work okay so so your bold case for if building out ethereum is that it's not changing a shitty diaper with your kids yeah yeah no i mean like these kids don't know austin no no and and probably good advice is well you know don't have kids build things it takes up so much of my time so optimism though like so much cool stuff comes out of the space if you if you are at all bearish on ethereum go to one ethereum hackathon and just catch the vibe go go from table to table asking people what they're working on what they're thinking about holy moly is that what i call it ether 2020 the vibe yeah yeah yeah yeah like yeah that was that was the virus that everyone got here you're right there is a lot of people who you know one thing i like about this space is that it's easy to get distraught about the the state of the world but when you can program political economies that um basically you can program governance and you can program your values into your money it just makes you feel like you can be a hot knife through butter through some of society's problems and build something better and a lot of that is still potential energy you know i don't think that nfts or d5 have really regenerated the world too much but there's a lot that we could build that could regenerate the world in the category of like quadratic funding and solving prisoners dilemmas and coordination failures so that's always the north star that that i'm aiming for but it's it's nice to meet other people like i always felt like i was alone until i got into the ethereum space and i met people at the at youth denver and caught coronavirus but also the vibes i think uh amine's talk at mcon was really uh impactful to me in terms of thinking about you know what what what's the end game for ethereum what when we're thinking about mechanism design and we're thinking about building these games for people to play and we're thinking about game theory and coordination who who could who could be our biggest target audience right and when we start thinking about basically this this game theory playing out at like a nation-state level and writing smart contracts for nation-states to stake their military budget or something like that that starts to get of course like we're way out in the in the hopium area here and we're you know taking bong rips pretty hard when we're having these conversations but there is a there's a possibility there's a non-zero possibility that ethereum smart contracts are used at a nation-state level to create coordination that you couldn't create before like if you if you explain simple escrow to someone and you know alice and bob want us you know alice has some shoes and bob wants to buy those shoes you have to have this trusted third party in the middle that holds both the shoes because alice and bob don't trust each other and and when you start to scale that out and start to program that escrow and start to talk about nation states not being able to get along and what could be the thing that creates that coordination this for the first time in history we may have a platform that could do it obviously there's a lot of things that need to grow and get bigger and a lot of a lot more adoption that has to happen but that like that kind of thing really gets gets gets me goosebumpy like i think there's something there for sure i don't know if i'll be around to see it but i hope so yeah so you're saying it's all coordination is what i heard it always has been okay um yeah i think that you know just learning about the prisoner's dilemma which is this game theoretic idea that when two people are able to coordinate they're able to create better outcomes for their shared needs than if they don't coordinate as a game theoretic primitive made me see coordination failures in prisoner's dilemmas all over a society where if only we could coordinate and um then then we could solve them and i think that what what's cool about ethereum is that uh in just web 3 in general is that it's this transparent immutable uh substrate for human coordination that we can scale globally and and and actually have trillions of dollars of assets in it so it's actually backed by something that matters and so if you view some we just had daniel schmuckenberger on the greenfield podcast he talked about global scale coordination failures and you know what if we could scale up coordination technology in order to coordinate better outcomes and solve some of these global coordination issues he's like really starts very small as an open source repo but once it's on chain it could get very big in in theory at least and i think that's the most exciting thing for me you talked about uh cutting through society's problems with a hot knife or like a hot knife through butter i don't like i don't even think it needs to be a hot knife through butter like right now i would say that there are in general i would say that people don't feel uh much agency in terms of changing the world or fixing some of these bigger problems they see them as i am this one little person i can have some small effect by influencing maybe but i can't change the rules i can't i don't have the agency to really change things and i think that this like a smart contract platform a trust minimized environment where people can stake in and have you know juan binet talks about incentives create an incentive toward the behavior that you want to see happen one single incentive create it correctly and and make that move and then on the other side figure out what the next step is and create an incentive to drive people down that step and if we do that over and over again we start making the world a better place and i think that we're we're giving agency to folks that haven't had that agency before and and it's an it's a new time i think for for for builders and creators and hopefully even nation states we'll we'll see yeah so you're saying that web 3 kind of makes people more agentic in that they can have an impact on the world uh whereas before you might be kind of like resigned to the status quo because you're a hacker you can't really do much about it but i guess you know the one area where i kind of get you know uh get off my opium and come up for for you know like a little bit of of just just like reality checking myself is that it feels like right now the space is more geared towards ponzinomics that uh like more capital rotates into the projects that have the most ponzinomics what would have to be true for capital rotate into projects that have the best impact um or are doing the best good for the world is there a class of long-term greedy investors and talent that can come in and work on impact owls or things that have that object level good for the world and like the example that i'll use is like you know like i was i was recording a podcast with uh biology this morning he was talking about how like commodities features like basically potatoes in the ground you can have people speculate on top of that but they're like speculating on the risk and that creates an actual function to the financial system in that like if a storm comes along and like kills all the potatoes i actually don't know how potatoes can be killed but like let's say there's some sort of risk with like a blight or something like that then like that financial engineering on top of that creates something for like risk management for the economy but like when it's yams like the actual like digital tokens that have no connection to the world and it's all like we're just breeding these like potatoes these digital potatoes that have no actual impact on the world like people can't eat a digital potato then it's not connected to anything so like how do we get how do we rotate into things that actually have an impact and are useful to people in their everyday lives in a way from ponzinomics do you think about that at all i think that's that's probably a little bit out of my wheelhouse i would say i'm at least one level of abstraction below that and i'm looking up to homies like vitalik and bigger bigger picture thinkers and you know when when they say hey we have a chance here if we could build this thing then i go build it yeah so i'm hopeful for it but it's not something that i i don't play at that level i don't think but what do you tell the builders that like you're pied pipering into the ecosystem are you like you know here's a project that wants to hire you but just so you know it looks like it's kind of like a ponzi like you know like where do you draw the line for the people that you're that you're taking on your wing i really don't run into that very often i would say now and then i'll have someone that's like hey i'm deploying this to bsc and i'm like what what the f why why are you deploying it to bsc like there's times where i'm like there's there's better chains that are more decentralized and decentralization is important here and you know you have to have the chat about decentralization a little bit i don't run into it too much where it's like you know i i i don't i would say i've gotten lucky i don't know there's there's like this luckiness about this do you think it's your vibe your vibes it might be the best people the vibe is like a no  vibe yeah for sure i like when when someone comes in and they're trying to make a bunch of money they're usually not talking to me right they're not like if you're looking to figure out how to pump a meme coin or something like that you don't come through build guild and and work with us i don't think a lot of these folks are quiet introverts that want to give back and and create cool things and just they get a lot of joy from building right well um appreciate you building a a uh rainbow rainbow road to public goods and regen projects where developers can work on on the public goods so uh keep up the great work austin is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say uh i'll probably think of something later but speedrun ethereum is the most important part if you're a builder out there go speed run ethereum right so you're saying i should speedrun ethereum at speedruneetherium.com you definitely should speedrun ethereum at speedrunetherium.com thanks kevin thanks for having me himself all right that's right peace awesome thanks for joining arts hearts see you thank you [Music] you
