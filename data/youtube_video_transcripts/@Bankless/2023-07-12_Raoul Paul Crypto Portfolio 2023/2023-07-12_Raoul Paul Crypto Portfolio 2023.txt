what does your portfolio look like today so this is summer 2023 what are you doing I don't change a lot so it's still 80 eighth bit of Solana small bit of Bitcoin and a tale of a few things that I bought that I'm not tied to so basically it's the same bet that I've had and I don't really change it I put money in when I could have you increased or decreased your net exposure to crypto so I haven't sold anything and then I added 30 40 in June nice nice good time to do that
