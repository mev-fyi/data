i think that many people in crypto have a toxic relationship with money i think it's because we have these higher highs we have these lower lows it's just like existing markets except the volatility is like 5 to 10 x and so we have these different kind of participants in crypto they'll be like the get rich quick tribe so this is the group that thinks i'm joining crypto i'm gonna become an overnight millionaire and what what do they end up doing they buy the tops and they sell the bottoms every freaking time then we have the youtube traders they enter crypto and they think they're part of that elite five to one percent who can outperform holding it goes well for a while and then boom they get completely wiped out then we get another tribe of like developers and technical evangelists who are like this whole money thing has like corrupted crypto from its foundation so let's not even talk about price anymore and we have like the flashy nfts that people are showing for status rather than the cars and the penthouses we've got people who feel bad about 5x gains because someone on twitter is showing off their 10x gain and then we have like the pumpers and scam artists
