[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i have jimmy mcneillis best known to you as jimmy.eth on twitter and other social platforms jimmy is an og in the space he is the founder of the avastars project which is well known for a number of things one of which is being an entirely on-chain art pfp project jimmy is passionate about on chain art if you don't know what that means in the context of this space you definitely should listen to this episode i think this is a really interesting ideological philosophical technical i don't know if you want to call it a debate but i would say topic that those of us who are really deep in nfts and deep in web 3 and blockchain culture need to be savvy about i think there are far too many people who don't really understand how the jpeg side of nfts really work works work and uh i think there should be a much bigger conversation that's being had about it and credit to jimmy who has been facilitating and leading that conversation for many many months now so was really excited to talk about it and it's it's super relevant right now because cyber brokers which has been like one of the hottest projects of the last few weeks uh is an entirely on-chain project so if you've heard people talking about that in the context of cyber brokers and wondered what the heck it means we're gonna really break it down in this episode and hear jimmy's perspective on why it's so incredibly valuable and important why we should care about it and uh and hopefully arm you with some talking points that you can use as you explain or onboard other people into the depths of web 3. the other thing that jimmy and i talk about and one of the reasons why i felt like this was a really timely moment to have jimmy on the podcast is the yuga labs acquisition jimmy is a huge apes holder a huge punks holder a huge mee bits holder he is a deeply relevant person to talk to when it comes to this recent news because he has stakes in all of these communities and and is just a strongly opinionated person which is something i love and admire about him he has lots of opinions on twitter that he shares quite openly uh he's he's a bit of a twitter ranter at times and so felt like it would be great to to really get his thoughts on what's going on here and what he foresees for the future so we dive into that towards the end of this episode uh and it touches on everything right copyright cco uh rights for holders jimmy has some strong thoughts on each of those pieces so we uh we dive into that as well i think you're really going to enjoy this one it does get a bit technical but i think it's it's important that we have these conversations this podcast is about going beyond just the pfps what are the what is the underlying technology what does the future look like and jimmy is just a wonderful person to talk to about all of that so we are going to hear a word from our sponsors and then without further ado my conversation with jimmy jimmy.eth jimmy mcmillis all all names to describe the one and only jimmy polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiomfinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs uh an especially special episode of overpriced jpegs as i think it's my first in-person interview jimmy mcnail is here with me known as jimmy.eth on twitter i'm so excited you are going to be my first in-person guest we're here in austin for south by southwest and this is perfect timing we are going to talk about uh on chain art super relevant given the cyber brokers i'll call it a phenomenon happening but you really ushered that in with your project avastars which we'll dive into and then of course major yugolabs news this week that i'm very excited to get your thoughts on as a major uh you know punks ape and me bit holder i feel like we could have no better person to provide their perspective so thank you for being here jimmy carly it's an honor and exciting i'm your first in-person guest i know i don't think i've had anybody in the studio i have a studio in new york i have access to but i have yet to have anybody in there so yeah kovid changed things right i know so now we're kind of recovering from that a little bit i think we've all either caught it once or twice [Laughter] once only once on my end but uh came close i think twice okay well let's let's just start with your background for anybody who doesn't know you're like wildly og in this space and let's kind of level set for folks there who you are sure so um i got started in the technology space in 2007 working as a partner of google's i was setting up at the time gmail for businesses basically i did that until about 2013 um and then took a couple years off uh tried to figure out what the next trend in technology was going to be and even though like bitcoin and ethereum were like kind of right in front of me the whole time i was completely missing it i ended up hitting the woods uh i went to the appalachian trail and attempted to hike that entire trail it's 2250 miles i ended up making it about 750 miles in the end and one of the reasons i came off the trail is because one day i was talking to one of my fellow hikers and he was telling me that uh he was making money while he was walking down the trail and i asked him how and uh of course and he said that he was mining bitcoin and then he told me the price of bitcoin and it was like 10 times more than the last time i had heard the price it's like 2015 you're hiking 2017 2017. this is like april 2017. and so in may a few you know 100 miles later or so i couldn't stop thinking about you know the fact that this was the next trend in technology blockchain um and i got off the trail and uh eventually built my own mining rig that year and then cryptokitties came out in december 2017. i actually was a little late to claim the punks which came out i think in june of 2017. but i got to clean the punks but still claiming them in 2017 is a big win right right but that and when i could have bought the i could have bought punks all day long for .05 but instead i was breeding cryptokitties at the time so i spent a couple years breeding cryptokitties and then um launched my own project avastar's in february 2020 and that was the first intentional profile picture project i believe we set out because we wanted people to be able to market our project by setting their profile picture because that's like your great real estate for the metaverse and we also stuck the art and the metadata entirely on chain we made them actually breedable on their composable you can make new avistars out of existing avistars more or less replicant factory we'll talk about that yep and then i continued to collect in the space and continued to build and grow some businesses we have nameless which is a minting platform we did garyvee's v friends we worked with sotheby's we've done a couple other amazing projects with like dez bryant and most recently we did a omakasi restaurant in new york where we funded we helped a restaurant fund their entire existence with an nft sale and then those nfts act as a membership token to um be able to eat their own fly fish club yes it's with garyvee as well yeah okay yeah all right you know all about it yeah so yeah it's been an amazing journey and i've continued to collect along the way um you mentioned you know that i have some board apes and some ebits and things like that so so yeah i'm really like just fortunate that i'm able to do something as a career that i happen to just love doing day in and day out no matter what so i'm a degenerate nft collector for sure degenerate core so we're going to avistars will be what we dive into but i do want to ask so you're on the appalachian trail somebody mentions bitcoin you're like oh the price has gone up since i last heard this is the next big trend of technology what was it that was like the click for you so early yeah well the click there you almost hit it is that like i was i was familiar with uh bitcoin when like mount gox got hacked and everything i remember like it was like four to six hundred dollars and that range i think it was like six hundred dollars for a bitcoin and then it dropped down to maybe in half and i was like oh that's it it's over this is this is what i expected to happen why i never like bought into this stuff and then when i was when the guy was on the trail like i think he said the price was like 4 000 or something and i was like oh my god it's 10xed in a couple years like there's something really significant here it's got past that mount gox issue and that was like the first like spark really it was like that and then once i learned about ethereum and learned like that i could mine it with video cards i built my own mining rig i was a gamer so i had built a computer in the past um and then but then learning smart contracts were there and then the nfts themselves like once i like bought my first cryptokitty that was the beginning of the journey that i'm on now because that's where i realized like all of my experience playing video games and collecting growing up and doing everything else was kind of getting ready to come into the internet world in a big way in the form of web3 and nfts and everything else so yeah okay that makes it i feel that way and i you know i was much later than you but i i was into like i knew about ethereum in 2017 thought it was interesting like understood what its potential might be but was like who knows if that will happen and then when i circled back at the very beginning of last year and and started learning about d5 i was like oh they're doing it like they're actually building that stuff yeah okay like it's so helpful i think if you had that early seed of interest yeah and then when you circle back and realize there's been growth you're like oh and now i'm all in but so often um and and this will lead into the avastar story as well but so often is the case is like we learn about something new and we misunderstand what it is yeah and we like think it's something much cooler than it is or it does something much different than it does um in this case like the blockchain and i think is actually doing a lot of what people think and under once the concept of blockchain is kind of hard to grasp at the moment for new people coming in but once you get it you get it and then it's like oh it has all this potential and possibility um and and with cryptokitties like i saw a lot of potential and possibility but i also thought that they were stored on the blockchain they were like the cats are on the blockchain and i thought that meant that the art and the metadata i thought that because it was an nft that meant that was all stored there and it was like this extreme potential store of value as a collectible because as long as ethereum's there they would be there now i learned a couple months later that that wasn't exactly the case and that's really what you tried to rectify then yes so you kind of have said this but i'll say like the the two things that i think about anything about why app stores are so distinct is they really like predated or like set off the pfp trend in some ways which i don't think people realize it really was like the first kind of pfp intentional project people were using punks and occasionally a cat but cats don't really make great profile pictures on social media and neither larval labs or dapper necessarily set out for those to be pfps like yeah i think crypto punks was like an art project yeah right and it was so much earlier and it was literally just like how can we put something interesting on the blockchain that isn't just a currency like that's how i think of it almost and yeah and avastar's you were like no no this is going to be intentionally something people can use to represent their digital identity so that was huge and then of course the onjane component which is like what we'll totally dive into but so give folks yeah give folks the avatar stories now and and what is avastar's and uh whatever you want to say on that and we'll dive into unchained sure sure yeah so uh with you know with have a stars once i realized that the cryptokitties were did not have the art stored on the chain and then the information that's stored about them is not in a human-readable form um the genetics of them which is stored on chain and that's what allows the kitties to be able to be bred together and you can create new cats that's a form of composability which we'll jump into later is taking two cryptokitties um they have underlying dna genetics you decide i want to breed these two and then there's an algorithm that kicks out a new kitty based on those underlying parental genetics that's a form of composability you take two nfts and create a new one that's based on on the characteristics of those um but i also wanted to like make sure that if i in i played through the thought experiment in my head where like dapper labs wasn't around in 50 years and i'm i'm willing and bequeathing my crypto kitties to my family member and they uh are they get the nft and it's just a character string on a blockchain and they have no idea what i just gave them and it's probably not worth anything as a result so let me break that down because i think what you're describing there is this dna code right which which leads to the breeding that in in the case of cryptocurrencies that actually is on the smart contract yeah but the image itself the jpeg right is stored is it an ipfs thing it's no they didn't even use ipf they just decided to store it locally on their servers okay so and and this is the piece that i do think there's a lot of misconception about the the picture itself is stored on the server if that server goes down that image is which we consider really what the cryptokitty is is now gone i mean potentially you could recover it in some ways but yes it's gone okay the original source what the nft points to is a place on their server and that that is gone and there's no backup of that image anywhere on the blockchain and so the the when you breed it a cryptokitty you've got two kind of kind of two dna sequences and then you can read them which gives you a new dna sequence sequence which is like a generative art thing right it tells it what the new kitty should look like but then that new kitty that emerges again stored on a local server and interpreted interpreted by the cryptokitties by dapper labs and then served as an image like they have an algorithm that decides that yeah and then it's possible like there's enough information out there that the community could recreate what those all these genetics are and everything else but um be a lot of effort yeah okay so you see that and you're like i want to be able to yeah if i want to give this to my kids yeah i was like this isn't right right like i was like hold on a second because i talked about like often technology is like not as cool as you think it is or you misunderstand right and so for me i had this misunderstanding that the cats were stored on the blockchain so then i couldn't let go of that thought like why aren't they and like can't they be stored on the blockchain in some way so i debated some folks for the better part of a year about this and then i think it was may 2019 autoglyphs by larva labs launched and they actually did put ascii character art on chain it's a 64 by 64 character grid kind of a simplistic expression of art but this was the way that they figured out how they could actually store the metadata and the images on the blockchain so that came out and i was like and i had just a couple months earlier had the epiphany on how i would do this okay and that was because the wonderful folks at openc had created a project called ethmogee and they're basically emoji characters that you can compose yourself as nfts and the way you do that is you go to the website and they have all these different layers they'll have a body layer like one of them is an eggplant one of them's just a red circle you know and then they have hats and eyes and mouths and and ears and accessories and you can assemble it the way you want and then when you decide that's the one you want you mint it and that creates it and you get that nft in the way you wanted it to look which i thought was cool and i was like whoa did they store the individual layers on the blockchain because if they did and you composed them all together this way like you don't have to store the entire image on the chain because you have all these individual pieces are there are there and all you have to do is figure out how to assemble those and so you could like have 10 components stored and make some like 100 or more combinations of unique images out of just like this so anyways that was kind of the epiphany for me i looked they didn't store those things on the blockchain at all they had a cool thing where like an individual actually owned each individual layer and could set their own price for the layer there was some cool other stuff there but for me it was the composability of these individual svg layers on the blockchain that like was the idea and then autoglyphs launched and that's when i was just like you know what i'm gonna do this uh i sold my home i borrowed some money from my mom i went and found some artists and a developer actually josie was one of the first people we're going to talk about cyberpunkers later josie was one of the first people i discussed this idea with at the time wow and we mulled on it and figured out how it could look and how it could work and i ended up working with an amazing a different set of artists so this amazing couple out of brazil marmoda and milky but uh and went and hired my developer cliff cliff rhodes or sorry cliff hall to do the development and then we got to work the four of us got to work over the course of the next uh really took about nine months to get to our genesis uh founder sale and then uh it took another two months to get to our actual series one launch and everything else but a little bit over a year after i saw autoglyphs avastar's existed amazing okay and so to break this down for folks so you have all these traits like like functionally how this works right and based on everything you describe you have all these sorts of different traits and each of those individual traits these svg files themselves are stored on the blockchain and then there's an algorithm that knows how to put them together in ways to create the image that we all see that's how it works yeah we call that an svg sandwich so the way it yes it's exactly what we did so there's uh i'm not gonna remember the exact number but uh for physical traits plus color palette there's something about 630 uh traits total for avastars and bass most of those are either a hexadermal uh hexadecimal code for color or it's a svg code snippet for that individual trait that's drawn and then basically what we do is we layer them in a specific order um like eyes nose hair earrings like those are the traits we're describing that then get layered on top of each other to create the face shape right hair color eye color uh background color background pattern there's 12 in all that every avastar has and uh then uh the smart contract basically there's a field in the smart contract that's like render avastar and if you put your avastar any avastar id number in there it will actually kick out the full svg code for that avastar you can copy and paste that save that as an svg file or just paste that code directly into a browser and you're going to see your avastar displayed there and that's rendered directly from the blockchain kind of in real time on demand rather it's not stored there each one's information isn't stored it's rendered so we're not taking up more space for each individual avastar we only took up the storage space for the individual one time and then it could be rendered elsewhere but this means if an ft 42 like if you guys go away anybody can go back to the blockchain and just using the blockchain render their app store that's just on the smart contract yep they don't have to do anything else and that was the mind experiment too like when the thought experiment two when i'm gone how do i make sure that these things are still there these are my pyramids so that was the idea so you're incredibly passionate about the importance of on-chain art and on chain i think beyond art i mean we'll get to maybe royalties on chain and things around that that i think are really interesting um obviously reason number one is like the legacy element of it though like if the if the you know whatever if you disappear how can you make sure this still survives are there other reasons why you think it's really important that things be done like this yeah i mean um i think one like we've started to see the argument out there that people like i was worried ahead of time that people were going to be like why were you you're using a immutable ledger that has like forever storage but you're not storing any of this stuff on there like this is like a larp it's not real like you mean like skeptics to blockchain the nf the problem with nfts if you saw that video he hammered that point he's like this art doesn't even store it on chain it's all a bunch of [ __ ] yeah and people even give avastar's crap for that because we have a url that points to our website as like the way to serve up the api um but ours is actually backed up on the blockchain itself um you know it's just really important to me from a value perspective like i had spent a lot of money on cryptocurrency so for me it was kind of like trying to make sure that what i had spent significant time and resources on up to the point that i decided things needed to be on chain that i was creating something that when people who came after me saw they wouldn't have the same objections so i was trying to remove objections that i saw coming in the future for for that um and similarly with launching royalties as well right like trying to remove objections and provide some sort of like value add on top of what had already been created like cryptokitties just punks did some cool stuff by like introducing this idea of digital assets and then cryptokitties did the standard of um you know uh erc 721 and nft standard that exists and then i just wanted to basically improve from there and say well like we can make these things actually better in some way by sticking them on chain and making them even more trustless and making them even more secure and providing a real uh starting point for value creation i guess in collecting yeah so from a collectible standpoint i think it makes all the sense in the world this is obviously like a superior form of a collectible than one that like is sort of piecemealed together where maybe it's on ipfs and that node could or you know nodes could go down and you lose it or you know or aws worse whatever right is there are there also like functional benefits as you think about like the metaverse getting built out like how does like something come like and i think this also gets us into other versions of composability that like actually just make this what we're going to need to do for the metaverse to become its best version of itself so let's like um yes so it's very important because of like the trustless nature of on chain when you stick something on chain um you don't have to anymore trust a third party serving that information up and granted ipfs is similar it's decentralized the ipfs hash is unique if someone can confirm that that's a valid hash for that project you can also similarly interact with data sometimes in a trustless way however you're having to then look somewhere else off the blockchain to do it instead of being able to do it at the same primitive level that the blockchain itself is so when you create a cryptokitty for example that smart contract is only reading the genetic string of the two cryptokitties on the blockchain and then creating based off of that it's not going out and looking at dapper lab servers or anything else similarly within avistar when you create an avastar replicant out of avastar primes you can take 12 traits from two to five avastars and create a new one when you're doing that you're doing it direct you're interacting with the smart contract directly to do this um and it's on the blockchain and it's trustless there's no looking outside to outside data or anything else so it's it's efficient in in one regard because all the information is contained in the same system and you're not relying on external systems but then it's also um trustless because it's been created in a way that's verified verifiably by verifiably scarce and the traits once they're used they can't be used again so the smart contract goes and checks and sees if those traits have been used so the whole thing just kind of works elegantly together when everything is in one place when you start storing things in different locations in different places and have other dependencies there's more opportunity for one for things not to work exactly how you would want them to work from a technology perspective but two if for example the somebody was doing a similar project but stored all of their trade information on their own server and didn't use ipfs for any of those things how in the future could decentraland issue you a token based on some trait characteristics on your uh nft um with without being able to like know that they'd have to go to your server essentially right they'd have to or they'd have to trust that like that data could be manipulated or changed and like some of the various characters could come in and like maliciously take control of some obscure project and that had some sort of access into some other entity and composability and could change some of that data and then manipulate this other system i mean i'm kind of giving an obscure example here but part of what i'm hearing is like if the essential decentralized has to go and interact with a server a foreign server it doesn't know that foreign server could also be in the hands of a bad actor who yeah negative ways as opposed to interacting with a smart contract on the blockchain that you know has that sort of trustless we all can read exactly decentralize and go in and look at the avastar's contract and know that this color trait is available for this nft and that this user has elected to use that color trait in their building materials or their paint into central and i'm just making [ __ ] up now but that can be done in a way that not only you can go back an individual who had some knowledge could go back and piece that back together and prove show the proofs that all of this is validly um interacted with and it's authentic so it's easier to close the loop and prove authenticity of like the composable elements if it's all on chain so i want to ask one final question that's sort of deep in this technical weeds that i'm sure is like breaking people's brands because mine is a little bit no no i think this is really important i think it is actually so important though that people understand things at a technical level like this and they're going to be trading and and like spending money in this space so here's a question and it's more like am i right in this or are there work arounds to this but like when i think about the metaverse and i think about digital identity and i like i think about what doodles is doing with space doodles and i've talked to jordan castro and i think what's so interesting is they're starting to to demonstrate ways that you can express different versions of yourself through your characters and when i think about so cryptokitties there was a a faction of i think early crypto kitties holders that did like hat on cats right where they were able to um you know kind of put hats on their on individual crypto kitties yes when i think about what you did with ava stars and this kind of composability question it strikes me and this is where i need you to correct me or not that for example if i love my avastar but i want to reflect myself a little bit differently than that character or you know take a character or maybe i want to change her outfit or something is it easier to do that if basically all these constituent components right the shirt is a separate layer from the hair's separate layer from whatever and instead of those separate layers being rendered together as a jpeg and put on ipfs each of those individual components are now in a smart contract i could write a smart contract to interact with that take those constituent components but then swap out so i'm now wearing the band t-shirt that i want my character to wear that made much easier sort of in the way you're doing things or no is that like not necessarily one of the benefits here yes and no so yes in that that's how it should be okay that's exactly how you described it where like i think if what you were saying if i'm picking up on that like you have uh avastar with uh let's say steampunk goggles and you want to use that and maybe some other project even like and create a new nft from that right and uh ideally that's how that would work okay at the time when we created avastar's there was an internal debate about this and um i wanted this is a debate i lost uh i wanted to do the traits um as a public good so that they were just all available there we would still have the rights over them individually but like let people compose new things out of them um cliff made a really good argument at the time that it was going to degrade the avastar's generation one brand if we allowed other people to create assets that were using the same assets that we created the gen 1 with so as a result right now only an administrator account has access to the individual trait layers as far as like rendering them from the blockchain now some really smart people including kai our friend kai and another guide to lens community members they've gone in and recreated and pulled the assets and and made it so that you can go in and at least see like how you could create your own avastar out of these traits but um right now the only way to actually get the art from the original avastar prime nft into a new nft the art itself is to um make a replicant because the replicants are authorized to use those traits um if somebody was to take a hair color from uh from an avistar and use it in another project they could do that and actually interact with our smart contract and burn the trait and you can prove all that's done the one thing they're not going to be able to do is access that art okay to do it so that's the part that we kind of got didn't get completely right there on that part but that's what i want to see happen okay and i'm curious if cyberbrokers has done something like that okay okay so but that's helpful i think i mean i follow that hopefully other people will follow that but it in theory again as we look at like what is the matter we need to write it out so we need to write another smart contract which we may or may not get around to to open up those trait layers inside the visual trait layers inside of our contract and allow other people to do it this is some form of a proxy conference and it's not just about hey i want to grab these ethereum earrings that are maybe you know that navistar has and put it on another thing but it could also be what if i create my own my own earrings that i want to put on my avastar like i think it kind of i'm interested in both yes i mean that would be like a derivative project in a sense but you could absolutely do that you own it you have the commercial rights to your avastar like you have the ability there is this composability aspect so yes and i guess i'm what i'm trying to get at is even backing up from ava stores like in theory this is a really interesting way for the metaverse and for our digital identities to unfold and this would be the way you would want to see it happen again the change in clothes yes piece like you know all these things that are going to be relevant to how are we projecting ourselves when we're running around the metaverse like you would like to see that all sort of on chain for the for a whole variety of reasons yes the visual aspects and the token the cool composable elements and everything and eventually i'd love to see you know in a you know encrypted fashion i'd love to see our identities actually be on chain as well yeah so you know this is just the first iteration of that yeah okay i want to talk about on-chain royalties because i think this is another area where there's a tremendous amount of misconception which is that right now as artists talk about secondary sales and like how critical that is to their future that's right now happening at the platform layer for the most part it's open seas allowing that not smart contract layer um it's a little bit of both but since predominant amount since the predominant amount of sales actually happen on the open sea layer and they open c i don't know if they are yet but they haven't up to this point like supported the on-chain royalty standards even though they've advised businesses like my own which ones to use as far as like 18 months ago maybe they have not actually adopted the on-chain standards so that you have to go in and manually put in your royalty amount as the owner of that contract in the openc platform in order to capture secondary royalties there okay why can you explain for folks today i do think this is so cool what people think is so great about this it's like a smart contract says the artist will get 10 royalty but like that's not where it's happening and why is that not happening there i think one yes we will um so i think open c made the decision that uh they didn't like the standards that exist already and weren't ready to like bet on one i think that was a huge mistake honestly like they spent a ton of time building in layer two and all these other things but like adding in like on-chain royalties when uh rarible did it i think even like looks rare and some of the others have done it like other people have done it and they're supposed to be leading the way and they completely dropped the ball and what you're describing there is basically you could you would do that within the smart contract and what opencs said is they they don't like that standard so they open see i think they've been creating their own along with some other companies um i'm a little disappointed they didn't like involve us in it since we were actually the first platform to introduce on chain royalties through like our nameless platform which was at the time called infinity but uh my understanding is they have been working on a standard with some other entities and there's a couple other standards in development one approach is you have like a database that stores all these things and you go and look up through the database smart contract references that other smart contract goes and looks up this database and and sees the royalties it's like a another ledger um the approach that we've taken up to this point um with a lot of our stuff and what we did first was we created um basically a way to put an address of the of the creator and then uh basis points like how how much percentage of a sale they were going to get and you just basically send that amount to that address whenever there's a transaction um there was a platform briefly called cargo that a gentleman named sean developed and he came out with uh something a little bit further developed than what we had done and we had adopted that standard once we started to see industry support for that and many of the smart contract developers today that are incorporating standards are incorporating that i forget what the eip on that is but they're incorporating that standard but there are a couple others now that are trying to come out with like these either alternative ways which may work um these like sen they're like not centralized they're a decentralized um but central place to store these royalty informations and the idea is that this is like a kind of similar to ens where you can point to a place to look and see what these royalties are you could point to any number of places so you don't have to have it and you don't have to trust open sea if open seas running this one this registry you could trust manifold or nameless or somebody else um or some conglomerate or some dow okay so we the crux of that is we will get there so much of i think what is right now like we're like uh yeah unfortunately not the focus of the open c platform they focused more on like layer two nfts and so instead we got a bunch of spam axe infinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes

get to cyber brokers and and the maybe that evolution that that is in this kind of long chain that you set off i think explain why this isn't common because this is you're almost unique in this right cyber broker is almost unique in this pretty much no other projects do this sort of on-chain composability thing um with their art my understanding is it's expensive because it takes up a lot more block space but maybe say a little bit as to why that hasn't happened yeah so one there's a couple reasons um there have there are a couple other projects um there was one that came out last year called unchained monkeys that kind of tried to and train faces is that on change faces of course and chain faces came out a couple weeks before avastar's did oh it was a front run yeah well not really but they're not like this it's not picture right well it was named it was my buddy nate and nate was like hand in hand with me helping like with ideation and stuff around avastar so like we were working and helping each other um nate actually felt bad he didn't want to label his project as a pfp because he wanted avastar to be able to be the first on-chain and they're not you know like avastar's if you look at the art versus like a chain faces aren't yeah it's like yeah yeah like simple like yeah exactly smileys versus like actually svg art um it is um cost prohibitive so when we did it i think we got all of our 650 uh traits or whatever on chain for less than five eth i don't remember the exact somewhere between five and eighteenth it was several thousand dollars it was not a lot of money um cyber brokers just uh spent 91 eth to put all of their traits on chain like just did it like yesterday or something so you know the and the difference back then like when we did it ethereum cost like 200 250 bucks something like that now ethereum's 10 times more so it was like 10 times more the ethereum cost 10 times more and they had to use at least 10 times more ethereum to do it yeah so like you know it's a hundred x more um right now to do what do you think that cost will come down like is your expectation that in the future this will be the way things are done and because of whether it's lt's or whatever it is the cost of putting things on chain coming down enough or uh i don't necessarily i think that like it is always going to be somewhat cost prohibitive to put things on chain um but it's a commitment that you make for like the the reasons you do it would be because you want to like preserve your project for a really long time it's an intentional step and signal for that matter to collectors that there's something more like to this than the traditional collections because another reason we haven't seen a lot of this is because by and large the collector community has shown that they don't care about unchained like as far as like assigning value to a project it's more about like the the memes and like whatever's popular and whatever people are talking about the technology um aspect of it is not understood by a lot of collectors initially and also like some really just don't care at all like like when i buy an nft i'm generally buying something that i don't mind or maybe that i want to have for a long time um since the since beginning of last year a lot of collectors in the space really learned about nfts because it was a money-making opportunity you know you have to understand like most of us they were trying to flip you were buying when it was yeah we were buying and collecting yeah exactly losing money like i probably put 200 000 into breeding cryptokitties over two years you know like of my own cash just like buying ethereum and then you know buying cryptokitties and breeding cryptokitties um you know it wasn't a money-making opportunity for most of us it was literally like well we're here for the tech laboratory yeah it was crypto winner and like you know no one wanted to buy our stuff we were the greater fools um but then everybody that came in last year like they paid attention to nfts because they're like oh wait people are making some serious money off of this so it becomes about the flip and the the shorter term opportunity and for that like who cares if it's on chain you know is if that's like from the mindset of a collector like who cares like if i'm just going to sell this thing in a few weeks for 10 times more or try to that's the idea then they don't care but then you saw projects like board apes which it wasn't initially it was on ipfs nothing's on chain but then they went and took some of the funds that they got from their sales and actually stuck the art on i think i don't know if it's all the way on ethereum but i think it's on are we yeah i think it's pinned to r weave and you're starting to see more and more projects that are going to be here for the long haul that are thinking through this strategy a little more and thinking through you know sticking it on chain another advantage of putting it on chain is that um you know you don't have to worry about maintaining that backup server for for that in the long run right so it can be you know in the case of of cyber brokers 91 each is a lot of money i didn't do the math yet but it's a lot um maybe like 220 000 or something um there's probably the server costs are probably going to be lower over the course of 20 years than that but you know for us for avistars like we spent a couple grand and like having that stuff there forever is definitely a cost benefit now a lot of projects still need to serve their art and things like that we look at the blockchain as a backup we don't look it as the primary place that you should be you know serving your art to your customers and things like that the part that crypto kitties got right is they were serving the art images directly from their website the pro the part they got wrong was they didn't store it back up on the blockchain in my opinion that's what they got wrong and let's actually do this quickly i think you've got a spectrum here right where you have like totally on chain something like what an avistars has done then you have like you know a i'm serving the image in my own server that could go down or like aws some centralized server and then as you kind of move towards the the middle of these two extremes you have like probably an ipfs storage thing and then you have our weave as well the next step uh closest to on chain yes can you explain what that actually means in that spectrum for folks sure so i mean you know cryptokitties is a good example of you know there's a minimal amount of stuff stored on chain and there's nfts that are worse than that that have nothing stored on chain uh initially when you mint an openc open storefront contract it's literally an empty vessel you cannot identify anything about the nft itself if you look at the nft at the blockchain layer so that's like the worst case now they allow you to add your stuff to ipfs and then pin it to rwev i believe at least add it to ipfs at a later date if you the user want to pay to do that to back your thing your your creation up next step would be cryptokitties just stores some trade information but no visual information the next step would be something like what board apes launched with where they had an ipfs link to the apes they had a hash and everything else you could go out and in a system prove that these were the correct traits for this but it wasn't stored directly on the blockchain you can't render trade information from the blockchain and then they added um they basically you can pin the ipfs hashes to are weave now so rweave is a blockchain that can um that claims that you're able to store something once for up to 200 years or more you pay once in store forever as far as like our lifetimes are concerned um so now you can take ipfs links and pin them to rweav and really for other than the part where i was talking about earlier the efficiency of being able to interact with um the same within the same vessel having all of the composable elements on the same blockchain you do have some form of on-chain when you store things on r-weave because it's a blockchain the information's stored there you should be able to piece it back together through the information in the smart contract and recreate that experience somehow with effort so that's a form of on chain it's not as strong as like that last step which is something like autoglyphs um avastars um and crypto cyber brokers like those are actually stored the art and the metadata are stored 100 on the blockchain there's no external dependencies um and that is where like the strongest possible like you literally as long as there's one node of ethereum running in 500 years you could go back and piece together any of those projects like completely from the smart contract you know josie we're talking about cyber brokers which has been a super popular project of the last few weeks can you speak to you know i'd love to get your opinions on cyber brokers i'm assuming you're you're quite bullish on them but also uh speak to sort of josie making the decision to put cyber brokers entirely on chain yeah um would love to hear that so i mean her and i have i got to know josiah in like that 2019 may 2019 time frame um i got introduced to uh cryptovoxels through josie and started collecting josie's art she's an amazing artist um and so for the last couple years her and i have had discussions and debates on these topics and the importance of on chain and everything else and she's one of the people who um cared i guess like when i started talking about it understood the value of it and when she decided she wanted to do her own project she basically said she wanted to also do it on chain i think like josie comes from a time before i even joined crypto i came in in 2017. josie comes from the bitcoin world i think she was probably here in like 2014. she was doing crypto art she was doing like art around like real irl art around like bitcoin and like getting oh yeah she's an amazing artist i mean if it's not obvious from her project but like her art is amazing as well yeah and she she has like that more decentralized ethos and everything about her than even like myself coming in as a noob and not really knowing like all of the cultural aspects of bitcoin and blockchain and the libertarianism and all of those things um but so she very much i think understood that the potential of the technology and went on when avastar's came out and did the on-chain stuff she like realized like wow i could probably do that too and then she i you know her and ben cyber guys who came from like neon district um like i guess they've been working on this for over a year and that's the other thing is i've had awareness and i've known they've been working on this and i've been excited about it because i knew they were doing it on chain i knew it was going to be josie's take on on chain and like avatars like what those were going to look like for like her version of the metaverse i know she's heavily inspired by things like snow crash and you know all the different sci-fi elements to it so i've been incredibly excited to see what they came out with um i owned i don't know how much of her artwork i own but basically however much i owned i was entitled to mint i think about 15 of the brokers for .35 each and then somehow i was able to claim one i don't know how i got that that's cool though um and then i bought a couple more and i sent something to i think my girlfriend and i'm sending one to a buddy for watching my dogs this weekend when i get home he's made up pretty well on that one yeah i met yeah i'm really excited about the project i know people have been disassembling their uh their prints on their brokers and like because i noticed early on like they're wearing underwear and like they're wearing things that you can't see they have hidden traits underneath of them and you know the nature of svg is you can kind of remove these layers off so okay because that's sort of what i'm trying to get as i think i understand the ideological play around this of like hey this feels you know important as like a true collector if you truly believe in the ethos of this decentralization but for folks maybe these newcomers who like don't care you know whatever i wasn't part of the early bitcoin i'm not a libertarian whatever like you know what are some of these other kind of practical tangible benefits that come from this and you know some of that is like just surprises right like hey you can kind of right well like you could like start and see you could play barbie i mean i mean you could dress up earlier with like oh i could put a you know if i want my whatever rock band that i like t-shirt on them yeah i can do that and i dress them up like a barbie feels like something you can't be even easier for a cyber broker than an avastar since they have like a full body and they are wearing clothes and things like that um avastar's by the way i believe is working with nifty taylor to to drop a collection of clothing pretty soon for for ava stars but but in the case of cyber brokers i've seen people like undress the the brokers and then like place their outfits and stuff kind of like i know like my sister used to have like these like polly pockets i think that's exactly what it is where you could like have the sticker books that re-stick the stuff and you can dress them up so that's kind of what it reminds me of but like a really like cyberpunk version of that like on the internet and i honestly don't know what they're i haven't looked to see or asked what their like road map is but it seems like there's like a lot going on underneath the surface of cyber brokers so not only like the dressing like being able to dress and undress them and having hidden traits underneath but they also have professions and like they have like skills and you're telling me i need to get josie on the pod yes and like figure out what's going on there and then like i noticed the backgrounds weren't like mapped as a trait either so there's like some different like puzzle stuff like the other thing is is like josie um is good friends with uh um coin artist who's a big crypto puzzler she did some of the first like paintings that contain puzzles to be solved in the the crypto sphere and i wouldn't be surprised if there's something deeper going on there as well i mean i know that like someone just actually today or recently this last week uncovered a riddle in the larva labs um there was a there was a me bit sitting in a wallet um and they put the larva labs put a secret code in one of the projects that they did recently and someone decoded it went and found the private key went and claimed the me bit oh wow yeah there's a tweet out there all these easter eggs i know yeah so i wouldn't be surprised josie and man have done some stuff yeah i know she has a puzzle component i don't know the details of it she's got awesome lore like yeah i think there's gonna be a lot coming here this is not just a drop and you know there's no rug aspect to any of this right like i think we're going to see this project they've been working on it for a year already i think cyber brokers is going to be around as a prominent project for a couple years awesome okay let's transition to yuga larva labs did you like know did you have like inside scoop that this was going to be happening beforehand no i heard something like the day before but the person i heard it from it was this can't be true yeah right he's like i heard this but there's no way and it's like nah that [ __ ] ain't true okay so unless level said here i said this at the beginning you own a ton of footage i mean your apes didn't you do a sotheby's or christie's like you had a whole sale of a ton of these apes that came out you sold one yeah the golden ape yeah the gold name yep um you want a ton of apes you want a bunch of punks you want a ton of me bits like you know you're you're you're kind of dogs yeah your hands in all these ecosystems what is now called a hugo labs portfolio right so what was your initial reaction to this news uh i am very excited because i have not been happy with the way and personally i've not been happy with the way that larval labs has handled a lot of the stuff i mean they really just being so hands-off is that really were yeah so hands-off and very uh emo and out of touch and maybe like you know it's an air of superiority that even if they don't intend to put off like it does feel like they're all on beaches sipping margaritas like we've made our money was not at all happy with their dutch auction of me bits and selling them at an average of like 2.45 eth a piece you know they extracted 70 million dollars from the community that day and as far as i can tell i've done very little to put any of that back in so they're basically it's funny because they're considered so og and they did so much good stuff with crypto punks and i respect what they did but like people talk about celebrities coming in and extracting like from the community like oh god my friend uh where kitty made a comment yesterday that larval labs like uh like successfully i forget what she said but anyways like they actually just rubbed and laughed right like they just left like they actually did a sale what she did larv lab was the only one that so far have succeeded in selling their project twice so they did their their sale to the community and then they just sold all their assets to you getting lara labs and they're just walking off into the sunset so um i don't i think that yuga is showing themselves to be good stewards for the space so far um they're taking what they're doing and their position in the space very seriously i have a lot of respect for gaiu siri he's one of my investors he's a lead investor in in one of our seed rounds and i i think that he has a very good vision for what hugo labs could become along with their ceo and their co-founders and everything else so i believe in people um and i believe that what they're doing is is worthwhile and good i love the project um i think that uh the eight tokens should be coming soon so okay let's let's get into like what you think and i think this ties into ape token like what they might be planning to do with all this i saw somebody speculating you know there's no royalties on me bits or punks right so this is a money play well yeah do we know if they're they may add royalties i don't know so they could so so as they stand right now mee bits and punks there aren't secondary royalties on that yeah but in theory you're saying so they so hugo could come in and add royalties to both these collections so and i'm not sure like technically like how easy or hard that would be but yes my assumption i mean my assumption would be yes okay i was also seeing somebody say with eight point coin coming out at some point in the not too distant future like you may be the only way to but to buy you know you've got this punk slot from this platform the way to buy those will be through eight coins that would be uh i mean i so i think there should be a choice obviously but yes i think that there's gonna be i don't know what it should will be yet i noticed they bought like 400 punks and like 1500 me bits or something crazy yeah so they have a lot of assets that um and they don't have a lot of like uh yoga themselves don't have a lot of apes or anything like most of those are in the hands of the community i'm not sure if they'll want to hold on to those assets and try to use that ip for their own or if they're going to maybe make some portion of those available through like ape tokens and things like that where you can maybe go in and buy these things with only with ape like some sort of exclusivity can't force that on me who owns them even you can't force me to only sell it in a coin right yeah but you could say the hugo labs ones you could say you could buy this with ape and then give immediate like what the key to i think any sort of token is that like making sure that there's like good cool stuff to spend it on i guess is like the easiest way to say it and like if i can buy uh punk or apes or me bits with the ape token um that i've earned through holding my apes like that's pretty cool if i believe in the long term of those projects which i obviously do yeah um but i think the key there will also be the community by and large uh uh embracing ape token and and like figuring out if there's value for them being able to bring over this community that of yugo labs projects like getting their the community's attention by selling things in ape and stuff like that i think that's the decentralized aspect of this could be really cool as well and at the risk of stating the obvious hugo didn't buy autoglyphs they only bought i know and which i think it gives us a clear indication of where their head is and you know guy was hearing right like this is an ip play and it tells me we're making movies we're making tv we're making all these things that you're probably not making with autoglyphs but that you very well can make with with punks and meet it's like it's not just a brand play because you could turn autoglyphs into like a merch brand if you just wanted to do a brand the other part of that to take into consideration is that autoglyphs may have been cost prohibitive to acquire because they uh larval owns 128 of those they minted 25 of their own project on that one on it and those are 150 eth north of 150 ether peach um so and yes you're right they don't have like any real use in the metaverse right now except for some pretty bland wallpaper right um again like you could make a sweatshirt brand out of it or do if you wanted to go that play but i don't yeah go in the pfp route and like characters in the metaverse and uh uh valuable ip to like merchandise and and license and things like that i don't think autoglyphs hits the same marks that uh punks and then moebius to a lesser extent so i'm a me bit holder right so as a move it holder i would imagine as a punk's holder i think the news has been well received i think most people are really excited about this some aren't but yeah most people understand that like they were also feeling a little bit of angst towards like larva labs and stuff i see it like you know nfc nyc you know board apes had so much going on they were sort of like the dart the bell of the ball in terms of the yacht party and this and that and there was so much kind of there was such a notable absence of anything larval labs in terms of building that community and so of course they're going to be people who feel all sorts of different ways about it but i think by and large it's well received i'm happy about it i'm glad you've taken it over yeah i've seen most of the og punks guys have been you know at least cautiously optimistic about owning their ips do the eight folks feel the same way and i'll say as i ask that i think it's this really interesting question which is in this new world how much this is great for yugo labs in theory right they now have this whole new body of ip but as an a polder i don't own a piece of yugo labs and but i think sometimes in this new world order people kind of see things as proxy for other things right ens tokens are sort of seen as proxy ownership of enos even though they're like kind of not right it's just really governance but but there's a lot of that getting conflated and i i'll be interested to see how that plays out long term how do apes holders feel do they see this as a win for them obviously they use ape tokens i'm not sure i'm not sure i've spoken to enough of them to like get a informed opinion on that but like from my point of view i think it's cool um as long as it doesn't dilute like how much hate token i'm gonna be getting right because like i mean look i own a lot of me bits too i own a few crypto punks so if that happened i would be getting some from those assets too but um hopefully they're just dropping it to ape mutant and dog holders and then there'll be other ways maybe in the future so i mean there's so much potential here though like i don't know what the design is of the ape token but you know there could be ways that me bit holders and eight and punk holders could could earn eight as well i hope so too i mean it's my sake i wouldn't want them to be on the initial thing like you still need to give the the it would be really cool i mean i think getting everybody and making them feel a part of this like you're bringing together like the newer um really successful collectors in the form of punk uh holders and then you got the older og uh nft collectors that have made it you know before then um they have been a little bit in conflict i mean i kind of helped start the apes flip punks narrative uh some months back um because i saw that hugo labs was killing it and they were making the right moves and they had done the ip thing they just got it and larval labs was just missing it and sitting over here being their superior cells that i perceived them to be right so i was like man i just see like such a contrast here and that's why i thought apes would flip punks but now punks and me bits have the opportunity to like participate in like a company hugo labs who really gets it you know in a different level you know can't fault larva labs for the technology innovations they've done and pushing the space forward in that way as cultural um and and culturally they really have like missed like the mark though they haven't done the community ethos like that kind of building but when you look at it obviously punk's being punk's and innovative for all the reasons that punk's innovative autoglyphs you know being this sort of on-chain thing that was inspirational inspired me bits being the it's 3d it's it can be in the metaverse like they have been so spot-on in terms of things i know it's like and it's so hard and i think they sort of feel like yeah we can rest on those laurels like that's what we do and maybe they don't have a community size maybe they can't sell this to the community people yeah and then and then and then you know maybe that's okay yeah i mean i think that like probably when they decided a few months ago to sell some version one punks that was probably for them when they got the backlash which by the way they made the absolute wrong move there it was really stupid like [ __ ] dumb yeah and then of course they caught backlash for it and then they probably just were like [ __ ] this yeah i'm done yeah i talked about that in previous episode if you want to go refresh yourself on the v1 yeah there you go she's got it she's already got it um okay the the big kind of initial revelation that we has come out of of the yuga acquisition is um rights being distributed to holders board apes were notorious for they gave rights over your ape to the individual holders full commercial rights they've now done that with me bits and larva labs you are notoriously very anti-crypto funks i want to get into like the rights conversation a little bit here let's take this piece by piece what is your reaction to giving the holders rights over their individual mutes and punks uh amazing so avistar's to come back to avastar's was we designed the digital asset ownership license you can google that you'll see it come up we gave uh commercial uh full commercial rights to avastar owners back in february 2020 when we launched um so i've always well not always for a long time i've been in favor of this sort of model for ownership going back again to cryptokitties i felt like we were breeding them as me the breeder these were my art tools the cats themselves the outcome was like my creation so i felt like i should have ownership over it and decide what to do but express that through avastar's and i'm i've actually one of the people who has leveraged the hugo labs the board apes commercial rights license and i have a record deal with universal music for kingship so i've actually exercised this commercial ip which a lot of people are like how is it actually really useful well like yes it can be you know you have to like hustle and find the opportunities but there are opportunities to license the likenesses of these apes and now punks and me bits to brands and entities and and projects um and kingship is just the beginning of that well say a beat more because there's been a couple has it didn't um timberland timbaland yeah yeah he connected to what you're doing or he's a total no they did their own thing they did their own thing like apes and music yes on just what you're doing that's fascinating yeah so what i did is um i licensed four of my board apes it's a golden ape a blue beams ape a mutant and a king uh crown ape to uh universal music group and uh 10 22 pm which is a joint venture and they are creating um music and experiences um from these apes um basically it's a it's a music group for the music a metaverse native music group band yes um so we've been working i've been working alongside them helping develop the concept and bring that to life um i think you should expect to see more very soon maybe this week maybe interesting yeah okay very cool yeah okay and so but i think there's a distinction to be made between you have a right over your i have amoeba i have full commercial rights over my individual meebit that is not the same as having full commercial rights over me bits right and so that's what yuga has bought is like ip of punk's ip of media right which is the ability to commercial rates for individuals yeah they they bought the ip rights from uh larva labs and then they conveyed those rights down to the individual nft holders which is something larval labs had not been willing to do yeah right okay and so this brings us to i'll give a little bit of back color here i talked about this in a very early episode of of this show but there's a cryptopunx derivative project called cryptofunks which is punk's face right or whatever their heads face right yep p-h-u-n-k-s yes yes p-h-u-n-k-s all they did was add that add the h the head just faces a different way it's the exact same art otherwise yep and larval labs went after them and got them delisted from openc and some other some of the other major kind of platforms saying this is a copyright violation and this like totally divided the community some people were like how dare you do that that's so against the web 3 ethos to go after places and you have been so staunchly oh yeah anti-funks yeah explain well like first of all like where in the web 3 ethos is it to just like steal other people's [ __ ] and to like claim it as your own and sell it like where is that the [ __ ] ethos right like no that's not the ethos um blockchain strengthens all of our laws and and allows us to enforce them more easily you can visibly see that a function is not a punk yeah and you can also track the providence of these this art back to the original like uh i i i think it's silly the people who make the arguments that like we don't have to follow the laws because the blockchain like because of this decentralization web 3 and that that for somehow like the web 3 ethos doesn't follow like copyright laws for example like you can actually like assign copyright and you can have like automatic mechanisms to enforce some of these things now built into smart contracts it's actually easier to enforce than it was before with digital assets um not harder and so these people are just trying it's a misunderstanding of what's going on in the space it's it's naivity but then like taken to a extreme that's not like actually in my mind productive in any way is there a form of derivative art that copies like an entire project like could there have been somebody who copied punks have there been projects maybe that have copied punks that have felt artistically significant enough to you that you like it or in general you're like great go do what you want with your individual punk but copying the project products at writ large i haven't seen a i haven't seen any derivative punk projects that were like anything that i would ever touch with a 10-foot pole like ever like from baby punks to left-facing punks to right like it doesn't matter uh it's all like taken from the punx project and there's only one original punx and that's you know the crypto punks that larval labs just purchased and anything else is uh is not as authentic or it's definitely not an original idea and uh i don't think that they will have any significant value in the long run compared to a real crypto punk and what do you think about cco projects think about blitmaps right who have intentionally said go do whatever you want we have no copyright enforcement yeah um i think that cco's first of all i want to go there and say i think cco's cool like it's cool to be able to release your work into the public domain like very cool um i don't think that there is a great deal of uh value being that is created for the collector in doing that i think you would potentially give the collector themselves so much more value by giving them the commercial rights to that ip rather than saying anybody can use it for anything because if anybody can use it for anything someone could start the new nazi party and use your nrt's image as that like that's what cco enables right like is you could use it anybody can use it for anything and the idea there is is like cool like your nft is like this really unique circle with a red dot in the middle of it and now like anybody can go make like really cool circles with red dots anywhere and it can get really popular and become a meme and then you own that circle with the red dot which is so cool because people are going to want to buy that because it's the original thing of it all man like how pissed off would i be if like my golden captain ape if that was cc0 and people were out there printing [ __ ] t-shirts and selling them and like they were making money off of the image of my ape and i wasn't getting anything from that but isn't that cool that i could maybe sell it for more money later because all these people have t-shirts [ __ ] that like that is the dumbest [ __ ] i've ever heard that's funny so i think the argument right there there's an argument the next beethoven will come along you know like that there are people who maybe don't have the the original idea right but get inspired by the flip maps or blip maps right flip maps being a directive of what yeah right and we'll and stuff by the way okay yeah and this is this is where i tend to fall on it is that i've talked about it a lot in the show because i think it's a fascinating debate and i'm so excited i'm fascinated about it too yeah i it does it it's what do you want to make a bet on right like i want to make a bet on gary vee i don't want that man to give up and ounce more rights than he needs to because i trust his ability to execute yeah but there are super talented people around the world who maybe aren't creating a genesis concept but could go and take and make blitmap something really interesting and i think i like the idea of having some exposure to that now i think that most cco projects like these only aren't aren't going to turn into that right like blit maps is a unique one because you've got dom hoffman like you have a real community there that's really excited about it and crypto i think you've got a couple standout projects that are cco that have enough sort of notoriety and and um in a positive way and communities that people could go make really interesting things there and i think it's interesting to have bets on both um but i i tend to kind of i'm not convinced that like for example i know the cryptos have a lot of like you know good community behind it everything but i'm not convinced that there's anything of tangible value there if it's cco because i don't have to own any cryptos and i can go do anything with it and i could make it so that it doesn't even look anything like any of those original ones and gives no value to anything that they've done there other than like some like like like intangible i don't know my point is is that like there the incentives are not properly aligned with cc0 there is no proper incentives for owners to like there there's no protection of your rights of that image and anybody can do anything with it so like you're kind of at the mercy of whatever the rest of the [ __ ] world wants to do yeah right and like since when has the world been organized enough to like do anything intentional like the right way we should do a panel would you be down for a panel if we got like dom hoffman or or uh grumplin if they were down to like kind of talk have a debate about this yeah absolutely because i think that would i think that would actually be so yeah the one thing i'm not interested in doing at all is having any debate with any of the funks guys they don't even deserve to have a student i don't i really have very little say i would be more interested in like a dom or like a gremlin or something people that are like that have taken over that punk's community that funks community too have been like really bad actors in the space i'm inspired in a lot of false narratives about like hugo labs being like nazis when in fact they're all immigrants and it's a woman-run company and you know there's a lot of like really negative stuff coming from the funk's community so um i would say like please don't support them yeah yeah they're not good actors and you've been really vocal about that i know like on twitter and i know all that history yeah and i'm not perfect but like i try to be transparent and open and you know my intentions should be pretty clear so yeah yeah i'll be curious too i don't know if you thought about this you mentioned guy oh siri so guy reps does he wrap all of you he raps like you cause he also rubs does he rep this is what i find interesting and i'll be interested in how this plays out because punks are wrapped by uta were oh so that's now done they don't own it anymore you learn about it wasn't just larva i thought punk's specifically the collection punks was wrapped by uta not larval labs wouldn't be any more though because that was through larva labs did that that automatically dissolves the contract they don't have anything to represent anymore because larval labs doesn't own punks anymore they don't own the ip the ip was the value that's what they were representing that ip's been sold from my understanding like those agents were potentially involved in trying to find a deal but i don't think the actual deal that went down because that was what i was curious about like does that does that representation transfer over and then you've got like cia representing i don't think you're ta representing punk's guy representing i don't think caa is representing punks anymore if i had to guess i would say at this point yeah i would say at this point it's uh under guys guys okay it's all a guy yeah and you're bullish on on what guy will be able to build for all of these and he's got a vision uh super bullish on on mr guy siri any final things i think we're kind of heading towards time here other things you want to note on any of this on chain are the hugo labs acquisition um well uh i mean i'm excited for the space now i mean i i really i've been excited for this space but we we went through a period here over the last couple months where i think we were maybe a lot of us were feeling some fatigue um just in general like too many collections coming out too much of the same stuff not a whole lot of innovation and i really feel like um with the more brands starting to come in we're going to start to see more mainstream focus you go labs leading the way in a lot of those ways creating partnerships you have things like what i'm doing with like kingship and you know timberland's doing with his stuff and jenkins the valet is doing with their ip i think now we might see some really cool stuff with me bits and punks coming out you know there's been like g-money for example has a game well he has an eight well yeah but he has an eight yeah he does have a game but he had this ape and he never knew like if he could really use that image as his likeness but now like g money can be like that that crypto punk ape yeah and he can commercialize that further right yeah the eight punk and that's like i think uh gonna be really cool to see like that sort of stuff and he just said i actually just emailed him i'm trying to get on the show because he's gonna he was like game coming now that i have my punk i'm making here's the game perfect you'd love to hear that he's like he's like it's dropping i think this week today actually i think he said he's gonna i don't know what to look at yeah supposed to link up with this weekend he's one of the people of like we've not been able to find our be in the same space at the same time basically yeah yeah he's all over the place in terms of he's traveling around um awesome and then i have oh i i want final question we'll have to have you back on to talk about nameless like we didn't even really get to get into the full brunt like you know spectrum of everything that you've done in this video it's just too much stuff um anything on nameless you want to kind of mention is there anything about about you know gary's dropping vf2 i don't know i'm assuming you guys are involved in that has there been anything with like the friends that has like surprised you uh i will say that like uh i've you know we've spoken to gary a lot recently about v friends 2 and uh i've been really impressed yet again with like i like gary like uh is a very interesting person and it's not always obvious like what he's doing when he's doing it like um like be friends and talking about series two i didn't know what that would look like and he dropped the book game stuff and you know you don't know how all this stuff fits into everything but i love how gary's taking care of the community that he's built already for for v friends too as well i'm super excited for v-con like i'm speaking at the event i think i am well hopefully hopefully i am but i i don't actually haven't come out yet so okay sorry be friends yeah i just awesome cool um and then like i'm moderating yeah i think that's going to be like the standout event this year for uh for nfts uh v con and i'm really excited for that i'm really excited for series 2. uh believe that we are involved in that one i don't want to say too much but but yeah really excited to be uh continue to work with gary gary's an amazing figure in the space um and it's been a very fortuitous relationship for nameless that's awesome yeah cool well thank you so much for being here truly like we i would love to have you back on and again we didn't even get to sorry it's been a very fruitful relationship for me well no it's not the same but like you know kind of it's amazing how we found each other and were symbiotic and it was fortuitous in that way like that okay sure they both worked for pull through okay oh yeah i like it um truly though like you know talk about namely you know again we kind of scratched the surface of kingship but like there's so much you have and that you think about and we didn't even get to talk about like your how you think about investing and things that i'm sure people would be eager eager to hear about so sure but i'm glad that we had an opportunity to talk about on-chain today that's like near and dear to my heart and i really appreciate that you like collect avistars and you're gonna understand like what it is that we did there and um you know i'm just so grateful for that community and everybody who collects those and i'm really excited about cyber brokers they're carrying that torch forward and like maybe even making it a little brighter um so and i'm excited to see what other projects like you know adopt the same ethos over time yeah yeah well and avastas has a really like die-hard community i think kai our friend kai had at one point done like a a look at um like percentage of holders who minted who like are still holding a project and it was like avastar holders and v friend holders i think were the two you have had your you know your hands all over both right in terms of that community people minted and have like stayed with those projects yeah which is and it's a lot of people's first nft i mean i've you know they're they've been inexpensive enough that they've made great gifts as well for people coming into the space you know you can give give them an av star and introduce them to it and then if they want to get really into it they can buy another one and then do the replica creation and learn when you look at the traits and you're like okay what am i going to buy now so that i can make a replicant that's x y or z or like that that's really yeah and that goes back to crypto kitties like we were like making stuff and solving puzzles and stuff so like that aspect kind of made its way into avastar's yeah we don't see a lot of that today in projects no no and i i definitely fell down that rabbit hole with avastar's which was fun for me being too late for cryptokitties well thank you we will do it again and i want to give a huge shout out to emergent order they are the ones that the space we're in right now um really grateful for them carving out some time for us here in
