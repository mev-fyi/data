are they arresting developers now david hey bankless nation this is the third friday of august hope you're doing well it is time for the weekly roll up that's what we're about to do david every friday coming at you you're in a different place are you going like uh mountain climbing or something this week no not mountain climbing i'm just gonna go climb a mountain which is meaningfully different uh oh okay me and the four alfalfa boys are right after this are about to go to the olympics in washington uh so gonna go have a little cabin weekend and then we're gonna go uh go to the high divide trail yeah this is so funny so this is different there's a distinction between mountain climbing climbing a mountain which is like you're you're not using your hands is that yes just we are just walking we are just walking a lot man again been getting into the uh mountain climbing uh documentary scene it's quite a like uh inspirational stuff yeah mm-hmm alpinist yeah no is that the next dawn wall's better than free solo all right does the guy die in the end though no because i can't do that no he can't do that again well all right in one of these three movies he does but not in the one i've just mentioned you're right no spoilers guys um sometimes it happens it's a dangerous freaking sport which is why i'm glad you are climbing a mountain rather than mountain climbing because this this podcast would be pretty boring without my co-host just me i have done this since we're on the topic i have done ice climbing in the past and let me tell you yeah i know and that worried me but like with like all strapped in you're not like super stressed absolutely i am not a lunatic but still you're edging like like ice climbing is not adrenaline not a team sport anyway okay some adrenaline and crypto this week as well certainly the tornado cash saga continues are they arresting developers now david uh there's an arrested developer yeah arrested that's crazy that's a big step up and the question on the back of that is is ethereum really censorship resistant we're going to get into that what else we covering david uh we're also covering the bad boys contagion topics are back we got uh three arrows capital on the front page of the u new york magazine uh so we're gonna talk about that also the genesis ceo has stepped down and 20 of staff is being laid off as a result of the crypto contagion and also more updates on celsius so bad boy season and also coming in in the third third hottest thing of the week there's an exact date for the merge we know we knew this last precise but somebody has gotten it down to the minute uh so we're gonna talk about that as well uh david while we're talking about things we should talk about our friends and sponsors at smartcon they wanted us to give the bankless nation a message which is they are hosting a badass conference at the end of september the 28th and 29th who's going to be attending smartcon what is this thing about uh smartcaron is chainlink's annual conference uh this is the first trainlink smartcon conference that is happening in real life uh so there are some absolute chads in attendance we've got eric schmidt former ceo of google uh sergey of course uh founder of chain link uh biology of course we just had him on the show sbf we all know sbf ed from arbitram stani from ave kane from synthetics uh so that is coming to new york at the end of september there is a link in the show notes if you want to take a peek and get a ticket also if you do get a ticket make sure to use the code bank list to get a healthy discount on that ticket price a substantial discount this this is numbering in the the hundreds of dollars yeah so you definitely want to check that out all right david let's check out some markets man what is bitcoin telling us this week uh bitcoin uh slightly down slightly down down four point seven percent uh start of the week at twenty four thousand 500 ending the week where we are today at 23 400. okay slightly down on the week no clear signal uh above 20k i'm not feeling good about bitcoin and unless it's above 30k but how about eth what's that looking like yeah eth down 2.2 on the week start of the week at 1900 currently clocking in at 18.60 are you surprised i mean we're gonna get into all of the uh you know like the ofac stuff arrested developer censorship stuff in a bit more detail but are you surprised that this action didn't hit eth even harder like price just kind of shrugged it off yeah that i guess that is a good point that like all the tornado of stuff was a big deal is a big deal and like it's been it's been like now it's two weeks in a row that like crypto twitter has been dominated by this like uh tornado cash of conversation am i surprised that it didn't hit ether um maybe i guess so i guess in a different state of the market i would have expected that to hit the price a little bit more but like it goes back to are we in a bear market are we in a bull market are we in a crab market and like one of the big indications the like actual solid indications of what kind of market you're in is what do what does news do to prices and if bad news doesn't tank prices you're in a bull market if good news makes prices go up you're in a bull market i agree yeah and i i do think back to the the statement i don't care if we say it every week on the rollup it's fine uh sentiment follows price sentiment follows price and so i think if prices on eth were down like 15 on the week there'd probably be a different narrative spun out there's all of all censorship that's why that's why eth is down on the week so because it's flat that really wasn't part of the the narrative this week and uh i i do think it's maybe an indication that we are not in a bear market it's also worth considering that like these seven day price updates that we do every single rollup like since we have what is basically one month on the screen the seven days it's just that red square that i'm i'm moving my cursor around right here the trajectory the trend is clearly up and so if we went for 14 days it would be green uh and so like this seven day the inside the seven day of just like just down 2.2 it's actually in like a monthly long uptrend and it's still fitting there it's true true so short-term david that's not your cursor well you can't see your cursor yes i can i'm really i'm the one who's recording my screen yeah no way i didn't you can't see my cursor yeah oh my god i thought it was my cursor this entire time no i i do i do capture your cursor i also capture my cursor there's double cursors there's two cursors on youtube yeah and also mine's bigger see i just place my cursor over your cursor and you can't and your cursor is gone unbelievable all this time and now i find out i guess i actually should have watched a roll up to see that previously or on spotify by the way yeah spotify you can catch that uh coinbase sorry coin coin market cap yeah yeah what's the what's the crypto market cap this week we are where we are slightly down on the week we uh ended last week at 1.2 trillion we are at 1.17 so down 30 billion dollars basically noise basically above a trillion okay this is a metric we've been paying closer attention to and it's gotten a lot more interesting in the last few months that is the bitcoin ratio what is that like on the week yeah it is up on the week it is up 2.4 almost breaching 0.08 it broke 0.08 earlier this week um fell back down but now we are at point zero nine seven nine five seven so the ratio looking real good on this has been up we've got a uh another graphic we'll show a little bit later when we when we talk about it but let's talk about the bullishness that is the merge because we can't not i'd love to talk about this we're like less than a month out okay it's like in less than four months it a month from now four weeks yes let me not flood the merch four weeks from now we will be in a post-merge world and this is what that world will look like monetary issuance rates if you compare fiat the dollar ethereum proof of work gold and bitcoin and proof of stake theorem proof of stake i'm going to read these numbers from you and this is from a bloomberg report actually where they're increasing their coverage of ethereum it's getting me pretty bullish so if you look at the fiat issuance rate from the 1970s until now it's been about 12.8 12.9 if you look at just the dollar it's issued this is different than inflation this is issuance at 9.2 percent okay per year these are all annualized numbers yeah ethereum has been under proof of work 4.2 percent all right so already significantly less than fiat but gold is even better than that they only mine about 1.8 gold from the ground new gold issuance every single year since the 1970s silver a little bit better than that one point four percent bitcoin better still of course right now that that number that they are showing on screen is post 2024 happening so they are jumping forward in future so the current issuance rate is about uh 1.7 one point yes one point six one point seven post which makes bitcoin on par with gold but basically and that's currently now if you want to project forward to the next happening that'll be cut in half again so it'll be 0.8 percent 0.9 percent something like this but ethereum under proof of stake coming in in four weeks from now at point one eight percent all right and then if demand recovers current fees yeah issuance and then that's with current fees and if demand recovers to uh the fees that we were generating it during the bull market or over the past year or so it will be deflationary at negative point four three percent pretty stunning numbers here david yeah we've been talking on previous roll-ups of like man ryan we might not be uh deflationary post merge but then if you look at this graph right here and it's like oh we'll be point zero but we'll be point one eight percent inflationary is like oh like it does the difference between point one eight percent inflationary versus negative point four three percent is like actually relatively small it's like still fundamentally bullish these scales for fiat and gold are like 50-year scales right right we're going to be like if this is when you're a monetary asset you have to look in 50-year scales there's another number that was on this graphic that i want to get you way and uh your weigh-in on is if you actually look at apple stock buyback okay that's a deflationary asset too at negative 3.7 percent and so some people when i posted this they said well actually if you're saying ether is a great story of value you should actually be saying apple is an even better store of value and that's an interesting take but the difference between apple and ether is apple is not a monetary asset all right it's not used within the apple economy you can't pay anything with apple dollars or apple as a unit of uh exchange there is reservation demand for apple stock in financial like well actually okay so you could like you could like stake you could like collateralize your apples talk if you're a billionaire and you can like make that deal with goldman sachs that's it right but like other than that like it's not like inside of permissionlessly global networks that have defy applications that are uh also permissionlessly built right and it never will be because it doesn't have the credible neutrality because tim cook and and team can change the issuance policy out of which you stop those uh buybacks right it doesn't have the credibility credible neutrality doesn't have the decentralization is not used as a store of value unit of exchange uh and um what's the other one media uh medium of exchange and unit of account it's not used as a money right and uh so like but ether actually gets like the best of both worlds it gets the stock buyback mechanism of eip1559 which is the same mechanism that drove apple stock to be like quote unquote deflationary so it gets that but it also gets the reservation demand of being like collateral money inside of defy it gets to have both yeah i i agree compare it to equities compare it to monetary instruments you kind of have to compare it to both and in both it's pretty favorable i've got to say uh we are bullish on ethan so are you david here's a tweet from you yeah so here here's a nice metaphor that i was cooking up uh and i say think of the merge as a current like an ocean current or like a river current swimming against the current which is equivalent to swimming against proof of work issuance is hard if you are a swimmer and you are swimming upstream you are swimming and you're probably not going very far you're getting you're becoming a really good swimmer but because you are have to swim against the current which is swimming against the structural cell pressure of proof of work miners you're swimming against the current like you're you're a strong swimmer but you're not going anywhere and so i say bitcoin and ether have become strong swimmers in order to sustain their current prices they're swimming against the current they're developing their muscles uh but they're not really going very far they're not moving but the merge kills the current because it kills the structural cell pressure of all of the proof of work miners and so as ether has become this like jacked swimmer swimming upstream all of a sudden this the the stream doesn't stops being upstream and it actually starts being downstream and so ether goes from swimming against the current to swimming with the current and so i continue in the tweet thread um uh that i say like when ethereum's network activity increases eip1559 actually increases the speed of the current that is pushing ether forward and so like the speed of water that the swimmer is swimming in increases or decreases as a function of gas fees as a function of eip burning and so the more network activity the faster the current is that's pushing ether forward after ether's already developed all of these jacked muscles swimming really fast and so like that's like that's like the metaphor of the merge and ether like supply economics right what i love about david hoffman metaphors is you could just close your eyes and just visualize them so if that didn't stick with you the first time close your eyes rewind this we run this podcast and listen to that again because jsmr yeah that's what's happening and the question i think is is the merge priced in or not we had an excellent episode with hal press who's i think the best writer the best thinker on this the best investor on this he literally bet his fund on the merged trade he wrote a fantastic post in uh the bankless newsletter that you should absolutely read it's uh fairly long but it is incredibly detailed uh send this to somebody with a tie financial analyst as well they'll enjoy this and we did an episode with him earlier in the week that you can catch on the feed but david we've got to get the contrary take a little bit okay and the contrary take to all of this bullishness is hey eat bowls crypto bulls here's a tweet from clark you weren't playing any eth merch you were telling yourself a comfortable story while you longed to s p i think he is showing a correlation between ethereum maybe and the s p price on this chart i'm not sure if that's what we're looking at what's going on yeah that's what's going on here so basically the tweeter is saying hey ethe bulls like you're getting so excited but look nasdaq's up we all know risk on assets do really well when nasdaq's up and that's what you're actually trading cut cut out the ether merge bs this is actually just the nasdaq and smp stocks are up so eth goes up uh in you know a higher beta form and they're probably right to some degree and you know argue perhaps easy decent a decent degree like maybe it's actually greater than 50 of the effect but we know with complete certainty at least i'm completely certain that it's not the full story and you know that that is true because of the eth btc ratio has rocketed off the floor going from where it was at like point zero five to where it is now at point zero eight and so did bitcoin follow the s p 500 perhaps yes did ether follow the s p 500 perhaps yes but ether was like a 2x multiplier on what bitcoin did and so like only one of these things followed the smp and one of these things followed the s p even more and ether did it even more and my argument is like that's clearly because of the s p or because of the merge i agree we're so we're looking at uh an eth bitcoin chart and this is actually from an arthur hayes article we're basically talking about how is on eth uh the asset and the merge in the trades we'll include a link to that in the show notes he just published that this week it's great great article as well and he's showing like this is eth bitcoin ratio and you can see that line of the merge probability increasing and ethan's just gaining strength on bitcoin but also interestingly enough david alt uh layer ones are not doing the same thing ether is okay they are still not relative to ether so that that's another you might say well of course eth is up relative to bitcoin because it's more uh you know um risk risk off a risk on excuse me but all layer ones have not appreciated relative to to um ether so i think this really goes to the fact that people are pricing in the merge that's kind of what we're seeing in the ether price right now at least all the evidence points towards that david got a lot more to talk about what are we what are we going to cover next uh coming up next are they arresting crypto developers and is that the future of crypto uh because there's already one in jail so we're going to talk about that arrest and why that happened and our speculation around that and leading to the broader question is ethereum really censorship resistant like they're there i i'm pretty sure ryan there's a bunch of listeners that don't uh pay attention to crypto twitter so like they kind of get it through this so we're gonna speed run them through the seven-day conversation that was the ethereum community on crypto twitter about his relationship with censorship because a lot happened on that conversation the last seven days so we're gonna we're gonna give that conversation to listeners and also of course bad boys bad boys what you're gonna do three hours capital is on the cover of new york magazine not in a good way uh alex michinski took over trading of celsius in the last days and really drove that thing into the ground in a grand fashion and of course the genesis ceo steps down and lays off 20 of employees with it so all of this spicy spicy stuff and more coming right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible lens protocol is an open source tech stack

cheap secure and fiction free arrest of suspected developer of tornado cash uh no longer suspected we do know that this is actually the tornado cache developer and this is f-i-o-d-n-l the website which is a netherlands website as to where because that's where this individual this developer was arrested in amsterdam so on wednesday august 10th the fiod arrested a 29 year old man in amsterdam who was uh suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through the mixing cryptocurrencies through the decentralized ethereum mixing service tornado cache fiod is this the netherlands investigation of financial services and final financial crime organization and they arrested a tornado cash developer now uh there's it's one thing to arrest open source developers uh that would be egregious uh we're not totally sure if that's what happened and so there's speculation out there that not only was this uh this person happened to be a tornado cash developer but they were actually perhaps also assisting and like aiding people in laundering money um but we don't actually no because fiod released a statement that basically didn't give us any clarity ryan what's your take on this well my take on this is you know first of all it seems very much like possibly they didn't have another reason for arresting this tornado cash developer rather than publishing the code as david you said we're not certain of that that is kind of the base case assumption and if that's the case a man was arrested for writing code that served as a public good for people to maintain their privacy online that means they put a man in jail because people use his open source code and i don't think david that can stand in any free society on earth as you said we still don't know if there are other reasons that this arrest was made but uh i believe on the 16th uh fiod provided some sort of statement on this but it wasn't really clear this is jake travinsky saying they refuse to say what charges are alleged if any so we still don't know if they think writing code is a crime does fiod think writing code is a crime two outcomes i i see here is that there is an ongoing investigation that they don't want to show their cards for and this is me like trying to retain my grip of bullishness on humanity as in like there's a really good reason i'm trying here it's like there's this guy like aidan embedded like money laundering of criminals and actually committed crimes versus uh they didn't say anything because they know that like they just arrested this guy for building tornado cash which is the outcome i do not want so it's possible that the first outcome the book still be bullish on humanity outcome is uh is still out there right and so we need to remain open to that possibility but i will say a few other things happen congruent with this which is um they deactivated the tornado cash discord right okay they killed the github repos of all devs and these were centralized companies doing this so you could argue this is kind of a chilling effect but still the chilling effect is in effect isn't it right it's legally a legally defined term as you explained last week on on the tornado cache episode and then this is the backdrop where ofac actually banned not individuals but they banned some smart contract code so what what does the weight of evidence point us towards for this arrest it is very possible that they made an arrest of an open source developer who just published some open source code bad guys used it and that's why they want to send him to prison and if so that is a big big problem i think not for we'll get to these stakes later not necessarily for ethereum not necessarily for crypto though it is a problem for for the technology more problem for the uh the countries and the citizens that live in those countries who are restricting their first amendment freedoms first amendment of course is a i guess that's a u.s only term but like freedom of speech freedom to write and publish code um some of these things are are very important in any free democratic society and these are the things that are in threat of being breached right now and without evidence that these uh fiod arrested this developer because they actually committed explicit and real crimes then i think as a community we have to assume that the man is innocent and didn't do anything until they tell us then in my mind this guy just got arrested for writing code so what are the legal experts telling us at coin center this is a crypto lobby group that uh investigates this and yeah as lawyers on staff what are they saying david yeah so coin center released a very thorough and detailed statement analysis legal analysis of the ofac ruling of tornado cache being on the sdn list so so here here's basically some excerpts from it that i think are important they write if the tornado cache application is not property in which some foreign country or national has an interest then the tornado cash application cannot properly be added to the sdn list or blocked under the specific powers granted by congress to the president in the iepa um i-e-p-a is what gives offec power uh something should be someone should be able to challenge the designation as being made outside the bounds of the statue and therefore invalid basically saying oh coin center saying like someone should be able to challenge this there's there's like strong legal grounds for somebody challenging this and uh coin center basically lays out the two big claims as to why somebody could challenge this so claim one ofac's designation of certain autonomous contract addresses denies americans their liberty and property without proper procedural due process uh yes cover this and claim two an overbroad interpretation of the iepa substantially chills first amendment protected speech so those are the the main core claims that coin center believes that there are legal precedents there's legal ground for someone to take coin center to or excuse me for someone to take ofac to court and coin censor is not the only organization focused on freedom to release a statement like this the eff the electronic frontier foundation which is an organization just dedicated to uh promoting the protecting the frontier basically uh and they put out a tweet that says the eff is deeply concerned that the u.s treasury department has conclude included an open source computer project tornado cache on its list of sanctioned individuals tornado cache is an open source software project and website that publishes decentralized cryptocurrency mixer and then they go on in their tweet thread and also release an article uh backing this and so now we have our our lobby groups our our protection our like our our frontier protecting agencies uh putting up a flag and say yo ofac uh no back off yeah and i i so important to note that ofac didn't arrest this developer it was the the group in the in the netherlands of course but it's all like it's all part of the same thing isn't it this global kind of financial apparatus trying to enforce these quote unquote financial crimes and is privacy one of those financial crimes this is a great tweet from alex david what are we looking at just if you want to get the scope of other notable money laundering scandals in perspective and let it be known of course tornado cash was used by some bad guys for money laundering i think you pegged the percentage at like 35 according to you to analyst so at least 35 percent of the funds inside of tornado cash was like north korea and some other like bad actors money launderers but that wasn't the only use case and let's compare it to other money laundering scandals in history what are we looking at here david yeah so we're looking at a graphic of just the previous biggest money laundering scandal so coming in and number one at 390 billion we have the 2010 wachovia wells fargo case uh where which was allowed to uh allow drug cartels from mexico to launder almost 400 billion dollars during 2004 to 2007. damn coming in at number one coming at number two 265 billion standard chartered british british banking giant 2012 accused by new york department of financial services says of its failure to uh control money laundering then helps the iranian government to circumvent u.s regulations to clear money to the tune of 265 billion damn uh donks bank donx bank dunks bank money laundering scandal arose in 2017 to 2018 when it was uh became known that 200 million uh 200 billion euros of suspicious suspicious transactions flowed from estonian russian and latvian sources through the estonian bank branch of denmark bank donk's bank from 2007 to 2015. 228 billion damn and so again go back through those again 390 billion from wells fargo what happened was a 160 million dollar fine no arrests uh the standard chartered the number two 265 billion the bank paid a 842 million fine and disciplined 10 employees i wonder what that means coming in at 228 billion the dance bank uh result 10 employees were arrested so 10 people went to jail okay all right uh no no fine maybe not to jail just initially arrested arrested yeah we don't know what the outcomes were coming in at number four eight billion uh hsbc uh uh the result was this a 300 million dollar fine no arrests uh coming in at number five 11 billion westpac bank uh bank paid a 1.3 billion dollar fine no arrests tornado cash coming in at number six uh tornado cash coffee source costs markets right we don't know at its highest point it held 500 to 900 million dollars but while authorities link some of these addresses to north korean hacker groups it's unclear how much of that total was used for illegal purposes ryan earlier you said uh 35 uh was in tornado cash that was in tornado cash at the moment of it getting added to the ofac list and that's after the nomad bridge hike uh heist all of these other recent uh heists when i was using tornado cash as for my own personal use cases like uh in 2021 it was reasonable for you pre-sanctioned importantly pre-sanctioned it was really before all of the bridge uh heist that we've seen and so like i bet you back in 2021 it was way below 35 percent i bet you're starting down below 20 and the scope of this we're talking like look 100 million to 300 million dollars all right look at these things insane uh 300 bill 390 billion our friends wells fargo in 2010 did this standard charter 265 billion billion with a b versus like 100 to 300 million dollars right and these are banks these are banks doing this so what david should should we shut down the banks like just shut down banks i'm sorry no bank has ever given me any privacy services like what have they done for me tornado cash gave me privacy services these banks didn't do for me ryan if the rationale is that smart contract code can be used by money launderers we also know that banks can be used and are used by money launderers and by the way these are just the ones we've caught okay so in that rationale we're we're trying to sanction the smart contract code should we also sanction all banks right like this is not the way to handle the situation it it appears very egregious to me but david maybe we should talk about the the conversation on twitter and that is part two of our story here because there are a lot of implications uh there's some backlash too but there are a lot of implications of getting smart contract code on the ofact list what is the first implication here and what are we looking at yeah this is going back to the chilling effect uh that has been created as a result of this ofac sdn list of tornado cache so uh michael zoltool he put out a tweet saying adding to the shame list openc dydx and microsoft because microsoft owns github and he says all these companies have gone beyond what the sanctioned laws required they didn't just obey an unjust order they went out of their way to do additional injustice and so there's been this meme created about these the over comply or uh and so like ah i'm over complying did you see the ofac editions today uh modifies no to tensor transactions seven hops from tornado cache fire an aml report there's all these people in the ecosystem that are just like doing these things that was not requested of them not related to the ofac sdn list and is censoring and prohibiting freedoms and users from doing the things that they want it's true everyone on ethereum with an ether dress is probably two or three hops maybe four hops away we noticed that was an analysis like the ninety percent of ethereum addresses are two hops away from a tornado cap fuse 90 and i mean that's probably because of like uh the aggregation of centralized exchanges but whatever sure uh so some of the people doing this ave had a front end block so anthony cesano one of the recipients of uh two sazzle.ethan 0.1 eat from the tornado cash like dusting that happened he got blocked from the ave front end ave has recently has since then pulled back all of this front-end blocking but they it was a third party that they use for the blocking right and they said we got to get more control over the third party and it's just the ui not the contrast but still even just the ui i get it uh dydx blocking tornado cache user so if you've used tornado cache you get blocked from doi dx and these are things that like are they are not required of them uh and so this triggered a conversation on twitter it's like yo like is ethereum like going to just bend over backwards and become like the censorship chain uh and this triggered a huge conversation inside of the ethereum community well there was a back and forth that that i had um over the weekend with uh antonio and i i want to make kind of like because it's important not to get overly like purist about this as well right uh and so i i tweeted out and this is around the time of where i was starting to see ui blockages from the osac it's time for d5 to grow some backbone and fight back instead of just blocking youth addresses unelected bureaucrats blacklisting citizens without cause or due process is unconstitutional illegal and incompatible with the free society it does if it doesn't stop here it just gets worse and then antonio who is the uh founder of dydx he was like what do you what am i supposed to do ryan like are you saying you want me to go to jail and if if you're saying that then why don't you spin up a front end of tornado cash like why don't you put some stake in the game and to be clear that that's really not what i'm saying right it's like i replied to him no it's not time to go to jail let's be smart but also on the other hand it's not time for d5 david to sit down and die and i really feel like this week has been a wake-up call for defy we have to catch our breath we have to organize we have to develop some strategy around this deploy some resources and execute i'm not saying now is the time to go to jail for like an organization like dydx but we have to find strategic legal ways to push back on this to protest and to move uh crypto and d5 forward and i think this has been a wake-up call for that yeah certainly um but it's actually gotten even worse um there it has been a conversation of like this fork of geth which is facetiously being called ofac geth which is a version of guest that does not propagate transactions or validate blocks with sanctioned transactions this is stefan from uh flashbots who is actually going to come out on the podcast on monday um but he's being facetious about this i'm not saying he's actually like creating ofac geth but the conversation that it's a to bring bring up the conversation is that like there's this world where like we have these ethereum clients that download a list of ethereal sanction ethereum addresses and just like don't include transactions from those ethereum addresses it's in the base layer software this is a base layer software which creates protocol level censorship which uh in my mind is bad uh but the point is it triggered this conversation which is really really it was a great conversation that the community had on on crypto twitter uh and then so we the next part of this conversation i think was really uh triggered by lufteris and he uh left harris uh can't pronounce his last name sorry he goes question for lido coinbase kraken staked us and bitcoin swedish these are all the biggest ethereum stakers and he asked them if a regulator asks you to censor at the ethereum protocol level with your validators what would you do would you a comply and censor at the protocol level or b shut down the staking service in order to preserve network integrity and he's retweeting a tweet that talks about just like if you add all these stakes together you get something like 80 or 90 of all steak uh and so this this conversation really triggered just uh the conversation that flowed so eric wall uh a man with very sharp edges who's also very poignant says question for the ethereum community if a majority of stake chooses a in this poll uh and this is the the poll that lufteris put would you one x consider the censorship an attack on ethereum and burn their stake via social consensus and we'll define what social consensus is or why tolerate the censorship and then and then he scrolls down and and it actually puts a poll and so the poll is you know x or y x burned the stake y except the censorship and coming in at 61 we have the the people chose x nine percent of people chose y so a very stark difference and then thirty percent of people uh picked a show show results and so really this is uh uh this is not really something that you can put into the protocol level that the ethereum community will say we will uh burn your stake if you censor this is something that we need to communicate to each other as a community like these are our values and we're going to make these values explicit well can can you just walk through that for people because i'm not sure everyone understands the mechanism of how social like how the like uh a social fork could essentially burn people's stake and and create a fork that is nonsense like uncensored while this censored fork happens could you just walk through a scenario right here so let's say those stakers in left dresses tweet uh become evil we call it evil coinbase kraken all of them you know and they decide some of them yeah and maybe it's not evil they just they just say we have to comply with ofact and so we are now going to only validate blocks from uh every other block that is not on an ofac sanction list so essentially they create an ofac sanctionable uh ethereum base layer and because there's so much stake there uh essentially a lot of blocks are not getting they they kind of control it so what happens in the scenario what is eric wall actually teeing up what does the ethereum social layer layer zero do about this right so the scenario here is that if all of those listed entities coinbase lido kraken all the big stakers all followed ofac sanctions list and didn't propagate any blocks that included transactions that came from an ofx ancient list basically if you are an ofac sanctioned list address your block you only get like one like five out of a hundred blocks that will be validated by a staker who's not following the ofac sanctions list so like 5 out of 100 blocks of your transactions only go through so making a theorem just really hard to use and the ethereum community through this poll where like 61 to 9 say that we will not tolerate that and we will send we will uh burn their stake via social consensus what does that mean in ethereum we have this concept called slashing and slashing is this very objective event of you're a proof of stake validator with a stake bond and you try to process an invalid block you lie to the blockchain uh you you did some irregular thing and that is completely objective uh objective you publish two blocks and they're conflicting trying to fork the chain basically doing something invalid and you're trying to attack the chain that's what we do with slashing that is objective and built into the protocol and it's going to happen automatically then there's this thing called social slashing which is something is going on with us with a validator maybe it's coinbase maybe it's lido they're censoring an address maybe they're censoring every single transaction and so like imagine like nine like all of these people all these ninety percent of uh stakers elidae coinbase cracking like the the government comes and says hey we want you to shut down ethereum and since you're producing 90 of blocks we want your blocks to be completely empty and they then if they had a gun to their head they would probably choose to not die and only publish empty blocks and that would be censoring 90 of blocks that would go through ethereum making the blockchain really really just troublesome and useless and so in the event that this happens you can't actually slash that person at the protocol level because it's more subjective as to what is going on as in coinbase is not processing transactions that interact with uniswap like they're still processing blocks and the blocks are valid they're just choosing to not include transactions that interact with unit swap or interact with tornado cache or do something and so how do we as a community get back our ability to use these defy apps there's this thing called social slashing or a user activated soft fork and so what this means is that because we have this like unique property in ethereum that coinbase kraken lido these blocks are being proposed by specific ethereum addresses so we know these specific ethereum addresses are censoring transactions and these specific ethereum addresses have some amount of ether staked with them and so what we can do is we can fork the chain and we can do something that punishes them we can either freeze their stake the most nuclear option is you can just delete their entire stake that would be pretty pretty damn nuclear we probably wouldn't do that on the first iteration the the thing that we probably do first is we would do what is called a an inactivity leak we would prevent them from being able to validate the chain and they would be forced to withdraw their ether state from the network and during that time they are no longer able to process blocks uh and then they like you could also slash them some arbitrary amount we would have to decide this as a community but i think the the first step would be like hey we're just gonna kick you out of the validator pool we're not gonna we're not gonna delete your ether we're going to inactivity leak you which means you are losing as much ether as you otherwise would be gaining if you were staking so forcing you to exit and kicking you out of the validator pool and only allowing validators who have not been censoring and this is this is a social slashing event this is a user activated soft fork this is something that the community would have to coordinate around saying hey ofac made coinbase and lido and uh kraken they made them by the powers of the nation state the monopoly on violence they made them sensor transactions and we do not accept that in the base layer and so we are going to coordinate around a fork and when that fork does is that kicks these validators out of the validating pool and they must withdraw their eath or else it's just like in limbo if they don't and so this is what's called a user activated soft fork and it's something that can only be done by social consensus of the ethereum community which is why this pull from eric wall is so important because it's showing that a 61 to 9 ratio of ethereum community members says that we will do this if if our entities censor transactions now this is a twitter poll of course right it's like it's not necessarily um reflective of every everyone of course but like what david's describing is basically the end game scenario here so a bunch of stakers centralized stakers decide that they are going to censor ethereum via ofac okay the community says we're not running that software we're continuing to run the original non-ofac version of geth we'll fork you this is the true ethereum and then uh they're trying to run an ofac version or a censored version of ethereum and like it's forked so you have eth on both chains you have every d5 app that needs to select which one to uh to spend their resources on the community has to decide a set of validators which which one to essentially run which software to run and it's a four core and may the best fork win and i think david in every single case what will happen is as long as we have a social layer around ethereum that says look censorship resistance is baked into the base layer of the ethereum project this is the true ethereum that the non-sensorable version of ethereum will win in the end and the reason it will win we know this from a game theory perspective is why would china go deploy and trust the ofac version of ethereum that's completely us controlled they're not going to so they state will continue to collect to the non-sensible version of ethereum and the community will eventually win like this is what i mean as long as you have a layer zero a social layer that is upholding these values and willing to run the original version of like ethereum that is non-censored we win and this is what would happen it would be a messy outcome the cool the cool news i think is if you're an etholder you just get eth on the ofac version of the chain right you could sell that if you want to dump that because it doesn't align with your values dump that it doesn't align your values if you want to or you could keep it you could do whatever you want and then you could um you could run validators on the the real ethereum chain that is uncensored that's that's where you'll find me you're gonna find me on the the non-censored ethereum chain i think a large portion of the community you'll find them there too by the way this same mechanism plays out in bitcoin does it not right yes and this is a great history lesson so we can we can move forward and one of the reasons why i focus on this yeah this conversation on teenager cache happened on crypto twitter it's really important that this conversation happen because a lot of new people came into ethereum in the last like 12 18 24 months that are still learning concepts like this and so we have to have these conversations out in the public where the ethereum community defines like hey like these are our values like no censorship at the base layer uh and so this conversation continues uh eric connor retweeted eric wall and says i do agree with eric we should make it known as a community that we stakers will burn the state of any entity burn at the stake any entity that tries to censure transactions no matter the reason these are the values that we're indoctrinating we're instantiating into our layer one now going back to what you just said about the this this the user activated software work has been a mechanism that the crypto world has seen before that we've done this once before so eric wall put out this fantastic twitter thread which i'm going to read here and he goes as the ethereum community gears up to prepare for its user activated software defenses to force any validator to think thrice before bending over to ofac there's going to be a lot of snark from bitcoiners and so we'll talk about the bitcoiner uh relevancy here it's envy user activated soft forking is the single most exciting thing that you can do in crypto bitcoiners had their user activated soft fork moment in 2017 and it is their proudest moment i am a bitcoiner and it is my proudest bitcoin moment the idea that ethereum would even be even close to achieving something similar is the most annoying thing that could ever happen they'll never let you have it the entire bitcoin rhetoric relies on the reason that they were able to pull off their user activated software is because users ran full notes this is the basis for the entire design philosophy it is it is true that the ability to run a full node is useful in a user-activated soft fork but annoyingly ethereum can still pull it off annoyingly to to bitcoiners first off ethereum users can run nodes despite what bitcoiners will tell you even if the default is to sync using state commitments that doesn't mean you can't enforce a user activated software you of course can secondly the outcome of a user-activated software is much more of a market phenomenon anyways you still win a user-activated software just by demonstrating superior pricing power so meaning that if if you're not a person who doesn't know how to run a node or doesn't want to you can still dump all of your ofac eth and buy all of your censorship this is the true ethereum is the eth class it's the one that has a higher price right and so uh eric wall continues and goes all of these things should be narrative violations for bitcoiners ethereums should not be able to use or activated soft fork is a core bitcoin thesis and i'll say this bitcoiners are better at user activating software than ethereums they are but they weren't born without ability they were taught that they had this power but what is that word ryan no idea i don't know ethereans can be taught the same basically saying that bitcoiners don't have a monopoly on the concept of a user activated software what most people don't know is that if ethereum's master user activated software under proof of stake they gain access to a weapon that is more powerful than the user activated soft fork of bitcoiners this is because a user activated software in proof of stake can selectively punish censoring validators i talked about this earlier bitcoin you can't selectively punish a minor in proof of work if a majority of hashtag centering you have to build a build more hashrate than the attacker which is possible it just is hard and takes time the non-censoring miners also in transaction fees that the censoring miners do not i i wanted to mention this earlier if you have like ofac guess and you have 90 blocks that are block uh stakers that are not processing ofac non-compliant transactions the remaining 10 of stakers actually make more money because they do get to process those transactions right so you're actually rationally like incentivized to process the illicit transactions uh if you can't over a power the attacker and proof of work the only option is the nuclear one you change the proof of work function and vaporize the entire billion dollar mining industry in one shot but you also kill the honest miners uh in proof of stake there is currently 25 billion dollars of east securing the chain if 10 billion of that is involved in censoring you can surgically vaporize the bad part and you keep the 15 billion dollars of remaining honest acres on your side and you vaporize it you vaporize it on your fork the non your non-censored fork right so it's like punitive actions like hey you're going to pay for this guys because your fork's not going to be successful ours is and on the successful ethereum fork you won't have any of your eth that is like the the stick that uh social fork can yield it's brilliant brilliantly elegant because you reward the honest people and you punish the negative people now ryan like i've always been curious about this like because you and i could take our crypto twitter conversations into this weekly roll up quite a lot and i'm actually cognizant that i think maybe like 25 33 of listeners are actually on crypto twitter and so i i've always been kind of curious like damn like from the perspective of the listeners like damn ryan and david are always concerned about like the bitcoiners and like the bitcoin maxies and like the tribes i want to i want to go to the quote tweets from eric wall's first tweet and so this is the set of quote tweets people that retweeted eric wall's tweet and you're gonna get two classes of people here uh one is ethereans retweeting the sweet saying i vote x i vote to slash and the other is you have bitcoiners trying to uh brigand brigade brigand the the poll and saying bitcoiners vote why because it makes the ethereum look bad can i just say whenever you're saying bitcoiners i want to make sure that you are talking about like not everyone who owns bitcoin but a specific subset of bitcoiner which is a bitcoin maximalist who wants all other chains to fail and only bitcoin to succeed that's what you're talking about when you're shorthanding bitcoiners when eric will is doing that as well if you're not on crypto twitter you're not like exposed to these like tribes that are warriors yeah and these zero-sum games that are being played we're overexposed and we are overexposed to these people so yeah if you want to like scroll down ryan and uh uh just see some of these conversations because like if uh the quote tweets the list of quotes let's keep scrolling just go through all of them there's so many the list of quote tweets again it's like here's stats sex and snacks uh at it's time for bitcoin imagine what it would feel like to know the integrity of your favorite  coin depends entirely on both stable coin custodians in a status mole rat that lives in a 100 million dollar la mansion to do the right thing even though it could sync them cry harder i don't know like these bitcoiners are insane dude these maxies are insane and so like again like there's two types of quote tweeters here people that are etherean saying i vote x and then people that are bitcoin maxies trying to like manipulate and attack the ethereum community because of exactly what eric wall was saying it's envy he says the user activated software incorporates the most single exciting thing you can do in crypto and bitcoiners don't want ethereums to have this power because right now it's the only thing that the bitcoiners have max maxis maxis yeah i i think that's what's going on what are we looking at here david this is just a meme like again the ethereum community is taking this opportunity to meme into existence like this is the press x to doubt meme but it's press x to slash so the entire ethereum community is like yo we will absolutely slash anyone who invalidates our balance and look so here's the thing a lot of this is talk conversation on twitter blah blah blah i mean at the end of the day if this ever happened by the way this is such i just want to emphasize this is still incredibly remote there's a conversation on crypto twitter but there is no talk of ofac or like the coin bases of the world or any of the validators running uh you know sanctioned code or running running uh censored a code here and and complying with ofacts sanctions and nofak is not even asking about so this is just a remote probability that i feel like uh the crypto space went and ran with this week as a thought exercise but it's a useful thought exercise but it's still incredibly remote and this is uh by the way we have the stick but we also have like the um kind of the carrot i think for people who are centralized digging providers so brian armstrong actually replied to lefterist's tweet when he asked uh if regulators ask you to censor do you comply and censor or do you shut down your staking service if you're a coinbase brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase says it's a hypothetical important to to note we hopefully won't actually face but if we did i pick option b i would exit yes coinbase would stop staking it would not censor transactions it would not run the ofac sanctioned uh validator code it would worth to note that the coinbase staking is extremely profitable they make a ton of money and brian is saying instead of censoring the chain and compromising the integrity of ethereum we will shut down that business just we won't do it and what will happen if they shut down more people have to kind of run their own nodes obviously so i think we've got a lot of defenses against this level of state the state level of censorship resistance and i think more defenses in a proof-of-stake world and it's definitely worth noting that these large entities stakers like lido coinbase etc they're highly incentivized to not censor the chain because they don't want to piss off the community like they they will we'll punish you we have that power and so like the the fact that this conversation is happening and the ethereum community is planting a flag saying hey if you censor our transactions we're going to kick you out we'll fork yeah and so like and we'll burn your steak and so they have to pick b because the community is forcing them to do that they have a fiduciary responsibility to pick b because they could get screwed imagine if they got slashed and they lost all of their depositors money right what are the costs of that so even just the prospect of us being able to do this and this rhetoric on twitter of like you do this and we'll fork and we'll slash right that reigns them in they can't take the risk it's about having this user-activated soft fork as a threat yeah without actually using it the fact that it's an option nuclear sus from having necessary mutually assured destruction baby exactly exactly do it yeah yeah don't do it though please don't do it this will be fine we don't have to fight uh there's some bad takes though on i think on this uh takes and uh love ryan sulcus previous guest on bankruptcy let's respect a lot of his ideas i do not have the best take this week but i think it's a summation of a lot of people who were saying like bitcoin was looking great and ethereum was looking very censored what was his take here yeah ryan selkis says ethereum is amazing but i don't get the sense most in the ethereum have the stomach to full decentral for to push full decentralizing without compromises uh uscc of course and ofac in imparting that and then he follows up bitcoin remains metal af both are important for the decades ahead but let's be honest eth is fintech 3 not web 3. absolutely terrible take ryan come on love you though love you ryan and so i follow up and i say tornado cash is banned in the united states yet tornado cash is up and running ethereum is fulfilling its promise on unstoppable applications metal af like sub tweeting ryan selkis here and so like you don't get points if you don't even have privacy at the base layer right okay so like people are just obsessed with giving bitcoin so much credit it's like well you didn't see bitcoin get banned you don't get credit for not having any useful applications show up it's on the bench okay like bitcoin is just like this neutered app chain like you all you can only get like coin mixing at the centralized level which has also been banned before bitcoin because besides uh you know transfers bitcoin uses basically it's it's banking layer it's privacy layer doesn't have one doesn't have a privacy layer but if you did want to use quote unquote privacy it would be through centralized exchanges which are fully ofac compliant yeah you're not in the game guys i love you i love bitcoin it's really important but you're not in the privacy game that's why ofac is not bothering you nation states aren't bothering you is because you don't have a tornado cash on chain that does not make you bitcoin stronger okay that just makes them not participating in the game that ethereum's playing we're jumping around here but here's a tweet of all these like annoying bitcoiners that are on crypto twitter they're extremely toxic eric wall again says the bitcoin maxis want you to fail you haven't even started and they're already laughing their ass off this doesn't even include all bitcoiners though i'm a bitcoiner and i will help as far as i'm able and he's put in four screenshots of just you know the typical example of like a toxic bitcoin maxi uh and this is like dr bitcoinmd a famous crypto bitcoiner on crypto twitter just like laughing at the possibility of a user activated software in ethereum basically there's like this cohort of bitcoiners that want to see ethereum fail and they are they think that they are just like about to dance on ethereum's grave right now because they don't think ethereum has the guts from a base from a base principles perspective like so for me the the value set the base principle is freedom it's decentralization it's privacy it's censorship resistance okay and any chain it doesn't matter what it is any chain that supports those base principles i support to the extent bitcoin supports that i'm a bitcoiner to the extent ethereum supports that i am in therian the extent solana supports that or freaking tron supports that in the future or cardano i'm a cardinian that's a tronian selanian i don't know but like it's it's it's not about a specific tribe or a specific coin or a specific asset it's about a specific set of ideals that we're protecting uh another take here an equally bad take i think this is from uh kevin o'leary another previous bankless guest we love you kevin you've got a lot of great takes this was not one of them this is a hell no kevin o'leary says essentially i'm glad the tornado cash developer was arrested now we get to move on we get to be more regulated i'll read some of the direct quotes i think we're getting to that stage now kevin says maybe we're in the third or fourth inning towards that but i'm tired of this crypto cowboy crap he's talking about privacy here in tornado i want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work i want that too i don't uh i don't need to be a crypto cowboy and i don't want to be one because i work in the regulated world okay understand that but this is the take that really gets me at the end of the day it's okay to arrest that guy the tornado cash developer why he's messing with the primal forces of regulation what do you think we're doing here kevin if you have to if we have to sacrifice him that's okay because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital it is not okay to sacrifice an open source developer who is working on the public good i know why i'm here and it's not for that he says we are messing with the primal forces of regulation that's why i'm here right that's what i'm here to do well it's just there's different kind of cohorts and reasons like so we get some you know like we get different tribes crypto tribes certainly warring it out we also get people who are just here for the money and that's okay but you gotta rest on top of the base principles of why the social layer is here another bad take but the question of all of this is david what can we do about this right all right so what is this jw uh verit person doing who is a um i believe he's a a legal professor yeah and a lawyer what is he doing right writes very eloquently he tweets out i bite ofac in the nose over their vague sanction of tornado cash i applied to ofac for a license in a way that would either obviate the harm that they did or give my non-profit the crypto freedom lab standing to sue them if they deny my license i think he's basically saying i've put offac in a corner either answer that they that they give me uh opens back up tornado cache and he wrote this very eloquent like concise blog post about the for the choice rule that he's forced offec into uh and basically saying like either way like i'm taking like either they do they take option a and oh like tornado cash becomes freely accessible to everyone again or option b and then they give me grounds to sue them and i will sue them so we have this individual going after ofac right it's great jw uh verit we applaud you um they might just offac might just take option uh c which is don't reply to these things which they often do but this is which he also stated that he will sue them for as well nice good job jw has all his bases covered uh we applaud efforts like this also uh coin center is doing some fantastic things so just you know three of what they're doing first of all they're seeking to engage ofac so let's not let's in all of this let's not attribute to malice which may just be incompetence they may not know what a smart contract is they may not know the importance of privacy let's make some uh space for that president is going to help ofac with some of these things maybe second there are some innocent americans who have funds deposited in tornado cash and they don't know whether they can take the funds out or not my guess is probably not none of this is legal advice don't know but uh coin center is helping those citizens and then finally they said they are going they're beginning to explore with council a court challenge to this action stay tuned alright so that's what our crypto lobbyist friends are doing we applaud coin center for doing that i think david there are a few long-term things we could work on all right the very first politician who comes out with a recognition and a need that we all have for a digital bill of rights i am supportful of that platform because david we need a digital bill of rights that protects our privacy that protects our cryptography that gives us the right to own our own private keys that gives us the right to run our own software that recognizes that code is speech for all citizens some of these rights are implied in the constitution with freedom of speech i think it's now time as we transition to this digital era to make this more explicit i would support laws on the books towards this that needs to happen but it's going to be a slow process the other thing we can do of course is start to form form prototypical crypto nation states network states as balaji calls them so imagine a crypto native country this is a decades-long project it'll take years to get to this but imagine if we set up such a constitution for digital freedom where we enshrined property rights and ethereum and other smart uh contract chains we made sort of you code is law for from financial perspective we backed our currency by ethan bitcoin we had a citizen level ids that are maybe verified credentials or sold bound nfds we use defy as our banking system we use dows for capital formation and that idea from bellagio's burned in my head of like let's start to work on this project we can eventually get un recognition maybe years down the road even if we fail this could be a prototype that other countries look at and they're like huh you guys had some good ideas here like maybe we should incorporate some of that because it's been successful so that's another thing we can do and then lastly david what is get coin up to and how can we help uh actually donate as individuals well there's plenty of privacy forward and also open source software freedom projects on git coin and so get coin in like four grant rounds a year i believe the next one coming up on september 6th uh seventh there is a three million dollar matching fund as in there's three million dollars out there to be matched for other donations uh so ryan you put out this uh bundle uh or this request for bundling of the top three to ten projects fighting for free speech and privacy and give them money because you know what moves the needle the most money oh so yeah uh and so uh there's go in the git coin there's going to be uh this privacy bundle which you can just like donate to in net and like all of your money will be matched by this three million dollar matching fund uh coin center i'm sure will be in there um there are other efforts as well uh but money money moves needles save your money for september 7th we're going to kick this off we're going to promote it on uh bankless and uh yeah we're going to we're going to fund where our values are in the future wow that was a lot but i think that was it was a lot but it was very significant it was by far the most significant happen thing that i totally agree all right with that let's move on to some other things david and on to the bad boys of the crypto industry celsius owes 6.7 billion in crypto assets and they only hold ryan 3.8 billion of crypto assets ro those are different numbers uh that's a delta there yeah there's a small delta there uh i mean this isn't anything new but we're just getting more and more insight into the state of these celsius books and it is uh what you would call down bad it's a sorry state did you know david uh financial times reported that alex mashinsky actually took control of celsius trading right before the bankruptcy so he was like oh things are going bad i know what to do i'll be the captain i'll start trading i'll fix this i'm pretty sure this is what's called revenge trading and i know hate trading yeah it's just like oh i'll one last trade to get us out of the hole uh and so we watched celsius do this they were like instead of paying down their debt they were just adding more and more collateral to their maker dow positions you got to take riskier and riskier bets to get yourself out of the hole right and that was alex that was alex doing that um nice job alex nice job alex just completely serviced your entire company and customers uh and also grifting off of the whole define name uh just a grifter of the ages is not um yeah it's pretty crazy and actually reminds me sort of the three hours capital story they just kept doubling down and doubling down and they made the cover of a magazine the new york magazine but not in a good way the title of this magazine is how two wall street washouts with a can't lose crypto headfund vaporize a trillion dollars the crashes surprised a trillion dollars can you imagine imagine having that associated with your name where we can laugh about this david a little bit like i mean i've been laughing about this through and through how if you're if you're gonna like bleed out your eyeballs about this thing you're just not going to make it in crypto you got it you got to like see the silver lining of this yes i guess i guess the cover of new yorker for the podcast listen it's kind of odd it's like those two like bitmoji type emojis for uh isuzu and kyle and then the actual article itself is like these just like actually kind of cool illustrations of them with like sparkles in their teeth uh yeah i don't know what to make about that uh in the uh a small excerpt from uh from the article among crypto's smartest observers there's a widely held view that three arrows capital is meaningly responsible for the larger crypto crash of 2022 as market chaos and for selling sends bitcoin and other digital assets pledging 70 or more erasing more than a trillion dollars in value i'd say that's true yeah right yeah sam bankman freed says that in the article i suspect they might be 80 of the total original contagion they weren't the only people who blew up but they did it way bigger than anyone else and they had way more trust than the ecosystem prior to that yeah so like this article is basically claiming that a trillion dollars of vaporized wealth was due to three hours capital contagion which that sounds about right yeah i'm kind of done with it david like i i know we we want to like cover it in pieces but like i hope this is getting near to the end of talking about these guys and i saw duquan did an interview last week i don't even i don't even care i'm not gonna watch it i just don't care anymore right like let's move on as an industry um learn what we can from these mistakes is no one going to jail i don't know is nowhere near jail developers gone to jail you're telling who traded customers funds outside of the scope of the product not going to jail three arrows capital who defrauded investors not going to jail uh like what who why isn't it do quan is not going why aren't people going to jail because they didn't write free open source privacy software david jesus where's the justice in the world i don't know maybe in time it'll sort itself out not sure but like hey it's back to layer zero we gotta protect these uh these freedoms and hold people accountable in the right ways some more crypto contagion though genesis ceo this is the largest like uh centralized crypto lending and borrowing otc desk on the planet by far the ceo just stepped down he'd been working as ceo for like seven years and genesis also cut staff by 20 this was more three years capital contagion just took i guess a couple of months for it to catch up with genesis and for these headlines to break uh i guess you know more more down bad all right and that is the recap of that thus far i hope that this is kind of like the last recap of this that that we get until somebody gets charged with something that would actually be a turning of the page of this whole i get my celsius money back or if ryan gets the celsius money back coming up next in the weekly roll up of course the exact merge time down to the second although it's going to change we have down to the second the current predicted merge time and taiwan using ipfs ahead of just trying to protect themselves from china cyber attacks what is going on there that's an interesting development so we're gonna get to all these developments and more right after we hear from some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your trucking account with juno you can send money from your juno checking account straight onto a layer 2 like polygon optimism arbitrarum and they have zk sync and stark net support on their way you can skip the ach wait times you can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an ethereum layer two in seconds inside juno you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees and your juno checking account comes with a metal master card that gives you up to five percent cash back on your spending juno is also giving you ten dollars cash back on your first crypto deposit and a hundred dollars when you set up a direct deposit this ad just writes itself so go sign up at juno dot finance slash bankless all right guys we are back talking about the projected exact time a precise time that the merge will happen this is marius uh a tweeter from twitter tweeting out he's finally back from vacation and he ran some computation to confirm the ttd date for mainnet and the projected date according to the ttd is september 14th at 10 57 paris time and what that translates into is about 4 57 eastern time the ttd is not actually a clock it does not listen to the sun or go with the rotation of the earth so as minor hash power goes up or down this number moves forward or backward but if we hold hash power constant we are merging at september 14th at 10 50 uh at 5 4 57 p.m eastern time that number's going to change that number's definitely to change up the precision of this suite and this estimate but like it's coming right like 14th 15th 16th somewhere in that range probably more likely the 14th or the 15th would you say yeah yeah i think i think i'm gonna guess that this date moves up as it becomes earlier because i think miners will turn off right like no one's investing more into hash power now the lower cash will go slower it will either say exactly the same or go lower not hash rate's not going to come online now it's too late oh what time do you hope it is i hope it doesn't like happen on the 14th like early in the wee hours of the morning oh yeah that'd be fine i would like to be awake for it yeah yeah because you want to just do a party you want to just like like some celebratory activity it shouldn't be like early in the morning yeah all right merch parties on guys this is on yeah there's also another air drop this week actually pretty significant one i think yeah this is a big deal yeah the safe airdrop for the gnosis safe uh and so this happened this is breaking as of well today at the time of recording uh nosysafe published an eligible wallet address list uh 50 million uh tokens about five percent uh are available for airdrop uh airdrop claimers if you have a nose safe wallet that had a certain amount of ethernet so a little bit of a surprise i don't think people saw a gnosis safe wallet token coming so if you had a multi-sig gnosis multisig with more than 10 eth in it and it also made two transactions you got the airdrop wrapped ether or ether are considered no other assets and the minimum distributed was 400 tokens although i don't know what the total supply is um go pick that airdrop up we will include a link to the show notes where you can uh click on that see if you are eligible or not um i guess they just raised money recently so you know airdrop on the back of that maybe i guess not and why does the multisig need a token ryan i'm confused hey you said everything that can be tokenized will be tokenized i recall you saying that on the bankless podcast my friends so that is that i i did say that um i guess uh this one confuses me well it can be tokenized so according to hoffman's law it will be too i don't even agree with hoffman's law anymore but it's still working it's still working as a law it hasn't yet been disproven all right so it's still a good thesis um open c what are they up to on the nft world yeah so there's been this controversy with open seas policy on stolen nfts so if an nft was stolen by an exploiter or hacker that hacker might go and then sell that and then openc would uh report that nft is stolen and then freeze it but the problem is a buyer a legitimate buyer would buy a stolen nft and then openc would freeze that legitimate buyer's nft basically freezing them out of the liquidity of openc this was this caused a big consternation big problem with the community because you had legitimate buyers coming to buy nfts on openc that were sold by thieves before openc could flag these nfts as stolen so openc is changing that policy what's going on is that they are still freezing stolen nfts but if a police report is not filed within seven days then they are automatically lifting that freeze on that nft and basically this is a tactic to get around false reports uh so people could like grief other people and say like that nft stolen and then openc would freeze it and then the owner be like it wasn't stolen that's my nft uh and so they're still freezing stolen nfcs but they're need they need to show the the owner previous owner or current owner needs to file a police report if they don't do that then that uh that lift is automatically uh released and so it's not frozen i want to get in the headspace get out of our crypto bubble for a minute and get in the headspace of enforcement agencies like the local police okay right here so think about this you're a board apr yacht club uh owner you have an ape and you lost it because you did something real stupid with your private keys you know i just left them out there and somebody took it and you have to file a local police report yeah like so what's the police gonna do they're gonna be like what are you doing like why did you do this if i was a cop on the be i would be incredibly annoyed right just at the prospect of nfts even existing and i have to go hunt for like stolen digital property online like how what am i supposed to do with this right and the tie here is actually like the ofac sanctions you notice came on the back of north korea hacking their own side chain right fbi has to get involved all these smart contract hacks the d5 is basically saying to the fbi hey come help us sort this out the fbi is probably like beyond annoyed like no how about you guys write your code better so it doesn't get hacked and so what do they do right the government responds and it's like we're going to sanction offac i just think that this is like these are all somewhat related and if we get out of our crypto bubble once in a while and we put our uh you know uh headspace in the minds of like enforcers right they're probably like pointing crypto and be like hey uh i understand what you're saying about that whole ofac thing but also how about you get your stuff together and like don't let north korea hack millions of dollars worth of crypto yeah i think what we're really missing here is like virtual police it's like our local law enforcement is not there just here to settle like physical disputes we need like virtual police to go after this police digital police but i don't even like that i'd rather just us get our  together i think that's a better solution same here here's pseudoswap royalty fee sweeto swap is finding favor with nft traders basically this is a news report talking about the absolute fantastic volumes going through pseudoswap so the pseudoswap is just like an nft liquidity primitive uh and it is doing some some great volumes uh so 10 million dollars i believe in the last uh accumulative trading volume uh so congrats to sudo swap liquidity something's coming for nfts and we really need it because of what's about to happen next well what is about to happen next then with this liquidity comes great responsibility and power doesn't it yeah so i've talked about this before we've talked about the concept the category of collateralized nfts where you put up your nft for collateral and borrow against it we know d5 loves to do collateralized stuff it's like one of our biggest things uh and so there's this application called bend dao which does this allows for collateralization of nfts and allows you to borrow against it and this twitter account cirrus nft says there's currently 32 000 ether about 60 million dollars worth of nfts being used as collateral for lows on bendel for the first time ever a lot of these are a serious peril of liquidation and he puts together a thread of the biggest risk to the nft market that no one is talking about a little bit a little bit hyperbolic basically board apes and mutant apes these two nft categories are on the precipice of a cascading set of liquidations because uh this bendall puts uh collateralized uh apes or cloudera's nfcs up for auction at like probably a discount five ten percent discount to the floor price hoping that someone comes and scoops these up a lot of them are collateralized and so a lot of these are going to be put on the market and there's just a like just like we saw that the 70 drawdown in crypto and like because of ave liquidations and century c file creations we're so we we can see on chain that there is uh uh cascading liquidations of board apes and mutant apes ready to go uh because of this like nft collaboration like i'm sorry ryan how many times did i talk about how this was gonna happen on the weekly roll up over the last like nine months at least like four or five times i mentioned that this like as soon as we get nft collateralization we're gonna have dgen's going on along on their nfts and then they're going to get liquidated and lose their nfts that's all right that's efficient markets man so people who are risky lose their money and that's okay it's a pawn shop nft everyone's going to be okay i think yeah yeah this is my knife too that i say like we're too degenerate as a community to not trigger cascading liquidations on our nfts uh and uh since uh there's an update on this it's about uh the first liquidation of one is about to happen there is one board eight board ape number five three three uh which the floor price is about 72 ether but it's being sold for 68.4 ether which lowers the full floor price ryan uh and so you know the floor price keeps on dropping which could potentially liquidate more nfts so hey if you're looking for something if you're looking for deals on nfts though head over to the pawn shop they're liquidating yeah liquidation a great deal like the fact that it is the apes i think is just like of course hey there's some horsepoints in here isn't there there's gotta be no it's all apes never mind you know uh mailchimp as well so uh bankless of course has a newsletter and we use uh substack right now we're looking at transitioning something else but um did you know david mailchimp has created a crackdown on crypto newsletters including the sorry the edge it's basically if you have a crypto newsletter they are not sending the uh emails out yeah so crypto newsletter got rugged sorry again the the i i think they're back i think they've resolved it somehow i don't know with mailchimp or with someone else but the hazards of um centralized companies if you're a decentralized if your crypto media publication like us david this is kind of a wake-up call to us to make sure that we have a redundancy here um also a wake-up call for taiwan in the face of cyber attacks from china they're actually looking to ethereum's ipfs tech to help out i don't know if this is a big way or what or if this is sort of a small trial but david i think what this speaks to is um interesting that nation states themselves will start to increasingly need to use decentralized technology like ethereum like ipfs like of course cryptography which they already use today in order to defend themselves against other nation states that is the reason at first the u.s mark andreessen told us on the on the podcast the earth did not want to adopt ssl did not want to did not want to allow crypto technology cryptography technology in the browser on the web but they had to in order to protect all of their stuff from other nation state actors so they just said yes to it i think that is the destination for ethereum by the way and why the ofac sanctions will not hold up because eventually they're going to need these decentralized asset money networks to protect against other nation states we're maybe we're seeing a whiff of that with taiwan here certainly like crypto currency cryptography blockchains these are technologies that supersede nation states they are an a level their dimension higher than nation states and so when you are a minority like nation state entity like taiwan it's advantageous for you to adopt these crypto protocols these cryptography mechanisms because the cryptography mechanisms cryptography supersedes nation states so if you are a subdominant nation state you use cryptography you use ipfs you use blockchain stuff to get out under the thumb of a larger nation state and so the ipfs for those that don't know is the interplanetary file system it's a decentralized peer-to-peer network that lets users back up and store files and websites by hosting them across a network of nodes eliminating central points of failure and circumventing censorship efforts the storage and file referencing system for ethereum is frequently compared like ipfs is frequently compared to a file sharing protocol kind of like a bittorrent uh and there's i don't think there's any coincidence that the news of this ipfs upgrade of taiwan uh i don't know what that means like i'm sure it's not just like universally like taiwan and no no i think it's probably a very small way yeah and and also the important stuff uh but comes right after nancy pelosi shows up in taiwan and then china starts flexing its muscles like that's no coincidence that this is happening crypto is entering the geopolitical nation state level uh conversations here decentralized tech is uh david do you remember all the way back from 2017 do you remember dragon chain yeah dragon train dragon chain yeah this is like disney's version of ethereum i mean it was it was it was uh disney was they couldn't officially associate their brand with it but it's like for some reason it got like like a wink wing associated with it yeah like ex-disney people and like it was it it was one of these things that pumped to the absolute moon in 2017 back in the days where we had a um asia had an ethereum killer called neo disney had an ethereum killer called like dragon chain it was all of these ethereum killers uh right now so the news is not that not dragon chain it's kind of dead but um the sec is filing suit against dragon chain all the way back from 2017. so this is like five years coming and now it's happening now we can comment on that in and of itself but just if you go to the price of dragon chain david do you know all-time highs for dragon chain above five dollars five dollars and fifty cents yeah it pumped from like bullet it started below a penny and then it pumped to five and a half dollars i made a lot of people very very rich yeah he's trading it now i'm guessing it's down bad it's down real bad i feel bad two cents oof 550 5.50 cents to two cents as a 99.9 something x drop that's a delay of wealth right there uh yeah so you weren't into dragon chain i was not my friend was but not not me personally like i just like track and train like i have this the name itself i was like back when like names were important i was like ethereum dragon chain ethereum track ethereum name is way better so i'm gonna stick with like the serious name it's it's worth noting that the sec statute of limitations is seven years so if you issue an illegal security and the sec doesn't come after you for seven years you're good five years they almost made it they almost made it um but you know you're not out of the woods for seven years and uh dragon chain got caught at five years yeah i guess it takes a long time to go through the process of this it's another lesson for crypto where we think things happen fast uh on other news in other news ontario cracking down what's this tweet from you david and tell us the news yeah there's new regulatory outcome like changes coming out of china for centralized exchanges they are if you're if you're a cryptocurrency that is dude you said china but i think you meant canada well i mean you know that's that's funny about that that's what's funny about that yeah okay so it's canada it's ontario specifically but canada go ahead so all other crypto assets that are not bitcoin ether litecoin or bitcoin cash these are the four cryptocurrencies that you can buy without any limits all other cryptocurrencies in ontario there's a thirty thousand dollar limit a year the a individual retail investor can buy crypto so that includes solana and i would say as much as crap as i give solana it is way better than litecoin it's so much better than bitcoin cash there's no competition there litecoin like this this is living in 2017. uh and so like only the they're not all these like enshrined cryptos that are like okay you can buy as much as this like bitcoin and ether good litecoin bitcoin cash absolute trash but then all the other cryptocurrencies are like like you're not allowed to touch them for more than thirty thousand dollars a year this is very similar to accredited investor laws where the wealthier you are the higher your limits are but like dude what the f what the f what are you doing in ontario what's going on it's not all provinces uh of course it's ontario and this is kind of ontario's version of the sec doing this and some people actually uh when i tweeted this out too they said these rules have been in effect for a while they're just kind of now getting rolled out so they were in effect starting last year they're getting now they're getting rolled out the other like tweak on this is it basically they're enforcing this at the the central exchange level so there are ways to circumvent it which is like you could open up nine different exchange accounts i guess and get thirty thousand dollars of solana on each if you really want to you could also buy a ton of ether you could buy it and convert it and then send it to uniswap and then have no limits there so it's not a ban on like you buying unit swap for example it is the principle of the thing regulator knows best right these are the four crypto assets ontario regulators have sanctioned d4 bitcoin eth litecoin and bitcoin cash these are the safe ones guys as much as you want i don't understand it um but uh and people for people don't know i actually grew up in ontario so i'm uh canadian and american but um i moved to the us when i was kind of uh in middle school that was a freaking tough move by by the way no another story moved to another country in middle school i'll ask about it in your layer zero but now like i just feel like i have to look for where i live right with like um how friendly is it yeah how free do i want to be and like this is like if i ever wanted to move back to ontario i might be second guessing it if stuff like this is coming down the pipe right so uh anyway canadians got to resist too we're working on it on the ofac side but there's lots of regulatory fights to fight coming in next we have the house passes the massive climate tax and health bill titled the inflation reduction act and is now being on its sent on its way to biden to receive his signature which he's totally expected to sign uh 437 billion dollar inflation reduction act um 15 minimum tax on large corporations one percent excise tax on share buybacks tax credit for electric vehicles there's 369 billion spending on climate and energy policies and also allocates 64 billion to extend affordable care act program to reduce insurance costs interesting that there's all this extra stuff that which is like stuff that we hear about all the time like you know affordable care act uh you know green energy investment but it's inside of this like inflation reduction act the name itself is like kind of like the patriot act like inflation reduction act like you can't hate it and also there's something completely oxymoronic about spending over hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to reduce inflation like you should be that that's what creates inflation like you're spending more money to to be fair so a couple things so one is this was actually i think the article we're looking at is from friday biden did already sign it so it's a lot now it's done right and um yeah there there are obviously some tax pieces to this too right so they are raising some income not just spending they're doing a little both but call me skeptical if this is actually going to do anything to reduce inflation it's just not i mean the drop in the bucket has impact on inflation this is just a micro drop in the in the bucket obviously before november elections which makes sense right nice nice bill to call it the inflation reduction act not gonna happen not gonna do much for it though uh david what's this we're on the releases side of things uh galleon portfolios what are galion portfolios yeah people uh new listeners people that came in last few years probably uh aren't familiar with this thing called token sets or set protocol it was a big all of the rage back in the bear market 2018 2019 but basically people could create their sets of tokens and like i created my set other people created their set galleon is working uh building on top of set protocol to make um just like more it's a little bit like index co-op so gallium portfolios there's four of them you have like the merge portfolio the fees portfolio spi uh and it's just a collection of tokens uh for in different ecosystems so the merge index 50 rap staked ether 20 liquidity providers like gladio rocket pool 30 d5 primitives uni ave snx you have the spartan index ecosystem spi which is snx lyra thales uh the ve token index for holders of vote is all the ve tokens out there so curve cfx fxs bao butterfly so it's just a new uh index index machine out on the world uh gallium portfolios so cool nice release there you go on the razor side of things we've got a16z they just gave 350 million dollars to flow this is adam newman's company a16z this is the big one of the biggest checks they've ever written values flow at one billion dollars adam newman of course is the entrepreneur uh in quotes behind a visionary yeah visionary right there's been many documentaries about him uh some kind of scandalous but a16z is a believer it's funny that like three or four months ago david uh flow was actually a cryptocarbon uh company no that was that was flow carbon this is that was flow carbon it's the same it's the same kind of thing it was adam newman uh flow carbon was the name they shortened it to flow and now it's a completely different thing yeah so i'm not sure it'd be an interesting story to hear like what adam and the team decided about the cryptocarbon market deciding it wasn't ready and then the pivoting completely to real estate but um the other side of this is this is an absolutely colossal raise with a massive evaluation and jason calcanis has a take on this what's his take david yeah jason calcanis from the all-in podcast and he states if a startup is worth one billion dollars before it launches a product it's probably a scam i tried to do some research on what this product actually is i actually can figure it out and that was actually a comment in one of the articles i read is that uh people we still haven't been able to figure out what this product actually is so that's the juxtaposition because we also know that mark andreessen is like one of the best investors of his generation and he's pretty savvy and pretty smart and this is him giving justification for why they're doing 350 million in this thing interesting juxtaposition i think not super crypto related other than this that's what is people are uh hype like uh like trying to look into the quote from one article that's that came that came from some investigative journalist said that adam is building a next generation multi-family property management system with a proprietary payment system adding that the system will include full financial services wallet a tokenized reward program and crypto payment method what yeah but yeah i don't know what that's about david i don't know our dragonfly they're a crypto hedge fund they bought another hedge fund called metastable metastable was like a 2017 2018. uh in fact they were earlier than that to crypto and they bought them to 400 for 400 million dollars all their assets under management um kind of some consolidation in the crypto hedge fund world david let's talk about jobs though let's do it we talked about raises so we got to talk about jobs a lot of hot crypto jobs going on what do we remind folks every week david that you should get a job in crypto because the private markets have a ton of money and these private markets are going into the jobs that you see here on the jobs board so there is a ton of jobs in crypto right read them off i gotcha dydx is hiring a software engineer on the back end stake fish wants an hr business partner it's not technical fish also wants a back end full stack engineer and a front-end software engineer and a devops engineer bankless we need somebody for media operations it's non-technical it's videos that sort of thing software engineer for boardroom labs a manager of crypto marketing non-technical mantacore games uh we need a thread or a bank list a vertex protocol needs a marketing coordinator non-technical a financial analyst from streams product manager for bankless success could go on but i don't need to because you can get all of these jobs at the bankless jobs board bankless.pallet.com jobs go check it out david what's coming next man questions from the nation every single week we ask the nation what you want us to answer so we got those questions coming up next does staking before the merge matter and also what comes next after the merge and also some hot takes from crypto twitter so see fantastic questions and the hottest takes are coming up right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible zk sync is an ethereum layer 2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll-ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk sync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started all right guys we are back your reminder get into the questions uh if you have a question for the weekly roll up you can reply to the tweet thread banklesshq on twitter tweets out every week and get your question answered this is the first question from skiing.lens on twitter is there a reason that e should be staked prior to the merge versus post merge does staking post merge carry any negative connotations such as missing out on rewards versus possessing already staked going into the merge should i stake now or should i wait until after the merge david what do you think i think that it does not matter uh i don't really there's nothing really special about staking through the merge like you get to say that you did it and that's the biggest thing is like you get to say that you were there like the financial roi like you're gonna guess like point zero zero five percent more east between like now and the merch because like you're just staking for such a little amount of time i would say if you are not already staking your ether the risks might actually be higher because there might be some weird shenanigans with the merge so as i would say if you're not already staking your ether i would just say hold on to it and then stake post merge and do that but this is my take too and this is personally what like i'm doing right it's like why stake now why not wait until after like a year ago when um uh yeah issues yeah when when stake rewards were much higher it's like something like seven percent something like that maybe there's some reason for it it was never seven it's like six oh it did start off very uh started off high when it was very low yeah anyway i could see that but that's gone down and um for me like there's maybe some execution risk in there but also like i i wonder about forking so if there is a pow eth version do you think they might disclude anyone who's staked from that from that by definition by definition you will not get the uh the proof of work statement again yeah i know you're not very bullish that there's going to be a high value po w chain but that's another reason you get more of that forked uh token if you don't stake pre-merge so i'm gonna wait i think that's the right call what's our next question from pete.eth he says or they say what will be the next thing to look forward to post merge what do you think david yeah i think uh the meta of conversation will shift into four eight four four uh and this is gonna be the thing that like cuts layer two transaction fees by like one one hundredth i think that'll be kind of the next thing that the general ethereum community um focuses on uh and there's always something to focus on but i will say it's also like like the merge eip1559 like staking we'll be in the revere muir we do have to like at some point like the ethereum chain just like runs guys at some point like there is no next thing appreciate that for a little bit yeah we do just you should just appreciate it yeah um but it will be 484 that we talk a lot about so 4844 probably next year probably sometime in 2023 hopefully uh and this gives scalability to rollups makes rollups essentially free yeah basically i'm using hyperbole but like close to free good it's good hyperbole i think after that i would would also say proposer builder separation but that is in the very distance that's like 2024 or stuff yeah and by the way rolled up into the next um next fork which could happen in 2023 is also withdrawals so if you stay if you stake you can be locked in like you guys i'm totally looking forward to withdrawals yeah i mean i i would like to get my eat back yeah yeah exactly and that's coming that's right now it's bundled in the same uh fork they're gonna co-release those things but that may not be the case they could release them in separate forks too all right david takes of the week this one uh from peter van volkenberg he is a crypto lawyer at coin center he's the one that wrote the coin center report and he says i don't know who needs to hear this but if the big regulatory battles are being fought about a different cryptocurrency it's not because your preferred crypto is more decentralized it's because it's because governments aren't worried about the things it does and how it does them and then of course with some nice context ryan john adams says i think i know who needs to hear this basically this is this is subtweeting all the bitcoiners who are like hahaha like ethereum is being targeted by like regulatory and like nation state regulations and then like peter is saying yeah it's because like euro bitcoin the government's not worried about bitcoin is not a threat to them let bankless let you and i david make a public commitment like i just want people to hear this right is bankless is about freedom it's about decentralization it's about censorship resistance doesn't matter what chain yeah all right if if cardano needs to fight the fight around this right because they're being unfairly targeted if tron needs to fight the fight around this if solana needs to fight the fight around this or bitcoin needs to fight the fight around this we show up we show up and i hope anyone in crypto shows up for these fights because we're all in this together right it's like i think the tribalism doesn't want us to believe that we're all in this together at the end of the day we are this is the crypto nation we are all fighting for the same things at least if we are preserving those basic essential uh rights uh so i just want to say that publicly in case that's not clear and i'll say that again like if you're if you're on crypto twitter like like in these like trench warfares with tribes inter tribal warfare like i i understand how like weird it is that me and ryan are like oh these big corners these bitcoiners like they are so annoying in my mentions of talking about like how ethereum is like the centralized scam coin that's controlled by vitalik's basement like i'm it's just so exhausting it could be that twitter algo tricking you though that david and like just put like we're gonna screw that let's put all these things in no the bitcoiners are like they target my tweets and they descend on them right now just harass me i know there's some uh this is another take do you want to read it yeah ryan sean adams says people gonna think twice about staking their eat in a centralized exchange now thanks ofac for promoting decentralization what do you mean what do you mean the meta take here is that this is getting us all thinking about decentralization and where the centralization vectors are and i think it's super good for the space uh long term so we're thinking about our front ends right maybe these more of these should be on ipfs we're thinking about validating staking and what happens if uh major validators go rogue and promote something that's centralized what does the ethereum community do to react where game uh strategizing all of these potential outcomes super healthy i'm pretty excited so this is the this is the beauty of crypto i think is anytime you get a kind of like censorship or or a massive crackdown like it's just like it's just like kind of the the water balloon it just kind of squeezes through the uh like authoritarian fingers and like manifests somewhere else and so uh yeah i think this is what progress looks like is the bottom line what i would say it's it's actually a good thing is that is that weird to say i mean people are like rose-colored glasses how are you saying that this ofx sanction thing is a good thing but in a way it is right the it's ethereum crypto these are organic systems these are anti-fragile systems and the community is the antibodies and when the community gets faced with a stressor we respond and we we make it things when something comes to attack ethereum we fix it and make it more decentralized so if there was a weakness we solve it and this is it only happens when there is stress like animals organisms they respond to stress ethereum is being stressed by this ofac sanctions thing and we are responding to it by making us stronger yep we're just wrapping around right now david what are you bullish on this week ryan this was going to be atypical for me i am bullish on mountains i'm going i'm turning off twitter i'm deleting twitter i'm yeah i'm going i'm going into the mountains i'm not connecting disconnecting from cell service you can't get cell service out there i'm gonna hang out with four of my homies uh and only think about trees you're gonna release all of the digital toxins from your body yes cause it's going to happen yes this is my first non-crypto trip since like 2019. oh dude you did a long time coming then yeah enjoy it enjoy the grass enjoy being outside yeah i've been seeing grass for hours yeah i'll um keep everyone at bay on twitter for you all right yeah all the maximalists you know thank you that will be on me this weekend i'm i'm bullish on zero cell reception ryan ready i am bullish on layer zero my friend so what is layer zero that is the uh the people underlying all of the guarantees all of the security that we have in crypto you have a podcast called later zero all about the people in crypto because ultimately this is our only defense our best defense against um everything that comes at this industry and people don't realize this whether it's bitcoin whether it's ethereum whether it's solana is the thing that enforces all of the immutability and censorship resistance and anything else that makes a blockchain a blockchain goes back to the layer zero right and that's what we've been talking about right so it's like if if enough people believe in censorship resistance for ethereum as a core value and a core property that the project needs to have they will run the software that makes that possibility a reality so it all comes out back to the people if the people stop believing this then we lose and we don't get the censorship resistance this is why i think movements like bankless are so important is because we are working on that layer zero uh and the tech can be great but if you don't have the layer zero to support it to run the software to say no in the face of censorship uh and to say yes for immutability you don't really have a blockchain right uh and i was bullish this week i guess is back to bullish on what i saw in ethereum and the you know the x movement of like i vote to fork out any censorship resistance and run a different chain sell my assets on the censored chain burn the stake if i need to and preserve censorship resistance i'm very bullish on that david yeah and uh it's it's the community that supports the blockchain that makes the blockchain right and like i said earlier so many new people came into this cryptocurrency industry in the last like 18 months and they probably haven't been exposed to these very tough questions because like some people didn't even think about that people are learning about what this means right now uh and we need to have these conversations every two years because new people come in and they aren't haven't had one of these conversations yet totally and so we just have to keep on rehashing and rein instilling what our values are on a regular basis because otherwise we'll lose them it's like 2022 is been the year of learning lessons right we learned the hazards of centralization uh and centralized lending providers with celsius and block fine others we learned the hazards of massive speculation on margin through a16 or sorry through three areas capital uh and others like them now we're we're learning the value of censorship resistance this has been a fantastic year for teaching us lessons this is why bear markets are so awesome i love them i love great markets uh me of the week david this is hilarious what are we looking at man uh we are looking at vitalik's new album which which drops september 15th called the merge uh and so for uh it's this is not actually his album uh but for the podcast listeners this is a like a very like dark looking like rap album with metallic and like this shadowy like look and just staring right into your parental advisory explicit content yeah the the merge it drops september 15th that's awesome uh that's it from us we got a moment of
