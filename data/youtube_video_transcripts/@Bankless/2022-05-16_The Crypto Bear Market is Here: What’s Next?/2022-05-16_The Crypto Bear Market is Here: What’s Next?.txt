this week ryan i'm excited for the bear market yeah look i'm looking forward to that too recession building is the best kind you said lower prices we also get back to fundamentals i feel like for for a long time people weren't paying attention to the things that really mattered in crypto and so we get a lot less noise a lot more ability to kind of like focus on what matters so it's kind of a great time to be in crypto and the cool thing is i've never been more certain in any other crypto recession bear market that crypto was going to make it out on the other side and be even stronger for it 2018 2019 i wasn't so sure i mean like it's the only thing that we've produced here bitcoin is d5 really going to take off will anyone care nfts weren't a thing smart contracts only had one use case and that was the ico so we've come so far and now there's not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that crypto is going to be here for the long run
