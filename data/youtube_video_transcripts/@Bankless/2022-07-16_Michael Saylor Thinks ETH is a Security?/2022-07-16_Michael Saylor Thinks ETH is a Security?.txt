you think that bitcoin maximalists let me say are threatened by ethereum they always happen michael saylor this week quoted as saying ethereum is obviously a security obviously david i think ethereum is a security he says i think it's pretty obvious was issued by an ico there's a management team there was a pre-mine there was a hard fork there's continual hard forks there's a difficulty bomb that keeps pushing back and then he says i think all proof-of-stake networks are securities all of them and they're all very risky it's above my pay grade the regulators will decide whether or not they will allow them to continue or not i don't know that the regulators get to decide whether the networks continue but i guess they get to establish some sort of stamp of legitimacy on them david
