Solana went down again why did it go down what happened it looks like there was a validator that signed two blocks which is bad because that's forking the blockchain and because of this the remaining validators I think couldn't find the chain they were confused as to which chain was the correct one because there were two versions of Solana and so both of them just didn't progress the Solana blockchain just halted so I want to ask this question of you if a blockchain keeps going down it is still worth billions of dollars which Solana definitely is do we conclude from this that the market doesn't value blockchain uptime Solana going down during the bull market I think it's not really excusable but it's more excusable but Solana going down in the bear market like they need to get this number of and like days without incident high they need to not be going down because you need to be Dependable of a blockchain if you're going to have the future of Finance on your ecosystem you need to not go down and you need to prove to the world that you're not going to go down and the rest of the world hopefully will care if their financial system goes down
