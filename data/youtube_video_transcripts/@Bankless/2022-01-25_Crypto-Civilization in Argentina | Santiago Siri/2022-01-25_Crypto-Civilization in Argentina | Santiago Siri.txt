i'm like okay there's a silver lining in all of this maybe the country had to go through [ __ ] uh in order to be the most apt country for you know leading in terms of crypto adoption out there welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero we were talking to santiago siri otherwise known as santi.ethe on twitter and santiago has been a community leader in the uh argentina space for as long as i've been in crypto uh while he doesn't currently live in argentina he still spends a ton of his uh mental energy and attention there santi was recently with vitalik as vitalik went around argentina and uh experiencing what argentina is like now that crypto has truly entered the argentine space and argentina has always had this very uh involved story with with crypto argentina is a very internet connected nation with high inflation and high capital controls and also a very strong developer community and so it's kind of this perfect breeding ground for a crypto society they actually need crypto for the reasons that crypto are is useful in the first place and it has just a an internet fluent society that really allows that expression that need of crypto to really manifest and so santi tells the story of more or less the fall of argentina from a burgeoning metropolis in the late 80s and 90s down to just a very cutthroat society because of the role of inflation and the loss of savings by so many people in the country also the the introduction of just corruption and from the government in capital controls and now what is perhaps going to be the other side of that story as crypto enters the scene and santi tells a story of how it's not really it's not like uh how we know america or maybe the rest of the world where you have society and then you have the crypto people uh santi tells a story of how argentina is becoming a crypto enabled society uh all of them uh and so it made me very very interested in going down to argentina myself and experiencing that for myself uh and just to see what a society looks like when everyone is on board with the whole crypto thing uh and so i really enjoyed this conversation with santi and i'm sure you are going to as well so we'll get right into that conversation right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible so you've got some money but how are you going

and uh i think this is gonna be the first time where we're gonna have a very long in-depth conversation so i'm excited to unpack a bunch of interesting stuff well yeah looking forward to it yeah it's true we've probably seen each other across many conferences around the world and we follow each other's steps on twitter and social media so it's good to to finally get to know each other a little bit definitely that's exactly what these layers layer zeros are for i use them as a tool to get to know the people that i want to know better but then also do that in public so other people can get to know you so my first question for you is santi what do you care about wow that's a good good icebreaker right there you know i come from argentina which is a developing country uh that has argentina has this tragic story of being a hundred years ago probably one of the wealthiest nations out there getting a lot of immigrants from spain from italy from all over the world during the first world war and even during the second world war and something happened in the country something broke something stopped working the way it did a hundred years ago and now it's a suffering latin american country uh developing nations struggling from one economic crisis to the next one uh with 50 of the people living under the poverty line uh with a high inflation with a broken economic system with very corrupt politicians and my quest with technology throughout my career has always been trying to figure out what we can do with digital technology with information technology that can help improve people's lives in argentina and in latin america really inequality is very visible very rampant all over the place and the one thing that i've seen change the world change reality change the way i live it change the way my community lives in a positive way has never been the politicians or you know the the next leader or the next great charismatic figure out there but has always been technology like i've seen throughout my life i'm almost 40 years old i'm 38 and i've seen the rise of personal computing in the 80s and 90s i've seen the emergence of the internet in the late 90s and 2000s and now with the blockchain and ethereum it's uh it's like this thing that keeps on unfolding in front of our very eyes and he has a tremendous promise to impact countries like mine that are desperately looking for an alternative because none of the existing systems and none of the existing monetary systems the dollar whatever you mean you know whatever it is they don't work anymore over there and um i guess like my my common denominator across the many projects that i have been involved with some some projects with a connection to politics other projects with a connection to crypto you know in a prior life i was into game development um the one common denominator is helping you you know use technology to help improve people's lives to improve people's uh you know have an impact in people's pockets directly like no no strings attached and that's a that's i think technology can be such a disruptive force in in a region like latin america where you know we we definitely are desperate for alternatives because nothing of the traditional circus work for us so i care you know when i think about why i choose the process projects i choose or why i work on what i work on mostly has to do with this memory of growing up in latin america and you know trying to figure out how to improve society around me you uh you were born and raised in argentina that was where your childhood was yes in buenos aires uh i lived there almost 30 years what was it like growing up there uh because as i've come to know argentina i've known it as you know back in the i think the 70s and the 80s it was just a burgeoning metropolis of just agriculture and just really good really good food and culture what was it like growing up there before things broke so i was born in 1983 and in 83s when democracy got uh restored in in argentina you know we we've been a democracy since then so i lived in democratic argentina mostly the chapter prior to that the dictatorship we have from 76 to 83 has been a very brutal and a very violent event in the country uh with 30 000 people being disappeared by the government a brutal i don't know we could call it a civil war between right you know fascists and and and left-wing guerrillas that were you know making terrorist attempts and killing each other so i appeared in the country right when the country finally after the falklands war the falcons malvinas were i should say right after the country got back its democracy and even though we became a democratic country in argentina i would say it's still a very democratic country where you when you look go through the options that you have to vote you will find options on the extreme left on the extreme right and a lot of in the middle and those options they all get votes then it's not like uh there's a lack of representation in ideological terms but uh from an economic standpoint in the 80s we had hyperinflation uh in 89 99 89 1990 i was six seven years old back then but uh prices changed every day like the inflation rate was five thousand percent a year uh this means that you know the prices that you have for products on a given day the next day supermarkets companies everyone had to price everything again uh and it was that led to a huge crisis um big economic crisis that led to the first president alfonsin to not finish his his presidency uh and eventually in the 1990s uh another guy came along called carlos menem who ruled argentina for 10 years and carlos menon kind of figured out how to fight inflation he semi-idolarized the economy he put he made a law that one one argentine peso should equal one us dollar and develop a strong connection to the us this is after the berlin wall fell so probably the world became more americanized after the fall of the berlin wall so most of my childhood and teenage years were during that epoch and in that period the problem was not inflation anymore but it was unemployment uh because buying us dollars suddenly was very cheap in argentina that meant that imports were very cheap rather than you know producing stuff in the country so a lot of factories a lot of uh companies had to close doors because it was simply cheaper to import goods from from abroad and uh that's a that's like the tragedy of argentina you know you go from dealing with huge inflation and then you all dealing with huge unemployment and it doesn't seem like we're able to find like a middle ground in the way we do things and that has led to i think in argentina in the context of latin america has always been very good at generating very skilled entrepreneurs very resilient entrepreneurs um i remember the the dot-com years i was already a teenager when i had internet access for the first time broadband access later on and in the late 90s argentina was able to produce some of the largest e-commerce companies if not the largest e-commerce company in latin america and that's a has been a common denominator of argentine entrepreneurs being able to capture the latin american market basically because brazil speaks another language and it's a has a huge domestic market so they don't care what happens outside brazil and mexico has a lot of the talent uh actually going to the us uh because it's right there so argentina always strategically had a very strong position of generating good entrepreneurs and building technology that historically has been a leader in the region in latin america and i think our history of you know knowing that we're dealing with a very broken economic system that we will deal with inflation we will deal with uh you know we will deal with a lot of kinds of bizarre crises that you can you know you cannot even imagine but it's a country that is constantly under you know whenever i talked to my mom today i asked her well how's argentina doing and she tells me worse than ever before and that's always her answer for the last seven years since i left uh and it's always like getting worse and worse but at the end of the day that has led to the like the argentine people to be very resilient very resourceful uh very entrepreneurial very uh capable of thinking outside the box and you know i i i was lucky enough that i grew up with a family that uh you know gave me a good education i was able to travel around the world to visit europe or visit the us when i was a child and that helped certainly help open up my mind uh in a great way and like that had a lasting impact in my life and that's why i'm probably talking to you here in english or i develop a career more more internationally but when i look back at the country its people are are amazing like it's an incredible bunch of creative uh lateral thinkers that can come up with incredible solutions and you know fast forward to today i see it in the crypto community in argentina a lot of the innovation being built around ethereum uh being built around bitcoin uh a lot of the the mines that are emerging from from argentina engineers developers hackers entrepreneurs are simply brilliant by any international measure and this is literally the children of hyperinflation the children of uh you know the comparativity that led to huge unemployment in the 90s you know i wish we could find a formula for our country we always tell say told ourselves that we're a country of individuals who are very good at the individual level but probably not so good at the community or team level i collectively we don't seem to work efficiently we cannot even manage our own country but individually you know we produce probably the best soccer players in the world or we produce a great entrepreneurs that whenever they have to go abroad they become very successful but internally in the country it's like a messed up place and uh you know it's always a challenge uh but you know it's the place i was born and it's the place i love and and and you know there's a lot of fantastic things about our culture and you know how we treasure friendship or how we connect with other people that it's something really special i want to definitely have this individual versus collective um theme as one of the crux of this conversation but before we in order to get there i want to keep on unpacking some of just the um originating influences of argentina the thing i want to learn um the most right now is is uh what was the order of operations for this like change in argentina uh like we i think inflation is at the very beginning of the story but what caused inflation like what was the original um thing that started this cascading set of events well it's um inflation has always been a constant i you know there depends on who you ask you will get different answers to this question for sure you know there will be the monetaries that will tell you is you know they are printing and printing and printing money and that's probably maybe the case uh i'm pretty sure that you know in the 80s when we had hyperinflation the only solution that the government could come up with was let's just print more money and that led to a disaster um then there could be you know there are other factors in place as well it's a kind of argentine as a country very much dependent on commodity prices uh our biggest export is soy and soy prices go up they go down when there are you know good years argentina has a lot of reserves when there are bad years the country is about to explode in a in a crisis um so and you know there's a lot of people you know simply playing the media playing playing politics uh behind people's you know interests and that you know you know it's a it's a bit of a tragic consequence we're still you know dealing with that today over the last 20 years argentina again when uh the convertibility or the you know the ability to convert u.s dollars to pesos one to one when that economic project ended we went back to an inflationary model and the currency has systematically lost its value 200 times so in the 90s it was one peso one dollar when that ended uh in 2001 we had a huge crisis and now we are back to 200 pesos one dollar suddenly our currency lost 200 times its value in the last 20 years and um you know the economic factors the external factors probably has to do with commodity prices and macro uh variables like that and from and from the internal standpoint because the country has such a has a lot of a i would say like uh humanitarian problems like uh if you walk through the streets of buenos aires and actually we did this with vitalik uh there are some huge slabs in the middle of the most wealthy neighborhoods in the city so you have this huge inequality in the country and uh with vitalik we actually visited one of these slums so he could get a close view of you know how a lot of people live in a country like argentina not just the tourist version of the country and you see this inequality all over the place uh there's a five more than five thousand slams where people do not have access to basic goods to basic water to basic needs uh they might have you know the youth smartphones and an internet connection uh so the people are connected but like infrastructure is simply not there and sadly the i guess like many populist politicians uh their only solution or the only remedy to address a situation like that is let's just put you know money in their pockets regardless of taking any consideration of how that money is created they just print it and that that populist formula uh you know works for a little while and in the long run generates this situation of the country losing value significantly and you know it's simply a very tragic consequence because it perpetuates the position people are living in the lack of infrastructure the lack of investment it perpetuates the inequality and it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy so it because the inequality keeps growing people you know politicians keep printing and the more they print you know the more the status quo remains it's the same and there's simply it seems to me that at least from the generations above me you know that they go over the country in the past they are simply not able to think outside the box uh the discussion in argentina has always been shall we agree with the imf and get some u.s dollars to strengthen our currency but get a huge debt and the debt keeps growing with the imf or we give our back to the imf and suddenly we become a pro venezuela pro cuba country disconnected from the financial world and you know we try to do the revolution quote unquote and none of these approaches are really you know addressing people's problems addressing the situation from a structural or from a systemic point of view it's just opportunist populist politicians taking advantage and misusing uh public resources uh you know regardless of the ideological sign of who is in charge uh and you know i think that today we have there's a generational change at least the the crypto generation or the online generation let's not call them millennials you know we have the online generation the offline generation the online generation is growing up you know i'm probably one of the oldest members of that generation but there's a lot of kids from you know between 20 and 30 years old that are now suddenly uh thinking in a much different way about money about the value about uh you know connected to the world and looking you know realizing that argentina is not a special case in the planet that you know we we can certainly think globally and connect with with the world at large and there's a new generation that i hope starts thinking about these issues in a different way i see it in the development front the developer community the soft the hackers the software developers are certainly uh innovating in a way that has no precedent in the country for the first time there are projects being born in argentina that are global they are not looking at latin america as a market but are actually thinking in global terms uh there's a generation of engineers that have created some of the most successful companies built around ethereum uh thinking about you know crypto and technology uh as a way of addressing some of the challenges that society is facing and you know i recently visited argentina just a few weeks ago for vitalik's trip there and i haven't been there since before the pandemic and it was kind of like suddenly uh getting into a like the back to the futures car and actually traveling to the year 2034 because it really felt very futuristic everyone under 30 years old recognized vitalik in the streets they knew who he was they knew about ethereum they asked him about ethereum 2.0 or you know what is the merge gonna happen like random people in the streets uh most of them obviously under probably under 30 years old but it's like uh in the pandemic a lot of people suddenly accelerated their uh learning skills about crypto or got into crypto in argentina we have a high inflation capital controls the it's it's illegal to buy u.s dollars even though there's a uh uh a dark or a black market of it uh and we have uh subsidized energy so everyone and their mothers are mining crypto they're having miners at home like uh it's it's almost insane you you see that like in the restaurant where we were with vitalik the waiter came to ask him for a picture the taxi driver asked him things about crypto everyone suddenly vitalik discovered that he has big shagal status in argentina and i think that the pandemic accelerated people learning about this technology the bull market also benefited a lot of people and suddenly there's like i perceived for the first time in new zealand asia in argentina that it's uh really connected to this stuff in a way that is way more significant than what i see here in spain where i live in spain it's a you know it's the euro comfort zone uh the the the state the welfare state works fantastic people live a very secure life they they are everyone is in a comfort level that they are not not that anyone no one is taking any risks in europe uh in spain like very there's very few entrepreneurs very few crypto mines whereas in argentina it's like everywhere you see it in the billboards in the streets there's uh the you know the most important streets are filled with advertisement about crypto startups and crypto companies and it's i feel like the country is like making a leapfrog after the pandemic in adoption not only at the developer level which is what i knew but what caught me by surprise is that at the user level uh you were seeing this kind of popular adoption of of of ethereum and and bitcoin and all of this new tech and to me that speaks greatly about what crypto is achieving because from a geopolitical standpoint argentina is you know at the end of the world it's a forgotten country third world nation struggling through financial crisis to financial crisis and in the last seven years uh i've been pretty much in over 30 countries following the ethereum crowd following you know the this revolution around the world and the fact that argentina is suddenly growing in adoption so aggressively speaks greatly of crypto speaks greatly of this technology because it means that the technology is being impacting the most where it's really needed the most uh in argentina it's not a theoretical quirk to learn about crypto or an investment opportunity it's for a lot of people a necessity they need it they can't buy dollars they are filled with pesos that are worthless they need this thing and to me that gives me a lot of hope about the future of the country uh the past of the country is a disaster i can tell you uh but it's still a great country with great people and i think that this new generation or what crypto is doing there uh it's a very fertile ground for this technology and some years ago it was still a thing of us the nerds you know but today you know it's on mainstream media when vitalik was there you turned on the tv in argentina every news show was talking about this guy and that was a a revelation probably to italic discovering that he'll probably be facing this more and more in the future anywhere he goes uh so dealing with his celebrity status will be a challenge for him but i think he he will do fantastic because he's a he's simply an amazing human being he's a monk that travels around the world with his backpack speaking the word you know preaching the truth uh and the but for argentina was a like a big epiphany for society like suddenly everyone was like hey you're into crypto i'm into crypto also like everyone and uh i i i'm a public figure there in the the crypto scene and whatnot and i realized that like the the the amount of messages and vms and emails and phone calls uh that i got since since that trip is beyond my my traditional level of information diet and it gives me the signal that there's something very serious brewing up there and it's coming from you know from the youth bottom up it's not like the el salvador case where you know el salvador got lucky enough to have a millennial president and this guy sadly he's kind of a maximalist but he's pushing bitcoin through everyone's throats top down uh in argentina is bottom up adoption no and with vitalik we have been able to meet with an ex-president with a potential future president uh with the government uh with a you know left-wing activist you met with a whole spectrum of uh leaders that the country has everyone left aside their differences that's the power that vitalik had uh not i don't think many people in the world can unite argentines uh like vitalik did and and it's because everyone is realizing that there's this thing happening in the with the new generations that is uh very wild very well and uh that gives me hope you know the last little bit of context i want to unpack before uh getting even more into the crypto conversation is the um the background around uh the government and the people's uh trust or lack of trust in the government uh my general understanding of the argentine government was that at one point in time it was a democracy with its feet under itself making progress and then corruption kind of took over perhaps around the same time that inflation did and my general gut take was that people were optimistic about the future of argentine leadership but when the going got tough it got really hard for people to think in the long term and so the incentive for corruption started to outweigh the incentive to actually build stuff can you kind of just like walk us through um the progression of people's trust in the government and the progression of corruption in argentina yeah it's uh i can tell you what i witnessed uh you know living there um inflation is a terrible thing like really terrible because it it's like uh the fable of the boiling frog like you don't realize how terrible it is until it's too late um the the thing about inflation like in argentina everyone now is used to fifty percent of annual inflation yeah compare that to america six percent recently reported yeah we were in the six percent level probably 15 years ago and suddenly you know all hall broke loose and that leads to situations like if you're a business owner you will have to renegotiate salaries every three months or every six months and it's a it's a very uncomfortable and pleasant conversation to renegotiate salaries with the people who are working for you and who are like building this thing with you and yeah every three or six months and you have to renegotiate salaries all over again having some pleasant conversation this friction uh between you know the management and and and the workers and this generates a very uh a very aggressive culture a very a culture where people don't treat each other nicely uh argent you know argentines are known to be very very aggressive i have many theories about that but inflation certainly permeates our culture another reason might be that we eat a lot of meat i once tweeted this on on twitter and i received a thousand replies of people like trash talking me and insulting me kind of proving my point of how how we are how we are with the you know within in a level of aggression i realized this more and more the more i leave the red meat turns into testosterone yeah like just compare us with india like india no one eats meat and they seem more chill than us in argentina you will eat for breakfast you will eat meat for lunch you will admit that dinner it's it's a carnivore country yeah maybe even a big cannibal i would say we eat our own so it's um inflation definitely like generates uh an aggressive culture and you know the distrust when we when we had the convertibility in the 90s which was one peso one dollar and it was a low and no one could print any pesos without packing that up with us dollars uh that worked very well for for a few years it had the rising issue of unemployment uh there was a lot of corruption during those years and when the tide changed globally either commodity prices went down or we started you know at the end of the day the policy of the us dollar is mandated by a single country you know the united states so whenever the united states changes its policy sadly argentina has no maneuver over that and you know we there were some uh crisis you know my financial crisis happened in the late 90s uh and that led to you know countries like argentina sally you know losing economic capacity losing a you know the ability to produce the ability to do a lot of things and that led to a situation where our research almost dried out uh the imf was not going to lend us any money uh the twin towers attack 911 happened so that definitely shut the doors of the imf like there was simply no consideration for what's going on argentina when 9 11 happened and right after 9 11 happened we started receiving funds from the us uh the banks suddenly uh closed the you know the the you know it was you were only able to retire from the bank uh 250 dollars per week uh that was the the cap of how much money you were able to retire from the bank when that got announced a bank run happened uh people took the streets and they took their you know their uh like their kitchen instruments and they started like going to the banks and asking for their savings back and of course the savings never came back uh the government changed uh we changed we had five presidents in one week uh and a guy came that said now it's gonna be four pesos one dollar next the the currency got devaluated you know forex uh in one day uh people lost their savings their life savings in a dramatic way and that has led to everyone simply distrusting bugs never keep your money in the bank in argentina for example if you want to buy a home you want to buy an apartment or you want to buy a car you don't do a bank transfer you don't do a wire transfer no one has their money in the bank you go with a backpack or some you know something that might not be too flashy and you just keep the stash of us dollars and you just you know you go to a private meeting someone will count the us dollars you know everyone will count them once you make sure the money is right the premium is a cash transaction buying an apartment in argentina is unbelievably a cash transaction more recently has been there there have been crypto transactions but uh until very recently a 100 of the apartments in argentina were bought with cash uh that's how much we distrust because of trust because that's the only way you can trust that's the only way no one wants their money in the bank after what happened in 2001 no one wants to keep their money in the bank a lot of people and this this is another consequence very tragic consequence a lot of people keep their money at home like they literally keep the piles of cash under the mattress or even somewhere at home and that leads to a lot of robbers and thieves suddenly trying to enter your home and you know kidnap you and try to steal your money uh there was a period where there were anybody yeah it's a honeypot there were a lot of kidnapping events uh you know during a moment where you know it was very common it was called express kidnapping sequel express like you didn't even have branding like oh i know you you turned on the tv and you saw another episode of express kidnapping happened here and they tied the person and they stole their money because they people kept their money at home they don't want any i want it in the banks and that leads to a lot of violence to a lot of violence like very violent situations very violent country uh and you know it's it's it's incredible what uh a lack of good governance can do to a country argentina is like has every checks every mark of everything done uh the wrong way and it's a it's really a very sad thing that's why today the country is suffering uh uh a lot of people live are living like people like me left the country uh people that are you know young they're starting their families or they want to you know the world has become much smaller in the you know the past decades it's much easier to live abroad today than ever before and a lot of you know people that you know want to pursue a career that came out of the university that want to become an entrepreneur they just are gonna try the you know to do it abroad and the country is losing uh a lot of bright minds uh and it's it's like the the ripple effect uh has been tremendous in the country so that's why i don't know how how much worse it can get that's my hopeful note there like it can get any worse than this you know there has to be a floor at a certain point and a bounce eventually happening i think crypto might help us bounce uh how high can we bounce well we'll see we'll find out in the next couple of decades but um i i i still remain optimistic about what can be done i think this story is just a great example of what happens when social systems break down and bankless listeners will know what line i always say next where one of my favorite lines out of the cypherpunk manifesto is that um cypherpunks understand that the code they write impacts the people that use it and code includes things like governments uh like like democracies like our constitution like the protocol for coordination across the country and um i think many many bitcoiners always say that like money is at the that the basement of everything right like if you fix money you fix everything also if you break money you break everything uh and so these social systems like exist on top of the money that we use um and so like what i'm seeing is that um the argentine uh money broke down for a handful of reasons both externally and internally and as a result of that how far people could extend trust to their neighbors and communities had to contract significantly i went from a whole entire country down to like you know your family your local family and your friends because that's the only people that you can trust and you're telling me that like you can't they can't use banks they can't use the banking network that a social system because the code is broken right the the government procedures are broken and so no one can trust that and so now it the it's the culture around argentina has devolved into just people being able to trust a smaller and smaller sphere of people around them and i think perhaps why this lends the argentine people so well into into crypto is because crypto you're not supposed to trust anyone like you don't have to trust anyone and when the volatility of like a of a nation becomes so high with uh volatile uh the volatile volatility of money the value of money is volatile but also the volatility of imports and exports uh and just the the the production and industry everything is volatile individuals learn how to weather that volatility in their own particular way and so maybe that's why like argentina is such an individual's individualist culture is because the collective has broken down and kind of turned into like more or less every person from for themselves um but that has really primed argentina argentine culture to take advantage of crypto which crypto really enshrines the sovereignty of the individual and the empowerment of the individual and so when uh and so like when you're telling me like in uh in order to buy an apartment you need to show up with a backpack full of cash well like there's nothing better as a replacement than that than a private keys right because you can you can bring private keys in your brain uh and so like all of a sudden that trust is uh now a new system a new social system and the argentine people are in need of it the most uh and so when you say that um you think that there is like a bounce coming for argentina like argentina is about to hit off of a floor and we're also seeing the rise of crypto post covid um i'm i'm seeing that those things are directly related like uh arjun argentina is a very the people in argentina can individually be successful but they're just looking for systems to allow that individual success to lend itself into collective success how do you feel about this interpretation no it's it's it's spot-on like it's it's to me it's a very surprising fact that the you know the argentina that i recently discovered when i went back because i left the country seven years ago uh i i you know um i tried to do things in argentina that really showed me you know how broken the country was i started a political party there that we had the idea 10 years ago it's a long time ago already but we had the idea of having candidates in congress that would vote every law according to people's uh vote online so we had to figure out how to do online democracy and at the same time to do a political party a long story short you know when i got into politics there it got so nasty so broken so absurd and and like people fighting for nothing that when i left the country i for three years i never came back i was like uh mad or like uh like pissed off you know i had enough of this country already i just want something else uh i went to you know i i got accepted into y combinator in 2015 and started democracy foundation i figured you know let's think it's probably easier to fix the world than to fix argentina and you know fast forward to today uh turns out that in the last decade you know the emergence of bitcoin the merchants of ethereum uh you know surprisingly and not so surprisingly like it's like a black swan event that kind of makes sense when you look back uh argentina is an incredible fertile ground for this this kind of technology and for many years this was a theory uh for me but now recently it's like it's actually happening uh now we probably there's no not a single politician right now in congress or you know in is understands what's going on with crypto uh but the people their families uh the community the entrepreneurs the developers the users it's growing dramatically and i compare it you know i lived in the u.s for five years i lived in it's gonna be three years now i'm i've been in spain uh you know don't get me wrong america has given me some of the most extraordinary opportunities uh in my career uh in spain you know it's a very comfortable life in europe it's a very secure place very stable uh argentina is wild as [ __ ] uh it has always been like that with like what's gonna happen now we we all joke about it also we have the one thing that i think has made us very special also in this whole context is our sense of humor we have a a very strong powerful crazy a little bit insane sense of humor that kind of helps us go through through our day and and with crypto you know i remember i i've been involved with the tech scene in buenos aires for many young since i was 15 years old probably for for more than 20 years and i remember in the dot-com years you know we had a lot of investment going on a lot of companies being created some of these companies were acquired by american companies and some successful acquisitions but none of these companies had customers they all had inflated valuations crazy valuations until the bubble bursted and then everything you know watered down and none of these companies had any real customers today in 2022 uh i walk through the streets of buenos aires i see the advertisements of many crypto companies started in argentina some you know some of the international ones are also there uh uh i visited some of these companies and met their entrepreneurs and they showed me their numbers and they have they are selling credit cards that do cashback with crypto uh they are like doubling in sales every three weeks uh they are yeah the rate of you know the level of customers and adoption is enormous uh everyone is interested and excited about the next thing happening on crypto and it's obviously especially the youth that everyone uses e-commerce today everyone uses you know they do their groceries and they do everything it's all done online now especially after the after coving this became much more commonplace in latin america e-commerce grew significantly everyone uses fintech but the fintech that uses crypto is destroying the market it's beating the competition beating the hell out of the competition some of these new companies that are doing cashback with ether or cashback uh with bitcoin or connecting their their bank accounts to to ethereum or to lightning network like it's really happening and the numbers are huge the real customers real money flowing in like it's it's really happened some of these companies have raised tens of millions of dollars like emerging markets have become a top thing for for the bay area so emerging markets combined with crypto is a an incredible combination and argentina is is living in that regard uh much much to my surprise you know uh i left the country looking for opportunity abroad and now that i've been living abroad for almost a decade i you know the thing that i find most interesting going on out there is certainly my own country uh where this this room is happening um like it's it's it's really impressive what's going on there so that's why i'm i'm like okay there's a silver lining in all of this maybe the country had to go through [ __ ] uh in order to be the most apt country for you know living in terms of crypto adoption uh out there um i i you know i'm very proud to of the community of developers uh and smart contract engineers that emerged out of argentina some of my colleagues and friends were involved in many of the most relevant projects happening in ethereum and to me it's mind-blowing that these projects came out of uh you know guys like me from argentina uh i can mention you open separate decentraland and maker dao you know and the list is really long so i shouldn't keep mentioning names because i can i have to keep going and going but it's a long list uh and it's a it's like this uh generation of engineers and and hackers that is kind of like i think consciously or unconsciously embracing crypto because maybe this can help out our families maybe this can help out our community and the results so far have been very very good um i when you know the project i'm involved with that is the proof of humanity and what we have been doing with ubi uh the stories i i got in the last year uh with since we launched the project are incredible like uh you know a lot of people we have definitely our biggest base of resources in argentina and in latin america uh we have a very large community and you just hear stories of people that for the first time they installed metamask they went through the whole web 3 initiation process and you know i've seen this firsthand i know a lot of people installed metamask and started using ethereum and web3 to get into proof of humanity and start you know it's you know getting some ubi and trading on erc20 for the first time and a lot of these people came from my social circles you know when we were launching the project and i realized that a lot of them were people that do not come from the nerdy techie and geeky scene of buenos aires these were you know family members or friends of my my friends or like people that come from much much more diverse backgrounds but they are into this thing uh to me was like suddenly realizing wow ethereum is like kind of growing into the next phase uh and and strangely enough like uh that that wave of adoption uh from from everyday users is coming from countries like mine polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy

more that it will um kind of the pendulum will swing back into being more of a collectivist society or do you do you kind of think that um the argentines have just mastered being an individual and crypto allows just the the maximum expression of the individual because crypto is a very individual technology um so what happens what happens to the culture of of argentine argentines as crypto becomes more and more adopted what do you think is going to happen argentina has always been very individualistic you know if i had to say you know what kind of country we are uh it's a country of individuals for sure um even though you know in the greater context of latin america uh you know in growing up in latin america you you will see you will find in society a lot of a lot of society may even half of society supporting more collectivist ideologies like the cuban revolution you will find half of the people in argentina probably defending the cuban revolution or defending a chavez in venezuela and the other half completely against it so it's not like a even though we're a country of you know individuals or very good at at the individual level uh ideologically speaking uh as a country that has grown in latin america and in latin america under the shadow of the united states uh i guess some of that reaction against the united states gets channeled through more socialist or or or yeah communist philosophies uh that you will find in the in the intellectuals or in the journalists or in the thinkers of the country so it's not like it's um argentina is not turning into singapore anytime soon it's still a country that you know has has its own struggles and has its own challenges uh but i think crypto has the potential to first and foremost empower a new generation and give that new generation a new way about thinking about reality because usually the youth when you look at the lens of politics the youth has been copted by the youth of other decades now the people who rule the country now were young in the 70s in the 70s the youth was about doing the revolution you know you know making taking the by force the power and installing like the cuban revolution some kind of communist nightmare they lost that battle in the 70s but a lot of these people are ruling the country today like the president and the government they has a very heavy influence on on their youth in the 70s so we'll call them setantistas you know people that and they try to to to tell the youth of today that they should be like the youth of that time and that's so [ __ ] up in many ways uh the youth of today the youth of today is the crypto youth that that's the thing that i find so exciting i when i talk to when we did the vitalik conference in buenos aires and it's a nice story like vitalik arrived on saturday on saturday he met uh president macrid an ex-president of the country you know half of the country probably loves king half of the country probably hates him but he's an ex-president so it was a good way of sending a signal to the country that hey this guy vitalik who might be might as well be the einstein of the 21st century is in our country and that was a very a great thing that he you know we were able to give this signal to the country too so the country learns about ethereum and and so an ethereum can discover how passionate argentina is about this technology uh when vitalik realizes that you know he might be having somewhat of a mick jagger status in argentina he tells me i'd like to do a conference so this is not like an exclusive trip just for me because i'm realizing you know how much people are talking about my visit here so let's do a conference i talked with the government of buenos aires we found a beautiful place for a thousand people uh to make this conference and we make the flyer we announced the conference and in three minutes three minutes the conference sold out completely so uh a thousand people a thousand people two two year you know we announced this on a sunday on tuesday we did the conference the major of the city came he had a private meeting with vitalik this is a guy that maybe could be the next president of the country uh like all of the thousand people that bought their ticket that got their ticket they were there packed room you know everyone wanted to be there people complaining on twitter that they couldn't get tickets and vitaly gave one of you know his fantastic keynotes we did an interview on stage to him uh he's such an easy person to interview because you ask him one thing and he will always give you at least three paragraphs uh describing uh his line of thought uh and the people there this thousand these 1 000 you know young people that came to to to see him live uh they were all you know probably between 15 17 18 to 28 29 like very very young and they were fascinated by what's going on like i i i i remember going outside to to say hi to some friends and suddenly i find myself giving a soup conference inside the conference like a crowd builds around me unless we start people start asking me questions and and everyone was so thankful was so happy was so uh in this belief that vitalik came to argentina uh they couldn't believe it like uh he he was you know people were so appreciative of that when we went to the slum we went to a school that was actually founded by pope francis and in this school some students came and again he's 16 17 years old and one student came with questions written uh handwritten in a paper and the questions were about vitalik's career he asked him well when when did you started how did you started writing for bitcoin magazine and this guy that grew up in islam that grew up you know in a disenfranchised section of the city uh you know with with definitely with much less possibilities than you know 90 of the people living in buenos aires he knew everything about vitalik uh he knew you know he was into ethereum he was already uh learning to mine cryptocurrency and and that to me speaks so greatly about the inclusive capacities of crypto and the youth is like gets it like this they you know uh i i feel this this fractal sensation in my own you know whenever i go to that con or whenever i go to uh a neath event i i know i'm being respected for being the old guy around i'm 38. uh it's it's the 20 year olds are explaining me roll ups or are explaining me you know whatever is the next thing you know it's always the youth that teach you about what's up and coming with technology and the it's so important to pay attention to to the youth in argentina thankfully i think that the the cryptovirus is a very very strong right now and a lot of these kids will grow up they will start up things they will create stuff uh that will surprise us and so i think that this legitimate youth and not the youth from the 70s is what needs to happen for for for the country to to change w will that lead to a you know a more individualistic society or a more market-loving free-market-loving society maybe it's a bit of an antidote to a lot of the socialist limits that you will also find in argentina but which is also a consequence of the the rampant inequality the inequalities in your face there if you walk in one of silence you will find an entire family you know going through the dustbin or through the trash and it's such a sad image and you it's an image that is everywhere so i guess you know it's not that we're left-wing or right-wing we're a bit of dreaming of an utopia or some kind of powerful idea that can really change things for us and my sensation is that you we will if that idea exists somewhere it's definitely in the in the realm of information technology and digital stuff like it's not in the realm of legacy ideological you know economic schools but really you know the hackers that is the cypherpunk manifesto is the declaration of independence of cyberspace that's the literature it's the sovereign individual it's the infinite machine it's uh that's the literature that that i i think is really bringing new ideas and it's an information technology uh it's in with beats uh that the only thing that i've seen throughout my entire life that has really impacted people's lives for the better um and i think that the youth gets this uh and and this is uh i have no choice but but to be an optimist also as an entrepreneur you have to be an optimist but uh but what i've seen in buenos aires recently caught me by surprise in a in a significant way and it made me feel very proud it was the proudest moment of my career to have you know my hero vitalik buttering our hero vitalik butler visiting my country for the first time and for him to realize that my country loves him and for my country to realize that you know this is for real and it's so powerful that the entire political spectrum has to meet with him it's like i have never felt any pr i don't know if i will ever be able to surpass an experience like that but it speaks uh greatly about what's going on there and the potential it has to to change things i think perhaps one of the the best reasons to be happy about that is that because um vitalik is um very morally grounded um he's very he's a he's a realist um but he's also an uh an optimist at the same time and he definitely sees the potential of technology for good um but he will he'll never go out and like say something ridiculous or crazy just to like drum up a crowd he's always very pragmatic and and effective and the fact that like so much of argentina is seeing vitalik vitalik's pragmatism and then falling in line behind that rather than some sort of populist leader that's drumming up a crowd or you know some sort of like you know trumpian figure who knows how to like you know play the media vitals the opposite of that and people are falling behind him as well that gets me really really optimistic because we need that in today's world there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to like you know drum up society to get them to to do the things that you want and vitalik's not doing that at all and people still like resonate with his message and and you know fall in line behind his leadership that's why he's like a monk you know yeah right in argentina i caught the attention that he always went everywhere with wearing sandals and socks yeah and he went to meet the president like that he want to be the minister of economy it's a and it's like that's the most cypherpunk thing i can think of like you know it's he's not not not a he's so grounded he's so you know if manny shows the real face of you who you are the real face of vitalik is amazing because he had all kinds of offers in argentina you can imagine that when people found out he was there i got invitations for him to go on a private jet to the patagonia or to go to punta el este in a helicopter to meet you know this powerful guy or to go you know he got all kinds of fancy invitations and he got you know the opportunity to visit that slum and to meet you know how the the working class in argentina really lives and he chose to go to islam he chose to go to the school there to talk to the people there uh the people were you know obviously fascinated by this this guy that looks completely different than anyone else in argentina like vitalik as a russian he he obviously caught some people's attention uh and but you know you saw just little kids approaching him and asking where did you come from and what do you do and him very politely in spanish actually we were all surprised that he actually speaks very good spanish uh explaining you know who he was and what he does asking questions about how people live there how families live there uh thinking about uh you know learning uh about these social uh challenges uh are the social dramas that people are facing and he wanted to see that he didn't want none of the fancy programs i mean i remember every day i sent vitalik a couple of options you have this this and what do you want to do and he he chose where where he heart uh it really is and i think he he actually said something uh in with in the first meeting we had with with president macri when he he said that one of the problems with technology is that it's probably easier to generate innovation uh in the in the information spectrum than in the physical world uh because it's easier to iterate and change things with digital bits and information than to iterate and change things in the physical world so a lot of investment and a lot of innovation is software only and it's software to make better software and he said that you know this leads to a situation where you create a society where you have these incredible billionaires uh creating a lot of wealth but at the same time you have a lot of junkies you know homeless people who are you know doing her shooting her in the streets and you know the wealth side is completely blinded by what's happening on this on this social side where a lot of people are getting left behind and living you know through a tragedy in in in the very same city where this happens and here you use san francisco as an example i lived in san francisco and you know i saw that you know you walk through the tenderloin you will see it and it's it's for him he said you know it's very important to support projects that are being built on ethereum that make sure that they impact in reality that have an impact in the real world and not just you know i guess that's why he he's kind of been talking more about that you know let's d5 is fun this defy is great but there's let's try to think about you know the social ethereum how a theme can help society at large um and i guess that's why he got interested into proof of humanity and ubi and and i think that this is a a very positive aspect of his leadership that he cares and he's paying attention to stuff like this to this social aspect it's it's a wonderful thing uh it's very uncommon uh you know he's the most the strangest billionaire i have ever met for sure with so i want to go into that a little bit more of all of the startups that you've talked about in argentina the crypto startups that you are saying have completely beat out all the fintech startups that haven't been using crypto what are the use cases that are really the most successful in argentina is it is it payments or like what are the what are the successful crypto startups in argentina what are the utility and uses that people really really need so the fintech sector in general has been pushing a strategy of bank inclusion through generating a lot of debit cards and credit cards and digital bands have become a phenomenon of the last couple of years among these digital banks there's one of these banks uh i will not say you know i can say the name it's called lemon which really have a huge impression uh the guys of lemon are they are doing a you know a fintech company that works as an exchange uh but you they are issuing credit cards uh where you will get cash back with crypto you will you you will get your cashback benefits with ether or with btc or you know with any erc20 token that's out there that's actually supported a lot of tokens um and because of this they are beating the entire competition the whole sector is growing fintech is definitely growing significantly and there's a couple of unicorn companies already playing in the in the industry there but the consumer you know the people that wonder their credit card to buy their groceries to you know make their things uh online to do e-commerce the the killer product are those that actually are you know crypto crypto native companies uh that have this this this this might be a small feature but if you're gonna accumulate a little bit of crypto every day that's a much more decidable than accumulating a little bit of argentine pesos every day it's a huge difference so it's it's uh the startups that enable savings that really uh get adopted quickly in argentina yeah they enable savings and because of that they open the gates for people to start experimenting with d5 products uh with nfts uh with you know dallas have been growing a lot you know there's a lot of interesting communities like i i you know i've seen the growth in the definitely the the demand for developers the the demand for people that know solidity like companies like open separating decentraland uh cleros uh you know have have created a school of training developers so now we have a lot of people learning how to build smart contracts how to build uh you know into these networks uh and obviously these people uh are you know also users and and ultimately i would say that you know this these new fintech credit card companies that give cash back with you know in crypto they're uh they're they're you know destroying the competition i'm you know i've seen some numbers and the numbers are wild very impressive and it's barely getting started like this this is just the beginning so the landscaping a few years from now uh might be very different but today buenos aires does feel a little bit like a cypher pancutopia a high inflation terrible government but the youth clandestinely you know using crypto for absolutely everything like another small story of vitalik's visit like there was one morning that vitalik went to a coffee shop at 9 30 a.m and the coffee shop opened at 10 a.m uh so italic was like okay it's close let's find a different place and from the inside the owner comes out running and says vitalik vitaly don't leave please i will open the shop for you come stay and and vitalik mentioned me that he was even able to pay with ether for his coffee and his croissant or whatever he had and uh it's it's like those things are showing me that well you know this is the the owner of a bar a random bar in the neighborhood of palermo he had suddenly you know got starstruck when he saw vitalik open the shop for him he you know he was already able to receive ether for for the coffee uh it's not like it's a strange thing a lot of shops are accepting a teether or you know some kind of stable coin a lot of shops you know you know asking the question can i pay with crypto it's not no longer like uh oh here comes the nerd asking about crypto no it used to be like that you know when i did it seven eight years ago i remember okay can i pay you with some bitcoin you know i remember doing that in some places and teaching people but now it's like yeah yeah sure pay you know pay with ether or with bitcoin or whatever and the that thing becoming commonplace is is a very very positive thing how has ethereum's fees impacted how argentines have used ethereum because if italic is paying for coffee using the l1 blockchain i don't know how i don't know how he sent ether to this coffee shop owner but uh do you do you know if it was on the l1 or if it was on an l2 and overall how has argent argentina navigated ethereum fees i didn't ask him that but fees are a problem of course a lot of people actually i hate to say this but a lot of people are using some of the like bsc binance smart chain or like some of the uh more centralized uh evms out there pretty much evf when we talked to when we talked to vitalik uh when we recorded with him he said that the majority of crypto use is just using binance.com or binance the exchange not even finance smart chain just like transferring to each other using binance yeah that's that's a lot of people are you know there's still a lot of education that needs to happen for people to be able to to really hold their keys uh finance has a strong presence in the country you you will see billboards and advertisement of finance all over buenos aires um and yeah it's it's you know i the i i think we'll probably see more adoption of road laps you know i'm pretty sure about that uh but some of the on some of the side chains but definitely some of the other blockchains like bsc and stuff like that uh helps people to deal with fees like a a ten dollar fee in argentina is a lot of money like in consideration a country where the minimum wage is 400 dollars or something like that so ten dollars i mean ten dollars used to be like the standard fee for something ether just six months ago probably now it's even a little bit worse uh so uh people are relying on alternative chains but this makes people you know it's it makes people resilient and knowledgeable and you know easily capable of you know bridging among many chains and you know it's the users are learning the ropes uh they are learning the ropes of how to manage you know uh a world with you know multiple chains or you know a world with roll-ups which i'm sure is gonna be the end game situation we will we will find in a couple of years from now what about private key management are people trying to learn how to manage their own private keys are they just sticking with custodial solutions i think many are probably using still custodial solutions or you know trading with inside the exchanges like you mentioned um but that there comes the responsibility of us the the developers or the the most knowledgeable voices in the community to you know not your keys not your crypto uh and to keep done insisting through social media through different channels i i do a podcast in spanish uh that surprisingly it's now a top five podcast in spotify and in this for spanish-speaking audiences uh so it's interesting to see that there's a growing audience of listeners that want to learn about crypto spanish and through media like that i think we can we have to the responsibility to help people really learn how to use this technology properly uh but you know i'm confident you know the the people that people get it and will learn and i will adopt best practices for sure so you've uh brought up um proof of humanity and ubi uh a few times so i want to go into that but also you at the very beginning of this conversation you talked about how one of the big um problems that argentina faced was that the government just kept on electing to print money and just hand money out as a solution without really considering the long-term consequences of these choices so how do you square those two things you've seen a government print money and have that not work but you're also interested in universal basic income via proof of humanity how do you square those two things and can you also just explain for the listeners what proof of humanity is yeah it's a that's a great question um so proof of humanity is a decentralized identity uh service built on ethereum built on the layer one uh where you have to generate a proof of yourself it's a small video you are not required to use your real name or legal name nothing like that um and once you submit the proof you need to get a vouch from someone that has already been proven uh and you have to put a deposit that you will get back if no one challenges your proof if your proof looks similar to someone else or you have already done a proof before or you look like a deep fake you might get challenged and that challenge goes to an arbitration system that is a cleros that will try to find a judor randomly and that will decide ultimately whether or not the the profile is a duplicate or is a a deepfake or a robot or something like that and kledos allows for multiple appealing rounds so it works works very well proof of humanity is really thinking about identity in a post facebook world you know facebook has centralized identity uh in a dramatic way leading to surveillance capitalism to manipulation to polarization of society the advertising business model combined with centralization has led to you know modern democracy looking really really weird um whereas uh so thinking about identities is very important that edward snowden said the one vulnerability being exploited across all systems is identity you know identity is the matter of all battles so understanding how we can formalize human identity uh ideally in the most privacy preserving way but also in a way where you have absolute certainty that there are no duplicates in the registry and there's nothing an entity a clandestinely managing multiple identities like uh having that kind of permissionless ability to audit the registry is extremely important in order to keep the registry decentralized and proof of humanity achieves this through a combination of game theory and leveraging systems like cleros and we launched this in march 2021 so the project is not not even a one year old but in this process we have almost 15 000 identities or humans registered in proof of humanity and once you become registered you start accruing ubi tokens so this is a standard erc20 token uh that you start getting you know it gets streamed into your wallet so you will start getting fractions of uei every second or every block at the rate of one ubi per hour so obviously the issuance of uvi is you know very aggressive it's 720 ubis per month per human right now the token is trading around 15 cents which is roughly around 150 dollars worth of ubi per month um you know price goes up goes down it's a free market so he has supply and demand uh the supply side of the equation obviously is tied to every new human that emerges in proof of humanity the challenge the challenging side is the demand side right how how we get the whales or people accumulating in this token we don't you know monetary policy you know monetary schools of thought indicate that the more you print you know what we talk at the beginning of our interview uh that will lead to inflation and losing value of the currency and you know i'm not foreign to that idea at all and i think that the the interesting thing of what we can build with with ueis this is a token that simply has one rule every human will accumulate this token at the rate of one uvi per hour that's it that's the rule now as engineers now we must work with this constraint like we must figure out how with this constraint we can make sure that the value being received by the people in proof of humanity is is the highest it can possibly be and and in that regard there are a wide range of ideas out there that have been implemented that were really surprising in this first year i remember on a twitter thread someone said why don't you do an endowment model like ivy league universities in the us harvard has an investment fund with 500 million dollars they invest that money you know technology companies bonds stock whatever and they generate the 10 yield every year and it's that 10 that funds the university the extra 50 million dollars you know that are you know sustained the university the endowment is kept being invested in good assets and goods good stuff um if i wanted to do that in the traditional world i probably should be born in a place where i can go to harvard and get a lot of connections and you know have the right people and talk to the radio become very powerful and maybe i can pull something that up in traditional finance on d5 i can just you know talk to my friend emiliano in italy who contributes to wire and figure out hey can we do a vault where we use deposit ether and we generate some yield by lending that ether to the market and we use the yield to burn uvi and that's from from a twitter thread to completion it took three months uh and we launched these balls where you know people who are you know holding if they can deposit the if the into the vault or some people are holding stable coins take a deposit stable comes into the vault this will get landed through the wire and protocol will generate some yield some profits out of the lending process and we use half of the yield to buy and burn ubi tokens and that's just what was one of the first applications that tries to burn uh uvi at scale um there's there's now a an interesting group of teams different teams trying to do nft games uh where you know when you transact when you trade the nft a percentage of the transaction goes to burn ubi tokens so suddenly thinking about video games that are that have purpose that are not just entertainment and it's a way of like okay if i spend a lot of time playing this video game at least the more i play i am burning helping to burn ubi so the more i play i'm hoping to to everyone that is receiving universal basic income over ethereum and it brings a little bit more purpose or less guilt when you find yourself playing a video game so there are a lot of nft projects that are looking into that direction i'm actually contributing to one of those that i haven't announced yet and it's super exciting like finally figuring out okay maybe if this game works out and if it reached significant scale the whole play to earn movement uh you know when you plug a video game to burning ubi tokens you're plugging purpose to that video game you're applying you know something that has a social impact and benefits people's lives the stories i heard from people receiving uei are amazing i i heard stories from people that were able to when vitalik he he bought almost 2 million ubi tokens and burned them he did this with the shiva inu tokens he received the fact that he coordinated the shiva hino to burn uvi was like a very impressive thing to see happen and when that happened i started receiving stories from people that you know they were able to afford the plane tickets to visit their parents after two years of pandemic or who were able to afford their student debt and you know they got this huge problem out of out of out of the way or they were able to i remember a person who told me that who who thanked me the fact that ubi gets streamed and not given in discrete allocations uh because her partner was addicted to gambling so the fact that we didn't give all of the money at once but just tiny bits of the money in real time was a feature that like she liked uh you know how how the protocol works so i heard a lot of stories like this who who are people and there's a power user of ubia who lives in lavana cuba and he has himself and his entire family are on proof of humanity and he's making probably 150 200 worth of ubi per month in a country where the minimum wage or the maximum which actually is 20 dollars a month so this guy is making you know he's he's putting food on the table for his family uh and you know we have a lot of users in cuba and venezuela it's the beauty of of decentralization and not working with you know the traditional banking system and you know these are all small stories like minimal stories that are emerging out of the community uh but i think that you know the more we can coordinate with other protocols you know we have been talking with the optimism team optimism is using uh one one percent of its fees uh to support public goods on ethereum and they committed a million dollars into that the the optimism community use quadratic voting to choose what public public goods they will support proof of humanity ended up being there so we receive uh funds from from optimism that can help burn ubi tokens so it's a i think that the effort is not dependent on on us the proof of humanity community alone but the more we can plug uh the ubi burner smart contract into other protocols other games other d5 solutions a small contribution to burning ubi or to simply buying ubi doesn't need to be burned always but a small contribution to that impacts all of the people registered in proof of humanity uh so yeah of course the supply side is is clearly you know uh gives us a challenge but i think that as a community we can build uh techno you know solutions that can help burn and reduce supply at scale and when that happens you know you you you will immediately notice how it's impacting people's lives i saw that the day after vitalik burnt my inbox exploded in people with thank you notes and saying how fantastic this was and that they will keep on holding on they will keep on you know building so it's a it's a obviously you know it's an experimental thing everything is a prototype even ethereum is a prototype we're all learning here but with uei and proof of humanity it's been almost one year uh almost 50 million dollars worth of ubi transactions happen in this year of course maybe a lot of people were trading and speculating uh you know it's a free market uh but uh with 15 000 people registered on proof of humanity it's probably one of the largest if not the largest universal basic income experiment happening right now and to me that's mind-blowing that ethereum can achieve this uh because when we talk about you know ethereum the social ethereum social ethereum is not gonna be like social media which you know twitter and facebook gave everyone a voice and we know we all know what social media did to the world and it's probably you know more uh on the side of fantastic things than on the side of bad things like social media has been incredible in the last decade but when you think about the social blockchain it's not media it's not media social blockchain is people's money people's pockets it's people's ability to buy bread to put buy food to to you pay their expenses so when social ethereum emerges and matures uh you know it can really address very big questions or very big challenges that the world is facing one of these big challenges is poverty a lot of people live under the poverty line the vast majority of the planet uh in argentina i grew up facing this reality every day where half of the people you see in the city are suffering they're living under very bad conditions and if there's a technology that can help address that and put some money to people uh so they make we make sure that everyone you know is able to meet uh their needs then you know it's a very powerful thing it's not just wow how much wealth this thing can create you know if you become wealthy alone it's not really wealth like wealth is really one you know you are able to impact the community you are able to impact society at large and with the with ethereum i think we can do that and like to miss a scary thought but in the next couple of decades you know end poverty with crypto that that should be a fantastic goal that the student could could address uh and that speaks of what the social capacities of the network can unleash another incredible thing is that it's a level playing field technology someone in cuba will get the same amount of ubi than someone in connecticut or in london or in beijing like everyone gets the you know it's it helps to level up the playing field it's a borderless it's global uh you know that we're not asking for uh identity information related to the passport or to your government we don't give a [ __ ] about that it's humanity first and uh and i think there's a an enormous community around the globe that is willing to support the experiments with ubi if we need to wait for the government to do this stuff it's going to take a long time the great thing about crypto is that we don't need to wait for anyone and and i think that's uh that's a very promising thing like uh if ethereum and cryptos and technology can help change the world like that then it's not just a technology you know you know a deep bubble it's it's something way more profound probably even revolutionary i want to ask um what about crypto makes you optimistic but i think you just answered it do you what else about crypto makes you optimistic you know there's a a physicist called david deutsch who i love he's a great thinker from oxford he's the father of quantum computing he was i think one of the original authors of the original paper that described the quantum computer and his request of the recent years is um he's trying to change the language of physics he says like you know every single equation in physics is the dynamical particles particles moving around either into the future into the past and this is just a very reductionist model of describing the universe and he has this theory of uh his calls he calls his constructor constructor information theory uh where he says that information theory has always been uh you know shielded from physics like whatever happens inside computers it happens inside computers and the physical world is entirely a different thing and the world of physics is is completely blind to to the world of information theory so he david deutsch he comes with this theory called constructor information theory where he he says that we have to change every equation we have to start thinking about the world on whether things are possible or impossible and use you know this analogy to describe the universe under more information theoretic concepts rather than dynamical equations that have led to this gridlock of quantum physics and general relativity not understanding each other and this philosophy of you know thinking about things are possible or impossible uh an outcome of that that david deutsch i heard him once mentioned in a lecture he says well anything that it's not explicitly prohibited by the laws of nature is possible it's not a matter of if it can be done or not but a matter of how we will get there but eventually it's something that it's possible and he argues that uh optimism is like the gravitational pull of this idea like if something is not explicitly forbidden by nature then there is a way uh and history shows that we have always found a way we humans you know with industrial age or enlightenment or in the electricity or information we keep finding a way to get there maybe this century will find a way to get to mars maybe we'll you know but we keep finding a way uh so the the you know optimism might be much more ingrained into nature than we can think of uh and i think that the if there's uh something that that really has impacted my life and gave me an overdose of optimism was meeting the ethereum community globally i remember very well when i went to my first devcon in prague uh you know i was still a bit shy of getting into ethereum coming from bitcoin many years of bitcoin you know maximalism i know the feeling i've been there uh but when i discovered a community that it was so pluralistic so diverse so open-minded experimenting and trying out innovations and [ __ ] we're not gonna just change money we're gonna change identity we're gonna change voting we're gonna change human coordination we're gonna change every single institution thinkable with this technology uh that's a like an oasis of optimism all over the place uh layer zero layer zero is the the you know the secret ingredient and whenever i lose some of my optimism because i'm human and you know we have our days uh i try to find when when the next ethereum conference is happening where in the world i make sure i hang out you know a couple of days with my friends there and realize you know holy [ __ ] where yeah this is still happening the dream is you know alive and kicking and the best part is that it's you know it's still the very very early days i'm pretty sure about that so uh you know you have to keep on building and it's it's very hard not to be optimistic when you're surrounded by by so many bright minds generous people and with great leaders like vitalik himself he's probably the ultimate example of of what leadership means uh in the 21st century and and you know we are just lucky he's alive he's here and he's hanging out with us helping helping us dream about the future well santi everything you just said i absolutely resonate with because it was the just the infectious positivity of eth denver that pulled me into ethereum in the first place uh so i definitely resonate with that and also my pinned tweet on my twitter account is it says uh optimus shall inherit the earth um and so i think i think we're definitely aligned there santi thank you for coming on layer 0 and telling us your thoughts and your story david a pleasure talking to you as always and yeah hopefully i'll see you in some youth conference anywhere in the world soon certainly uh santi if people want to follow you on twitter and also learn about proof of humanity where should they go i'm santi city on twitter telegram whatever everywhere and the proof of humanity are proof of humanity on
