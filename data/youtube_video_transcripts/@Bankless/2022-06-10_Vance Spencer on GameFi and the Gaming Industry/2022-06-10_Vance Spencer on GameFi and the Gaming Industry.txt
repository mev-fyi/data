the games industry is largely broken over the past 20 years the opportunities for game developers right now are sell your title to a major studio and some really kind of shitty earn out deal or try to chase down this monetization opportunity of ads which is increasingly deteriorating and so all roads for these developers kind of lead to crypto where people are excited there's lots of funding there's global distribution of wallets tokens is a new design space for growth you know dows that own the assets and the community which can take part in the upside of the game i feel like it's kind of like the bell curve meme where like people in the middle of the bell curve say like the games are too complicated you can never build them they'll never be valuable but on both sides of the bell curve you know the really smart guy and the really dumb guy are kind of like you know games on crypto is just like fun and i think that's going to be the base case for where we're going is like it's not going to be play to earn it's gonna be play ander and even if you're able to increase the economics of an industry that's you know hundreds of billions you know 20 30 40 that's just like such a fundamentally constructive thing that you're going to see a lot of activity as a result and so
