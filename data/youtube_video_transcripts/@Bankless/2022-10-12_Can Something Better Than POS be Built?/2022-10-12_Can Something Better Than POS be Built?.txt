one of the reasons I started working on Cosmos was I really wanted to work on proof of stake and I thought the classes team was the most like farthest Along on proof of stake actually as of last month or two weeks ago over 50 of market cap is running on proof of stake but now what's like the next thing I think there's like things we can do even better than proof of stake I I really believe there's like a world where we can build like a web of trust based consensus protocol that will actually be even more decentralized than proof of stake I just want to keep tearing down centralized or even high levels of communication required systems and build more organic mesh systems
