[Music] all right thankless nation it is the first week of march this is friday morning i hope you're enjoying this special edition of the rollups first edition of march with your friday morning copy david what are we doing today we're rolling it up we're rolling up the first week of march as we all know the cryptocurrency industry moves so incredibly fast and so we try and distill a full week of crypto news into one single episode it's an ambitious endeavor we try and condense as much information and as short a time as possible sometimes we go a little bit long but we're gonna try and condense things a little bit better this week so ryan shall we get into it we should david but but first before we get into it we should mention that consensus tickets are on sale so this is a virtual conference you can attend i'll be there david is speaking there ray dalio is speaking there so he's in good company the thing i wanted to mention is that you can get 20 off when you use the bagless code they've got an early bird special so if you're planning to attend a crypto conference this year this should be the one you attend everyone goes uh fantastic event and get 20 off with the code bankless we'll include a note in the show notes david you ready let's start with markets my friend you ready to start with markets let's do it what are the markets saying well tell us uh bitcoin what is the price of bitcoin right now where have we been and where are we going yeah at the time of recording bitcoin is at forty seven thousand five hundred dollars uh ryan's got missouri on uh up it's got forty eight thousand dollars you know different depending on where you look but we touched over got back over 50 000 this week uh but maintaining strength i think has been a little bit of a struggle for the uh the main monies the bitcoin and ether um we are we're falling down a little bit today but you know on on the ether price action we both touched sixteen hundred dollars and the fourteen fourteen hundred dollars in the same day so things are volatile we're definitely planting a floor i would say but we are struggling to get much higher than that still feels like we're in a bit of a dip but maybe as some have said a dip for ants this is not a substantial dip uh not sure when it will end but it definitely still feels very much like we are in a secular bull run let's talk about the price of ether what's going on here yeah from the low low price that ether hit of fourteen hundred dollars earlier this week uh earlier this week and last week uh it got all the way back up to sixteen hundred and fifty dollars and now ether is back down to the price of fifteen hundred and thirty seven dollars kind of all over the place again having that strength off the floor off the bottom of the dip that we saw but also uh not really able to continue its strength really so it's still kind of stuck in this range we will see what happens and it has dipped harder than bitcoin but you've officially called the bottom floor of ether for now at 1300 and that's holding up fairly well so far so cross your fingers for david guys he's he's making calls here well yeah no right or not i do believe that you cannot go below 1300 let's see about that that's a dangerous call but okay uh d5 leaderboard let's talk about total value locked in d5 that has dipped a little bit it was kind of plateaued at this 40 billion mark which oh my god 40 billion still incredibly high versus a year ago uh but you know the parabola has flattened a little bit lately what's going on here yeah so again both uh there's there's three things going on here there are continuing deposits of assets into d5 protocols those assets are increasing increasingly increasing in price except for the last week and also defy pulse is adding new applications into their metrics right so i think today they out just added tornado cash so tornado cash is the new uh metric i think there's 300 million dollars that tornado cash is uh congrats to tornado cash for getting on the board well deserved i expect a number to only go up with tornado cash and so um uh and that's true there's 300 million locked in tornado cash right and so that the what's going on is there's a little liquidity mining mechanism where if you put your ether into tornado cash and leave it in there which is good for privacy because there's a bigger crowd that people can hide amongst in the in with tornado caches mixing services so they reward you with the torn token for how long you leave your ether in there which is pretty cool super cool all right what's going on with uh d5 pulse index the dpi which is the top 10 d5 token projects um price of that is 4 13 at the time i'm looking at it what has it's a little bit up on the week it looks like unlike unlike ether price what's going on yeah and i'm gonna start saying some trader words but don't ascribe me to being any sort of trader professional but it looks like dpi has done a triple bottom it's touched the 400 range the low 400 range three times in march already and you know march is only like five days long now uh and so again planting a floor at 400 not really able to extend above that floor but definitely not going below it either so there's both like the mixed signals in the markets right now signs of strength but not able to continue that strength and dpi is showing that as well now we started looking at this metric into the the new year the dpi to eth ratio and this basically tracks uh dpi strength relative to east so it tells us whether we're in defy season or not as we've called it in from cyclical perspective so david are we in d5 season what's happening here yeah ryan if you uh zoom out for that three month or six month uh time frame uh the dpi versus trend is extremely strong uh wow yeah look at that straight line up and to the right there's a lot of volatility in intraday or intra week movements but ever since 2021 dpi has been an up and to the right trend versus eth the trend is your friend uh this hasn't this been has been a really sustainable growth which is the thing which is the cool thing this isn't a blow off top uh things are just modestly marching up and to the right uh when in terms of d5 versus eth which i think is a metric that offers much more signal than uh dpi or defy tokens versus the dollar people dpi is an indication of people's ability to be risk on and it's in dpi versus eth is people's interest in being risk on versus ether right which is already kind of a risk on asset anyway so it's really a taste of how risky people are interested in being because d5 tokens are more speculative than ether uh and mark this just marching up and to the right david do you want to talk about the neuple or should i talk about the new poll i think you're going to have to talk about the newborn okay this is uh this is a metric we'll get back to defy uh revenue in a second but this is a metric i like so many of you have probably seen the the wall street cheat sheet that looks something like this where you go through this parabolic cycle of first there's hope in the market uh then there's optimism belief euphoria and then it drops down to complacency anxiety denial panic uh and anger eventually it levels off in in depression when the bull market comes to an end you're in the the bear market everyone thinks it's dead never coming back you get back to disbelief and then you repeat the cycle uh all over again well the nupl is an interesting metric from glass node studio so this is net unrealized profit and loss so won't get into all of the mechanics of this metric it uses something called uses something called realized gains which but it's basically kind of tracking the um the cost basis of all ether holders and using sort of a metric to measure whether they're up or whether they're down this is based on when the ether has last moved inside of their their ether account so think of it's kind of as the cost basis of all ether holders what i find interesting here david is is they use that that wall street psychology um kind of frame of reference where they've got like in the red in the in the the bear market that you're seeing they've got capitulation in the orange you see hope uh and in yellow optimism and then green is belief and then and then blue is euphoria and they sort of chart this over time which is super interesting and right now according to this metric we are in a stage right before euphoria which is the the belief stage uh so we're in that green zone territory uh above uh like a bit above this metric number we get into euphoria we've seen that according to this metric uh three or four times back in in 2017. so we're going to monitor this from from time to time and kind of update you on this but when we start to get into sustained blue level territory that might be an indicator that the market has topped that we're inside the euphoria phase and things are getting a little bit nutty we are the stage right below euphoria according to this metric i think it's it's something to track something that's quite interesting because it was fairly predictive in the 2017 bull run that makes a ton of sense and i think my only comment here is that when if and when we go from green to blue and go into that euphoric uh mode that actually is not an indication to sell at least in right that one present moment because it's about sustained time in that euphoric moment if you go back to 2017 we first get into the blue the euphoric moment with a 100 eath price right and so maybe a little bit north of that but then and then we got and then we fell back down into the green but then got back into the blue at 300 eath price and then for the third time we got into blue at the max the absolute peak at uh 20 or at 1400 so in 2017 there was according to this this metric we were in the euphoric mode for three times before it was the actual top so if people are looking at the green that we are currently in and like oh man there's only there's only one more stage left it's about uh time in that stage as well yeah well said good good for good for pointing good that you pointed that out i think that's definitely important to realize um all this metric is saying probably the bottom line is we have not yet hit the euphoria stage so we are still relatively early in the bull run we're certainly not in the earliest phase but we're definitely not in the later half is what this metric is telling us um david let's talk about the defy index fund that bit wise uh release we we had at uh we had matt hogan on the podcast for state of the nation which was just like an oh my god it was so good so good such a good state of the nation so listen to that he came on tuesday so you could get on the podcast or on youtube that way but like his message was the financial advisors are coming is his message and there's 40 trillion dollars at least in the u.s locked that the financial advisors manage and he talked a little bit about the defy index that bitwise has released and it turns out this is a headline just from yesterday that this has been their fastest growing crypto index product ever so the financial advisors are coming david and they're coming to d5 and they're and they're investing in defy tokens super bullish i think for this space i think what the interesting thing about this is that financial advisors aren't the fastest to move but they're also not the slowest to move either right they are relatively independent and if one individual financial advisor wants to pull the trigger on something they can do that right and so when i when i see the headline fastest growing week ever my head's at well how many people are on the sidelines kind of waiting for other people to make the move and now that other people are taking the move like i think there's going to be you know quote unquote the floodgates open and you know what matt opened our eyes to i think david on that podcast is that the narrative really makes sense and why does the d5 token narrative make sense is because financial advisors are used to investing in capital assets like stocks assets that have some sort of cash flow related to it this is a graph from the block and we'll include a link in the show notes as well of daily defy revenue so once again this is not like 2017 where the tokens available produced no cash flows they were just like utility tokens futility tokens as we've called them now our tokens are producing real cash flows no wonder financial advisors are starting to take interest what would you say about this uh chart here that i'm showing from the block of daily d5 revenue yeah it's it's so consumable this information is consumable and easy to to to to look at and for a financial advisor i think they should be impressed about how the fact that they don't have to wait for a centralized entity to issue a quarterly report having live data is a huge value proposition that i think regardless of the specific d5 protocol the fact that defy at large is issuing you know real-time reporting should be able to offer financial advisors you know the peace of mind when they make these investments so we are hitting about 25 million in defy revenue per month a total of 210 million these are especially when you consider growth these are not numbers to to sneeze at anymore um david there's one last thing i think we should cover in the market section and that is this tweet from robert lestener i'm going to get you to maybe explain this and the significance of what robert's saying here yeah i actually didn't understand the significance of this before i saw this tweet and i had to go and ask my more educated friends about what this means so here's what i've learned uh robert says uh this is currently the most important market data in cryptocurrency markets it drives the cost of funding across stable coins and assets the profit profitability of many businesses operating in this space defy markets and in some cases spot spot prices what lestener what robert lechner uh founder of compound by the way is what he's talking about is the gbtc and e premiums of grayscale that is a significant source of revenue for many many yield bearing companies right like think of um who's that who's the biggest guy yeah it would be a great one celsius would be another nexo right and so people are like many many businesses have their revenue a significant amount of their revenue from putting bitcoin into grayscale to accessing that premium right so like if the premium the the gbtc to btc premium is 50 somebody would put in one bitcoin in wait six months and get 1.5 bitcoins out like great great business model um but it dried up and now it's even negative and so people literally this revenue stream just got deleted from so many companies that depend on it and so we are going to see a big contraction in uh people a company's ability to um to generate revenue from this from this this path and the fear is that this could actually lead to selling because now they have to sell assets to make ends meet and that's why robert lesnar is drawing attention to this yeah i think it's interesting because people always ask the question of okay blockfi is is delivering like seven eight percent yield annual yield on stable coins how does that work where does the yield come from well one of the places that yield comes from uh is this arbitrage opportunity between the the grayscale premiums right so because there's this massive difference between the spot price of bitcoin and eth and the the the price of grayscale shares um institutions are able to arbitrage that and they deliver that in the form of interest to centralized platforms like like block fight and of course that filters down into the defy ecosystem as well now um i think there's two kind of questions about this first of all it's interesting to understand that but you know the the first is will these premiums be sustained right like low this is the first time they've ever dropped into negative territory in recent memory and is that just a blip or will it hang out in negative territory if it's just a blip it doesn't really matter for kind of the long term if premiums go back up uh it doesn't matter um the the other thing i think to consider is i've my understanding is as well there is a nice arb opportunity when premiums are actually at a on on the negative side so there might be other ways to restore that those high interest rates in in d5 but it is interesting to think about the question of like okay where do these interest rates come from because they are manufactured from some sort of arbitrage opportunity somewhere and the grayscale arbitrage opportunity is one of them it's just how markets become more efficient david that is markets we should take a minute to thank the sponsors that made this roll-up episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of d5 so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited bunny goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today all right david release time let's get to the first google finance has added a crypto tab to their google.com finance sheet where you can see all of the metrics you can see what's going on in the us in asia s p nasdaq russell index dow jones and now crypto just feels like it naturally fits there i think it's kind of cool mainstream adoption yep that and that's the story um crypto is getting in front of people's eyeballs more and more and more prob probably because people demand it so this is the first year i've heard crypto actually mentioned on like npr when they're going through like the you know the roundups it just feels like it fits uh this is something we would have never seen in 2017. david i'm gonna round out a few of these and and throw them at you and then let's uh get some comments so the first is zk sync has announced ecosystem investment round a new investment round so this is a layer 2 based on zk i believe it's zk roll ups not optimistic roll ups this is from matter labs they've got a pretty massive series a investment for the tech that they're building let me get to the next one um uh sushi is going main chain multi-chain rather so and they're taking like this shotgun approach to it which is sort of interesting so sushi of course is sort of a uniswap clone originally but they've developed into a an interesting automated market making defy exchange in their own right and they're just shotgun gunning approach their their deployment to other layer twos and other chains including phantom uh the polygon chain which is formerly matic x die chain binance smart chain moon bean uh moon whatever network which i'm not even that's something on polka dot looks like it's an interesting approach they're like we're gonna we're gonna deploy sushi across all of these we've got alpha hamora who has embraced as it says in the headlines a multi-chain future they're starting with the binance chain so they are deploying alpha hemorrha on the binance chain and then we've got metamask which is a wallet that we all know and love and use they are creating an api so that it can be super easy using metamask to switch different chains you could go from ethereum mainnet to the polygon network to some of these rollup chains like arbitram and optimistic and scale and scale network and xdi and more and then lastly i think but not least we've got xerion which is a d5 portfolio viewer that we know and love we had them on a recent ama they said they were going to do this they are now supporting the the viewing of assets not only on ethereum mainnet but also on uh the layer two polygon network david that was a lot of headlines there right but i think what we're getting to you is a theme here and i'm interested in your your thoughts on this and that theme is this we are moving from uh just ethereum host of all d5 activities to something a little different to re-architecture a bit more of a multi-chain world what's your take on all of these things yeah the poly chain world or the poly chain thesis has always been one that has been interesting to me because there's many different ways to view a poly chain world one of the uh ways to view a poly chain world is through the east max millis lens where you have the ethereum l1 and then you have all of the evm compatible ethereum l2s that's optimistic rollups uh that's zk rollups that's matic and that's a story that we have here we have a story of many different people implementing ethereum's l2s and those are also different chains right and a zk roll up or an optimistic rollups is a blockchain uh and and that is in that with metamask you can now select these different networks that aren't the ethereum l1 as you see fit and then we also have the story of sushi swap basically expanding out like you said shotgun method to every single relevant blockchain that has users right any blockchain that has users that makes it worth their time to make this effort even some that don't do you know if meaning yeah yeah and but then also alpha moving on to binance which definitely definitely has users and so the interesting story is that you know some teams and some companies some some tokens don't have to be ethereum native perpetually right there is value in going and finding different users on different blockchains and all they have to do all sushi has to do is generate revenue on other chains and that's good for sushi importantly sushi the token is issued and relies on ethereum right and so you own sushi the token using the main ethereum chain but there's no reason why these other uh teams can't go and generate revenue for their application for their business by going and generating revenue on binance smartchain or matic or wherever at a high level i think it's important for people to to realize that there are really two separate chains that that we've talked about throughout all of these the first is a side chain and a side chain is is basically something that is not at least from ethereum's perspective sidechain is all relative but from ethereum's perspective anything that is not secured by the ethereum main chain consensus would be considered a side chain so um the binance smart chain would be an example of a side chain x die for example that would be an example of a side chain it has its own validator set a layer two is better defined as something that derives its security from ethereum consensus the value of eth as an asset uh and the ethereum main chain so um you know the the polygon network kind of plays a little bit in in layer two uh it's mostly a side chain but a little bit in layer two but these roll ups that we've been talking about that are coming out like optimistic roll up uh the roll up that that we just mentioned from matter lab zk sync those are all layer two chains that are secured by the ethereum net and the value of eth as an asset so when we talk about a multi-chain world at some level we've always had a multi-chain world right i consider coinbase binance gemini these are all side chains essentially they have their own ledgers these are side chains to ethereum and bitcoin and other crypto networks so we've always had a multi-chain world uh and now we are having like more of a multi-chain world with with some of these d5 protocols expanding to other chains i think the interesting question is are we going to live in a in a world that is more l2 layer layer 2 dominated or are we going to live in a world that is more side chain dominated or is as andreessen horowitz said in their recent press release chris dixon wrote this about their investment in optimism we don't know so we're betting on all of them is basically what they said what's your take my take is that in the short term during the bull market we will live in a many different blockchains many different l1 world with plenty of side chains right binance smart chain it's going to work during the bull market polka dot perhaps there perhaps even polka dot works during the bull market i think and that's because those are just more people than what ethereum capacity can handle and so there's overflow there's spillover this is why ethereum l2s are also going to work there's going to be general spillover then during the the coming bear market if that if that cycle does continue to play out things will contract there will be fewer users and people will contract back to ethereum uh in my opinion as the an economic hub of the internet and then the the that will give the opportunity for ethereum specific l2s to um to benefit because they are closer to ethereum they're closer to the heart they're closer to manhattan so short term all chains will work long term mainly just ethereum l2s maybe or maybe you're a protocol sync maximalist david and that that is a thesis through which we see the world the most credibly neutral base protocols tend to win over time we'll see how that plays out but we'll continue to talk about it david this was a d5 protocol that just was released last week we talked about it on the roll-up um alchemics and you explained it i don't think we need to explain it again you could listen to the previous roll up to here but what i'm amazed at is this new protocol only a week old and it's already got over a hundred million in dye in it this just this space moves so incredibly fast and capital moves so quickly do you have any takes on alchemics uh yeah i gotta take on scoopy triples twitter name best name and twitter by the way it's so fun to say it's goopy triples that's how i say in my head but yeah for those the tldr of alcomix is uh it's uh loans that pay back themselves via interest earned in d5 right so you pay out 100 loan and then the principal or the the interest will just pay off the loan um don't tell stu don't don't tell students about this one is the joke that i have because i'm sure they would like their loans to be paid off as well but that's just not how it works so pretty cool protocol and i think it's going to be a pretty important money lego all right david this is another hot d5 protocol called b protocol i know you talked to them for meet the nation uh earlier this week i'm not sure if that episode's released yet but can you tell us what b protocol is and the headline here is b protocol and compound their integration is live so what's going on with b protocol here yeah b protocol meet the nation coming out sometime next week for those that want to go and dive deeper into b protocol basically b protocol is like your safety net for liquidations for maker dow or compound or in the future ave they're going to integrate with ave and so this is a response to the black thursday events which actually is almost coming up a year on our one year anniversary of black thursday yeah and so for the quick history lesson black thursday ethereum blockchain was extremely congested because ether price went from like 270 dollars down to like 120 in a very short amount of time maker dow vaults uh were needed to get liquidated but ethereum congestion was so high that bids weren't getting in and so somebody was able to liquidate those vaults for zero dollars which was bad because then there's no collateral left over um some some people had their basically their vault just completely drained it wasn't an exploit it wasn't an attack it was just a failure of of liquidations and this is what b protocol is doing it's a guaranteed liquidator and so what you do with with the protocol is instead of going into compound or make or dao you go to b protocol and you deposit your money into compound or maker dow through the b protocol wrapper and what that does is that gives b protocol the rights to liquidate your positions according to the same exact parameters of maker dao or compound or the underlying borrowing and lending protocol but they get priority on uh on liquidations versus the uh liquid the external liquidators right super cool and they actually save a bunch of money by not having to compete with miners on gas fees and so they and that's uh where a little bit of yield comes from and so because uh the liquidators of the b protocol system don't have to compete with other miners in gas auctions that savings actually goes back to the users which is a pretty cool platform super interesting david i'm going to have to watch that full meet of me meet the nation with b protocol because one thing i have questions about is like what are the security implications of wrapping your collateral in a b protocol token i'm sure you cover it there but what a super interesting primitive just in general that like i wouldn't have ever thought would could be devised and just like the creativity of these financial systems uh it's pretty cool man um let's get to nfts every week there's new nft releases this week has been no exception kings of leon are releasing album nfts right now um that's a fairly you know it's a fairly mainstream band right kingsley um i'm a king king's leon fan uh so they're joining the nft fray um you know this is just an example of of another another group from the music scene jumping aboard crypto here absolutely and again the the always the through line is this is a new way for artists to monetize themselves they're not doing this because well maybe they are doing it because of hype but they're doing it because they're going to make some money right and this is going to just be a magnet both for capital and for other artists right so you know if anyone's a king of leon like has a kings of leon connection we would love to bring them on the show so let us know oh yeah let's bring kings of leon on and uh what i love about this david is we're reading about nfts and crypto in rolling stone rollingstone.com no big deal all right david let's wrap up releases with this compound has introduced another chain called gateway or the compound chain as the original white paper described it so what's compound doing here and how does it fit into the conversation of a multi-chain world that we were talking about earlier yeah this one's a little unique this is a a side chain i guess because it has its own consensus mechanism it's not secured by ethereum it's secured by cash validators and cash is the new uh currency token for compound it's a stable coin uh and so this is a application specific blockchain that links into ethereum and other chains that is specifically built for compound very unique pivot i guess from compound that has a lot of uh you know eth maxie's like me was scratching their heads as to why they're doing this maxi i don't really get it i don't really get why we want an application specific blockchain rather than going on to something like optimistic rollups like where everyone else is um but robert leshner and i'm not ready to to bet against him so i'm just going to sit and sit on my hands and wait and see how this thing plays out what's interesting here is they built it on substrate which is a polka dot technology now they didn't choose to connect it to the rest of the polka dot network that would of course um incur fees to reserve a spot on the polka dot network so they haven't done that yet but i find that interesting and it basically allows you to do something that you couldn't just do on native ethereum which is like borrow against uh borrow dots for example a non-ethereum asset using eth as collateral i guess this is what that this is supposed to provide but i'm not sure how security works to be honest if it's not secured by the ethereum net um and if it's not secured by by polka dot either it's just secured by its own set of validators you know backed by this cache token so a bit of a different take here and we'll see how that evolves david let's leave releases and get to the news as always there is a lot of news let's start with this one citigroup has come out with a paper where they actually said bitcoin is at a tipping point and could become this is in quotes the currency of choice for global trade i guess they mean global trade between competing nation states what's what's this report saying yeah this report is massive it's 108 pages and it's very positive about bitcoin it's it's a huge improvement from some of the reports that we saw back in 2017 uh and yeah look bitcoin mentioned over 658 times ethereum mentioned 21 times i believe also very positively it's a it's a report about bitcoin for for people interested in bitcoin but they couldn't help to include some some ethereum talk because of how relevant it is um and so that's pretty cool the fact that big institutions like citibank are talking positively about bitcoin is obviously bullish look at this david i'm doing a quick search for unit swap because i have not rocked this folder swaps in there you just talked about wbtc on ethereum really yeah so the bankers are going deep on this stuff huh is that what we're seeing type in rap type and wrapped wrapped wrapped we got three yeah wrapped bitcoin wow they're doing their homework good job welcome bankers thanks for tuning in to bankless oops all right paypal hide that from your boss yeah not safe for banker work at least all right uh paypal to buy crypto custody firm curve i've not heard of this crypto custody from so it may be a smaller one or it's not not like anchorage which is one that i've heard of or um bitcoin bitco thank you um but they are getting into the crypto asset space they bought this for for 500 million dollars so first of all wow nice premium on crypto based company these days but also this is part of the d5 mullet story that we've been talking about so the d5 mullet is um finance traditional finance fintech in the front and define the back crypto in the back that's what paypal is doing here investing in the new financial infrastructure it's kind of what i see playing here i think that the banks are going to get checkmated by this kind of thing because if d if if fintech is the front end things like paypal for for example or things like venmo or square right and they're using traditional banking infrastructure as the back end if they just do a swap that out for crypto infrastructure where does that leave the banks is always my question but this is super bullish i think for for crypto that fintech is getting involved here and and having a blockchain in the back right ethereum or bitcoin in the back quote-unquote is where they're supposed to be like these things are not supposed to be in the front face of users like we don't want to tinker with ach or fedwire right that's not cool only nerds like us like to tinker with ethereum the blockchain directly if we want to go mainstream with this we need big trusted companies like paypal to do the define the back uh defy mullet right where all all of the ui and ux developers that paypal employs which is a lot of them they're all of a sudden going to make ethereum and bitcoin and all these d5 protocols very easy to use by just obfuscating them and showing them the paypal front end every fintech is going to get their d fight mullet on we're seeing it already uh this is another tweet from mike dudas about paypal and there's a direct quote from the story paypal's crypto unit is experimenting with smart contracts testing ethereum and other blockchains as potential candidates to help the company improve payments and other transactions they're just jumping right down the rabbit hole i think we'll see more of this in the future as well david something that happens i feel like every week we'll put it in that category is microstrategy invests more of their cash into bitcoin they've just done another 15 million dollar investment this week not much more to say there is there no no the week goes by other than the consistency is impressive and it kind of leads me to believe that michael saylor and microstrategy will never actually be done filling their bag and they will permanently be taking their us dollars and buying bitcoin with it like this is what the seventh eighth or ninth purchase of bitcoin by microstrategy at some point this is just them or saving this isn't they know you know what this looks like to me it looks like what we recommend is you dollar cost average into crypto there's dollar cost averaging their company balance sheet into crypto uh it's happening sometimes it's 15 million dollars sometimes 900 million dollars you know sometimes they borrow it you know it's not even like they just borrow it from directly from the fed and bondholders uh nice to be able to do that if you're a corporation another thing that tends to happen on a weekly basis is something that happened this week a d5 protocol was hacked 14 million dollars uh furrow combo exploited i've not personally i've heard of this i've not used it uh directly but um i'm not sure did you read the details of this hack or what actually happened this exploit was unique and that has never been done before and i think it's unique to how or what frucombro is it's apparently a drag and drop d5 building block system which is kind of cool um but apparently somebody was able to uh trick the protocol into thinking that the application that they had deployed was avei when it wasn't actually ave or something very very very very unique another the last thing that tends to happen other every single week is the fed talks about talking about the us digital dollar when are they going to stop talking and actually do something david yeah like once again the fed says we're looking into digital currencies and at this point just do it just get there is doing it they're trying the first time we talked about the fed looking into the digital dollar ether this was that was like you know in 2020 and ethereum was a younger system then like we forget how younger yeah we're all younger and it has it has developed way more in the last like you know x number of months than the fed has the fed's still looking at the digital dollar meanwhile crypto dollars on aetherium are through the roof like it's not going to hap if it hasn't happened by this point honestly it's not going to happen david let's get to some of the things that are happening in nfts because this is another thing that's going to be recurring theme i feel like for the next few months on the rollups that is nft's breaking new records the musician grimes this is elon musk's girlfriend i believe she debuted an nft auction sold out 20 minutes about 6 million dollars got another one blau brings in the biggest nft crypto art auction ever so setting records here almost 12 million 11.6 million in this auction um got another one here ubisoft is incorporating nfts into its game so major game publishing company working with so rare they're doing sort of football soccer in the us collectible cards and ubisoft is launching a game built with their nfts and lastly um well this is spencer newton saying that nfts are on the verge of going mainstream and he's got some metrics behind it but david all of this news on a weekly basis this week included feels like spencer's right nfts are going mainstream the fantastic thing about nfts is that they are magnets for celebrities and celebrities are magnets for people's eyeballs right so the amplification power of this whole revolution is massive because it's celebrities jobs to be public and get as much exposure to their nfts as possible so celebrities are taking nft's mainstream for us and that's because nfcs are a way for them to monetize their own labor as we have been saying that's that's a really good point i mean where effect crypto is effectively leveraging all of the attention and all of the fan base that these celebrities have in order to amplify its its mention uh in it in order to amplify its its attention on this space spencer has seven signs that nfts are on the verge of going mainstream david should we cover these yeah i think we can blow by them pretty quickly number one is that obviously sales are through the roof 91 million dollars worth of crypto artwork sold in february uh it which is 8x the previous month so that's pretty crazy the second is that there are now over four artists who have sales in artwork value of over 10 million so spencer says this is a sign that artists have unprecedented earning potential once you see another artist make 10 million on nfts you're certainly going to fomo in to that if you're a creator if you are an artist david what's the third one uh nba topshop up to 300 million dollars in all-time sales that's on the flow blockchain and there's a deeper conversation as to whether nfts on the flow blockchain are gonna work out can't settle to ethereum kind of a problem in my mind um but still either 300 million dollars or 300 million dollars bringing more people into the space the fourth is the sales of crypto punks these are the original nfts yeah vintage 2017 or earlier even uh they surpassed all time sales this is all denominated in eth which is another interesting point in and of itself all-time sales of over 105 million dollars so the more authentic the original nfts are doing quite well in this nft boom market david what's the fifth hash max 825 hash max in nftx nftx is a a nft uh etf type product uh with index fund that allows investors to get exposure to crypto art uh and there's just more and more hash marks in nftx nfts continuing to be like overall buying pressure for nfts david did you hear mark cuban call them hash marks on her podcast the guy knows branding the guy was awesome yeah well done mark freudian slip there all right open c which we're having on a bank let's ask me anything next week they just surpassed 50 000 users this is an over a hundred over a over a thousand annualized growth uh so this is definitely a sign of a vibrant secondary market for nft so open openc is almost like a an ebay for nfcs where people can resell nfts that they've purchased what's the seventh cap this one off for us yeah socks one of the first tokens redeemable for a real world item unisocks uh as these one socks one pair of socks is now trading at 130 000 these aren't these are actually erc 20s um but the connection is still the same you know scarce digital goods uh that well this one's actually redeemable for real life goods but i would still categorize it in the nft camp uh there's there's only so many of them the uniswap meme is extremely strong and to the point that people are evaluating that uni-swap meme at 130 000 per token i don't know how many total tokens there are i think maybe ten thousand um market cap is very high for socks david this is the one that got away from me i remember being like oh i'm not gonna pay 150 dollars for a sock come on unit swap come on hayden adams i'm not doing that joke's on me they're worth 130 000 now gotta love crypto uh evolve funds files for an etf this is a canadian firm that is filing for an eth etf this is right on the heels of the bitcoin etf that they just followed and i think maybe the story here is that first bitcoin will get its etf and institutional adoption but right on the heels of bitcoin is ether and this is what we've seen across you know the cme futures across all institutional preferences so far that bitcoin is really paving the way for ether to get into the institutional adoption as well and he takes here yeah here's my hot take an ether etf is more bullish for ether than a bitcoin etf is bullish for bitcoin and that's just because of relative market cap sizes if you're somebody who's interested in buying a bitcoin etf you're probably also interested in buying an ether etf and one dollar into an ether etf means more for ethereum because the market cap of ethereum is much lower than uh bitcoin and so it means more it will push the price up more that's my hot take uh i've got a i've got a second hot take on that which is the they take that bitcoin expands through institutional adoption so crypto banks as as we've said uh ether can do that too though right which is the interesting thing but it's not limited to that because it can also expand as d5 collateral as well so it's got these two paths to growth whereas bitcoin has just the one which i think is is kind of unique and bullish eth um there's a hot take on top of your hot take bitmex arthur hayes expected to surrender to us authorities he was kind of on the lamb i believe but uh now he's expected to to surrender what's your take on this uh it's gonna happen now it's finally happened no end of story i guess end of story end of story it's probably yeah arthur arthur is definitely going to be back in the crypto scene i'm sure at some point we'll see what happens next with that story um not ready for that to happen all right david let's get into some takes we've been dropping hot takes but now let's let's formalize it with in our take section this is a message from chris berninski what is chris saying here david yeah he is giving a warning to crypto entrepreneurs to be patient and let the deals come to you basically so let me read this out real quick if you're an entrepreneur raising money in crypto try to get more than one term sheet before committing to a lead the market is competitive and flush with capital that is to your favor more than one terms of service or or terms she's excuse me we'll help you get you the best deal and neutralize predatory behavior what he is saying in in the crypto space is that good entrepreneurs with good products are the scarce goods and as an entrepreneur you need to know that and so don't just sell out for the first deal because capital is not scarce in crypto people need to deploy crap capital and they don't have very many places to deploy them to that's also just a warning or a message for people interested in entrepreneurs the environment is friendly to you go build something like you can get money for it so go go out and get that money um so thanks chris for for just being a heads up play so chris is saying labor is in charge of this market in particular david i think labor that knows how to develop smart contracts and defy protocols in order to know those things you had to be leveling up on this stuff like two years ago right you could join now but you're not gonna command the premium that a of d5 veteran and a veteran is like two years one year even developing this space commands not that this is the yeah this is the value of front running the opportunity and when we say that we don't just mean investing in assets while they're low and expect them to to go high we do mean that but we also mean front run the labor opportunity if you know crypto at this stage in the game you are ahead of most of the world uh use that to your advantage you can do that during the the bull markets is what chris is saying here here's another take anthony cesano it's really fascinating to watch binance smart chain speed run ethereum's d5 summer what's he saying here yeah so he's talking about like the crazy farming apys that you can get on binance smart chain right now the crazy token movements new tokens new assets anthony's saying that it's very much like ethereum's defy summer but now it's happening on binance and it's happening at a faster rate and which makes sense because we've already done deep by summer once and so now the binance train's doing it's just going to do it even faster finance change saw bnb skyrocket in price and saw many new assets come and also skyrocket and price also got their first drug pulls uh so pop their rug pull cherry like congratulations finance uh and so yeah that binding smart chain speed running d5 uh defy summer all right here's another take the evm is the mode while we're doing anthony susano takes this is his second take here the the ethereum virtual machine is what he's saying is the moat is he saying that's the moat for ethereum the uh if you're in virtual machine what's your take here yeah so binance smart chain also an evm compatible blockchain right and so many many things are evm compatible blockchains notably eos was once an evm oh i guess it still is an evm compatible blockchain but what anthony is saying is that because everything is an evm compatible blockchain uh that's actually beneficial to ethereum while in eos and binance marching they're like hey you can come deploy your contracts on binance or on eos right and so then they do but it's actually just adding network effects back to ethereum because they ethereum set the standard and everything began on ethereum in the first place so compatibility to try and steal users or volume or activity from ethereum to your chain by implementing the evm is actually just increasing ethereum's network effects that's anthony's take yeah definitely i i can see i can see that take although i would say it's definitely not the only moat for ethereum i don't think anthony's probably not saying that but would you agree that the evm the technology component is not the only moat that ethereum has it might not even be the strongest mode i think that ether as an asset is emote in in of itself i think the ethereum community is emote i think credibly neutral protocols builders behind them are also moats in this ecosystem i'm not sure necessarily you know stronger emotes but i totally agree with the take that others adopting the evm enforces the evm as a standard um polka dot for instance they're not uh going with the ethereum virtual machine right um cosmos atoms they're not they don't have an ethereum virtual machine right now uh and um you know that has maybe decreased their adoption speed as a result all right ryan on to the next take which is mine and my take is that i am a full block maximalist and so this has been going around especially as many many people come into this space and they aren't they don't have some of these conversations that we've been having on bank list for a while now they see like oh polka dot scale like oh like you know buying a smart chain new chain like doesn't have fees it's good uh and so my take is that i'm a full block maximalist and that means that i pay attention to blockchains that have full blocks and that's a simple the calculus is pretty simple if your blockchain has full blocks it's being used and people are paying fees to use it therefore and fees are importantly not gameable it's not a gameable metric unless you are interested in burning money to fake that metric uh full blocks and and blockchains with high fees which is only bitcoin and ethereum are how you get a very strong signal out of this space and so as soon as polka dot or binding a smart chain or whatever block and so your blockchain here has full blocks i will start to include it in my mental models and we will begin to talk about it on the bankless program so stay tuned for future blockchains with full blocks all right david while you throw you thrown it down right there this is kind of what you're talking about right so we've got ethereum and uh it's it's kind of at the top with 15 million dollars average seven day daily revenue uh and then we've got bitcoin in second place with six million but i will say and then we have a bunch of d5 protocols we've got binance chain here with a hundred thousand in uh average fee daily revenue are you saying if that starts to rise up the ranks and get closer to ethereum and bitcoin that that will make you more bullish on something like binance chain relative to ethereum or bitcoin yeah it's a step in the right direction however there are issues with binance's 21 nodes which are largely run by binance right and so when binance pays for fees on binance smart chain they're actually just paying themselves so there is actually a way because they're the ones collecting their own fees it's okay for them to watch trade because they they the fees the money that they're paying they just collect uh so there is a nuance there that is worth uh parsing out yeah absolutely but definitely your point that that fees are the way you determine whether a blockchain is used or not is a is a good one all right david let's go with this last take i think uh this is ashley saying ethmaxy's pretending this is ethmaxy saying this bitcoin is a worthless meme coin also ethmaxis nfts oh my god nfts are the best thing ever what is she saying here well i think this means that i'm actually not an eth maxi because i don't think bitcoin is a worthless meme coin but many eth maxies do like they point at bitcoin and go oh it's a pet rock it doesn't actually do anything can i ask you i want to i want to get back to that that thing of eth maxis because i don't actually believe david before you get here it's like who's in eath maxie i don't like antiprosynthesis okay there's so there's one there's one guy on twitter that's a pseudo-anonymous account he's an ethmaxy i keep seeing all of these tweets about ethmaxy's in fact i'm called neath maxie i know i'm not neath maxie because i believe in other assets that are not ethereum and other genes that are not ethereum i'm definitely a bankless maximalist and a decentralization maximalist in the space because i think those values are how we like are very important those are the things we need as a foundation for this space but i don't believe that there's only one chain that can exhibit those those values so and i don't even think you're an ethmaxy you said you were in maxie early in the episode but i don't think you actually are like this is a meme that i feel like has been foisted upon a group of people without without substance but what's your take yeah uh i'm i it's it's a semantic issue right because like i'm not an ethmaxy because i own assets that aren't ether right and that's the difference between bitcoin maxis and ethereum maxies um and i don't really think ashley ashley is like poking fun at youth maxis i think she's just doing it for the memes it's a good meme it's a good joke um the point about if why the the theory behind why there can't be a theory of maxis is that ethereum is an economy no one is like an economy maximalist i mean i guess or we're all economy maximalists and by definition ether can't work as an asset without many many many other assets as well having value on ethereum and so just like this one token to rule them all attitude is is um just not relevant it's invalid when it comes to ethereum but it is also a very easy way to just ascribe homogeneity amongst an out group right so if you don't consider yourself an eth head an etherean or whatever you'll just point at all the people that you do consider to be in the out group of you know the ethereum believers and then you'll just call them eth maxis and that's how it works i got it so sometimes when people use the term ethmaxis what they're really saying is like fans of eth like people who believe that eth is really important and really great and that it's better in some dimensions than other chains it's kind of what they mean but that sounds like me yeah right so like i guess in that in using that term then you would be an eth maximalist but um i think what's interesting here is that ashley's is saying like bitcoin is a worthless meme coin and then she's also pointing out that uh ethereum maximalists or ethereums people are ethereum fans are going crazy over nfts right and nfts what are they they don't have cash flows they are useless memes are they not do you see that there's uh kind of um i guess a contrast here or something that doesn't line up i guess in the way that they think of these things yeah i mean there's we could go we could talk about this forever nfts are valuable because there's belief that other people will buy them you know there's one way to value these things as in this strictly the value of the art but i wouldn't say that that's why you know nfgs are being bought for millions of dollars these days they are being bought because people think that they can sell them to other people for higher prices in the future which is what bitcoin is yeah that's also what ether is like as soon as we have a conversation about like especially with bitcoin with perfect scarity scarcity it automatically turns into a pyramid not scheme but pyramid game right yeah and nfts are also a pyramid game where the value depends on you being able to sell it to someone else in the future for a higher value and at that point if it's if that's the only fundamental thing about what is true about the value of that asset then that's when people say like oh it's just like a worthless meme coin it's just a ponzi game it's just a ponzi scheme or whatever um but all ass all scarce assets have this ponzi nature to them their only reason that they're going to go up is and people are going to buy them now so that they can sell them to other people for a higher price later i do think it's the case that uh ethereums have traditionally been like it's taken them a long time to admit that that memes actually have real value and that you can have things that are store values because everyone believes their story values or things that can have value because collectively society believes they are valuable ethereans historically have been a bit slower to admit this whereas bitcoiners are just like yeah of course the number goes up like they got it day one they got it day one absolutely all right david those are the takes uh we should stop and tell our listeners about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible and then we will be back with the meme of the week gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemiini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card

does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics all right david we're back what are you excited about this week my friend uh okay so i didn't want to do this because i wanted to keep this alpha for myself but my my one of my favorite digital artists out there uh is releasing his nft his digital art nft and it has some bankless influences on it it is a picture of this git coin robot the theme behind git coin and he's he's fighting the the monster that is moloch over some sort of cityscape right uh really really cool and there's also some trophies to go to that that are going this is amazing it's so dope dude it's so dope this is the first time i've seen this and so like i i'm i'm going to be paying attention to this when it goes live for bidding uh and i might and this is why i'm i'm okay i i don't really find myself an nft fan i don't really find myself like interested in speculating on art but i want this for the art i want it for the art so i'll be  placing some bids uh depending on how high this this thing uh goes there's i'm probably going to get it out priced but i really really want this thing uh and so i might buy it we'll see a bad move to talk about it then in a bankless roll up my friend because now the word is out when is this oh friday the fifth uh the auction goes for two days so if your doctor should get yesterday about it over the weekend that'd be great let's just cut this piece let's cut it cut this out it's not going in oh man yeah that that's pretty awesome great piece of art for sure yeah and and also uh the artist kitty is uh donating revenue to git coin so not only is this art for art sakes purposes you can fund an artist who i believe deserves to be rewarded for their art but you are also funding git coin which also deserves to be funded so you can feel good about it actually slaying moloch while you are buying a picture of moloch that's fantastic yeah wow good point good point all right ryan what are you excited about you know this is really quick this week but i'm super excited that we actually have tokens with cash flows uh this this bull run right um so we we saw on the the the block chart where we saw defy tokens with revenue over time that's amazing we just put out a piece actually by the time you listen to this yesterday so on thursday lucas campbell from our team put together 14 different token metrics that you need to know when you are evaluating a token i felt so much david in 2017 like um like we didn't earn it we didn't earn the bull run the the tokens that were pumping in price had nothing behind them like no substance this time i don't feel like that we have a real decentralized finance economy with real cash flows with real users uh this is a big deal and um you know if if it's your first time in in the crypto bull run if you weren't here in 2017 just know this is different we didn't have this stuff in 2017 so i'm super excited about it and this is something that uh chris berninski has talked about ever since i i've read his crypto assets book in 2017 that valuations in this space will play out over like decades we'll get better and better at it as an industry and i'm definitely seeing a level up on how to value crypto assets this cycle that we didn't have in previous cycles so kind of geeky kind of nerdy whatever but look it's it's what i'm excited about this week it's it's a another theme of the bankless podcast that we keep on harping on is that being understood is extremely bullish and when i when i hear matt from bitwise saying that investors can understand defy instantly specifically because of live real-time data that they can analyze and verify and reduce their career risk where somebody's like well why did you invest in that defy token it's like well look at this live report of all the revenue that they're making in real time like that's why i invested it's doing billions in volumes it's doing billions in volume right and so like the investability of this thing is so awesome and yet if you want to get access to like what does it mean to get access to d5 that gives you real-time data like how do you get how do you get exposure to that and the answer is either dpi or eth or it's just eth because ethereum is the economy that enables the real-time reporting of valuation metrics yup absolutely well said we're bringing in new core cohorts uh into the space and everyone is learning about it um meme of the week david meme of the week of the week even what is our meme of the week your time of the week the meme of the week is wall street a scene from wolf of wall street where jonah hill is on the phone with his boss right after uh leonardo dicaprio tries to get him into whatever whatever the i can't remember the story anyways he's on the phone with his boss saying uh me quitting my job to work for the decentralized present and future and then there's uh ethereum looking over his shoulder watching him quit his job and then the caption is hey man have you heard of this ethereum thing something about sovereign finance and lots of memes anyways i quit is it possible this is a great meme but like is it possible to actually quit your job and go work for ethereum right now like i know you and i are doing it but i mean to be fair we started like a year and a half ago or so what what are the opportunities now for people are there more opportunities or they're they're fewer there are oh my god there are so many opportunities and i think that the most obvious opportunities are specifically in two realms uh d5 protocol treasuries millions and millions and millions of dollars hundreds of millions hundreds of millions of dollars available for funding for anyone that can contribute value of any kind to a protocol right like you have to if you if you have value that you can provide to a protocol i guarantee a protocol will pay you for that value in some way right and and that's what's so awesome about this is like there's no more like credentialing you don't need to go get a degree you just need to show this protocol that you can contribute value and so like all of this and like you know four years of education and two years of education after that so you can give your credentials like no the the community like hey yo that guy is doing good work pay that man some money it's much more casual it's much more just like by the seat of the pants and i think much more fun much more freeing and that's just d5 protocols the other side is nfts which is funding artists we've talked about this number of times on the bankless program but funding artists and giving them vehicles to monetize their creativity and their labor i think the design space for allowing creators to fund themselves with nfd is just getting started and those are just those two things you can carve your own path i quit my job of in my career path of trying to become a physical therapist and and i started just writing blogs for this company back in 2017 and that's just how it started i just started creating i just started producing something that people valued and so if you don't know what to do go and figure it out because like honestly it's up to you you can get it done anyone listening to this you can be employed by ethereum or an ethereum protocol or pick your blockchain of choice by the end of this bull market and so if you want to that opportunity is available to you you just need to actually act on that here's the other thing i would say is you could start this out as a side hustle right so you don't have to just like do the jonah hill thing and call your boss and tell him you quit right that's like that's that's a fun way to do it it makes a great meme but you don't have to i mean you could start using your spare time your hobby time your weekends your moonlight hours doing something for a protocol getting involved in these communities and understanding actually what they need do they need more users is this marketing do they need more education materials do they need videos do they need like coding do they need some financial analysis any skill that you can bring to bear to help one of these protocols achieve its end goal will be valued by the d5 and crypto community and economy and you don't have to go zero to 100 right away just start to start doing something in the midnights in your hobby time and uh that's a great place to just even see if what you're producing provides value to the community first before you go all in 100 million people employed by ethereum by the end of the 2020s 100 million 100 million people by the end of the decade yeah wow there you go 100 million people starting with the listeners starting with the listeners starting with the bankless nation uh we're going to be in the ethereum in the crypto economy not only buying the assets of this economy but working for this economy that feels pretty fun uh we should do risks and disclaimers guys eth is risky defy is risky crypto is risky none of what we said was financial advice today but we are on the journey west we're glad you're with us thanks for joining us on bankless
