bankless Nation welcome to the very last weekly roll-up of the Year happy Friday morning to you I hope you're drinking your cup of coffee while we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor which is why I've pulled in my dear friend Anthony cesano to sub in for Ryan while he is getting his software updates for 2023. Anthony welcome to the bank this weekly roll up hey David thanks for having me today I love how you say Ryan's getting a software update just because there's that Meme that he's actually a robot

Meme and it's stuck pretty damn well uh anyways uh Ryan like I said uh he's actually out on vacation enjoying some some well-earned breaks with wife AI Child AI uh so we're pulling in Anthony susano to sub in for for his help so Anthony thank you for for helping us walk through the news are you ready to do it yeah let's go here all right so last weekly roll-up of the Year bankless Nation we are going to talk with some year-end Market talk we got roughly about 10 times the amount of charge that we usually do on a weekly roll up so we're gonna walk through the years winners the year losers and what this snapshot in time is going into 2023 so that's going to come up first an extra large Market section some candy to end the year with uh coming in in second got to talk about the state of Solana everyone is talking about it on crypto Twitter right now so we're going to discuss that uh coming up after that we also got to talk about the state of multi-coin capital because it's not great and then lastly we're going to talk about the state of layer twos because they report out of bank list from our analyst Ben just came out and there's always a bull market somewhere so we're gonna talk about the state of layer twos Bank location you know the deal please like And subscribe rate and review wherever in the metaverse you are listening to this content that is how we get crypto back onto the top of the iTunes business and investing charts and before we get to all of that topics first we get to have to give a shout out to our strategic sponsor for 2023 Kraken you guys know Kraken Kraken has been the exchange since 2011 and why have they stuck around since 2011 well because they've prioritized things like security and transparency and actually servicing their customers well uh and so that's how they've been able to stick around for such a long time for actually being true to the ethos of crypto and helping the crypto industry Blaze paths forward into the frontier of the world of crypto after all of the insolvencies of 2023 having a secure and transparent exchange is no longer just a nice to have feature is probably a trivia based requirement of your exchange of choice we definitely need secure exchanges to get our money from the old world into the new world and Kraken is is helping us do that thank you for cracking for being bankless strategic sponsor for 2023 visit kraken.com Bank lists if you want to upgrade your exchange all right Anthony are you ready to get into the markets uh let's start with Bitcoin of course uh Bitcoin started the week at the high high price of Sixteen thousand eight hundred dollars ending the week at the low low price of Sixteen thousand six hundred dollars down one percent Anthony and he takes on bitcoin no I mean this range that Bitcoin and eighth have both been in uh is just hilarious to me because I mean it is the uh Christmas period right and we're going to be seeing very low volatility around this and then you see these Wicks on the chart of people just trying to kind of uh wreck shorts and wreck Longs and it's just like this little bit of a ping pong going on but yeah volatility is is very very low right now uh and this range kills both bears and Bulls I think when I look at this stuff it reminds me of 2019 or I guess like parts of 2019 where we just kind of ranged forever and 20 and probably even 2020 and people are getting really frustrated with it like oh my God starve for volatility and typically you see people go down the risk curve in that in that environment which is kind of funny in a bear Market to see people going down the risk curve but yeah it's an interesting dynamic because I think this time around we have nfts right where people kind of seek refuge in nfts and that's why we see some nfts still popping off even though Ethan BTC are like sideways basically everything else is basically dumping so yeah it's kind of an interesting Dynamic to see how people will move between in different markets because they're they're kind of like starved right you go where the food is so to speak yeah and when there's no volatility in the blue chips like Bitcoin and ether when that that range gets really really compressed and all of us like monkeys are opening up our price apps and being like hey can I get some dopamine like can you do anything go down even like give me some excitement and so people's like trading ranges get compressed and compressed and compressed and so they start to get like more or less more more bearish or more bullish inside of tighter ranges and they start to play tighter trades and it just makes the the field of play like Tighter and Tighter I remember I think what you're talking about in 2019 was like the BART effect that was just absolutely massive in 2019 where it would Bart up and then Bart down and you could like sometimes just feel a Bart coming and it's just like oh yeah we just marched it up give it like somewhere between 12 and 18 hours we will bart back down and what BART means Bart is like Bart Simpson like imagine like the Bart Head go straight up like Jag around for a little bit go straight down and then you do that verse anyways we digress eth price kind of doing the same start of the week at 1220 ending the week at 1200 flat down about 1.9 and of course the eth Bitcoin ratio uh pretty damn flat on the week about a half a percent down uh we are at zero points uh seven two on East BTC Anthony any comments on eth BTC um I think it's just continuing to do what it's done all year has remain flat against Bitcoin which is actually incredibly bullish for eighth I think uh as people have said on Twitter I think I've said it as well uh basically eighth didn't do this last bear Market eighth went straight down against Bitcoin last bear Market it dumped like 90 against Bitcoin uh you know and 94 against USD but this time around it's basically flat on the yeah we had a bit of a dip mid-year uh when Heath bottomed in June because of uh 3ac puking all their s t e for eighth and then selling that eighth um from there but we bounced back from that and now we've just kind of stuck in this this range for the whole year which as I said I think is incredibly bullish there are people calling for hbdc to actually nuke um maybe next year or something like that too oh I've heard people call for it to Nuke like soon yeah yeah I mean I've been hearing it all year from particular people but I look at that and I'm like well look if you're just looking at charts maybe you can come to that conclusion if you're just looking at a historical kind of chart data but the biggest thing for me is the merge uh and that's what's affected each BTC at the most by removing that cell pressure that we would have had from miners uh that's I why I believe if BTC is is so strong at least uh and there's other reasons as well but I think that's a core reason and if you're just looking at charts they're not going to show you that charts they start historic historical charts will just show you ethereum in the proof of work error right it's not going to show you with you in the proof of stake era yeah what do you make of this trend so we have like this very long-term trend from like almost 2019 of eth BTC just going up into the right but then we have the short-term trend of it coming down I am not a TA Charter person any TA person looking at the chart right now is going to cringe but just what do you make of this like convergence of like kind of short-term bearishness versus long-term bullishness on the East BDC ratio yeah I mean I think since 2020 eighth has really come into its own thing uh atheists viewed a lot more positively by The Wider market now Eddie's still viewed as more risky than BTC though that's why you'll see the kind of volatility here and you'll see things sell especially in big sell-offs you'll see it's selling off harder than than BTC but I think more and more people understand the eighth ball case now than they once did more and more people understand that ethereum is here to stay or at least maybe not even understand but believe ethereum is here to stay because believe it or not even up until like the end of 2020 I probably after D5 summer or during defy summer a lot of people didn't believe that ethereum was going to amount to anything right are we still Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin uh and I think there's a bit of parallels now with with some other things we're going to talk about later but yeah that's that's why because I think ethereum just has a much better story now and there's a much better bookcase for it than they used to be and obviously we just did the episode with um with Justin Drake and DC and myself and you guys uh that you put live there but I think yeah more people understand the ball case for Ethan ethereum on and that's helping there but as well as those kind of flows that I guess hell press originally talked about due to the merge um I think people looked at that and were like oh well athe is not doing very well against USD it's like yeah but that's a bit that's bear Market things right in a bear Market nothing's going to do well against USD right but look at is relative to other assets and look at its historical performance and look at its current performance eighth is trading like it is basically the same risk profile as Bitcoin which is quite something that's never been like that before nothing's ever traded like Bitcoin before honestly in terms of risk profile Bitcoin was considered by far the safest asset in crypto and was your flight to safety in a bear Market uh but that's not the that's not the um that's not the thing anymore yeah so I've got the Missouri chart screeners up and we are looking at a comparison down from from all-time highs uh ether actually ahead of Bitcoin in terms of down from all-time high by a whopping point six percent so either is down point six percent less than Bitcoin which is unheard of compared to last cycle uh if you go and inverse this and see who's down the most of course we have Tara Luna Terra Luna of course followed by BitTorrent followed by Lido some of the star from some of the starting points of these are all kind of arbitrary right why is z cash down technically 100 yeah well it started off the out at the superior price but we're going to go into some winners and losers uh so but but for first I want to actually look at Bitcoin and USD in yearly charts this is the last weekly roll-up of the year and sometimes people forget to zoom all the way out and see what things look like on a yearly basis and so what I've got on the screen here are both the linear and logarithmic charts for Bitcoin with yearly candles so each one of those candles that you you are seeing is 12 months of time and you can obviously just see a secular bull market in Bitcoin unquestionably up and to the right like there's actually only two red candles on the screen which is kind of insane actually uh so one two three four the first four years of Bitcoin it was green on the yearly chart then uh in 2016 no wait oh well this actually isn't the full the full chart for Bitcoin excuse me two out of the one two three four five six seven eight nine last year is a Bitcoin only two years have been read and we are of course finishing one right now uh Anthony what do you make of this uh of this chart yeah I mean I think this is what people will talk about when they say four year cycle for for Bitcoin right or you'll have like uh some you know a red year after having a few green years right but it can be kind of arbitrary like you can actually get an an all-time historical chart for Bitcoin it's called the the BLX on trading view it's uh the brave new coin bitcoining index um and and the four-year cycle is pretty pretty uh prominent in that and I understand that because of the harvesting cycle and all that sorts of stuff and maybe that's been true in the past but I don't think it necessarily is going to be true going forward um I have a lot of opinions on bitcoin that I won't won't give generally here but I I think that the the comparison here between linear logs quite important as well linear will show you the extent of I guess the movements and how Wild they can get you can see on the linear chart there's a massive wick for Bitcoin in uh in in 2021 there let's come back down and then you've got obviously the red but the log will give you a better long-term picture and a better smooth picture of what things look like uh and and Traders use both I've seen Traders use linear a lot actually because they like to see there's because they're more short-term oriented they like to see the pronounced movements there because it'll show you it more violently um like yeah especially on the eth chart right uh but uh but yeah I prefer to look at log charts just generally though yeah that that youth chart is even more volatile looking than the than the Bitcoin chart but both charts are just looking absolutely up and to the right of course uh ether's actually got much more red yearly candles than Bitcoin does and but um that's also just because this is also picking out ethereum's earliest years as well because this one actually does go back to its first year of existence uh and then of course here is the eth Bitcoin yearly candles which also is just up and to the right so it's just important to know that no matter what you look at in crypto Bitcoin ether ether BTC uh things are always up and to the right uh that's not probably true for every single asset of course there are many many assets that came during the 2013 bull market that aren't around same thing with 2017 but over time time we're starting to collect more and more Assets in crypto that when you zoom out and go into the yearly candles everything is just up and to the right any final comments on these yearly charts before we move on yeah I mean I think it's also important to I guess understand outlier bias here because as you said like there are many many many many assets from those previous Market cycles that never came back against USD let alone eth and BTC so always good to keep that in mind when looking at things and trying to say oh well you know Ethan BTC did this last cycle it means my favorite asset can come back it's like no it doesn't it's not what I mean there's no guarantee of that um I understand why you would say that and it's fine to believe that but don't fool yourself into thinking that that's a guaranteed thing right take a snapshot of the nft markets right now since this is again the last weekly roll-up of the year so to end the year the board API Club coming in at a 73 East floor taking the number one spot followed by the crypto punks 65eath followed by mutant Apes at 15 eth those are the one two and three nft projects to finish the year Anthony you want to talk about nfts you want to keep on moving uh I mean I don't pay too much attention to nfts I always find it funny watching the spats on Twitter especially between the board apes and the crypto punks uh with the floor price I mean now being quite close they used to be you know quite far apart uh but I always find that that kind of entertaining but yeah I don't really pay too much attention to it generally it's just not my scene yeah I think the board Apes might have actually flipped back over to number one this last week uh because crypto punks were in the in the lead for the two or three weeks prior to that but unquestionably board Apes were in the number one spot for the vast majority of 2022. uh all right so we're gonna look at some Trad fight we got Tesla and Amazon on the screen in his charts absolutely wrecked uh these are some of the Amazon's going all the way back down to its March of 2020 it's covid uh covid lows and we are that is where we are now so imagine that Amazon is back at the same price it was at the bottom of the March coveted lows kind of insane uh Tesla is an absolute Free Fall coming in at 123 dollars when it used to be almost as high as almost 500 but definitely over over 200 for the last almost two years now Anthony any comments on traffic yeah I mean the trend here is quite funny because it basically just shows that everything that happened during the covert period was just funny money right like all the assets going up it was like an everything bubble but in saying that if eath was back at its March 2020 bottom it'd be 90 right we are like 13 x from there and and Bitcoin went back to like you know what was that like under 4 000 or something so when you look at it like that crypto or I mean Ethan BTC not all of crypto but Ethan BTC have done remarkably well uh which is which is quite funny and you know it also speaks to that Narrative of inflation Hedges as well like you could still make the argument that hey look Ethan BTC have acted really well as kind of those inflation inflation or debasement Hedges because if you look at stocks I mean Amazon is a big ass company that is very very profitable and is uh you know he's growing year on year but their stock price did nothing the last two years now uh looking at this Tesla's a different story I think Tesla got way way overvalued from where it was supposed to be I mean I don't have a great read on the stock market but just doing naive like price to sales price to earnings and then pricing that in the future you can you can see that but seeing something like Amazon you know erase all of its gains from from that bottom is is quite something and you know I think that because of that it makes it makes the market just much more healthier generally too and I think that that's what the Fed was looking for when when raising rates they wanted the market to reset itself to prior to the covert stuff uh but you know we've still got inflation relatively High we still want to see that come down all that sorts of stuff but generally the macro environment is very hard to study because it's not our scene so to speak uh being in crypto but also it is much more complex I think than crypto it covers so many different things across so many different uh countries and and places around the world that it's hard to to see but yeah it's funny seeing just like Amazon erase all of its gains for it's like something as profitable and as big as Amazon raises gains I think there's definitely some solace in this because if you weren't going to be a crypto investor the other asset class that you were probably probably would have invested in is like high growth high risk tech stocks and so like they also got wrecked too so if you're feeling like wrecked by crypto well I mean if you compare crypto to like tech stocks it's almost the same uh and so like like if you compare them they say relatively like doing so so bloody well compared to these other stocks right it's just crazy 100 yeah so I've got I've got coins coinbases Equity uh absolutely absolutely right uh coin is down 90 not even from the top tick of the 400 almost 440 price that it reach on day one but of the price it originally came out at 380. it is down 90 from its original price of 380 down to thirty four dollars right now I kind of think that coin is like a generational buy right now man like it's it's got to be worth I think this makes coinbase worth seven and a half eight billion dollars like that's pretty insane so my thesis on coin the reason why I didn't buy it and probably won't buy it still is that one it is directly correlated with the health of the crypto market right because coinbase is revenue is directly correlated with that but also you have coin trading in Trad fire world with people who don't understand crypto right people do not trade this as if they know what's going to happen with crypto they do not trade it with the assumption that there's going to be another crypto cycle they trade it with right now Queen Bay Queen is trading like crypto is dead because that's what Trad fire lots of people outside of crypto believe so by that measure you like I can't bring myself to buy coin over something like eth or even I mean I wouldn't buy BTC but like when you compare it to BTC or even some other crypto assets because if Queen is going to do well it's going to be when the crypto Market's doing well and by the time the world believes the crypto Market is doing well there's already been a lot of gains had by both Ethan BTC and other assets that you were still probably going to be better off buying those than Queen now that's not investment advice ice but that's the way I look at it and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon because the Trad fire outside of crypto World they find it very hard to understand crypto they're going to trade based on pure marketing narrative just general mainstream noise and we usually see that come when crypto prices are already at the all-time highs like when Ethan BTC are back to all-time high you know that's when I would suspect some big moves to happen there but yeah I mean that's just my general thesis I've had on on coin for a while yeah it's definitely a fair take I will also just point out the vast difference between the 7.9 billion dollar market cap of coinbase right now versus the 220-ish billion dollar market cap of ether like there's there's some alternative risk to reward there I'll say yeah I mean it's it's definitely yeah a a a better maybe it's a better risk reward to play buying coin here than than buying ease depending on your time Horizon depending on how you look at these things but I think generally yeah coin is just looks like to me like it's trading uh like the rest of the world thinks crypto is dead which they do right now right yeah uh and then of course we got Solana here is the yearly Solana like candles there's three of them uh and the first one is a tiny tiny little green candle the second one is an absolutely gargantuan green candle with a huge Wick all the way up to 280 and then the third candle where we currently are is an absolutely gargantuan red candle which goes all the way back down to the base of the green candle uh we're gonna talk about Solana coming up next so I'll save some of your takes for it for that Anthony uh but I want to get your take on this one uh this is a tweet from uh sour hog last fud of the day so Luna avax traded at 600 yeah Saloon avax is a index of soluna Avalanche and uh Solana I said just said soluna Solana Luna and Avalanche that the index traded at 600 and now is worth twenty one dollars that is a big oof Anthony give me your hot takes uh I have or should we save it for the Solana section no I mean I I can give one on this on this in particular I I think people are going to call me an eighth Maxi no matter what I say so I'm just going to give my honest takes here um this was perpetuated by people who were mercenaries right this was perpetuated by three hours Capital this this meme of soluna abacs uh which was funny because they didn't really have a soul position but they had massive Luna and and avax positions they didn't care about fundamentals they didn't care about how uh like uh Tara was built on a house of cards they didn't care about Avalanche just being an evm fork and only really having any traction because of the bull market they just cared about making money and it's kind of an irony that they had so much money that they made and they lost it all but when looking at stuff like this and and looking at it happening in a bull market you really need to remember if your first cycle you won't know this but next cycle you need to remember that people pushing this narrative do not care about you at all all they care about is making money they don't care about the projects so I'm not surprised at all to see it come down like this because we already saw this happen last like all if you were around for them we already saw similar things happen um but in terms of speaking to the fundamentals of these projects yeah it's it's never in line with that and as we saw Tara went to zero uh you know Salon does not have enough great time and no one talks about Avalanche anymore at least from what I see so yeah but anyway yeah I haven't seen anyone so Avalanche has not shown up in my feeds either although people in the bankless Discord do say that there's exciting stuff there that I should explore uh something I'm not going to explore though I thought I thought this was pretty pretty funny so hex uh the Richard hearts baby down uh 97 of course a very polarizing coin on crypto Twitter uh there's definitely an army of hexagons out there that are going to come on to my mentions just because I brought it up uh but I thought I'd just put this tweet out there uh just because I thought it was pretty funny um we can move on though uh here's here's a takeout or a tweet I want to get your take on this is uh Ben this is the Ben the analyst over at bankless our our guy our analyst Ben uh RPL up 67 percent against Lido since the November 7th or excuse me November 9th bottom interesting and he takes on uh RPL versus Lido yeah I mean I'm become so biased recently towards rocker pool because yeah we're both Rock and pull Maxes yeah yeah I mean I joined as an Odell member bankless is already an oh doubt member I've spun up many pools I think the rockable community is so closely aligned with ethereum it's it's basically the same Community um but my I guess like most level-headed take here not not bringing my rocketpool bias into this is that Lido is already worth a lot right and it kind of has grew really really quickly but I think there's a belief in the market now that Lido's growth has topped out right at about 30 and that post withdrawals they're actually going to lose a lot of market share due to people reshuffling their ether round and due to uh rocker pool being in a very very nice position and going to be in even better position around time of withdrawals to grow so when it comes to lsds it's hard to bet on anyone uh and maybe betting on Lido historically has been a good relatively good bet I guess but yeah I mean arpiel the token from what I've seen has been very very resilient it has an actual fine use case within the protocol itself it's not just the governance token and I think the community is one of the best in crypto uh so so yeah I mean I am a rock-a-pull maxi at this point but that's my most level-headed take that I can give yeah I know I share those sentiments as well I think glido captured a massive amount of the market and asking Lido to go up 67 is much harder than asking rocketpool to go up 67 uh the winner of the year the best token the best crypto asset to hold your money in this year was unquestionably GMX if we scroll all the way back out to the one year chart it is up on the up on the year a lot of chop uh started at twenty dollars currently ending the year at 40 to 43 dollars uh so and doubling on the year uh but actually most of that doubling happened in the first few months it was then a flat for the rest of the year uh so congratulations to GMX and all GMX holders because you guys did not lose in 2022 and I'm made you winners here's a chart that I thought was pretty interesting that's actually not the price of a token but it's actually the price of a stable coin and this is uh the chart I saw of Rye in relation to other US dollar and other Fiat currencies and so Rye of course is a it's a stable coin in the sense of the word as it's meant to it's a coin that is meant to be stable but not stable to anything in particular uh it is a it is opposing Market forces uh and so how that works it's out of scope for this it just attempts to maintain some sort of soft Peg to the US dollar not follow it in particular and if you look at this chart uh it's probably the coolest and most simple and most stable asset to hold out of all Fiat currencies uh Anthony what's your take on this yeah I mean I like Rye um unfortunately it has some limitations on it that will that mean that it can't actually grow that fast and it can't actually be used within D5 like other stable coins can um and the biggest limitation there is capital inefficiency because you have to clear allize it with Ethan this is why dye went multi-cladral is because it was very hard to grow with just claralizing it with eth but I think that all of these kind of stable coins even ones that aren't tied to USD uh specifically tied to USD I don't know I feel like long-term I kind of hope that we get currents like we just get like eighth that becomes the de facto currency and we start measuring stability against eth rather than trying to mimic Fiat currencies uh because yeah I mean fear currencies lose purchasing power just like any other currency does but if we have one that can maintain its purchasing power over the long term like something like 8th does I think that'd be better but yeah the stable coin stuff is going to be a massive kind of element of thing still going forward and I'm excited to see if Rye can actually grow um but but generally yeah it still Savage from the same kind of issues I think that other decentralized stable coins suffered from yeah certainly certainly all right bankless nation that is the snapshot of the year in markets but we got some more conversations ahead uh next up we're going to talk about the state of the Solana ecosystem uh it's depending on who you ask it's either in a meltdown or it's moment of solidarity or something we're going to talk about Solana also going to talk about most high coin capital in the state of Layer Two it's coming up next but first

below a dollar and then in at the top of 2021 2022 it was 270 dollars and now it is eight dollars and 36 Cents coming almost full circle to where we are now down I think something like 94 from all-time highs uh this is the Talk of the Town on crypto Twitter right now everyone's talking about it and the the tweet I put out which I won't read here is that uh the Solana Community is trying to bolster morale the East Community is saying it was Vapor all along the trading Community tells me how bad the chart looks Anthony what's your take on the Solana ecosystem right now so my take has remained the same from when I first heard and learned about Solana I think that people kind of look at the stuff that maybe I'm saying and other ethereum people are saying and being oh you're just dancing on Solana's grave you know you're just throwing shots at Solana because it's down so much and it like I've been throwing the same shots at them that I've been throwing since day one I just don't think the Solana architecture is long-term sustainable I don't think Solano is going to win against ethereum and its L2 ecosystem from a fundamentals perspective the price action I think is in a different kind of Realm and you can talk about it in a different context but I'm not surprised at all because like Solana had support from SBF and FTX right and like now that they're gone and now the SPF isn't funneling all the money that he was making uh or I guess stealing from customer deposits into Seoul Seoul is going back to basically the price that it started at like you know I don't think it's gonna I don't know if it's gonna go back to three dollars but it's basically erased all of its gains like it's down more than 8 8th was down in 8th 2018 bear Market an eighth was propped up by icos right and that's why it came down so much but when you have something like like that such a big Force propping up your thing and it's going to come down very very hard and Heath went through that in in 2018 and that's what Solana is going through uh right now now in saying that I think people are and this is one point I really wanted to hit on I think people are making the false equivalence between eth coming back from that 2018 bear market and and Seoul coming back from its current bear Market there is no guarantee of this at all right there is no guarantee that your favorite thing is going to come back just because uh someone else's favorite thing came back and let me put this in context for people like there were thousands of tokens issued and assets issued in 2017-18 uh maybe one percent or less of those actually went back to their USD all-time high and none of them went back to their Ethan BTC all-time high I believe uh except maybe B and B I think BNB might have been the only thing right so you can't just look at previous performance of other assets and say that your thing is going to do the same thing now the the thing you can do is look at the actual ecosystem behind your favorite project and be like okay is this sustainable is this going to grow are we going to be able to come back from where we're at today um and I think for Solana it is an extremely uphill battle just like it was for ethereum in 2018 but the problem for Solana is that ethereum didn't have any real competition at all during its risk Renaissance kind of period and ethereum led its own Renaissance period Solana has competition from from everyone else every other layer one all these other layer ones like Aptos and sui and say and stuff like that but also ethereum and its layer to ecosystem which actually exists today it didn't exist back in the day but it does now so if Solana can come back from that I'll actually be bullish on it right like I'm I'm serious yeah I'll be bullish on Slender if I can come back from this because they're basically starting from a very very very bad position right now um not not only from Tech perspective but also from just general perspective and if they can manage to build an ecosystem out of that and go back to all-time high which I think is just near impossible right I'll be impressed and I'll be bullish but at this point in time I I just can't and and I've got so many other thoughts on this and I'm not just saying this because I'm an eighth Maxi I believe this about pretty much all the L ones and I have a lot of thoughts on l1's generally but I'll I'll leave that at that and you can maybe give your your take there because you did say you were going to back the truck up at ten dollars and I don't think you did I did back the the Tonka trap truck up today uh so I bought a few Soul a handful okay at below 90s but yeah do but did I do that because I'm fundamentally bearish or bullish on the Solana ecosystem no it's because of the same reason why I said what I was saying when I tweeted that out in the first place is just like I know what it's like to be in this position and the the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that the Solana Community seems to be taking this as a challenge to themselves which they've all the reasons to be bearish about Solana and maybe I'll just go through with I'll put on my eth maxi hat too and go through those with you uh you're totally right that like ethereum had like this privilege of being the only ethereum in the room when it came back from the grave in 2018 to 2020. there were no ethereum competitors at all uh and like Solana has to come back while faced with a an ethereum that is already one cycle ahead of it with all of its layer twos which are in a bull market right now that's part of the topics that we're going to talk about and one thing I've always said is like I won't really be bullish on Solana until I see a frontier of developers pushing forwards in a new direction that ethereum isn't uh and I'm I mean that's yet to see that that's always been like all right David you are so bullish on ethereum what will it take to change your mind it's always the answer to that has always been when I see developers doing things on other blockchains that are not being done on ethereum and those are Frontier new level Technologies and I'm I'm yet to see that uh and then also I mean and even even I wasn't gonna just on that note even if that exists there's no guarantee that that's going to push soul back to its ridiculous all-time high because just to give context for people Seoul started at about 50 cents I think it stayed there for a little while but then quickly went up it went up to 280 that is a bigger run than when East did in 2017. he went from 10 bucks yeah exactly eighth went from ten dollars to 1400 it's 140 x uh Seoul did much more than that right and as we've seen it was because of the SPF and FTX uh kind of money funneling in so where's this money going to come from to get it back to to that even if Solana is providing value to people even if they have users even if they have developers building cool and interesting stuff again that does not necessarily translate into price and I mean the reason it did for eth is something that we could talk about but it's an aside there but yeah I just wanted to make that note for people and I think this applies to so many different things as well yeah 100 I think my mind it goes back to like the one bullish thing I see about Solana is the community seems to be taking this moment not to capitulate but to rally at least that from a very cursory glance from what I'm seeing on there is a real Community there there's a real community and that's like this one nugget of like bullish optimism that I have for the salon ecosystem under a sea of like wow that's a lot of headwinds that like not even ethereum had to face during 2018 and so like I'm just not envious of the Solana ecosystem but uh I am always heartened to see people believe in something uh because I I think you and I both shared that that experience believing in ethereum and during 2018 to 2020. so if that's what they believe in by all means um Good Luck adventuring forward into the frontier yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean as I said like if they can get out of this like it'll be incredibly bullish for them but it is a huge if it is something that I mean they have so many headwinds and honestly like ethereum as you said did have headwinds coming out of its own bear period but not compared to what Solana has here and I'm not just saying that because I'm people gonna call me an eighth Maxi for saying that I literally really objectively looking at the headwinds that that Solana has compared to what what ethereum had it's it's very different and it's a different ecosystem it's a different ball game uh if there is a real Community there that can bring value and keep building out Solana that's fine but is that enough to fend off competition is that enough to get soul back to all-time high I really don't think so yeah yeah and the sentiment on crypto Twitter is like as negative as it can get on Solana here's a tweet uh from she generates maker has 260 million in uh in total locked value in March of 2020 when ether was collapsing to 85 so during the capitulation crisis of kovid each collapsed down to 85 and maker Dow had 260 million dollars of tvl some of that was my tvl uh Solana currently has 229 million dollars in total locked value so the maker is just a single app on ethereum and Solana is an entire layer one blockchain so this kind of puts into per it puts into content text like Solana has individual applications on ethereum that it competes with like many many many applications and that is not the condition that ethereum had prior exactly exactly it speaks to the fact that back then ethereum was the only thing that was around right and now uh Solano is not the only thing that he's around the reason why Solana has such low TBL uh or at least one of the reasons is because people have their funds on other Chains It's not just ethereum right there are other chains out there obviously is a vast majority ethereum but there are l2s that are just dominating right now I'm going to talk about that uh so and that didn't exist back then like there was just ethereum there was eos but no one like I mean EOS came eos's problem was that it came in a bear Market I think so it didn't get what Solana got by coming and being ready for a bull market but there wasn't really anything else there was and there wasn't defy or anything and then ethereum created this thing called Nephi and worked on it and it's amazing and it works really well and people love it and now there are other chains that just copy ethereum and there are so many of them so like I don't see the differentiator here like I really don't and honestly the only reason why people are talking about Solana so much is because it had such a big bull market and that's just uh left over from then there are other ecos and there are other l1s that do much better than Solana Beltline and smart chain is killing it right compared to Solana no one talks about it you know what I mean so I think the only reason why that people so many people are talking about Solana is because it had such a loud bull market now and that's another headwind will people do are people even gonna care in a year I I honestly don't think so um and and yeah I could go on forever and people always call me an ink Maxi for this and I really don't like it because I think the takes that we're both giving here are very reasoned and very uh just looking at the data looking at what's happening here and honestly like with if l2s didn't exist I'd be just as bearish on ethereum because there's no way ethereum would be able to actually service anyone or anything without l2s taking on a lot of this a lot of this growth um and from that perspective I really do think that people need to look at this objectively and look at what's happening now compared to back then and not just say oh Salon is going to make it out of this because ethereum made it out of its spare Market that's it it's insane to me when people think that maybe it's just people blindly having optimism here because they need to because maybe they're underwater just like I was underwater on eth buys maybe I had some blind optimism back then but but yeah just looking at it as a whole it's it's very hard for me to to find a bookcase here I do want to pay attention to one last tweet from vital computer and actually who tweets out some smart people tell me that there is an Earnest smart developer community in Solana and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out the chain has a bright future hard for me to tell from the outside but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive and interestingly enough this tweet actually marks the bottom uh because Solana was like breaking down below eight dollars and then vitalik tweeted this and it jumped like 20 25 or something uh to be I think where it is just below ten dollars right now uh but this is this is kind of the sentiment like I see real people in Solana who believe in it and I think this is the right sentiment to take moving on to other Market topics and layer twos are really really good and they're really really strong so again this is analyst Ben over at bankless who put a L2 year in review with some metrics that we want to share here so here is the arbitrum transaction count on monthly basis almost every single candle is higher than his previous one for the entire year of 2022 which I think is pretty damn cool uh the same thing with optimism it's just a chart up and to the right so L2 usage is just in an absolute bull market users are up and up and to the right not unique transacting addresses and of course the rise of GMX on arbitrum as well one of the few tokens that didn't do bad in 2022. Anthony uh what's your take on all of this yeah I mean we've been saying people are going to call us AV Maxes for this but we've believed in l2s for for a long time right this isn't a a kind of sudden thing for us for us this isn't like oh all the l1s are dead l2s are good let's pivot to being bullish in l2s no we've always been bullish on ethereum and l2s and ethereum's roll up Centric road map because it makes the most sense it makes the most sense from every kind of way you look at it economic social uh scalability and we're seeing this play out in real time while the l1s are dying basically or losing a lot of their activity l2s are picking all of that up and people are coming home to ethereum because ethereum is consistently the most sustainable ecosystem in crypto it is the most fun to be on uh and I think what was holding it back was those High fees on layer one and now we have l2s which have really cheap fees not as cheap as some of the l1s out there um but they will be post Proto dank sharding they'll be cheaper and they'll still be able to inherit ethereum security and ethereum's community and ethereum's network effect so I'm not surprised at all to see the l2s grow I'm a little bit surprised to see them grow so well in a Market it really speaks to just how how awesome uh the I guess like l2s are the fact that they can grow in a bear market like this but what's gonna happen in a bull market I mean it's going to be amazing in the next bull market we have ethereum is actually going to have a scalable ecosystem for people to play around with people aren't going to be priced out anymore uh and I I honestly can't wait for that but and and L2 transaction counts have actually flipped L1 now which is what we want to see ethereum L1 is a settlement layout he's not a user layer at least for most users it is for those who can afford it of course but l2s are where the users will sit and the thesis is playing out before our eyes this is not a new thesis we've talked about this for many many years and it is playing out so I think people need to understand that is it that we we're not just pivoting to being L2 balls we're we've been L2 balls all along right we've been waiting for the for the l2s to show up I'm really enjoying this new scaling Factor page out of layer 2 beat uh one of my predictions for for 2022 is the scaling factor of ethereum which is how many more times layer twos on ethereum M transact ethereum's worth of capacity so right now the ethereum's got a scaling factor of 2.4 so if you combine all of the layer twos together add all their transactions that is 2.4 times the amount of transactions you can put through the ethereum layer one and my prediction is that we are going to hit 5 by the end of 2023 and I think that is a very low number I think I think we could see a lot higher than five definitely all right Bank this nation coming up we got the news of the week that we got to talk about China is opening up an nft Marketplace absolutely nuts uh as an ice storm passes over half of the globe pudgy Penguins reach new all-time highs coincidence uh and a developer gets arrested and exchange gets sued and I ask Anthony to rate crypto Twitter tweets out of 10 so stay tuned for all of this and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless

dot IO not so much news in the ethereum world this week one release we want to talk about Taiko Taiko is a brand new ethereum layer 2 evm equivalent Layer Two I love those words uh and they tweet out first public testnet is now live Welcome to our Alpha One test net aka some Icelandic word that I'm not even gonna bother to pronounce but it's got a volcano now or something yeah way better than I would ever had so congrats on that uh they continue as we it's as open as we make it so while you are relaxing this week participate deploy contract wrote a node and proposer or just make some transactions so if you are interested probably uh for the technically minded if you are interested in exploring the frontier of ZK EVMS that are evm equivalent check out Tycho yeah the unique thing about Taiko is that they're building a type 1 ZK VM uh or ZK roll up uh AVM um and I don't think there's any other ZK VMS doing that which is cool because I think vitalik mentioned that with like two three or four types of ZK VM and they have different properties but yeah taiko's building a type 1 ZK ABM so different than the other ones you may have heard of yeah and if you want to learn more about what Anthony just talked about there with the type 1 versus type 2 read this post I will link in the show notes about how to distinguish an uh ZK evm uh d-gods an nft project on Solana has now decided to bridge over to ethereum in q1 of 2023 uh so kind of some indication of a little bit what we were talking about earlier uh I think that was the biggest nft project on Solano um just to give some scale here it's not just some random nft projects from what I saw it was the biggest and they also bridging something called Utes to polygon as well so yeah I mean it's kind of like people abandoning the Solana chain for ethereum and polygon and that's how people kind of read it on Twitter um yeah I don't know there is a signal there I don't know exactly what that signal is because I don't know what this project is I don't know how sustainable it is I don't know anything about it but there is a signal there that projects moving from Solana and other l1's back to ethereum or just over to ethereum and the polygon POS chain there is a signal there I believe it depends on what you want that signal to be though uh certainly like I talked about with the pudgy Penguins uh did you ever own a pudgy penguin NFC uh Anthony I don't think you're much for an nft guy no but uh someone I think crypto wife made me a penguin in my kind of like character but it wasn't part of the nft but yeah I don't think I ever owned Apache penguin no well let me tell you I bought some Prodigy penguins and sold them at the absolute bottom so congrats to everyone that held the pudgy penguin because it just hit an all-time high of seven eath rare to see uh an nft hit all-time highs these days but congratulations to all the pudgy holders speaking of nfts uh China is actually launching a national digital asset Marketplace to trade actually not nfts they are specifying digital Collectibles because apparently digital Collectibles have been popular amongst Chinese collectors through heavily regulated marketplaces and now there's going to be a Chinese National digital collectible Marketplace wow did you see this one coming no and I kind of take news out of China with a grain of salt because there's a lot of Lost in Translation and the Chinese government basically changes their mood uh from time to time I mean we've seen China bans Bitcoin a million times right so I kind of take that with a grain of salt we'll see uh it's not really interesting to me considering it's a very closed ecosystem like it's more closed than a centralized exchange right it's completely utterly controlled by the CCP so yeah it's definitely not something that interests me uh to be honest but interesting interesting development but yeah not something that interests me personally I mean it definitely checks out if China is making a cbdc this is what what is this this is basically a cbdc version of a Marketplace for a digital collectible so I think it's trying to if this if we're taking this piece of news at face value because yeah you're totally right there's like a just like a cultural barrier that can't be crossed with a lot of news and information that comes out of China but I think it's fair to assume that the Chinese government is like oh digital Collectibles those are totally going to exist so we should make a Marketplace that is state-run to facilitate that technology that seems like the very obvious like path just like accepting their existence and then making a state operated exchange to do that that sounds pretty China to me yep exactly uh did you know microstrategy purchased an additional 2 500 uh Bitcoin for 41 million dollars Anthony oh well it is is it a day that ends with why strategy is buying BTC you know what I found funny about this actually is that they sold some BTC to tax loss Harvest and then re-bought and bought more which is actually kind of smart because they're down so bad on a lot of their buys right now so tax loss harvesting makes sense um but uh yeah I mean I'm not surprised at all that sailor bought more BTC right yeah yeah here's the art that article about the tax loss harvesting uh sold 700 Bitcoins bought them back two days later to tax loss and he also sold a bunch of um Master strategy um stock I believe and then probably put that money into BTC which is kind of funny when you think about it is like taking the the try to find money from from master and putting it into BTC so yeah that was interesting as well I think dude this is the story for the ages man like this is Ryan's take and I I think I should agree with him is that it's gonna work out for him like Bitcoin is going to end up in the green for for Michael Saylor Pro probably yeah I mean I'm not bullish on bitcoin against like against USD can probably easily go back to all-time high in the next cycle and I have no doubt there but yeah it'll probably work out for him but it would have worked out better if he bought eth that's my opinion to each their own you know everyone's everyone's got their preferred assets yeah yeah we've been following stories like this over the past few weeks so here's another one Argo blockchain which is a Bitcoin mining public company uh has suspended trading on in U.S shares for 24 hours uh they are on apparently the verge of bankruptcy so they are looking to figure out how to restructure without declaring bankruptcy but the health of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is definitely being stressed and this is nothing new this happens at the bottom of every single bear Market really is like Bitcoin miners go under and the strong ones become stronger this is kind of like an important facet of like how Bitcoin works in the first place with just miners always improving inefficiency in theory but to me actually right uh excuse me I almost it's called you Ryan Anthony this actually marks a bottom for me this is a bottom indicator of for just the crypto industry at large but also specifically for Bitcoin and I have this eth BTC long position open and this news like this actually makes me a little nervous uh just because this this is a strong bottom indicator for Bitcoin yeah but there's also still a lot of mining emissions that will just keep getting sold right like that was the my main thesis around 8th BTC was the the fact that eighth no longer has those emissions and BTC does and on top of that these collapses just lead to more centralization of mining because as you said the bigger players get bigger mining becomes more centralized uh because and becomes much harder to compete because of that because you need like a massive amount of capital to start up and I I know that there are arguments to be had about proof of stake centralizing as well but I don't think that's out of scope for for my point here but I mean I don't think I can be bearish on each BTC and that scenario just because some miners have capitulated doesn't mean that the existing miners aren't going to continue to sell BTC to cover their expenses they definitely will that is not a theory that is a fact they have to sell BTC to cover expenses that is the only asset or the only Revenue that they make is from selling BTC um some of them may have a very small part of um of their business that does other things but it's like centralized crypto exchanges majority of their revenue comes from crypto trading right so the majority of the Bitcoin miner Revenue if not all of it comes from selling BTC and this goes for any Miner so when you have that cell pressure and ethereum doesn't and eth as an asset has much more I think demand drivers than BTC does at least from my perspective I don't know how you can be bearish on either BTC in that world yeah yeah and some more news out of the crypto exchange we're all Gemini's earn program is being sued by some of its investors of course because all that money was in uh Genesis which went under because of FTX all of this contagion worked its way to Gemini earn and sadly is now being sued by investors uh due to all of that Anthony any comments here may just more kind of innocent people getting hurt right thinking that they're putting their money into something that was trustworthy because Gemini is a trustworthy exchange right they haven't really had any dodgy stuff happen around them and yeah I feel sorry for people that lost money here but again speaks to if you don't know where the yield is coming from uh you may just be the yield yeah that's a good take there Anthony a few weeks ago Ryan and I covered the story of this guy Avi who uh was manipulating markets on Mango markets on Solana and then took some of that winnings to go get liquidated with gambling with curve in Ave I don't know if you remember that story but that developer was arrested for uh Commodities fraud and manipulating markets go figure right uh and I thought this tweet was pretty funny from him statement on recent recent events this was after he was publicly known to have done all of this he did he did this out in the open I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week second tweet I believe all of our actions were legal open market options using the protocols as designed even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way that they are and unfortunately the exchange this took place on Market mango markets became insolvent as a result with the insurance fund being insufficient to cover all liquidations this led to other users being unable to access their funds to remedy the situation I hope to negotiate a settlement with the insurance fund with the goal of making all users whole as soon as possible as well as recapitalizing the exchange this man is now being charged by the cftc for Commodities fraud nice yeah yeah commodities for Market manipulation my main takeaway from this is I brought a kind of take where essentially it kind of opens Pandora's Box now like if you can prosecute for this or if you you can charge for this can you charge for people running MAV strategies right like for example there is a very toxic MAV strategy called sandwich attacks that pretty much everyone agrees with is extremely toxic and should be completely uh eliminated but can the cftc charge the MAV searches and and maybe even the relayers for kind of help helping this to to happen and I don't know maybe they're studying it maybe they're trying to see if this can can be considered Market manipulation but it's all very subjective because there's also Mev and Trad fire markets and it's quite toxic as well like payment for order flow I Believe is quite toxic where the biggest players get to pay for the order flow information and then make money on that basically a form of Mev so it's going to be interesting to see how that shakes out but it seems like they're more so going after the individual rather than the actions that the individual like the individual for the actions he took but rather than the actual actions right so maybe just don't be so public about it and don't actually go out there saying that it's a highly profitable trading strategy when in reality you were just manipulating things and you you knowingly did it right you knowingly manipulated The Exchange uh knowing that it would lead to losses for users if you do it like that then yeah I mean I think it's a bit bit if you'd be Brazen about it yeah it's a bit bit more yeah and the way that this works bank listenation if you're questioning how this happened is he basically took a large sum of money was able to move a market in one direction for an oracle price and then be able to take a position out of that market that he just moved in order to capitalize on it and then when everything resets after he's been you know tinkering around with oracles and prices on illiquid markets he ends up with way more money uh and then everyone else that had money in the extra in in the mango Market uh didn't have any money to withdraw this is called an economic attack uh and it's what it's Market manipulation is what it is and so Anthony are you saying uh that uh the difference between like a sandwich attack with Mev versus Market manipulation and D5 app is really just like on a spectrum and one's very very small and one's very very large is that kind of what you were saying yeah but it's it's I mean it's just subjective right it just it depends on which regulatory Authority that it is what they want to go after what's actually written in law what they can prove what they think is harmful on on what scale it's harmful at there's a lot of different moving Parts here but you could you could imagine an argument being made by some one of these authorities to say that anyone engaged in Mev behavior is hurting people so we're going to prosecute for that but it'd probably be a lot harder to prosecute for that rather than just going after an individual being so loud about it and having all the on-chain proof to to kind of go after because a lot of the Searchers are actually Anonymous from what I've seen they may researchers oh interesting all right bankless Nation coming up next we got some questions out of the nation we're going to go straight to the Inner Circle Discord to get some of our questions this week uh and then we've got some hot takes of the week and Anthony and I play a fun game where I go through the hardest takes the hottest tweets of 2022 and ask him to rate them on a 0 to 10 scale oh I think that's game is going to be pretty fun but before we get there we have to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you

get started and we are back with some questions from the nation we're getting these questions straight from the inner circle Discord so if you are a bankless premium subscriber and you would like to ask either me or Ryan but this week Anthony a question go into the bankless circle inner Discord and ask it in the brand new weekly roll up question section the first question of the week comes from poser out of the Inner Circle Discord asks how does asset compare with tornado cash how is it security model and why did you invest in it because uh this uh bankless listener knows that run and I invested in NASDAQ and since Anthony also invested in Aztec Anthony you want to take this question yeah so the main difference between Aztec and tornado cache is that Aztec has a much broader kind of Scopia Aztec is a privacy preserving layer 2 or they've actually kind of rebanded themselves lately to an encrypted L2 because they're using the term encryption instead of privacy uh I think Brands great yeah it's a really great Rebrand and I think it may be due to I guess the stigma around privacy which unfortunately exists but basically tornado cash is is a mixer right very good mixer obviously because ofac found that kind of prudent to sanction it because it was so good at being a mixer whereas Aztec wants to be an encrypted layer 2 where basically you can do privacy preserving transactions at their layer 2 while also tapping into layer 1 ethereum liquidity and they have this thing called Aztec connect and they have a bunch of apps on Aztec that allow you to essentially tap into ethereum layer 1 liquidity while doing a transaction on Aztec layer 2 which means your transaction is still private so I think it's very cool I mean as you said I'm an investor in it as well um basically because they're one of the only L2 teams if not the only one focusing solely on making a privacy preserving L2 which I think is incredibly uh interesting and Incredibly needed I mean my two biggest ball cases for ethereum uh or my two biggest things I'm interested sorry in ethereum are scalability and privacy and Aztec offers both so yeah no brainer investment for me for sure not only does it offer both but one actually helps the other so the Privacy helps the the speed and the speed it helps the Privacy which is a pretty cool uh Synergy between these two things all right next question coming up lab punk what is it currently the best hardware solution price over quality to run a dedicated ethnode Anthony I know you've got a solo Staker computer I don't think you're going to suggest that as a price to Quality staking computer but I was wondering if you could give your take here do you have any any ideas as to the best kind of Hardware to set up an eighth note I think the best hardware would probably be a knock so if you search like Intel nuk on Twitter that's going to be your best kind of like uh price to Performance ratio now my style is taking PC I posted the Twitter people probably saw it it's basically a gaming PC like totally Overkill you do not need that at all but Intel knock uh with at least at least 16 gig of RAM and a two terabyte solid state drive is going to be your best bang for your buck now in saying that you can also run validators on Raspberry Pi's or what something called a rock 5B board but for everyday people I would suggest something like an Intel nuk and run something called dap node on it which makes it really easy to stake and dabnode actually has their own solution um with avado so avado is basically an Intel knock that comes pre-loaded with that node and then you can run it with that so yeah I would say that's your best bang for your buck uh kind of node to run a dedicated eighth node slash validators on that I forgot I had one right here oh there you go that's all it is really that's that's all you need and you can run up to hundreds of validators off of that which is actually what someone from the rocketball community does um I don't believe he's running it off a knock I think it's either off a rock 5B or Raspberry Pi he runs hundreds of rock-a-pull mini pools off of that which means he's running validators on that so when you when you kind of look at it like that yeah you don't need beefy overpowered Hardware at all uh and people who do that like me are just doing that because they like pretty things uh but yeah an Intel knock or or an avado which is basically not coming pre-installed with that node is probably going to be your best bang for buck I think yeah and these These are really what these machines are for they're just like the minimum viable computer that's in a tiny little box and it does all the computation you would ever need for a computationally constrained blockchain like your individual computer can totally run a blockchain uh and it doesn't really need to be that big uh all right and then last question Theo will there always be an N plus one layer twos or do you think we will settle with a winner take most kind of Market between one of optimism arbitrum ZK sync I'm not sure if they specifically chose these three but they're are some bigger layer twos that we would expect to be in the future I think that n plus one phrasing is kind of interesting I think so I think the question is will there always be growth in the supply of layer twos or will there be a concentration on a few winter layer twos that will scale both horizontally and vertically what do you think about this Anthony so broadly speaking to me there are two kind of categories of Leia twos there are the generalized ones like optimism and arbitrim that allow you to do anything like what you do on ethereum layer one and then there are the specialized ones like the app layer one oh sorry the app uh l2s like dydx for example that are very specific to a a use case and very specific to just Dy DX so I think that in terms of generalized platforms there's only going to be a small handful of them that actually take the majority of the market share there aren't going to be hundreds of these generalized l2s that all share market share it's just not going to happen like that I don't believe um but then on the uh the dedicated L2 app lay us kind of things I think that we're going to have hundreds of those I think there's going to be a lot of different ones not all of them are going to succeed of course but they're definitely going to be quite prominent so that's how I split it up and I think obviously the market leaders right now are arbitrum and optimism in terms of the generalized platforms but the jury's still out on a long term winner I mean as we've seen there are ecosystems that can kind of build up a network effect but then lose that quite quickly because it may not of being a real Network effect that may have just been subsidized by bull market activity but yeah that's how that's how I generally look at it and I think that's a good way to frame it as well because there is not going to be hundreds of generalized l2s there's just I mean just from a perspective of network effect there's not that the network effect begins Network effect and because of the parallel distributions that we see in pretty much everything I think I don't think the uh generalized l2s are going to escape that power law effect yeah I think we can definitely apply the same reasoning why we you and I both don't think that there will be a large number of smart contracts layer ones are probably going to extend itself into Layer Two so there's probably not going to be that many smart contract layer 2 either for the same reasons that we believe the first case um but then there's also you do get the more app specific chains like oh there's always going to be like a single chain for like World of Warcraft for example or whatever like more specific Niche use case you have for a specific server of some kind um but then also there's uh there's takes like pallenia's take who thinks that they always emphasize the possibility that a layer 2 will be able to produce some possible new type of money a new economic model for money I've seen them uh articulate that a number of times and so I'm there's like perhaps use cases for layer twos that we haven't even really been able to optimize for yet uh actually Anthony I do have one more question for you uh I can't actually remember where this was questioned asked in the Inner Circle but I thought I'd ask you uh what is your favorite Pokemon oh geez that's putting me on the spot I haven't played a Pokemon game in a long time um I think my favorite for from I guess like when I used to play it a lot which was very very long time ago Sapphire and Ruby days gen three um I would say my favorite from back then was probably salamance because the way that you gotten salamance was getting a bag on um and I think it's Bagon and to get that you have to go to a specific cave and kind of find it and it took me a while to get there and find it in I just I actually remember where I was I was at I was at the beach playing on my game boy with my parents uh and I got it there and then it involved into Sheldon I think it was Sheldon or something and then salamand so yeah um but yeah since then I haven't really got kind of played it too much uh so that would that would be my answer all right and of course all of these questions came from the inner circle Discord if you want to come in and have some fun with us sign up for bankless premium and I will see you in there in the questions and answers channel one take of the week this week out of crypto Twitter and this is coming from D John Spartan himself and if anyone else tweeted this tweet I definitely wouldn't have included it but DJ and Spartan says personally I'm excited about 2023 because that's when the crypto bear market ends no specific time in 2023 but just 2023 broadly Anthony what do you think about this take it's a name I'm sorry to burst your bubble it's a copy Pastor wait seriously yeah yeah I'm sorry but did I just get memed yeah you did you got you got inverse abroad I just got in this Rod wow um because look did you inspired and I I consider to be one of the the smarter people on on crypto Twitter even though you should post a lot even though this is a post unironically I think it's also truthful but he's also been calling the bottom for as long as I have on E specifically and saying that now would be a good time to accumulate for the next cycle which I also believe to be honest um so I think the bear marker for eth uh like and BTC ending I mean it could be in 2023 if you subscribe to those usual cycles that we see in crypto but yeah I think on the surface this is a post with with a bunch of alpha underneath it as well yeah see that's always the beauty Beauty about dijon's tweets it's like yeah it's post but like it could not be though you don't really know yeah you don't really know but I think I think he subscribes to the same thing maybe we do where now is the time to accumulate and like on on Ethan maybe BTC but yeah it's kind of and then he's also saying things like there are some assets that are going to give you 100x from here just like what happened last cycle but picking those is really really hard and it's even harder these days because there's so many more assets and projects um but but yeah and when you see Market talk like this on crypto Twitter just generally to people I would kind of stay clear of it no matter who it's coming from because no one has a crystal ball but if you are a long-term investor then yeah I mean you can look at a few different kind of metrics out there and come to a conclusion based on that and then the last set of tweets that we're going to go through in 2022 these this will actually be the last tweets uh blockworks put out this uh article that I thought was pretty fun crypto twitters most liked tweets of the year there's seven of them so we're gonna go through them one by one we're not going to talk about this one we're just going to put it on screen and briefly move on uh number two vitalik buterin about the merge and we finalized happy merch to all this is a big moment for the ethereum ecosystem everyone who helped make the merch happen should feel proudly today Anthony rate this tweet out of 10. uh like 100 out of ten like come on this is easy this is I mean the merch is the best thing that happened this year and vitalik twinning about I mean I saw vitalik tear up on the stream right like he was in like I couldn't imagine the amount of Happiness he was feeling uh seeing the merge happen after working on it for so long it's like he's pride and joy right his baby so yeah I mean this is the best tweet of the Year for me I mean the merge is the best thing that happened this year's is the best tweet yeah there's not even not even hard for me to answer yeah and the uh 194 000 likes I think that yeah this makes if it talks most like tweet coming in at number three CZ we need less divide in the world more building a hundred and thirty six thousand likes Anthony rate this tweet I mean I agree with the Tweet but coming from CZ it's a bit ironic uh cz's kind of like a Redemption Arc has been funny because he's like being able to have like a more positive um uh view of himself because of SPF blowing up but ZZ is still a villain in his own right to me so I would say I agree with the Tweet but I think it's it's very ironic coming from CZ and out of 10 I mean maybe eight out of ten or something because because that's what I've always believed in like let's just keep building um but it would be 10 out of 10 if it came for someone else CZ is a villain why is he a villain uh I'm not I I to go into it would take me a while but CZ has promoted some very shady and scammy things in the past to make himself uh to make binance kind of successful he got into bed with Justin sun and Tron during the last bear Market he was a very very big promoter of them um and he generally does a lot of the same stuff SBF did in terms of I guess like uh well I mean it's suspected of but there's there's obviously not much proof but he he's definitely better at managing his risk as well he's definitely better and like not just I mean he's everything that hasn't I don't think he's stolen customer deposits or anything like that but for people who have been around for a while you'll know that cze he's definitely been a villain and he's just kind of like reject his image recently uh maybe these days he's not as much of a villain but he definitely was back in back in the day I definitely agree that those all those things definitely happen I will also give him some credit of he has put a lot of private keys in a lot of people's hands and at the end of the day you also have to take into account that people in like South America and Argentina use binance to get their lives done uh and so bonnets is a good business right and it's it's been great for crypto and all those insolvency rumors I think we're really really dumb about binance I think comparing binance and FTX is completely wrong and comparing CZ and SPF is completely wrong but at the same time CZ is not an innocent party it's not like he's an angel he what he definitely is a villain in his own right he definitely cares about he cares about growing binance at all costs I don't think he cares about his own wealth and and power like SBF definitely cared about power above or else but I think CZ as a person cares Above All Else growing binance and he's and he stuck to that which is fair enough but he's done unscrupulous things to grow binance which yeah that's that's where the villainous comes from I think all right coming in number four naive ukele the president of El Salvador just over a hundred thousand likes El Salvador just bought the dip with an El Salvador flag 500 coins and then average US dollar price of 30 700 Anthony zero out of ten uh like zero because this dude's just eating his country's like money into BTC at the highs and I really don't think that he's citizens cared much for BTC or cared much for it being integrated they uh yeah El Salvador as a country is is not you know it's not a first Little Country right and to see your Presidents and I say president with quotation marks uh because there is uh apparently he's not much of a president more of a dictator to see him yielding this money into BTC into being underwater on and then trying to force his citizens to accept BTC at their businesses and stuff I don't know I don't think this is this is a great look at all uh and I've been critical of this from for a very long time yeah I again I don't totally disagree uh Michael Saylor tweets out Monday morning it's time to get back to work and it's a meme of Michael Saylor handing you McDonald's fries hashtag Bitcoin Anthony right this week yeah I mean I I think as a meme it's hilarious um uh again going back to like the person tweeting it versus the Tweet itself uh so I guess like eight out of ten maybe but he traded this in May of of this year when BTC was collapsing and so it was length and everything else right and he's just making fun of himself for being underwater so I guess he's got some some humor there um but but at the same time yeah at least like Salem I'm not a big fan obvious people know yeah you have to give him the credit on the Tweet though that is pretty yeah definitely yeah Sam bankman freed 58 000 likes uh one I'm sorry that's the biggest thing two I f'd up I should have done better Anthony rate this tweet oh I mean like negative a million out of out of ten like saying I should have done better are you kidding me bro like you literally knowingly stole customer deposits to try and get into things to try and like Leverage try to make up for your bad trades like get out of here get out of here like I'm I'm so glad that he actually got arrested and he's actually facing jail time for his uh his crimes here because this is just ridiculous and I think I said this on on my own show people like SBF who were just basically massive egomaniacs when their Empires crumble their mind breaks and they're actually not thinking straight anymore because then they know deep down that they're never coming back from this right and they're he's not the only one dokon 3ac um and they they speak like they're actually like mentally deranged and they're saying things that a normal person wouldn't say and that's simply because their mind is broken their empire is gone uh and their life is over they I think they know that and their their careers are over and they have to deal with that and their way of dealing with that is this apparently yeah yeah that's a pretty good take yeah the devil speaking of dokwan yeah dokwan at 41 000 likes close to announcing a recovery plan for UST hang tight tweeted out on May 10th of 2022 41 000 likes Anthony rate this tweet the same as the previous tweet like what a piece of right promising people that he was going to be able to recover UST and everyone had their money and people lost billions of dollars like seriously like when Dark One arrests honestly like what uh what like I'm not gonna means words yeah like him and SPF and and the others of this cycle that have numbingly lost customers their money and created these these  things and especially people like dokwon who had a massive ego and would dunk on everyone calling out anything wrong with UST or anything like um bad about UST yeah I mean and the fact that they're so liked these tweets as well it just speaks to how crazy the bull market got and how people just didn't really give a about anything except making money um but but yeah I mean the lesson from all of these people is that the most popular people in a bull market are not people you should be following they're usually the ones who get washed out first and we saw it this year we saw them all get washed out uh and yeah maybe lessons for next next bull market people that are still around today yeah I did tweet out uh about what lessons did we learn during this last bear market and it was like oh yeah we don't listen to egotistical personalities so I don't think we're gonna fall for that again I hope there's like a decent number of people who all learn these lessons I'm not optimistic that there's like not another new lesson that we learned that we don't totally foresee um but that was my take about that all right Anthony to close it out of course we're gonna do the very last meme of the week of the year of 2022. are you ready for it yep here we go it's Gary Gensler who's saying come on in and talk to us and then Sam Bateman freed saying I did several times uh give us your takes I mean I gotta be careful with what I say here because I'm dealing with uh with uh accusing people of things but there is a lot of kind of evidence and a lot of proof uh that Gary Gensler was uh I mean in bed with SPF and not treating him like a bad actor actually inviting him in treating him like a good actor um getting ready or gearing up to give him preferential treatment uh that's kind of coming it's alleged I'm not saying it's proven or anything like that um but I think Gary Gensler has done an absolutely terrible job as the SEC chair he has not protected really anyone he only cares about himself and his own career which is evidenced by him going after celebrities like Kim Kardashian instead of going after the actual scammers in crypto the big ones um so so yeah he did nothing to protect people from FTX and SPF and obviously FTX wasn't regulated in the US FTX us was but FTX was in the Bahamas but the reason it was was because they wouldn't provide a regulatory framework for FTX to operate within the US uh and yeah I mean there's a lot of takes on the SEC in general but yeah they've completely failed in their mandate in my eyes yeah and I've actually been talking to a number of Securities lawyers in last week's going down the uh Securities Law SEC rabbit Hall uh and the both the two takes that I've gotten is that in order for crypto to get the regulation that we want we're going to need a new Administration uh and so I'm going to put my my daydreaming hat on and I'm going to say that because of this because of the relationship between SPF FTX and Gary Gensler as Gary Gensler was using SPF and FTX as like a playing card to elevate his position and his power that hopefully is also the downfall of Gary Gensler as if this plays out and then we get a new Administration in the SEC as a result of that maybe I'm daydreaming but I see that as a potential possible path forward uh which would be extremely bullish but that is just absolutely mere speculation Anthony sadly our time is going to have to come to an end because we have gone so far over time but I have absolutely enjoyed this weekly roll-up that we've done together thank you of course for always subbing in for when we need to get the AI some software updates if y'all want more of Anthony he puts out a video basically every single day at 30 minutes about what is going on in the ethereum ecosystem is called The Daily gray you can find it on YouTube I get it as a podcast Anthony talk a little bit more about the daily way yeah I mean I will I will say that if you're into ethereum and really ethereum alone and want to hear me say bullish things about ethereum then the daily ways for you uh please don't come to the Daily way expecting me to say nice things about other ecosystems I think some people get the wrong idea sometimes the daily is an ethereum dedicated Channel it is not like Bank list which tries to cover everything it is definitely ethereum and ethereum alone but if you're into that if you are all about ethereum then the daily way I think I believe is the best resource for keeping up to date with everything happening in ethereum so yeah and I would really appreciate it if you subscribed and watch my videos and gave me feedback if you think I'm doing things right or doing things wrong uh but yeah go go check that out if you're into that stuff yeah and I of course have the daily gray in my ears at least a few times a week at least a few times a week I do try and catch every single episode but I definitely binge them for sure Anthony thank you so much for joining us and also bankless Nation thank you for joining Bank list throughout all of these weekly Roll-Ups of the year that was 52 out of 52 weeks we've done a weekly roll up and Anthony thank you for joining me for I think think two or three of them yeah I mean yeah it's definitely been three I think or four maybe four but yeah thanks for having me this is always very fun yeah absolutely and of course Anthony did you know that crypto is risky you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it is not for everyone but we are glad you are
