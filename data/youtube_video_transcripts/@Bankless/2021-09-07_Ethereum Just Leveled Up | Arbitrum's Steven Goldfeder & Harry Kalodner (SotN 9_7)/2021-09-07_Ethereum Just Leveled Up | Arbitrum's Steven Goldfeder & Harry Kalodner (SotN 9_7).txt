hey bankless nation welcome to another episode of state of the nation we have arbitrary back on why do we have arbitrary month well it's because they shipped they shipped a layer too it is here it is available a bunch of new exchanges on it unit swap sushi swap balloon i was told layer two is never gonna ship hey it's ship david it's here we just talked to them so we've pre-recorded this episode given holidays and given schedules in advance and we are releasing it to you on youtube now also on the podcast but david why don't we talk about what we talked about first of all who do we have on we had as stephen goldheader and harry kladner the ceo and cto of arbitrarium the guys leading the arbitrary team into actual mainnet along with a whole host of brains behind them as well and these guys really understand the deep core principles of roll-ups and layer twos and that's why everyone gets really excited about arbitrary and why we were super excited to get them back on the show to update us with arbitrary now that they are live now that they are actually live so we asked a number of different questions uh focused a lot on scalability and like the gas markets and how they are the same or different than ethereum and how they also adapt and evolve over time those are some of the biggest lessons i've i've had about learning about like l2 gas markets and how it's going to look like in the future well as well as a number of other questions as well i think the the reason this is also a really important question is because um you know right now there's this this question in the market at least whether another layer one is going to supersede ethereum or whether a layer ones are just competitive with layer twos right there's kind of this uh this question and uh we asked these questions of arbdrum hey like how are you gonna attract liquidity and how are you gonna solve composability problems how are you competing with other layer ones that are competing maybe against the ethereum ecosystem they had some great answers um one thing that was cool and we'll have to do some time david is like they have reddit on board dude i still feel like this is such an underreported story like reddit 450 million users right um what are the largest social media sites in the world i'm a daily user of reddit maybe someone should report on this somebody should report on this come on is what should happen uh but apart from that i mean they picked arbitrary is is the bottom line and the reason they picked it we kind of got into it anyway we talked about that i think the bottom line here is they've cut the tape you can you can go through you can access the theme park you have many of the d5 apps you know and love others are coming soon so like ave compound these are coming in the future you said defy and days another cool takeaway for me david is um post merge right there's still more exciting things to look forward to on ethereum the next big milestone will be data sharding guess what data shrouding does massively decreases the cost of all roll-ups right that's something we got into too so some neat discoveries in this conversation i think you as the listener um through watching this and through listening to this will be better positioned to make a decision on which of these solutions are going to win into the future um so we are going to get right to that conversation but before we do i got to ask the question i ask every single state of the nation david and that's what is the state of the nation today sir ryan we are migrating we are migrating on our way to the arbitrary layer 2. uh there is liquidity getting onboarded and then our as soon as other applications that i'm a frequent user of like compound and ave come online to arbitrary i'm going over there man like that's yeah i'm sure you're gonna let me i'm moving now i'm moving like you're moving from seattle san diego and i'm moving from ethereum to arbitrary we are migrating yeah absolutely we are uh guys also wanted to do a shout out to so rare so rare is a fantastic fantasy sports nft game that you can play you can trade you can collect you can play fantasy sports with your friends these guys are building on a roll up to you on top of ethereum this is the largest nft ethereum sports game that exists absolutely massive in europe as well so in the us we call it soccer but of course our european listeners will be calling it football and go check them out go get involved in what they're doing go collect go trade we'll include a link in the show notes you can also go to so rare.com that's s-o-r-a-r-e-dot-com we all know exactly how just absolutely fanatic fantasy players are about their sports teams and we also know that ethereum is the new epicenter of culture and now ethereum is eating up all of the fantasy culture by making them tradable fun nft games on on ethereum so that just makes screams product market fit to me yep absolutely guys a few other things going on in the bank list community so one is we just released our conversation with a former cftc commissioner so if you haven't caught that this is brian quintes he just resigned from his position as commissioner at the cftc so he gives us some candid thoughts some of his personal thoughts we just dropped that podcast uh yesterday so on monday so go check that out and in the future david we've got a big podcast coming out with kathy wood from arc investments we're recording that this friday you'll get to hear it next monday i am super stoked about that conversation chris berninski's gonna be there too i don't think every anyone's ever done a chris berninski plus kathy wood combo but bankless is about to do it right yeah no that that conversation i'm i just expect to blow people's brains and hopefully mine as well so looking forward to recording that later in the week also right on your podcast feed right now is the third episode of layer zero with none other than justin drake and i'm just gonna leave that there because the conversation is so odd enough that like justin drake justin drake what are you doing so like go listen to it right after you're done listening to this don't work don't play don't talk to your partner just listen to bankless that's what we do right all right guys we are going to get to the guests in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at f app.balancer.fi bagless nation we are super excited to have the arbitrary team back on bank list post launch they said they were going to launch in summer of 2021 and launch they did it is still summer 2021 guys uh uh stephen harry congrats on the launch thanks so much for joining us thank you thank you so much for having us here yeah we told you d5 summer and you know it's we got it it's still summer so we got in there it's still summer so how are you guys feeling like post launch i mean uh what's i it was launch week as we're recording this and launches don't always go well how did this one go shockingly well the the the biggest barrier to launch and this is like a funny insider story is we were planning on actually opening to users a couple hours earlier and then amazon had a significant outage and there were a few of our things running like there were a few like our like block explorer was like running our indexer was running on there and that went down and we were like oh my god like we need to solve this now we're like should we just launch anyway and then we're like well he didn't tell you when 3pm so no we'll just [Laughter] you know do you know i wasn't sure like so yeah at what point in time did you guys commit to launching in august um in early august is that when you committed there was some commitment i saw on the arbitration twitter and i was like biting my nails i was like oh okay it's getting toward the end of august are they going to be able to do it you know it's august 30th no launch are they going to be able to do it but you guys pulled it in it pulled it out of the hat man you just launched right at the last day and got this thing out there yeah it was early august that we committed to uh to doing that and it was clear to us that that we would get there and um yeah ultimately uh you know we we we chose them the last day of august but we were you know we were somewhat clear about that i think we said in the post late august and ed gave a talk at uh uh smart con that day and said you should assume august 31st unless you uh unless you say it earlier so uh we tried to uh at least set the expectations right there but then uh uh it's also on a tuesday and you know we've previously done launches on a friday and then like you know you going to the weekends alright let's do it on a tuesday this time in case you know in case there's uh some delays we're not like stealing people's weekends so um uh yeah so things went fabulously smoothly uh and so far so good um you know usage has been uh going up um a lot of value has been uh coming into the system and i think overall uh the user sentiment uh from what we can tell has been pretty good so we're super excited uh this is the beginning not the end right so there's there's a lot more goodies to come but uh you know this was definitely uh a very important uh milestone for us just so we can uh let's just go ahead hey i was just saying the user feedback has just been it's been so much fun like reading about people having like good experiences using it like you know just like you know it was so easy to use because people are definitely still at the stage of being shocked about that which is pretty funny given that that's been like our like core focus but to see that you know we actually pulled it off it's it's pretty great i'm sorry we should say that we have a new bridge ui coming next week that's the one complaint we got that our our bridge kind of looks like it's from 1995. um i could confirm that it's not from 1995 um but it's okay though i mean people have used curve have you guys seen the curve oh yeah interface i mean i don't know what decade that's from maybe the 1980s but um yeah we're used to these things in in d5 and uh as long as it works yeah i think people have been very we have only gotten positive feedback on things working and ultimately that's what we're trying to do give users uh fast uh fast transactions uh cost savings and um really try to import the ecosystem so excited that people are using it and building on it so we have a ton of questions that we want to get through kind of a grab bag of just a bunch of different topics but before we get there i want to just ground our listener with some context uh so can we talk about the you know the the leading weeks and months that have come up to the actual launch what was the roll-up rollout plan like what have you guys been doing in the last few months to really prepare for this launch date yeah great question so um part of it was like social community and part of it was technical of course um and diligence so um you know there was a lot going into getting ready to do our our our there was a lot getting into going into getting ready to see our mainnet developer um our main developer launch in may and a lot of you know getting the tech ready um and making sure i was at a point of stability that we were ready for that then there was a lot of community organization and just giving people time you know we committed to a fair launch in which uh different teams would have enough time to to launch because the thing about defy and you know you know smart contracts in general but specifically e5 is it's all about the composability and the interaction and uh having a system where sort of uh one app goes live at a time is it's it's not that useful um it's problematic because so many apps have dependencies in others we really wanted to give you know everyone the ability to to set up as much as they could beforehand and of course we can't wait for everyone but we tried to do that and then uh you know we did you know uh some internal auditing some external auditing during during this time uh really to get you know more diligence uh and confidence and did some additional feature requests we tried to you know limit new features coming in but there's always some future creep and like oh we got we just got to do that before before we go out the door so um a bunch of that for sure but definitely so it's part technical part uh social coordination and just giving people the ability to to launch and really trying to be fair and putting everyone in the same footing so we all know these systems build themselves from the bottom up right and so we need we need that initial like bootstrapping flywheel phase to get launched and i think you all the users are like biting at the trump or trump excuse me chomping at the bit to get into arbitrarium but uh of course uh the things actually had to be there so you guys needed to have some sort of like you know quiet period to allow the developers to get this you know the arbitrary native d5 flywheel going um so when it comes to actually launching well on a technical level what does that mean when we are like cutting the tape for the arbitrary theme park what is actually like different in the code that allows this to be launched what is the launch yeah i mean it was basically well it was two buttons what colors were they a big red big red button a big green one um because you know essentially the only the only difference in our system kind of over the past two months basically has been has been the white list and we put in place basically that kind of had developer teams coming in and so kind of we had we had had the you know the you know it was really removing a feature was all we needed was it was the launch process since it was we started without a whitelist because we had our test net and we put this in place for mainnet so that we could kind of move a little slowly as as kind of stephen was describing get sort of you know get get uh get dapps onboarded and kind of like help teams understand what they were doing and then we just had to cut that back out so i understand guys there's um some training wheels right now on the system as well like some governors um what sort of governors are on the system currently and uh and why are they there yeah so um right now there is a uh a limit on the max transaction capacity in the system that's uh one uh one one main limitation the main limitation that we have and uh the reason for that is um uh really to uh just um make sure the system stabilizes and and watch it before and watch it stabilize before sort of um you know we really really up usage and give us also some time to continue to improve and you know we just reduce uh you know improve performance and and uh as time goes on but the those uh constraints were designed such that based on our uh our projections of usage uh no one will hit and indeed we're nowhere or we're maybe 50 x away from there so we have in the capacity we're seeing today um so we we have significant capacity uh until those uh any of those constraints are hit they're just sort of an upper bound to stop some bot from trying to do something that uh um you know a bit too crazy right now but uh average usage i think won't go um anywhere uh near there but you know the thing that we've committed to is and the other part of this is we still do maintain upgradability controls in the system and indeed you know there are two scenarios in which we use them one which we plan to one which we don't plan to uh the first one is to uh increase uh performance over time and increase scaling over time we'll have at least some alpha here we'll have an update going going live quite soon that will reduce feed costs uh uh um um you know so you know we do a nice uh few costs and fee reductions so that that's the type of upgrade we plan on doing and then there's a type of upgrade which we don't plan on doing uh which would be to respond to any security incident but of course we feel like we we need to have that upgradability in place for the time being uh until the system fully um um gets um more more uh you know running under a runway under its belt and um yeah basically um but we try to be very very open and honest about that and so the two things is we call our arbitrary now and mainnet beta phase and we're committed to only it will stay in beta until those until the system is fully decentralized um so that's uh commitment number one from us and you know we we want everyone to know exactly the state of the system we think it's uh really really at a great place but ultimately the goal is full decentralization uh for sure and uh we will uh commit that to you to uh calling it a beta until we're there and we're confident that we'll uh get there over the coming months so stephen i want to give people a sense for what it's like to kind of enter the uh the arbitrary uh theme park right and so they're they're in the mainnet ethereum theme park right now and now there's this this sub theme park called arbitrum that has just you know cut the tape and so users can enter and they enter through this token bridge and you basically enter uh by moving some of your assets from ethereum mainnet to arbitrum and you do it primarily through this bridge now we talked about in our past conversation there will be all sorts of other bridges in the future all sorts of other ways to get into the theme park but this is the main bridge maybe the most decentralized bridge um to and from ethereum so you transfer your eth or you transfer your erc20 and then once you're on the other side basically you in metamask or something you just switch around your network so rather than mainnet you switch your metamask wallet or your browser wallet to uh read from the arbor drum mainnet and in this new theme park we've got like many of the same rides i was scrolling through this earlier uh and i mean these are all of our friends our d5 friends right we've got uniswap sushi swap balancer they are all deployed there i think many more are coming um ave i'm not sure if they're deployed there but i'm looking forward to when they are except in this theme park with all of these similar friends um everything's cheaper right so used to cost eighty dollars to use the uta swap ride and in arbitrary how much does it cost maybe like ten dollars or something now five dollars something like that um can you give us a sense for what the the typical user experiences on the other side in terms of like fee savings and the rides that are available to them yeah i mean i think right now things are running at around yeah ten percent of the cost of ethereum roughly speaking um i think that we're working on some optimizations in the pipeline that will get that down even more but obviously that that's still a pretty nice improvement over using ethereum uh using the base layer today so we wanted to sort of you know not not hold things up um just to make things more perfect um in terms of applications it's there's a lot live already there's a lot more coming um no matter and there's a lot of awesome teams working on this no matter how there's always like you know some last minute things that need to be done so we were hoping that that as many as possible people would be live you know when we went live there are a lot of people who are going to be coming you know who are going to be coming live over the next week or two um as they kind of finish up their development process and and uh and fully ship i'd say in terms of users the most sort of you know the the the prices being cheaper are huge but the other thing that's just so massive is is the faster confirmation time it is just that feeling of being able to click a button and getting the results of your transaction kind of within seconds as opposed to sort of what people are used to used to on on main net which is massively better with 1559 but but still takes some time and so that that's the other kind of big angle there one question i have is um i like to parse apart the differences between the ethereum gas markets of which we're all used to we generally all know things uh utilities like gas now or going into ether scan and seeing like that like loading bar which is an estimation and you know we we're all used to seeing gas right we're all generally familiar with the gas markets on ethereum and how that impacts gas price can you guys compare and contrast like gas markets on arbitrary and how they might be the same or different with how people are used to transacting on ethereum and like for example like how does the actual ten dollars for a unit swap transfer how does that number actually emerge like how is that number decided yeah absolutely so so most of the you know the the costs are split up kind of in using the system into a variety of different categories but actually right most of the costs are actually the costs that are being paid in ethereum fees as a roll-up every trans every arbitrary transaction gets posted to ethereum um it's kind of only the data of the transaction of course not not the execution but we are paying you know and i i don't i'm not going to remember the exact number but i think our our sequencer has has uh spent like 23 eth already and gas fees on on l1 um does it make a transaction every single ethereum block or how does that uh happen yeah so so it batches things up so it will collect some number of arbitrary transactions and currently kind of once every once every six minutes ish um it'll post onto it it'll post kind of a whole batch of transactions onto ethereum um and and you know there's kind of there's an interesting kind of factor here which is sort of the the security model and i like to be really clear on this until it's posted to ethereum you're still to some degree trusting the sequencer but then six minutes later um or or well within six minutes because it's posting you know whenever the next one is now you're at basically full of theory and security um and the upside of that is you get super fast confirmations and know exactly what the result of your transaction will be almost immediately do you kind of see that in the user interface uh when you're making transactions like the uh like the you know state of a confirmation and how secure it is and how it evolves so we're still working on on kind of on on figuring out a way that we can display that there's a problem which is basically right now all of our effort has gone to sort of how do we make arbitrary fit into existing ethereum tooling we haven't had the like the the pull to you know let's say have have meta masks change its its ui to to reflect these things um which we you know i think you know the hope is definitely that you know we'll we will you know get there sooner rather than later um so for now it's relatively hard and we try to communicate it and write about it and for your average user who's transacting in small value it doesn't really matter um for kind of you know for for people like um liquidity providers and and for people like you know especially for a number of teams we're working on who are going to be providing these fast bridges for moving liquidity back and forth those are the teams that we've kind of like talked through a lot kind of these various sort of security model questions since they're the ones especially who kind of would take who will kind of be most kind of deep into that and you know take a lot of the the risk on and make decisions about what they want to do there do you know a big picture so harry you said um arbitrary so far is maybe burnt like you know or um 25 eth or so um and like i i wonder how long it will be i'm showing the ultrasound.money leader board the ethburn leaderboard i wonder how long it'll be and until most of these um leaderboard candidates are actually layer twos right i mean because this is what we're talking about this is the the scalability roadmap for not just arbitrary but all of ethereum you might like start your entire life as a user on a layer two and live there the entire time uh but you know settle ultimately on top of ethereum main net i'm curious what you guys think how long do you think that'll be before uh some layer two maybe armstrong starts to rise up the charts in this burn leader board that's a great question i i would i would say definitely before the end of the year wow wow in the all-time leaderboard well i mean this is this is um this is 24 hours here all right 24 hours okay they could do a 24-hour leaderboard okay so it's not good give us some time to catch up [Laughter] catch up to the nfts they're going pretty fast i think within a 24-hour period of time there will be l2s who are by far the the biggest gas guzzlers um particularly as like a bunch of you know the nft action migrates on to onto layer twos as you know i think a lot of people are are excited for oh yeah interesting all of these apps that we see burning a lot of ether they probably have the incentives to move on to layer twos the most which would just like you know take all of their eat burning a reduce it by putting it on an l2 but then also have it under the l2 umbrella of eath burning oh that that's interesting absolutely and like you know just just like you know quick quick glance a number of those you know a number of those burners are already uh launched on uh on arbitrary and then we'll have to have like the second level leaderboards like okay so arbor was burning all this ethan who's actually responsible for running all this ethan arbitrams then you might see a leaderboard that looks interesting again yeah we're definitely going to have nested leaderboards here i want to go back and finish the conversation about how gas fees are actually determined on on arbitrary we on ethereum is just a function of like how much blocks based demand how is in you know obviously more demand makes you know the gas fees go up how it is does that work one-to-one with arbitrary any other details that we need to talk about yeah sorry i guess we ended up getting a little off topic in the yeah it was all good it was all good um yeah so basically kind of i started by saying kind of the the mean component right now is l1 costs because basically the system is not congested there's pretty there's plenty of capacity in l2 we're nowhere near sort of the limit of how much the l2 can do but there's always going to be this sort of base cost that isn't you know even if one person is using the system that you're you're still that person is going to have to pay for their costs in layer one the thing that could happen and you know will will happen at some point um as it does on every chain um but certainly we're nowhere close to yet is is congestion in layer two is the kind of the actual l2 capacity um hitting its limit um and at that point basically there will be sort of similar to um similar to ethereum and we took a lot of inspiration from from 1559 um a gas market um that kind of where we're kind of it will you know the the people who are you know the people who who value the block space most will be the ones who uh who get it um which you know we'd love to have room for everybody we hope we can stay ahead of the curve in terms of expanding our capacity but if if we don't um that that's what will happen so when you guys uh deploy a transaction to the ethereum main chain every six minutes sometimes the ethereum main chain is extremely congested so that actually turns could turn into a an expensive operation to deploy those transactions every six minutes uh how are those fees paid and how are the size of ethereum l1 fees uh related to the users who are paying gas fees on arbitration are those two things connected yeah a little indirectly but yes i should say there's a caveat to my every six minutes thing which is if the sequencer c the sequencer is smart enough that if it sees a spike in gas prices it will wait a little longer to post its next batch to see if the price goes down which we added in after we ended up paying for some very expensive batches so and eip1559 helps with that right are you guys like actually tapping into eip1559 as a gas oracle um yeah we we're absolutely using it we're going to be using it more um for kind of to improve the l2 gas oracle we're already using it for the sequencer itself um but it it's helped and if you look at the graph it helps a lot but we we still had a day where the where the base fee was at like 2 000 way for a little bit there so it's massively smoothed it out but it's still kind of bumpy okay okay there are so many things to talk about and like we're going down all these little micro rabbit holes all at once but but uh let's go back to the question of how does a gas fee for an l1 deployment connect to a user paid fee for just a normal uniswap transaction on arbitrarium absolutely so so kind of the general the general idea is there's kind of these various components and kind of there's a view that the arbitrary chain has of the ethereum gas price that it sort of you know tries to regularly update and then it uses that when evaluating the costs so it's not sort of exactly one-to-one um we see come in essentially for example how much call data was your transaction from that we can infer how much did the sequencer have to pay to post your transaction in terms of the call data um and from that um we can then kind of figure out how much we we should charge you there's a kind of an interesting little and i'll go down you know this is this is a bit of a nerdy technical digression but it's kind of interesting um we can't actually use the price the gas price on the chain when the sequencer batch is posted in order to charge you um that doesn't work and there's a very simple reason for that actually which is that see you're getting your finality very quickly we have to be able to tell you exactly how much your transaction costs within seconds but it's not going to actually be posted for for minutes and so we have to essentially make our kind of best approximation guess as to how much it'll cost you um and then sort of apply it um when you actually make the transaction and the way we kind of deal with that is we basically cost average a little bit and so we have it set up so that on average kind of the cost will be fully paid you might pay a little more a little less than the sequencer did when it posted your transaction but on average you'll you'll be kind of better off because it'll sort of regulate how much you might need to pay and this is all made relatively much easier in the fact that you guys use ether to pay for gas on arbitrarum and then also ether is needed to pay for gas on ethereum so that efficiency is there oh absolutely yeah i mean essentially so you're you're and we're collecting fees in l2 we're not collecting fees in l1 right um so the fee the portion of the the fees you pay when you make an arbitrary transaction are kind of split up and only a portion of them goes to the sequencer that that's kind of to pay for the sequencers costs those kind of accumulate to the sequencer in layer two and you know as kind of you know and will show up as you know liquidity in the system essentially um and then this and then kind of our plan there although we haven't actually done it for the first time yet but our plan there is then basically to automate the sequencer basically withdrawing periodically so once a day it withdraws all the fees that it's collected in l2 back to l1 and then a week later it will be able to sort of roll that into the funds it uses to uh to pay for hosting users transactions okay just a few more questions on this thread um when so when the arbitron l2 makes a transaction to ethereum it costs money uh when there are more users on arbitrum and there are more people to spread that l1 transaction cost across does that actually reduce the cost per on a per user basis if there are more users yeah so there's kind of there's there's flat there's there's fixed costs and there's variable costs right so the call data of your transaction is is a fixed cost so that you know there's some number of bytes of data that are kind of that describe your transaction that's fixed there's also kind of sorry that's that's that's kind of very that's based on your transaction there are also other costs which are kind of flat per batch and fairly significant costs um and so we have kind of this extra and basically the way we're handling that is that that's divided over kind of all of the users who have transactions in their batch and that's just overhead so the more users we have the more we can just sort of divide that over the users until it becomes completely negligible so there'll be some savings there is sort of this whole component which kind of won't be reduced because it is just you specifically but it will definitely go down so we're keeping going keeping on in this whole gas mark is conversation where can you guys uh i i like to think of things visually so i'm thinking of a loading bar with like optim or excuse me arbitrum somewhere on this the you know full saturation of the maximum capacity that it could ever have where is it on that spectrum from on a zero to 100 level like where is it when in terms of like its actual uh ceiling of a throughput is that like 20 maximum capacity 40 maximum capacity i know you guys have it throttled at the very genesis like is that is that even the right frame of mind and where is it yeah wait so so just sorry just to clarify there's like there's there's three numbers here there's like how much how much we're actually getting right now what the limit is right now or and what like the theoretical max limit is which of those were you uh all of them i want all of them yeah i also want all of them yeah yeah so i think you know so in terms of you know the the you know to start with you know the the actual theoretical limit we don't even know we know what like our we know where our current version of our software maxes out and it maxes out around i think um i think we could we could theoretically if we wanted to if we were not really too concerned about state float um run probably with about 10x the capacity with the software today and that's without sort of a whole bunch of pipelines of optimizations that we have planned over the next couple of months that will that will significantly improve there 10x the capacity what's that in reference to yeah so so that's like our arbitrary doesn't use it has kind of its own type of gas um that we call arm gas just to distinguish it between from regular ethereum gas and it's a different metric yeah um similar idea but yeah um and so that's kind of the main thing that we think about in terms of kind of scaling um and that kind of you know encompasses you know the computation and the state uh costs and kind of the way we have it configured right now because we wanted to be relatively conservative is to target handling about an ethereum's worth of traffic so right now harry it's about an ethereum's worth of traffic and you're saying maybe the the maximum is about 10x that so it'd be 10x uh current day ethereum's traffic and that's on the that's in terms of kind of you know so there's a lot of you know that 10x would be kind of there's there's a lot of considerations here there's like how expensive and hard do we want to make it to run a node the more we increase that limit the harder it is to run a node and there's sort of a you know an open discussion here and a set of trade-offs as to you know on one extreme side you have ethereum where it's like you know we should be able to run on raspberry pi's on the other side and i wish i had a better example than this but i'll just use this example on the other side we have eos with the you know 21 master nodes and data centers um we're targeting you know somewhere in between those two i think more on the ethereum side than the eos side um but there's but that's kind of you know where where one chunk of wiggle room is and the other chunk is just i think there's a massive amount of sort of optimizing we have planned and that that chunk by the way is sort of the 10x that's the 10x like if we wanted to become eos we could do 10x today um we don't want that the other side is basically optimizations this is our initial we've been this is our there's so many different things we want we we have on our list of to-do's that will decrease that will increase capacity and decrease costs and we've had to aggressively slash the to-do list in order to ship something which i think is an important lesson for anybody trying to ship you can't have everything um and i think you know one of the one you know one of the kind of ways we're going to be able to take advantage of the fact that we're kind of in the short term retaining this upgradability um is in being able to kind of provide these improvements oh and i should just say on the just to finish out the rest of that question in terms of actual capacity i think right now i think we peaked at around five percent um and that was kind of at the peak when it was kind of everybody jumping in um so you know even with with kind of the targeted one ethereum worth of capacity right now i think that we have kind of a pretty good amount of headroom um before kind of users need to think about congestion one last question on capacity right this is all for arbitrary one yes which is one of possibly many different arbitrariums we talked about this in our in our june conversation that in the future there might not just be arbitrarium like there'll be arbitrary ii and arbitrary iii and all of these different arbitrary universes is that for every universe another potentially 10x if you decided to to grow like eos um or uh are we talking or am i not speaking like am i not phrasing that correctly so you so you i think you're you're phrasing exactly right and the thing is so there are two different things at play here there's the question of there's one way to think about this is imagine that like the entire ethereum all it was doing was like supporting arbitrary traffic like that everything was on l2 and all like the ethereum's entire capacity was was like our rooftop traffic so then what could we get and well then then there are two so the constraints that harry gave you is what we're comfortable running in a single in a single roll-up what we you know performance-wise sync-wise because even if you could do like tens of thousands of transactions per second uh you wouldn't want those in one roll up because then the you know the the cost of running the infrastructure that in the city the state growth would be uh unmanageable but um when you so you could use you know these so the ethereum traffic you wouldn't use it all for one roll-up but you could have multiple deploy deployments of roll-ups each which get the security of ethereum because they know they're roll-ups and they put poster data on ethereum and each one of them has this level of capacity independently so there is some fixed band fixed limit based on you know the amount of data you can post to ethereum but like even this 10x number is nowhere near that so we have like uh you know way way way you know a ton of room to run uh multiple rollups and indeed we're seeing like the first instance of this right now it's on testnet but reddit's running an arbitrary roll up on testnet and that's gonna be a completely separate um completely separate rollup right and these two things they'll each have the same capacity and they'll just be completely separate and both and you can do a third and the fourth and the fifth two if you wanted to they won't compose with each other but they'll they'll all be roll ups and compose with everything in their in their in their ecosystem stephen since you brought it up i gotta ask right now any spoilers you can give us with what reddit's up to because they they posted that they were selecting arbitram which was absolutely huge news they did so because um they they said they wanted a decentralized and open solution which like bravo reddit for actually like figuring this out any hints you can give us on what those guys are up to so uh you know i think we've been working them for a long time and they have a really really fantastic team like an incredible team and um i think they have a lot you know a lot of really good things to come and i know they're just starting on test net and they're uh and they have i think some really good plans coming but i don't want to uh i don't want to um the truth is you know on the one hand like we coordinate them technically um and i don't definitely don't know all their plans and what they're planning on doing on their roll-up chain and um i know i think um um i don't want to speak for them uh unfortunately on that but i would say that you know we're very excited to work with them and you know we we're coordinating closely with them and they're really a fantastic team and i think we'll see excellent things uh come out of that team because number one they have like a world-class team and number two like they get it right yeah this is reddit but they get that they want to be an ethereum they want to use a roll-up and you know they understand the trade-offs and and they they uh um they're really just a really really uh incredibly impressive team well i think the entire community is excited so you got to tell them to stop by bankless uh and tell us more about it sometime i'll let them know one one last question on the the dynamics of the scalability side of of arbitrary and then we can go on to other subjects um say say in a maximally successful version of an arbitrary rollup uh there's you guys are hitting the max capacity on the block space the fee market emerges fees start to get collected on the layer two and there's a lot of economic energy could in theory you increase the frequency that you deploy a transaction to ethereum maybe you go from six minutes down to three minutes is this a parameter that can be adjusted and what are the what are the properties that would um be make that a rational choice to tinker with that number absolutely i mean and you know again to get like to get you know to throw this like slightly technical the sequencer has a target for for how much gas it'll it'll spend per batch and currently you know if it doesn't hit that target after six minutes or it might be seven minutes it posts a batch because it doesn't want to keep you know it doesn't want to kind of keep it in this sort of less than fully secure state for for very long if it hits that target sooner it'll just post its batch you know immediately so we could we could easily get into the point where you know i think as usage picks up you know it'll start to be you know it'll be every three minutes then every two minutes you know at some point we're gonna get down to every block or every other block potentially and we could do every block now but then you'd have the opposite part of this problem because there's not that much usage right now it's the few transactions in that block would pay the entire overheads and that's that's the the needle you want to thread here that's why uh we're doing this six minute thing now because it gets you know enough transactions at current volume to uh make the overhead uh you know relatively low and not uh you know you don't pay most of them in your transaction because remember we're posting data to ethereum and there's a minimal we have we have significant overhead uh on on the batch side but even if you just think about like the 21 000 gas and minimal you know ethereum um you know base uh you know the ethereum minimum um like if there was only one transaction we were posting every block then your transaction would now have an overhead of that of that price so obviously users don't want that so we think six minutes it still gives you um you know a a pretty quick finality but that will only go down over time as as the transaction volumes increase and there's more users available immediately to advertise the batch costs gemini is the

ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com so guys you have shipped something really cool folks can use it more apps will be deployed on it over time there's about 25 million in liquidity we're recording this a little bit early folks you guys will see this too a little over 50 now uh okay so over 50 now which is super awesome and impressive so it's growing very fast um let's have this conversation because i i want to be real with you guys for a minute right so um bank list has a dog in this fight um here we go here's what i mean okay we want layer two uh to win right because we want the most bankless most decentralized financial system to win right it's we do not want binance chain to take all the quote unquote defy from the ecosystem i know you guys don't want to you know disparage uh binance chain or anybody else that those aren't your words there are words like legitimately we want layer two to win we want the ethereum ecosystem to thrive we think decentralization matters the ability to run your own node in ethereum is important but here's the problem um ethereum is kind of a victim of its own success right so particularly in bull markets no one complains about this during bear markets but in bull markets we're in an nft mania you know gas fees you know 200 grey 300 gray it's expensive to do things on ethereum because everyone wants to do it at the exact same time okay so now we have layer two that has been long long promised and now it's actually here you guys have built it you guys have shipped it we've got real apps that's awesome now we wanna have a conversation about um how layer two wins how specifically arbitram wins against the the more high throughput um centralized values compromised values compromised we would say eath killers that are out there right and so like nothing against them this is not a um this is not a fixed pie i think their success will also breed ethereum's success will also breed layer two success so i don't wanna couch this as like a a um you know fixed pie kind of zero-sum game because it's not everybody does end up winning but what we hope wins is decentralized values and i think layer two represents that you guys have taken the time it's freaking hard i mean how long you guys been working on this six years something like that it's hard to get to where you you've gotten today but now we're here now i want to have a conversation about how arbitrary wins how layer two wins and here's what you guys need so let's talk about liquidity first all right so um all of these other layer one chains right now they have these massive liquidity programs going on okay so they are paying users to come to their theme park right it's very easy right like here's our theme park we've got these rides and everyone who enters gets 20 bucks right okay that's going to attract crowds all right so we've got maybe that problem first how does arbitrum attract the liquidity that it needs it doesn't have a liquidity incentivization program now i don't know if it will in the future i don't know if you can comment on that but let's let's uh dice apart this liquidity question first uh stephen what do you think so i remember when i came on last time i told you well i don't want to say any specifics but i know that there are some application layer teams that are planning on doing liquidity mining and a bunch of those have actually gone live already i know uh sushi swap's doing liquidity mining on arbitrom i know dodo is doing a big video mining program i think swapper is doing one and there are probably more those are the ones at least that i that i'm aware of over the past few days and there are more to come than i'm aware of as well so um i think um the application level level liquidity programs are important that's what we have on ethereum as well um you know different projects one liquidity mining on ethereum of course um and so i do think we can compete there um uh for sure we've seen liquid liquidity you know pour into the system and we know that there's a lot more of these programs to come um and um and you know we i think we're actually very very happy with the trajectory of liquidity coming into the system it's been super fast and um but like you know um you know we want it to happen gradually so uh um it's gradually you know i guess uh you know 50 million dollars in in three days is is is fast enough for us right now and i think it will ramp up over time particularly uh with these programs and and uh in terms of like the more general though um the values i think are what are what are important and that's why we're doing this you know we could have just not done this and cloned ethereum and just changed a few parameters and boom you have you know hey we can call aws a blockchain if you wanted to and you have a really big but uh that's not what we believe in and i think ultimately the values the values will win but i think it also has to do with the thought leadership a lot a lot right because it's a user coming coming in that doesn't have a background like this is day one for them in crypto they don't really understand the difference and they do what they do understand those fees right so they see i'm paying a low fee here a high fee here and they don't understand the fees but the people that like are actually building this vision uh and or have been encrypted a little longer so the the you know the project leaders and and the builders most of them i do understand this and you know the thing we know about ethereum is that the community is stronger than any we've been a part of uh ever in any you know but it's it's uh super super strong the ethereum community and um yeah definitely the you know the strongest community in crypto i'm probably gonna upset a lot of people by saying that uh the bitcoin maxis uh that watch i guess sir um but you know we think it's an incredibly uh strong strong community and uh the values really really shine through and it's a philosophical movement and uh ultimately though there have to be the thought leaders that that not like our dictators on these values but but kind of are in the sense that they they won't compromise and won't go to other places and and number two is a really education explaining what these values are what we're doing here and what the risks are and hey if we if we you know uh call aws a blockchain we're back to where we started and we haven't really accomplished anything so i think that that's going and and the good thing is that there are so many people that have these values and it's such a strong community and and we see those playing out and that's what we're playing into but but ultimately i think you know uh the thought leaders have a very very uh important uh educational mission here and but the liquidity i think you know the incentives uh on our return i think we'll uh have already we've already seen some and they'll continue to compete with with uh i think other other chains and um again we've just been impressed by the by the adoption that we've seen just in you know we're only three days old and it's been pretty you know what people tell me sort of the skeptics tell us is like um users don't care about decentralization right and um like i i wonder your take on that and that may that may be true for a subset of users or even for for many users right they do definitely care about gas views and i understand that but um i also think there are different classes of users when people say users who are they talking about right so reddit is a user for example and that's why it was so fantastic to see reddit make the choice that it did but also state the reasons it did if people haven't seen that reddit post we'll we'll include a link in the show notes so you can uh look at why they selected arbitrum and it was decentralization it was decentralized values so i'm curious uh your take on this the noise of liquidity right anyone can incent i guess liquidity by like pushing a token out there and uh giving people free money and then you know traffic will will come but are are you seeing that builders that class of users are preferring decentralization is that a thesis that's going to to hold true or do you think reddit is kind of a one-off um yeah what do you think stephen i i think it holds true i think uh not to name other chains but you mentioned one a lot of the projects that we see are on other chains are more derivative of what happens on ethereum a lot of the the users that are builders and are really um you know the innovative a lot most of the innovation that we see happens it happens on ethereum and and that's important because you really want that you want the the innovators product because often you know we've seen this so so many times someone copies something and oh they didn't get that critical fix and it's buggy and dangerous to use because um they missed something uh kind of important so um i do think yeah though that that class of users uh is absolutely on ethereum and basically almost exclusively on ethereum and the other way i like to frame this whole thing and this is something i've been saying for a long time the way i view our retrieve is basically a common denominator so there are those users that care about security and you know we're among those in decentralization and there are those users that care about costs and you can you know arbitrarily is a place you know in my opinion where all those users can come together and say uh we're not you know we don't have the cost of bsc right we're not we're not or uh or whatever uh we don't have you know the cost of a side chain but it's much much lower than ethereum is affordable and the cost will go down over time that's number one but we do maintain that you know the security derived from ethereum so it's a common denominator and why is a common denominator important why do i care where you go why do i care to be in the same place and that's because the magic in this ecosystem the magic and b5 is really about composability and we're much much much better off if the if there's uh you know concentrated liquidity and the defy apps are in one location so hey i might say you know i don't really care i can just run my own chain and i'll i'll i'll call that secure and that's good enough for me and the fees will be super cheap but i actually want to be with you also on the same chain so and you have users with different values and that's where the common denominator comes important we think you know we've hit a sweet spot where we can make those who are fee sensitive happy and make those who are uh security sensitive happy and also of course um um you know invite and be a part of the ethereum community as we do this one thing that i really enjoy about the ethereum community and stephen you touched on this is that the values of the alike technologies will attract a certain set of users right and these are the users that do care to run their own nodes and do care about decentralization yet the scale scaling that those values for the whole entire world is probably not going to happen people want to not experience ethereum and have ethereum and all of us l2s be in the background and so for those people in my mind they are going to respond to incentives and you talked about the liquidity mining incentives of all of the apps on on arbitrom and that's that's going to work out decently well um but we are going up against uh avalanche which has a 180 million dollar war chest for liquidity mining incentives and then phantom just rolled out a 300 million dollar war chest for the same sort of incentives right and you know we all know people will respond to incentives this is david naming names not you guys by the way david's naming names here these are just facts these these these are war chests that they have to incentivize users right and they have these war chests because they have their own native token which establishes their own treasury so my question to you guys is like are you guys going to have like a native token to establish some sort of treasury to do some yield farming like is this what about all these yield farming uh opportunities that we have on l2s is this something that you guys have in your roadmap so right now what we've launched is we've launched with with fees but what i can say is um the fee revenue is such that um you know paid an east of course but it's such that um it's designed not only to uh you know reimburse us and and keep the company going but also uh also enough to um you know share with validators that we've discussed very openly and we have some good validators coming on board that will be getting fp revenue and i personally think that if you know if if the fee revenue grows to a point um uh where i think it's going to grow that that uh we'll have uh um significant uh war chest as well to to uh you know share with people in the ecosystem so i don't know exactly um you know obviously you know we we focus very very much on the tech and that's where we started right now we put out a product uh and we're happy with the adoption of but and you know we have to watch the watch watch watch how these fees collect over time but one thing which i can tell you which we don't plan to do is we don't plan to um just say all right you know this is our fee revenue we plan on on reinvesting that in the ecosystem and our projections are that um you know over time um this will be significant and it will give it will give us an edge so i don't know um you know we haven't committed to any exact mechanism or exact process of how that's going to work but i think we're very very sensitive to it for sure and um but ultimately arbitrary is a community project and when we say it's fully decentralized we mean that um you know that you know that's not to say that we obviously don't benefit from it and we won't be um but we won't be taking free revenue from it but it won't be exclusively less by any chance at any point and we will i think have significant resources to reinvest the ecosystem i think resources you know as significant as some of those numbers that you that you mentioned or more so um right now we're not really feeling the pressure to do that only because liquidity is flowing in there's a lot of excitement people are sort of you know uh checking out the theme park walking around uh looking at the rides uh going on them but but you know there may come a point and where where um where you like you said incentives talk to people and i think we will have uh um a good way you know we're thinking a lot about that right now and um and um i don't think that we'll be left in the cold uh yeah i think it's already impressive like just a a few days in you're already over you know 50 million in liquidity so i mean the liquidity may flow without incentives you know i guess uh if you have the right product then you shouldn't need to pay people to uh to use your theme park um although it does help sometimes you got like an ecosystem fund these are all that where there were there were you know so there are many mechanics of how you can um distribute some of them go to the obviously there's a difference whether it goes to developers the end users there are a lot of internal things which we're which we're considering and basically you know the bottom line is one thing which is how do we reinvest in in our community um you know given the the way the system is set up how do we reinvest resources in our return and in our virgin community in our orbiting community because ultimately that's our goal let me ask another related question just still on the topic of you know how does layer 2 win um and this is a question with respect to composability okay so i think if you're a high throughput chain that makes some decentralization sacrifices namely um you don't provide the ability for a regular user to run a a node that's not validating um or that's not like val validating blocks then you can have higher throughput in your you know like your your single chain instance uh and maybe there's less a need for of for composability right so if you could do a you know 10x or 100x inside of your main chain without you know by sacrificing decentralization and you can provide composability right that that's what's competing against ethereum and all of these layer twos which kind of fracture some of the liquidity so if i go bridge from mainnet to ethereum right now i have access to uniswap in the arbitrary theme park and i have access to sushi swap but um yeah i don't have all the trading pairs that i would on mainnet i have you know less liquidity so my slippage costs are going to be higher for that sort of trade um can you talk to us about that um is that going to be a in the armor do you think for layer twos and how does arbitrum and the other layer twos solve for this composability splintered liquidity type issue yeah it's a it's a great question um there's there's a lot of really awesome projects right now that are working on composability there's there's so many you know there's like i i keep learning about new ones like there's a few like you know the few that like i've seen for the longest are are um connects top and and seller um who've been working on kind of these sorts of problems for a long time and there's kind of more and more there's this like weird thing where the blockchain space is really weird because everybody got super used to composability to sort of synchronous composability and and started thinking that like that's like the only way to do things well but the entire rest of the web is asynchronous it's like a very foreign thing and there's there's all sorts of ways people have figured out to kind of build in these environments where where you can't just you know in one go interact with every single application with a sort of global lock so that nobody else can touch it while you are this is really sort of an area where there's sort of all sorts of kind of techniques and so a lot of sort of what's being built on the blockchain space in order to be able to handle these kind of multiple parallel chains is taking advantage of computer science concepts that have been around for for a long time kind of just generally dealing with asynchrony so i i'm pretty confident that kind of where it matters there are going to be sort of nice you know nice products in place that basically sort of are able to hide the the annoyances which are currently which are currently very visible to the degree that if a user doesn't want to sort of deeply care about what application a chain that the adapt that they're using is running on they won't really need to care um there'll be some like you know some increase in fees maybe you know as they you know a slight which will be relatively small just for the cost of liquidity but it will be sort of relatively in the background you guys happen to be in uh talks with any major exchanges about just uh getting assets off of exchanges straight on to the l2 can you update on that front yes so uh since we spoke last i think we've announced okx is doing that and also huobi uh we'll be doing that directly and we are in contact with a bunch of others uh as well but those are the only two that have uh publicly committed to do that already and um uh they haven't gone live just yet but i expect those to go live relatively soon and what about okay so everyone is uh participating in this nft mania going on right now so we all know open c is there are you guys talking with any nft platforms maybe openc themselves about uh putting their platform on to arbitrary yes we are in contact with uh different nft platforms and the thing about nfts um at least you know i'm curious your your thoughts at least the way i see it is if defy it's a lot about bridging the existing projects um and part of that is because the you know they use uh fungible assets so you can take assets and just bridge them in mass uh with nfts it's more about like um you know like no one's no one's taking crypto punks and say oh that's movies all over that's not the way these work they're not you know it's i can move my pump to to arbitrary if i want to but the project doesn't move in mass but i do think that um so it's really about new creators right and and we see this every day and really nfc now like every day there's another amazing project so it's about getting new creators onto arbitrary uh you know new artists and and issuing nfts and arbitration we're seeing uh some of that now uh we'll have uh i really just want to emphasize that point uh just to just to parse it out so we listeners don't skip over that what you're talking about is like great like people in theory can move their crypto punks over to arbitrarium but if you own a crypto punk like you might be okay with just paying the gas fees on the l1 right there's a decent chance that that's true there's cheaper nfts that are just maybe a price at an eth or lower but you're saying that like it actually just makes more sense for some of these newer nft products to just issue and deploy natively on arbitrary first so that you don't actually have to move each individual unit over there exactly i think that's you know for the platforms to come that's when it makes sense it's not to support the straggling uh punk or penguin or something whatever i moved over it's really to um support the native assets that live there and hey you know people might go over the bridges the other way too so there might be an asset that's native to arbor trim and someone moves it over to ethereum main that but i think really uh we'll see the communities there so whereas in d5 it's more about um existing projects uh you know existing uh well-known projects moving over i think in in nft it's more about watching uh the creativity and the art that happens on arbitrary and then the nft uh platforms i expect to to come once once there's a community of of nfts uh there just to double check on this when you uh you said issue nft's native to arbitrarium when you issue an nft on arbitrary it is also native to ethereum correct as in there is no like formal like ongoing link between the nft and arbitrom right like you can take it and deploy it and send it over to ethereum and then you know as sovereign as any other nft that was initially deployed to ethereum correct yeah so we have a bridge uh the bridging an arbor trim is is is um the bridging and arbitram is um gets inherent this is where we're talking earlier about there could be many bridges but the bridge that we talk about is the protocol there bridge that has the um the roll-up security property so um you can go back and forth on the bridge and uh it derives security and ethereum because because uh the bridge is secure this is kind of back to that you know um suburbs and city sort of metaphor right so like if you're starting out with your nft project you you know might start in the suburbs where things are cheaper right but when you really make it then maybe you move to manhattan maybe you move to to mainnet right so does this paint the picture of a world where um the highest value sort of assets and transactions might be on mainnet right but then we have like maybe lower value transactions on arbitrum and other layer twos and then maybe in kind of sidechain world you we have transactions that just don't really require much economic security at all is that kind of how you see this evolve with any asset whether it's an nft or whether it's you know d5 token crc 20 type assets did an interesting question i don't know i would really expect over time that kind of mainnet will be mostly settling ltu's that there won't really be sort of like a whole large economic ecosystem on mainnet sort of independently from kind of bridging from you know interchange bridging protocols and l2s i would expect that the more likely scenario to me is that like let's say we have no no plans for this right now but but thinking long term that there is an arbitrary chain that is just nft projects that like if you're gonna do an nft project chances are you deploy on the arbitrary chain there's another one which is kind of mostly defy most nfts are you know not high enough value that you're going to want to pull them into the defy ecosystem but the ones that are sort of relatively high value where maybe you want to like collateralize alone using your nft you might actually do this sort of transfer over to not not to move it back to main net but move it well first to main net and then back and then down to deposit it into the uh the d5 chain yeah interesting it's going to be very interesting to see how that evolves i guess the like one challenge is there there are so many nfts right now on mainnet right and so some of them won't be high value enough to even do anything with to to move or would you ever move a crypto punk from one chain to another is it's kind of a question and i'm talking quite long term here i'm not talking like you know next you know it you know this is more of essentially as as l2s increase fees on on main net are likely to increase essentially because what you could do on mainnet for your given transaction fee i can do 10 times as much if i'm on an l2 so i'm going to be willing to pay 10 times more than you are um in order to get the same utility which will kind of eventually sort of you know you know be a heavy incentive to migrate onto onto l2s as sort of the amount of you know usage of the entire ecosystem increases another i guess longer term question a little bit short to a medium term maybe is uh when layer two excuse me when eth2 fully arrives does that give arbitrarium any additional wins yeah absolutely we're really excited um i'd say we're not yet holding our breaths because i think it's still going to take a little while to really get sort of fully there but when it does it's going to be a huge benefit what what are the benefits yeah so so kind of and it's funny there's eth2 is in these phases there's phase zero which we already did i guess there's sort of an an extra half phase now with the merge which is exciting for a whole host of region reasons although maybe probably not directly useful to arbitrarium and then there's phase one which is data sharding where we have kind of this sharded blockchain and you can't yet do anything with those charts they just hold data except what do rollups need they need to be able to post data um and so these things are like almost you know are basically made for roll-ups um since they're not useful for 99 of what happens on ethereum other than for for kind of use other than four roll-ups and so once that occurs the l1 costs which is which are kind of by far the biggest component of arbitram today will most likely go way down um and at that point basically the only cos the cost in the system will be basically just sort of the standard blockchain costs of how much you know what's our gas limit you know how much congestion is there as opposed to worrying kind of about this other cost component being a major factor can you estimate is that going to cut like a theoretical arbitrary fees and like in half or maybe like uh cut it like maybe it's one tenth like what's the ballpark range that we're looking at so for the layer one part yeah i mean probably somewhere between 1 100th and 1 10th i would guess they're going to be you know 64. i think last i checked although they've moved this around a bit but i think last i checked it was going to be either 16 or 64 shards iterating on the design a bit there um each one with sort of a huge amount of data throughput compared to ethereum today and no one else other than rollups are going to be able to make use of this um until phase two and execution is added um and so it'll be sort of you know it's going to be a it's going to be a roll up world basically basically yeah and then all of the gas savings that you guys have just are passed on to the user right so now the users have to pay less fees exactly and the really cool part is users will just get that win uh that you know arbitron will you know and this is another kind of you know another you know short-term reason that maintaining upgradability is really important because when eth2 comes out we're going to want to be able to make sort of you know an alteration to the layer one system that will actually let us use this massively cheaper path and and then all the entire arbitrary ecosystem will just one day see all of their fees go way down that's amazing i don't i don't think people know that by the way not many people and how far i i know you guys aren't on the eth2 team so it's almost like unfair to ask but just ballpark what do you think is this like a year away is it more is it less i don't know i think i will try to guess i know it's good all i can say is yeah you know just echoing what harry says from from our perspective it can't come soon enough and people people miss that because like even like you know talking like investors they some people like have this thought like that that roll-ups are just a band-aid until these two comes and like it couldn't be anything like different like more different you look at vitalik uh he has this post about a rollup centric ethereum that's not like the role of centrifuge one that's a rollup centric ethereum like e2 for sure so uh yeah we we can't wait for it to come soon enough but i think our guess is as good as anyone else's before we get to that i mean i think the thing that personally i'm really excited about is the merge and the move away from proof-of-stake because one of one of the questions i sometimes get in in when i'm interviewing people who are not sort of too deeply in the space they're like oh so arbitrary doesn't have to use is you know is is really green then because it doesn't have to use proof of work and it's like not yet not exactly and then how do you explain how do you even have that conversation have you ever had tried to have that conversation you get into complaining yeah well i mean the great thing to say and the thing you know the thing that like you know as you know as sort of you know the ethereum community can can and does say is like we're not there yet but it's the plan it's always been the plan it's not easy so a huge amount of work has gone into it but you know proof of work has always been a stock gap measure until proof of stake was figured out and i think that you know is very satisfying because the thing people are really worried about is not like okay is it gonna still take you know some number of you know years or whatever i mean i don't think it is but like you know it's like is this like you know just like permanently like this or or is there kind of you know a you know a better system in the future which so clearly is so question to both of you as we come down to the close of this uh show uh what are you personally excited about to see get deployed on optimism or excuse me arbitrarium um stephen you want to check that first yeah um i'm just personally excited about really um it really the entire you know it's not one it's really it's really everything what i mean by that specifically is that there was a time if you had asked me a year ago i would have said you know the thing that i'm just terrifies me most about rollups getting adoption is that you can't do this one app at a time it just doesn't work because then that apps in a desert and you know its users lose out and they can't do all these cool things that every other app on ethereum can do and so it's like a very hard coordination problem so for me it's really about having a full functional b5 ecosystem and we're so close right now and we'll be probably be there within a week or so based on you know projection they have broadened that means you have lending decks indexes options derivatives all in orbit room and that's the point where any any prod product uh project can say i can deploy an arbor's room today i don't need a weight i don't need to say well i i just need a b and c to move so i'm really excited about just the full ecosystem and you know we're we're almost there we we did a lot of waiting to sort of for a lot of people to get ready not everyone went live on day one uh you know today's uh what is it day uh four i guess um so but i think by day 15 we'll have um pretty much um you know i'm not gonna say we'll have every single project or multiple in each category but i think we'll have the entire defy ecosystem covered um within days and that to me is is incredibly exciting and that's not you know that's that's that's step one i'm also excited about nfts um having a lot of good conversation with gaming but like what i'm personally most excited about is just the full diva defy ecosystem because that's where composability is so magical and a year ago i think nobody had any idea that you could basically do this coordination just get everyone to move like you know or to redeploy in mass and that's um incredible incredible to to see play out because it's against everything we we thought was possible a year i i would say for for me it's kind of seeing seeing applications that wouldn't have been possible on ethereum um and and i know we i think we already have sort of our you know i'm not sure if they're a lot i think some at least somewhat you know for instance perpetual protocols which just you know are more expensive um retail defi that's that's you know just hasn't had access um and and you know and then you know those those are even sort of the the least exciting of like the new things to come because those are the ones i could think of exciting it's such a good answer all right well i'm gonna be honest harry killed it on that one the day when i keep when i when i see something new launch and i'm like oh my god that's possible [Music] yeah what have we done yeah absolutely well uh thank you so much for a conversation today guys i guess maybe last question um you recently had a pretty monster raise so congrats on that 120 million dollars um also it sounds like you guys are hiring so what are you gonna do with um that 120 million are you are you hiring some folks any shout outs you want to give yeah that is what we're doing with the 120 million it's basically full hiring so we're fully remote so we don't have we have very very minimal overhead and that's going to basically go to investing in in people and investing in research and development because basically um you know this gets to you know we've covered a few things around this which uh what our scalability is now what we'll get to eventually and the answer is you know we think arbiter is a good answer to a lot of the scalability problems today but we think there's still a long way to go because adoption is not going down we're going up and to the right and that's going to continue going that way and so we have to think about hey um not only how do we scale for the next six months and how do we scale for the next year but how do we move past that and have fundamental you know increase increases and capacity increases over five years and ten years as well because you know we believe and we believe this for a while if i look back 10 years ago i was i was i was already talking about uh you know blockchains back then so uh we think that's where the adoption is going and therefore uh it really will give us the ability to invest in in people and build more cross-functional teams that are uh improving arbitration today but also have like big vision uh visions and that's about core scalability it's also about like tooling and compatibility because you know we're fully evm compatible and it's great and that's allowing us to really um be the best solution for those that are uh you know that that are in the ethereum community today but then we also ask ourselves um what about the user that comes to arbitrary tomorrow can we make their experience even smoother can we can we give them extra tooling and extra and do things maybe that you know add affordances that would be harder to do on layer one and you know this is something which we're thinking about a lot because uh as we grow and grow and grow the community of developers you know we need to tap into uh you know much broader communities and to give uh people the ability to acclimate onto ethereum uh and more smoothly and easier i think is is really really exciting so but in one word it's hiring that's what we'll be doing with with that and we uh um i don't think we're not looking it's a lot of money so we're not looking to build um you know a a an army we're looking to build uh a nice sized team of you know some of the best minds in the world so we'll be paying you know you know we'll be uh you know compensating very competitively for uh really really um strong engineers and and uh and uh researchers and you get to work with us you guys have it uh arbitrary team harry steven thank you so much for joining us i like the sound of defy in days really looking forward to doing more with arbitrary in the future thank you so much for having us thank you absolutely guys uh well looks like layer two summer is here it's bleeding into fall a little bit i think this is a layer two a year it's just years from now it's just it's layered from now on i mean this is kind of the road map for ethereum so we'll be having a lot more conversations about layer two of course guys go check it out go try it out for yourself we'll include some links in the show note i think we're actually releasing a guide on bank lists pretty soon to
