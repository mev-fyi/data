[Music] hello hello gmgm this is overpriced jpegs i am carly riley i hope you are all having a wonderful start to your weekend if you are listening to this on saturday morning when it drops i hope you all had a beautiful past week i want to get right into the show we are talking about how meebitz dao is doing something very interesting with fractionalized ownership we're going to talk about some of the new projects that launched this week one in particular that i think is interesting we're talking about wolf game finally what are my thoughts on wolf game what can we learn from wolf game what can we expect from wolf game is it worth all the money that was thrown into it and then finally the sandbox launched their alpha this week that's a big deal we'll talk about that xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the tokens across all of your wallets but it also displays the nfts that you've been tirelessly collecting xerion even reports the value of your nfts in your overall portfolio giving you the most comprehensive report on the entirety of your crypto portfolio xerion isn't just a place to get an understanding of your portfolio but it also hooks into defy activities like trading borrowing and lending all in one convenient place so you don't have to memorize all the various dfi websites to do all of your default activities to get started go to xerion.io bankless and load up your wallet or wallets into the xerion interface and supercharge your defy experience and enrich your nft lifestyle that's z-e-r-i-o-n bank-less i want to give a special thanks to overpriced jpeg partner blockblock not only because they are a sponsor of this show but also because they are my employer blockblock is an innovative blockchain lab we work across nfts and the metaverse and our goal is really to push the industry forward with every new project we take on we founded and currently run the meebit style which just partnered with larval labs to create more metaverse friendly renderings of me bits which is awesome we are also partnered with a sundance award-winning filmmaker to build the first dow that will own a feature-length documentary film we have a ton of cool projects down the pipeline and are really looking for cool people to partner with on this so go to blockblock.io to subscribe to our newsletter and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io okay new drops some of the new drops this week uh a couple two that i two that i just want to mention somewhat quickly because i think it's worth knowing about them sartoshi who's a very famous digital artist in this space and influencer in the space in general dropped his mfr's project it was popular all over twitter if you're on nft twitter which if you're listening to this you probably are that means you probably saw the m effers the thing that i think is fun about this project is really that it's giving me flashbacks to what it was like two months ago when you had these really crazed hyped pfp type projects that would drop and they were all these crazy gas wars not that i think that was the best time for the nft space but it was a moment in the nft space and we haven't really had a project that captured the imagination of of sort of all of nft twitter at once and the sartoshi drop the mf at first drop seemed to do that so check that out uh damien hearst also on thanksgiving airdropped all of his like the currency holders another nft it's a play on or it's sort of in connection to the album cover he had designed for drake at one point so it's damien hurst everything he does like turns to money he is fun fact i did not know this damien hurst is supposedly the richest british artist in like in living time or whatever he's worth like 300 million dollars or something crazy so i thought that was actually quite interesting but the new drop that i actually really wanted to highlight is ross ulbricht has launched an nft project from prison so i don't know i'm guessing that many of you are familiar with ross albrecht though i'm guessing that there are a fair number of you who are not so i want to give a little context here and that context is is will explain why i think this is so interesting uh ross ulbricht founded something called the silk road a website called the silk road when he was 26 years old the silk road is really the website people think of when they think of the dark web it started off as a site where you could buy essentially any kind of drugs and it evolved into really a marketplace for illegal goods in general i do think the silk road is one of the reasons that lawmakers and people in general think of crypto as and think of bitcoin as really only being used for nefarious purposes the silk road launched at a time when bitcoin was really becoming popular the first wave of bitcoin's popularity and it definitely accelerated the silk road accelerated the adoption of bitcoin there are a lot of people who first got into crypto because of the silk road and because of ross albrecht and specifically buying drugs you know a lot of the drug transactions that were happening on the silk road were marijuana but there were also plenty of other drugs being sold and then things did get really dark with the silk road human body parts started being sold on there etc etc so ross albrecht was put in jail for being the founder of the silk road what's notable is his he's received two life sentences plus 40 years that was his sentence was like you know it's symbolic obviously you're not gonna live two lives right so but like until you die and then until you die again and then plus an additional 40 years and this is sort of a topic of a lot of conversation in like incarceration circles and in the crypto space in general because people feel like that was just way too excessive for what ross is guilty of notably ross's sentence is longer than el chapo's sentence despite the fact that ross was not actually convicted of anything violent himself so the last thing i'll say here and i'm just highlighting this because i think ross's story is really interesting and it's worth learning more about and he just dropped an nft which is quite interesting ross is a libertarian who started the silk road because he believed in free markets but and this is where it's important ross's philosophy was predicated on non-violence so there were rules in the silk road you weren't allowed to sell child pornography on the silk road because inevitably child pornography means there was violence you violated a child so there were rules to the silk road contrary to popular belief and there is a feeling among some people including his mother who recently went on a twitter space with oh shiny which is why why some of this is coming up again uh there's a feeling that ross was really convicted for his like libertarian ideology the the judge seemed to think that he poses a continuing threat to society and therefore made his sentence very long because she felt he still identified as a libertarian and that it was those libertarian beliefs that had led to the silk road and therefore that if he continued to hold those libertarian beliefs if he were allowed to be set free who knows what else he would create because it was his libertarian ideology that led to this sort of dangerous site being started and of course there are a lot of people who feel very very uncomfortable with the idea that that's sort of forming the basis for his very long sentence there's a little bit of a digression hopefully it's it's still interesting to folks the nft right now is uh this is friday the day before this podcast will air it's it's got a bid of 260 eth on it right now one of his nfts so it's it's launched on super rare it's it's gonna go for a lot of money and the funds the proceeds from this nft sale will go to support ross's continuing legal battle ross is still hoping that he'll get out of prison at some point as well as go to a nonprofit that he and his mother have started called art for giving which goes to support the families of incarcerated people so a little story about ross albrecht the silk road and worth checking more into if you know nothing about it okay the project i want to highlight this week is meet its you're probably familiar with me bits it was the third project out of larval labs who launched crypto punks so they're not exactly an understated project because nothing that larvolavs does is understated but they did see a modest boost in floor price this week and i actually think it's because of me bits dao which is a project i'm heavily involved in the startup that i work for was co-founded by kai turner who's also the co-founder of nevitz dao so i work very closely with him i i work closely on a number of projects on me bits as part of me bits dao so i wanted to talk about some of what we're doing not to shill the project at all but because i actually think there's a lot to be learned here and so as we look at me bits and why they're doing that well this week i want to highlight what we're up to and i think there'll be some learnings as a result of that so some context here larva labs launched me bits in i think it was may of this year at some point here in 2021 and they were airdropped to all crypto punk holders and the premise was these would be avatars for the metaverse so me bits as you probably are familiar are 3d avatars if you have a me bit you can go onto the larval labs website and download like the vox files the 3d files for your meebit and this was clearly larval lab sticking putting a stake in the ground saying hey these are these are metaverse avatars but there's a huge gap between making an nft and saying hey this is a this is a metaverse avatar and then actually having that avatar be a dominant avatar in the metaverse right there's there's there's some distance between those two realities and so meet it's dao which was started by kai turner what is an attempt to bridge the gap and and close the distance close the gap i guess between where me bits are today and where we ultimately want to see them which is as avatars in the metaverse and so in that way it really acts as an investment fund investing in projects that help to get me bits everywhere you could say so one of the goals we've had with me bitstau for a while and kai in particular is really passionate about is expanding access to ownership of me bits me bits were free to crypto punk holders but of course at this point to be a crypto punk holder you have to be very very rich and as soon as me bits hit the secondary market they were around two and a half eth so really quite expensive for many people who would love to own me bits but just truly can't afford a ten thousand dollar asset like that without really being clear on what'll happen to the price and so we wanted to allow for for just greater participation in the meebit's ecosystem and probably a month ago a couple months ago kai and and myself started engaging with a company called seasons i'll talk about that in a minute and basically what we've put together is it's called an album an album of me that's meebitz from the founders of me bids dao and kai himself and block block the startup i work at we pooled together about 20 meets and put it in this season's album and we then sold tokens mbbt tokens that are are sort of fractions of this me bit album you'll see why i'm stumbling over what i'm saying here in just a minute so in theory this is sort of a fractionalization mechanism like those that you may be familiar with pranxy quite famously sold a crypto punk and fractionalized the crypto punk and that allowed people ways to buy into the value of a crypto punk at a much more affordable rate but the difference between other fractionalization platforms where all you're doing is sort of buying a chunk of the economic value of the thing what we've done here with our meebit's season album is you're actually buying a proxy ownership token which means you actually have ownership rights over the me bits that are in this album so what i'm saying there is unlike if you just buy a fraction of a crypto punk if you if you buy a fraction of a crypto punk and the crypto punk then sells for double the price you'll double your money and that's great and that's an investment strategy and good on you but you can't use that crypto punk as if it's your own punk what we're trying to do with this meebit's album is actually allow you to own a collection of me bits that you share the ownership with with others of course but now you can actually use one of the me bits in that pool in the metaverse as your avatar if you so chose you have you have you can participate in we have a photo booth app that we're building out where you put your me in the photo booth and you can take pictures of it in different poses you can now use the mee bits that are in this pool assuming you have enough mvbt tokens and treat that maybe sort of like it's your own because it is and that's a really perhaps nuanced distinction but i think an important one and in this space in general we don't think i think especially new people don't necessarily think enough about the nuance of what they're buying what do you really own what can you really do with that thing you own i mean on the one hand we talk about that a ton in this space because you have the creative commons and we talk about you know licensing rights and and that is a big conversation in nfts and on the other hand i think individual investors don't think enough about it when they buy into a project but your future value is very predicated on what exactly you own and what rights you have with that thing so i do think this is something novel uh i'm sure others have done something similar we're not completely trailblazing here but it's an example of a pretty prominent project something like me bits now really broadening its access and it's because of me but now it's because of kai turner and um i watched how thoughtful kai was through the process of creating this album and issuing these mbpt tokens and thinking about the tokenomics behind it and so i've been really glad to see that it's it's really worked out and that's the the final piece i want to talk about this which are a couple of my takeaways having watched and been a part of this process with me bits and and me that style and the mbbt tokens so we launched this album and the sale of the album a week week and a half ago two weeks ago at this point um and we were not expecting the mbbt tokens which are your buy-in to own these me bits we were not expecting them to sell out at all we were like great this will be a slow burn kind of a thing we even ran a promotion where if you bought a general membership token to be a part of me bit stout you could get some mbbt we just we wanted this to be something that over time offered people a way to buy into medics in a way that they they previously couldn't a way to to get more involved in ebitd's dao but we weren't expecting for this to like strike fire immediately but very quickly i think partly because of the promotion with with me stop general membership but also for reasons that aren't entirely clear to us the mbpt tokens took off and specifically seemingly in asia what we're starting to learn is that apparently there was a lot of appetite for owning ebits in a number of asian countries i think china in particular but the price point was sort of prohibitive for folks so there was this huge influx of investors in general and asian investors in particular who bought up a ton of mbbt and and bought it bought you know bought all of the mbbt that was outstanding and then drove the price of mbbt from its initial offering price of around 22. it was like 0.005 east all the way up to 90 per mbbt on like coin gecko and these liquidity like other other markets so i want to say a couple things on this which is first it felt like a study in if you build it they will come kai is a really generous person in this space who as i mentioned was incredibly thoughtful about why he was doing this how he laid it out and even though he wasn't expecting a ton to come from it at least initially a lot did come from it it was it beat his expectations because this is corny but i think he put the right intentions out there in the world and this is an industry and a space where sometimes things just catch fire so this is to say if you've been thinking about a project you want to do or or playing around or an experiment you want to try and you have good intentions with the thing just do it right who cares you know it may not work at all but then on the other hand it may catch fire so that was really fun for me to watch how this thing that we had fairly low expectations for took off on the other hand when the price of the mbbt hit like 90 dollars we were all like no stop i won't i won't make the joke that kai's made but we were like this is not a [ __ ] coin like we're not trying to like pump this thing and this is me making an anti show for this project i'm a part of which is like don't go buy the price of this thing way up and to give you the numbers there are currently 20 or so me bits in this season's album some of them are very high value bits they're not all floor me bits and with the remaining or with the mbbt that we've accrued now or the each we've accrued from selling the mbbt we're going to buy up many many more bit me bits for this this overall album and this overall pool there are a hundred thousand outstanding mbbt so when they were each valued at ninety dollars per mbbt the overall valuation given to this album of me bits was nine million dollars that is too high me bits may end up going crazy and being worth a ton of money and maybe 9 million dollars won't someday be a crazy high valuation for me bits but right now that's a crazy high valuation for me bits and the people who were paying 80 90 for this mbbt i do not think we're properly evaluating what they were buying into this is a very straightforward transaction you're basically getting access to 20 40 some number of me bits in exchange for your eth you can very easily track what the current market value of this album is and when it gets wildly above that something has gone awry so it is subsequently the mbbt has come down from about 90 per mbbt to 35 mbbt uh it's it's a much saner valuation now um but it's just an example again which i'm going to talk about a little bit later i think with wolfgang of in these moments of frenzy people totally lose their head as to what the underlying thing they're buying actually is and what the value of that thing is so please please be careful use your head i'm not like a math whiz but it doesn't take a math whiz to be able to do this basic calculation and see that things were getting out of hand so as somebody who is sort of partly behind this mbpt project this is me saying 90 was was was far too high but i do think overall this season's album is a really cool concept it's something that i would love to see other projects emulate or do which is to offer greater access to true ownership of the underlying assets not just fractionalized sort of ownership over economic value next i want to talk about wolfgang which dominated twitter for a whole bunch of days right up before thanksgiving here in the states so i didn't get to talk about it when it was happening because we didn't do a recap episode that week but i i think this is a fascinating potential case study of where this space could be going or maybe it'll be an example of a burst of light that died very quickly we don't know yet so but it's very much worth tracking so we can see what does happen with wolfgang okay for somebody who was like under a rock the week of november 21st or whatever and does not know about wolf game here's the basic premise wolf game dropped pretty stealthily and with like a white paper that said hey no road map no empty promises what we're dropping is this game here you [ __ ] go right and the premise is this there are sheep and they are in a barn and they are nfts and they can be sheared for wool which is an erc20 the wool is an erc20 token that wool can be spent to create new nfts mostly sheep but sometimes wolves wolves are outside the barn and they want to steal the sheep and steal the wool so the farmers on this farm with sheep and wolves have made a deal with the wolves where they say okay if you don't come and attack our sheep we're gonna pay you a wool tax so every time you have a sheep and you shear the sheep for wool 20 of your wool haul gets paid out to the wolves so they don't attack you okay now the way this game actually functionally works is you if you have sheep you can either stake your sheep or not stake your sheep if you stake your sheep that's how they earn wool and they are safe from the wolves if however you unstake your sheep because for example you wanted to sell your sheep on open sea the wolf a wolf can come and steal your sheep and so you may end up with nothing so it's a very it's just like a risk it's it's gambling it's a risk game from that standpoint also every time you use wool to create a new nft you can either end up with a sheep or a wolf it's more likely to end up you're more likely to end up with a sheep because it's less valuable and when a new sheep is born through the wool using you're paying your wool a wolf can come and steal that new sheep that was born and so again it's just a game of chance so this fundamental mechanism a is actually kind of interesting in and of itself because something like this hasn't really been done in the nft space before where you have wolf nfts and sheep nfts but the wolf nfts can steal the sheep nfts like that concept is new on the other hand the concept is very very basic you could say this isn't really a game it's just like rolling dice and seeing what happens of course the thing that makes this so interesting is that the sheep because the sheep are nfts the wolves are nfts and the wool or erc20 tokens there's real money to be made off of all of these things and because the game got popular and it was a novel idea people were able to make a lot of money selling wool and sheep and wolves now the criticism of this game at the time when it was getting really frothy and big was okay but there's no fundamentals here right this is all being propped up because people want money and that's creating this like circular loop where people want money so they'll play the game which and then more people want the money and so that drives the price of everything up and the price being driven up makes more people join and it becomes like circular loop what has happened since that original since two weeks ago when the game was wildly popular is it's become clear that there's going to be a second phase to this whole thing where there's presumably a real game that's being built out where you can use your wool to buy artifacts and decorate your farm i don't know i'm speculating as to what this will be used for they did say you could use the wool to buy artifacts but there's a whole new level to this is the point that's going to be launching in 2022. now i want to talk about some of the takeaways from this whole thing and uh why it seemed to get as big as it did so the on why it got as big as it did i do think it if you read the white papers there are now two white papers a v1 white paper and a v2 white paper it's clear the team is very bright and very thoughtful and they have come up with something that at least in the nft space is truly novel again in the broader world not very novel this is a gambling game but their use of smart contracts to make this happen very novel the whole thing is on chain which which is incredibly impressive now the team itself is anonymous which i don't love at all but this is where having a couple key influencers promote the project really helped make this thing as successful as it was so beanie very controversial influencer has apparently been an advisor to the team he knows who the team is though they're anonymous he has said they're they all come from they mostly come from the defy world which is why you see very defy like protocols being used in this game the staking mechanisms etc and beanie had several twitter spaces about this this game and talked a lot about it and i think that tremendously helped to have somebody like that sort of vouching for the team when otherwise the team is anonymous you also had gary vaynerchuk get into this uh game and get pretty excited about it which isn't surprising if you follow gary vaynerchuk you know that farmville was like a big moment for him like watching how farmville played out on on facebook back in 2010 or 2009 he's oh he's referenced that several times in the years since as being kind of a watershed moment for him of like oh my god look what this like social gaming thing that's going on on facebook so i'll talk about the farmville element of this in a minute because i think it's actually really important but the the big names promoting this project uh was very helpful given that the team was anonymous but their white paper was honestly uh quite impressive but my big takeaways have really been well a couple things on a practical level when something is super fiery and pumping and every influencer is talking about it don't buy in that is not the moment to buy i know this from personal experience i've been burned by this before it's very tempting i had the temptation moment with wolfgang when all of this was going down i really wanted to buy some wool i wanted to maybe buy some land plots i debated buying sheep right like i debated all of it and ultimately my training my months of training and buying nft kicked in and i was like you've been here before when everyone else is buying into something it's almost always at some sort of peak the project is usually at some sort of peak in that moment so i held off i didn't buy that has paid off because prices have come down significantly part of that is because there have been some smart contract challenges there were some exploits that happened that have totally kind of derailed the original plan whatever they seem to be fixing it um but also i think it the prices came down because the feverishness of it all did ultimately subside as days passed so that's not to say this project isn't cool or might not be worth a hell of a lot more in the future it might but it's just a word of advice to say if you're in the middle of something and everything's pumping that's usually time for you to pump the brakes okay i'm really excited to see what happens with the actual game itself i say that because again this this first phase of it where you were sharing sheep and sharing wool and minting new nfts whatever that was just phase one to like unleash the broader ecosystem apparently and in 2022 we're gonna get the actual game which again we're not really sure exactly what that's going to look like but i think this is going to be a really interesting project to track to gauge i don't know call it the the broader viability of play to earn games i know there are lots of people out there who are convinced that play to earn is the future and it probably is but we don't really know yet there are also skeptics who are very anti-plater and we'll talk about that and something like this where you did have this sort of circular mechanic where people were only really in it to make money feels like a precarious situation so what i'm curious to see in 2022 is what this game is and there's sort of two pieces to this a is the game really fun on its own like would people want to play it if they weren't making money i think that's the best case scenario the best case scenario is that if this can be a game that people want to play no matter what and so the added benefit that you're actually earning money on it is like crazy so my instinct would be like that's what you want to do on the other hand this is where we pull in farmville i think farmville is a really interesting case study farmville was not a fun game it was it was hardly a game right all it did was like you planted stuff and you had to harvest your crops at particular times of day and if you missed those times of day your crops would die and you'd be sad and you it was definitely felt kind of multi-level marketing e in that you had to bring new friends into the game in order to like earn certain benefits and get you know decorate your farm and whatever like there was no strategy to this to farmville and yet it was wildly successful and and moreover there were people who played it for years and years and years and just like enjoyed the methodical feeling of the whole thing so it'll be really interesting to see if wolfgame does end up looking a lot more like farmville which i think right now there's a good chance that that is what it is and it does stay successful for many many years that's something that's going to be very interesting to understand and and if that happens i think play to earn the sky's the limit with play to earn because if you have people playing like fairly boring games but they just love the routine of it and they can make money on that that's incredibly game changing for people around the world so tracking what learn seeing what this game really is going to be in 2022 and then in the long term tracking if it's able to stay successful uh is is going to be very instructive and i'm very curious here's the other piece i want to say on this there are a lot of people or i've seen people i don't know if it's a lot but i think it is i've seen people in the gaming community who are very anti play to earn games and one of the arguments i've seen folks make is that gaming people game because they enjoy it and it's fun and it's an escape and if you add economics to that if you make somebody's economic livelihood dependent on gaming this thing they do for fun then you're gonna sort of kill the spirit of why people gain in the first place now maybe that sounds like a crazy argument i actually don't think it is i think it makes some sense right that if you're making money now from the thing that was previously your hobby it's not really a hobby anymore and it takes on a whole new shape for you but what i think that argument misses is that much like nfts have created a whole new generation of art fans from people who previously didn't care about art play to earn gaming is going to create a new wave of gaming fans from people who weren't previously gamers so perhaps this is obvious what i'm saying here but there were a lot of people who got into nfts because they could make money on it and now actually care about art and are interested in generative art and artists and this whole world that was historically of no interest to them and i think gaming will be similar where you have people like myself frankly who have never really been gamers but see this play to earn things see it's a way to make money see it's changing people's lives internationally think that's really interesting and may themselves then end up falling in love with gaming so i do think that gets missed in the narrative from gamers who are very opposed to play to earn and the other thing to say is the gaming community hated farmville 2 because i felt like it wasn't really a game for all the reasons i outlined so certainly there's precedence for gamers being very territorial about what is and is not a game and how it should go and being wrong from the standpoint that the consumer ultimately decides what is what so stay tuned wolfgang is something i want to track for the long term because i think it'll be very very instructive to see how this plays out and what that means for the future of play to earn the gaming space as a whole the nft you know erc20 space as a whole i think this is honestly fascinating everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse on juno is your new crypto enabled

okay last but not least we have the sandbox launching their alpha right there the first time that the public is getting access to play in the sandbox i'm to give us a little bit of context a little bit of backstory here we are going to talk a heck of a lot more about the sandbox on this podcast because it's such a huge player in the metaverse space at this point so the sandbox and this is really interesting some folks may know this the sandbox actually launched in 2012. this is a very old project in 2012 it did not have the crypto component to it did not have a blockchain component to it it was simply a place where it was an ios and i'm sure android and it was like an iphone game where you could build worlds and build games and inhabit those worlds and games i think sort of a la roblox and it wasn't it's been incredibly popular it has like 40 million users of the ios version of the game so many many millions of people played the sandbox long before it was it had any blockchain affiliation then i believe it was 2020. so last year or maybe it was a couple years back anyway i believe actually it's more like probably 2017. once blockchain started to get bigger sandbox made the decision to pivot and and build out this whole blockchain component really because they or so they say because they wanted the creators the many people who are creating worlds in the sandbox to be able to monetize their creations in ways that have historically never been possible again this is the promise of blockchain is that creators can suddenly be rewarded for their work in ways that they never have been able to before so the the sandbox has has been a very very hyped part of the metaverse there's really like three metaverse companies you hear about like facebook aside where you have decentraland the sandbox and cryptovoxels and people have their favorites the sandbox is a big deal because again they had an existing user base about 40 million people they're heavily backed by all sorts of vcs which is controversial in to some folks minds um and they're really like a roblox and a or a minecraft game with the added benefit that creators have a lot more control and ownership over the world they build the money they make from selling the assets that they've built uh and of course all of the stuff like the land and the assets can also then be sold on markets outside of of the sandbox or at least sand the the main currency in the sandbox can be sold outside that they have all of the like corporate partnerships you could ever want atari has a huge chunk of land in the sandbox snoop dogg is a huge partner of the sandbox the walking dead has like the the ip the walking dead has like these huge plots of land and are building zombie games in the sandbox esports i mean they they seem to be doing everything right in turn in terms of building out corporate partnerships but of course all of this will come down to what is the gameplay experience like in the sandbox really up to this point we haven't known the answer to that there hasn't been an answer to that because it's been in beta tests and you've only had very small select groups that have been able to play in it so alpha the alpha where you've now the public in the sandbox is happening right now it launched on november 29th so far the reception seems to be fairly positive the way this is working is that you have i think it's a thousand alpha passes so you have only a thousand people who are playing around in 18 experiences in the sandbox um like quests and things and then but then there's there anybody can come and play in there's like three experiences that they've opened up to anybody in the public and uh now with that said it's only for people who have windows i have a mac i've not been able to play it um so you know this is all to say there is a certain amount of limitations still on who's in the sandbox but the reception seems to have been positive so far i've been kind of trolling the internet trying to find reactions from people who have alpha passes who are actually in the game and um all in all it seems to be like it's living up to its hype which is a big deal because there's a lot of hype around the sandbox so again something to continue to track we are hopefully going to be talking to one of the members of the executive team of the sandbox very soon here on this podcast to get much more information on it all um but the sand token the the token the currency used in the sandbox has been pumping like crazy lately as have all metaverse tokens because of facebook's meta announcement and it'll be really interesting to see which players can come out on top i mean the sandbox gives they on their roadmap they want to be a dow eventually they want to be owned by the community apparently in within a certain number of years all sand tokens will be owned by the community so the creators of the sandbox and their investors apparently are no longer going to hold sandbox tokens or sanj tokens so um very interesting to see how this plays out i want to close with this there was a tweet by farouk who's a well-known influencer in the space this tweet is from a couple weeks ago and it says i don't care what people think and i don't care if you think i'm too new to have an opinion but we are never going to enter a multi-year bear market in nfts ever in this lifetime save this and hit me with it if it ever happens aka never so he's saying we'll never have nfts be down overall for multiple years they'll always bounce back this is you know this super hot market and will be for our lifetimes and then gmoney who's also a somewhat known influencer in the space replied to this tweet and said this might be the biggest top signal i've seen yet and i want to talk about this because i want to talk about top signals and give you some food for thought to close with as we wrap up the year of 2021 look into the year of 2022 and try and think about what the market might do um i tend to be with g-money on this about this being a top signal a top single signal meaning something that's a sign that we've hit the the top of the market and that there's more more bare news to come i i want to what first popped into my mind when i saw this exchange was the 2008 financial crisis and the fact that we really got into the 2008 financial crisis because most financiers believed that the housing market would just never go down and so all of these subprime mortgages and the the um the bundles of subprime mortgages that were being bought and sold across all of wall street were all predicated on the idea that housing prices would always go up and therefore we wouldn't essentially have a 2008 crisis and of course as soon as you think that something can never go down it goes down so there were there were whispers of that mentality here of like nfts will never go down year-over-year which does feel like nearly a guarantee that we're about to enter a three-year bear market i'm mostly kidding on that i also wanted to introduce y'all to the idea of socionomics which is a concept that i i was introduced to right out of college i worked for a hedge fund and one of i guess indicators one of the indicators that they this hedge fund looked at as they made investments was social mood so socionomics is the idea that social mood actually drives the economy it's a flip of the typical interpretation which is that like the economy drives social mood and it says that actually it might be the other way around that there's sort of general social moods that exist independent of other factors and that that's what ends up driving the economy so for example there there's been studies or however you want to phrase this that show that like massive skyscrapers like when whenever it's like the new tallest building in the world was built that tends to correspond or that almost always corresponds with like a peak in the stock market so this there's like this social mood exuberance that's causing people to want to build big buildings that's also causing them buy-up stocks and then the social mood flips and it all comes crumbling down now it's really hard to know which comes first chicken in an egg economy or social mood but the idea itself is really interesting and i saw an article this past week that uh it was i think from the bbc let's see it's the bbc that said nft or non-fundable or non-fundable token is collins dictionaries word of the year and this also kind of struck me as a top signal of like just the wild exuberance for nfts that has happened in 2021 as much as we can all say we are early and i think in many ways of course we are still very early there has been the the social mood has been quite exuberant when it comes to nfts and investments this past year and that does make me worried for what might happen to the market in call it the year to come so i'm very bullish on nfts i'm very bullish on blockchain in the long term i am bracing for what might happen in 2022 though i have to say i think 2021 was so big for nfts and it was so big for investments in general that it does feel like a cooling off is is coming so food for thought i don't know what y'all think would love to hear your thoughts on top signals on socionomics on this idea that social mood drives the economy and that certain things then can be seen as sort of top signals again like building big buildings um but hopefully you find it interesting and you look a little bit more into it and with that i hope you enjoy your weekend we'll be back next
