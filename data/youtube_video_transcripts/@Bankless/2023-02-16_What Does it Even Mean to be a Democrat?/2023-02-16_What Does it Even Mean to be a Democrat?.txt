I'm absolutely a Libertarian I happily Embrace that label I think a lot of people on the left or the right if you ask them like what it means to be on the left to the right they don't quite have a consistent answer and it's interesting to watch people on both sides of that Spectrum take conflicting views that don't actually adhere to a single principle my principle is that people should be peaceful with one another everything that I believe comes down to is sort of trying to fit it to that
