foreign ation how you doing on this episode of the Greenfield podcast I'm joined by David Hoffman the founder and the host of bankless which is fun to have him on the Greenfield podcast considering I've been on the bank list podcast a couple times and this podcast is hosted on the bank list Network and uh Juan Benet who is the founder at protocol labs and is involved in uh filecoin and many other great projects in the ecosystem on this episode we were talking about what would have to be true for crypto to be good for the world and for those of you who are skilled at reading between the lines this is a tough episode to produce in the wake of the FTX implosion last week and I think that a lot of people in this industry are licking their wounds and thinking about the just the massive amount of capital destruction that was caused by SBF and a structure at FTX that resembled more Trad five and D5 so in this episode we talk about the social causes of crypto we talk about the tension between crypto being money games and crypto having rights and uh being good and being pro-social for the world we talk about education uh child five versus D5 getting people over the learning curve of holding their own keys and holding their own crypto and uh you know my basic plus minus for crypto being good for the world is listen ethereum has taken care of the carbon output from its Network down to almost zero there's still a problem with drugs in the industry with three I see Luna the capital destruction that came from that but the positive things that we're seeing coming out of crypto are remittances access to US dollars from anywhere in the world uh multi-cigs are way easier way of managing common property than the complex legal mechanisms usually required emerging Democratic governance approaches that are being pioneered by some dials nfts allowing for property rights on digital artifacts money pouring into privacy Tech that wouldn't have been previously this is not an exclusive list but it's just kind of to give you an idea of the plus minus that is that I have in my head after recording this episode with Juan and David and I think that we really get into some of the evolution that we're going to see in web3 over the next cycle in this episode so what would have to be true for crypto to be good for the world this episode is a part of the answer to that question and I hope that you enjoy so uh without further Ado I'll give you Juan Benet and David Hoffman enjoy working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of

get started what's up gentlemen how you doing Hey Kevin hey really glad to have you both here uh so you uh You And Me David have have talked a little bit about how crypto is and isn't good for the world and I gotta say man this tweet that you sent about how for the first time ever after ftx's collapse I have nothing to stand on when I say crypto is good for the world uh that hit me hard and you got 2 400 likes on that one so maybe that's a jumping off point to to dive in here after FTX collapse kit collapsed can you tell me what you're thinking as you sent this tweet yeah I think a lot of the industry went into a moment of reflection after FTX and I think it's really because it was the third of three major events that were kind of similar ish um three AC the destruction of three years Capital the destruction of Terra Luna now the destruction of FTX it was just like man this this keeps on happening man like this is this is what 2022 was uh and so uh it just it took me just like a moment of reflection be like it seems to have dominated 2022 just seems to be dominated by just people losing money um yeah and in an industry that is supposed to be about like you know self-sovereign asset owning and uh you know permissionless Freedom it's like we're not using we have the tools that have been specifically built to prevent this and then it seems to actually enable it somehow uh and I think I was just like in the mind I think me and a lot of the industry would have just in this mind state of just like momentary capitulation of just like damn man like sweet the theoretical use cases of crypto are amazing but everything bad that's happened about crypto happened in 2022 uh and so like taking just like and I I love everyone in crypto because we're all futurists right we're all idealists uh we're all we're optimist about the future uh but then like 2022 comes and punches you in the gut and then another time and then another time and it's like all right well like me and Ryan we call ourselves like storytellers like we're trying to get people to be on the bank list Journey right so we got to tell the story because that's how humans learn things uh and it's like sweet like that's we're just we're just making something out of nothing right we're just we're just making it up uh and hoping it sticks and meanwhile like people keep on losing money to things like Tara Luna and FTX and like dokwan and all that stuff uh so it's just like a moment of like frustration about some of just yeah some of the bad stuff I guess yeah thanks for that David you know I I think it's clear when I talk to you that we believe that crypto can be good for the world and I'd like to make this episode about how it how it actually achieves that that goal of being good for the world and so I'd love to hear from you on next about how FTX hit you and as a long-term Builder what your take is on the FTX implosion yeah look at I'm tremendously disappointed I think it is a a huge disaster for for our community in in the ways that were totally preventable uh like our community and what we've been building with for crypto stands precisely against the kind of problems that led to this downfall um you know I've been around since very early like before 2012-13 is when I started getting into into Bitcoin and and crypto and so on and a lot of it is about creating public verifiable structures where you do not have to trust people to act uh correctly and so on and I think what what is especially disappointing is how many good things we're getting starting to get funded that now are totally destroyed because of this um and just a huge overhang that's going to come into the whole community and so I it feels like we've on one so amount of work now um to your question this is precisely why we're here like I think if anything this is a massive reminder of the work that we're doing and why it matters the fact that these kinds of mistakes should not happen and where we can build economies that are free of this kind of mistake and this kind of uh just beyond mistaken right this is uh it's unclear still what everything exact how everything exactly happened but there's at least significant evidence of serious fraud that should be completely avoidable with cryptographic Primitives um and this is why we why we build these things this is we're not here for C5 we're here for D5 at least and I'm personally here for refi where you're you're even moving away from the traditional structures um you know exchanges and investing and so on are should be like the minority use case of of crypto crypto should be about building a much better economic structure a much better set of economic remedies where we're building um long-standing uh superstructures that are able to give us utilities that are that are able to build a um a much more open Financial system a much more open economy where you can build um massive scale services and infrastructure uh without having to rely on corporations without having to rely on small groups without having to rely on individuals to to remain honest and this is a massive reminder for all of us that uh hey we have an enormous amount of work to do and um we have to be constantly Vigilant to make sure that the groups that come in are uh true to the values and truths of the goals uh and and we don't just take their work for it we sort of force it we force our viability we force accountability we force public verifiability in in a cryptographic sense you know math doesn't lie um you you can build drastically better structures and that's what we've been doing for the last 10 years we've made a lot of progress a bunch of setbacks but um I think overall it's uh it is massively good for the world and I think uh even though this is a super disappointing week um it is a not just a reminder it is a uh a reinforcement of the good that we've done already so the fact that this is shocking to us comes from a place of we're already in a much better world right so it wind back the clock to why Bitcoin decided 2008 the financial crisis there it was an escape hatch from that type of disaster and not having any alternative today we have Alternatives and we are disappointed and shocked because they weren't followed one of the things that sort of stands out for me and I'm curious if it resonates with you all is the difference between the first time user experience you know if you're Joe the plumber if you're a Joe Main Street and you use crypto for the first time it looks way different to you than if you're someone with a computer science degree working in Industry that understands why D5 is powerful which and you understand why not your keys not your crypto and you know I wish there was a way to bridge people from that first time user without having to go through these massive detonation events where people lose their money because when people lose their money that's when The Regulators start sniffing around and they start saying we're going to regulate this from without instead of crypto regulating it from within so just acknowledging that massive Delta between what we see as people who live and breathe this stuff versus what people who are using it casually see for me is maybe a starting point in recognizing the vantage point between how main street views crypto and how we view crypto on the regulation of crypto from within um you know I really think that this was totally avoidable um by uh forcing a certain set of Standards from within our community about what uh different kinds of financial institutions should be doing uh with funds with user representations and so on and this doesn't at all require uh external governments to to Define it I think that this is standards that we should be placing and it is our own fault for as a community for not requiring those when we were kind of um supporting and promoting a lot of these groups uh and so sort of you know a lot of people um kind of have a lot of trust in in community leaders on kind of where to go and what products are good and so on and having our own notion of standards of what qualifies as a legit crypto institution that follows the crypto values and the and has public verifiability um that's something that we can build ourselves uh and the other part is we we probably could have we have the coordination tools and what group is extremely good for is to coordinate out of massive problems we have the coordination tools to avert this kind of disaster right so the I was you know Kevin you and I talked about this but I was sort of shocked that this week alone the sort of crypto market cap was shaped by you know 20 to 30 percent um over the disaster and averting the catastrophe probably would have been one percent or less than one percent when it started and we just lacked the coordination Primitives to solve the problem uh on the get-go um a to prevent it in the first place and B to act as it's happening and so this is something where it has made me consider how we as a community should be what kind of structure should we put in place to to avoid these kinds of financial disasters um or kind of uh step in to take them in a different course um and that's a lot of possibilities there but I think it's a it's a stuff that I hadn't been thinking about before I've always uh considered more markets are just like this hive mind of people right like with the market price of something it's just like the collective intelligence of so many different Market participants and then boom we have a price on the secondary Market um like markets remember because it's all of our Collective brains they also have memory uh and like humans the way our brains work is that we encode memories much faster if there's pain involved if there's suffering involved and so like kind of how like Mount gox was a meme that probably did a lot of energy added a lot of energy to the Bitcoin or chant of like not your keys not your crypto there's probably going to be that's probably what the legacy of FTX is going to be where like it imprints upon us like people that came after Mount gox that didn't learn these lessons personally uh that you know of some of the values right so I guess we there's there's a reason why web3 has values why we talk about value so much uh and sometimes in the crypto the world things happen that are illustrative of the whole point of why we're here uh like exchange hacks for example uh and sometimes like I think moments like this is where it goes from a meme that you hear about on like podcasts or on Twitter into something that like you've actually experienced and and you can express for yourself is like why it's important not because I'm like you know somebody memed it on Twitter or whatever uh it's sad that this is how humans learn it's unfortunate that we have to learn through like you know pain and experiencing it firsthand rather than just like knowing it but like maybe that is what is the Legacy the good Legacy of FTX is that like it's it's the new lesson of mount gox for a much wider broader set of people uh regardless of whether they lost money in it or not uh and so like the other like kind of existential crisis I was having Kevin is like you know you know how the the meme of like the cycle right and like you kind of don't make money your first cycle you always make money your second cycle uh in crypto um and like I was just feeling like bad about the industry because like yes because we dump on the new site the second cyclers dump on the first cyclers and so like this crypto world like has this way of just like the only way Pat with the only path forward to actually make this thing work is like by hurting people like the second cyclers dump on the first cyclers the first cyclers get Mount gox they get ftxed like I so far I haven't like seen crypto progress forward in a way that doesn't hurt people and in in a particular particular way I I don't think that's true so or or in the times that I've been here I think that more damage has been done by the same group it's not kind of like last cyclers on new cyclists or anything like that uh at least at least for my for my understanding of the yeah I mean it's usually it's usually the same groups or similar types of groups that come in and predate on on people on groups it's the same kind of overly financialized use cases overly speculative use cases the crazy high Leverage The fudging of kyc and AML and all that kind of stuff the um you know it's one thing to kind of have an international exchange or whatever it's a separate thing to allow a lot of people to participate anyway you know wink wink um and get people wrecked um and I think it's a I think it's it's an over focus on Financial returns uh as a community that is hurting us I think that one of the big things that we as a community to do is realize that we what we have in our hands is New Economic superpowers New Economic Primitives to build a better economy not to make people Rich uh if people want to get rich quick like that's already like you're starting off in the wrong in the wrong place like you should be focusing on other uh on this much better structure of saying hey address why you don't have access to to resources why you need money why you need uh well you don't have access to good services in your communities um and it's kind of TR like what we have as a potential here is uh much more massive than than kind of helping um a few communities kind of get like get a leg up it it's much more about rewriting the rules of how Capital Works rewriting the rules of our of our institutions globally um I think we can scale to that like Curtis is it's only like two to two to four hours of magnitude away from uh from nation states and it's that's not very far one one of the sort of double-edged swords that this brings up for me is that we can program our values into our money and that's the Ultimate double-edged Sword because if you want to build more public goods you can build something beautiful and that supports and pay it pay it forward but if you're just a Ponzi scheme grifter or you know you're an SBF or a doe Quan you can build giant stuff like that and you know it brings me back to this this uh bankless episode that you did that uh David about why is crypto full of scams and it's because the crypto Believers and the core devs are building this beautiful vision of programmer values into our money and building a better world and then these grifters graft onto it and they corrupt that and and and bring their own perverted version of crypto to the rest of the world so I I thought you did a really great job with the why is crypto full scams video David and and that's kind of informed by a mental model for the space as well yeah thanks my man um I I think that the line that people need to not be focused on short-term money and they need to be focused on like instead of number going up they need to be focusing on like economic Primitives it's like a perspective though it's like a time it's a Time Horizon perspective that I think you're saying where you say like hey let's focus on not getting run rich in two years let's go focus on making sustainable wealth that'll last us multi-decades but like there's still a commitment there at the base layer of like this is about money and this is about making money whether or or not like making your uh net worth go up whether that's like resources like cheaper access to Commodities like more again more sustainable so it's ultimately just about wealth uh and and so it's just about a time frame thing it's like all right like do you want to be wealthy in the long term or do you want to be wealthy in the short term and like all of these like dumb monkeys that inhabit this planet are like uh short term well I want it now uh and then we have like a bull market we enable the grifters and like a fewer people a very small number of people who represent the very core of crypto to cite the concentric Circle model that Kevin was talking about like you there's there needs to be like one one of these people needs to be like fatality Peter and who builds ethereum and then like oh all of a sudden like it scales out to all the dumb monkeys now that all the dumb monkeys are on ethereum uh and like it it but that just takes so long and like meanwhile we have like the short-term resume that just like kind of manifests and expresses around it yeah I mean I I think this is where the private versus public versus Network Goods differences exist so um at least I and I think a lot of there are a lot of communities that are much more focused on building better resource utilization and better progress and better growth not just kind of individually uh making more money and making more wealth and so the difference the difference here being individual private wealth going you know number go up for an individual person is a it's kind of it's a different sort of thing than hey what if we allocated our efforts better and created more resources better and faster and we had different ways of allocating them like at the end of the day capital is just a distributed system to try and resource allocate uh and it works is worked really well for the last couple hundred years for a lot of reasons it's really difficult to centrally plan we had you know massive experiments in central planning in the in the 20th century that totally didn't beat Capital um and the the point though is like the rules of how Capital worked today are broken like are very very broken if you look at how you know it you you can make dramatically more money in in the world by producing um really glitzy not long-term useful things that don't provide any well-being to anybody like when you look at you know reducing mortality or curing diseases or um uh reducing uh poverty uh giving better access to water like all of these really important things that are in the world you can make way more money by creating some like um entertaining thing that just kind of helps people and you know nothing bad against entertainment but um it's probably not the most valuable thing that anybody could be doing and it's the multiples of of value in how um you know the broader stock market and the broader economy values these things is much higher is extremely short-term oriented and the long-term oriented stuff goes uninvested in because the rules of capital underneath the hood are kind of broken and so that's what is extremely promising to me about crypto and it's already to a great extent already making significant advances here um it's enabling lots of groups that are much more long-term oriented to build these institutions and these these structures on the internet that don't depend on them that are that are creating these long-term oriented um digital infrastructure that can give you digital human rights um and that's a super super cool cool possibility um and hey that's how you gotta get into rewriting capital and and getting to a much better um better place the bridge for me between what Juan said and what David said is this idea um that ENC strickler came up with called bentoism it stands for Beyond near or near-term orientation and it's basically going from being incentivized by now me what's good for me now to what's good for us now and then there's another Vector which is which is the future which is future me and then the fourth quadrant is future us and and so basically if if you're in a market where 99 of the you know to use David's term dumb monkeys are just focused on Naomi in the marshmallow test there's is actually like a market advantage to being someone who doesn't think like that and moves to Future us or future me and and you know maybe this is how this system evolves forward is as all the gains from failing the marshmallow test and from being incentive from just going for for now me dry up then the market matures and it moves towards a more mature Market cycle which is focused on uh Squad wealth and groups and in longer term orientation and that's where the real uh advancement in the space happens in the alignment between the capital cycle and the actual things that are good for the world and the other analogy that I sort of use is evolution if more people choose uh us in the future doesn't that also create a market opportunity for someone to defect from that and go back to being me now yeah I mean I think it depends on the market structure and whether those opportunities have have dried up or not go ahead one I think I think it's that what we should be shooting for is creating structures where you create alignment between the short-term uh incentive Behavior and the long-term utility so a concrete example about this is how how uh Bitcoin itself solved the the kind of bootstrapping of the network problem you create a very short-term oriented incentive for participants to go and mine Bitcoin out of the out of the ether in a sense um and you then create a way for alignment of the broader Network and the security of the network and the broader distribution of the network and like that's what we should be it's way harder to shoot for that because you have to discard a ton of mechanisms that are that are going to be either it's way easier if you're solving for one thing either short term or long term it's way harder if you're trying to solve for both but if we can create structures that align those incentives where our individual marginal short-term return is what produces the good long-term results like that's that's the promise it's like can we if we can build better infrastructure like that and better um economic Primitives and better services and better um uh yeah a better com economy it can get you there um that's that's what I think is is super cool about not just cool it's like it's a uh extremely promising and already having impact I think it's to the question about the accounting of um you know how the sort of get the utility and the benefits versus the damage um my sense on all of this is like crypto comes out dramatically ahead on on benefit uh even despite all of these big problems because of the utility already created to of having this alternative Financial system that is programmable um that can give you digital rights um that that is a a thing that did not at all exist before in fact you have you just just you can have Smart contracts on ethereum and you can create the Notions of Rights and encode them there and coordinate groups of people to build things like dials to build things like um uh crypto networks like it it's just amazing it's amazing relative to what we had before uh and I think that's already extremely valuable compared to the to the massive you know Capital destruction that some some Drifters along the way have have managed to cause coin shift is a leading treasury management an infrastructure platform for Dows and crypto businesses that need to manage their treasury operations every crypto org

and if you're a builder interested in refi be sure to join the build with sellout hackathon live now with a prize pool of over a hundred thousand dollars I think that one of the challenges that I see and by the way this is an idea that I got from the web 3 is going great episode which just aired on Vanquis um is is Molly Molly white in that episode points out that a lot of the expected value of crypto being good for the world is in the future um whereas we just have to just we just touched the hot stove with FTX this past week and you know I don't totally buy that I mean the the positive um ability for people in Argentina access USD from anywhere do remittances and anywhere in the world uh you know like get coin rounds on climate like those are all things that exist today like uniswap exists today and so I don't totally buy that but I do think that one thing we have to be mindful of an industry is like pushing we need to start realizing those those positive externalities soon and and start scaling them up to be at like FTX 50 billion dollar scale I think yeah there's also the problem that uh all the good things in the world become normal and then all the bad things in the news bad things in the world go on the news like at least it leads right and so like there's also just like a public perception crisis and like in the in in Technologies in their infancy it's like super easy to hate on them right like it's so easy you can just like go to Reddit right now and be like nft is bad and you'll get like 10 000 enough votes um and and so again and now like I think that's probably why I felt like so demoralized this last week and so many in the crypto industry kind of said they felt the same as like there's like what do we take to the normies right now what do we take back home to Thanksgiving and and say hey I'm proud of my industry I'm proud of what I do here uh and like there are very real things like remittance is sick like uh argentines getting out of inflation saving people's lives but like you take it home and people like oh honey I heard like the the Sam bankman guy like ran off to Argentina with uh 10 billion dollars of people's deposits and like it's and like even when you know everything's like the everything is like the real stuff is is there it's like hard to it's like hard to keep on fighting it man it especially hard in countries where uh you have a good Financial stack right so a lot of our perspective comes from eight countries that have good Financial Stacks I was born and grew up in Mexico in a place where um you know it has a lot it's an amazing country really uh natural resource wealthy uh amazing people everywhere super thoughtful long-term oriented in a lot of ways super Community oriented uh and yet massive amount of corruption in governments and in other systems that has created a financial stack that is not aligned with long-term success for communities and is aligned with bribery and Corruption all the way through um and so just the idea that you could have a community of people gathering together um their resources and having it in a secure environment that is not gonna like disappear overnight because like the bank happened to you know have somebody corrupt there that rather the money somewhere else or something like that is a massive massive Improvement and um you know you can sure there's like a you know 50x 50 billion um problem but there's the you know trillion dollar level amount of value created in this broader economy and how much of that is um which ideally segmented out to understand how much of that is um kind of financial instrument speculation versus these broader important use cases and and kind of understand have like the real kpis um that's something maybe that we can do is like create a a kind of here are the crypto kpis that we should all be shooting for uh to create utility for the world what are we aiming for as a community and and what's an honest rating of where we are and where we're headed I think it's probably also important to remember that this was just like one guy who like would didn't care about crypto to begin with right that was like a lot of people's critiques of SPF from the get-go is like the guy openly admits that he's just in crypto for the opportunity like he told that to our faces uh and and so like you know Enron uh like Lehman uh SBF and FTX these are just like one sets of entities I don't know if there's anybody specifically malicious at Lehman but like Bernie Madoff for example or like these are just like one just one like lunatic one like sociopath lunatic who uh did this and like crypto is actually technically like just adjacent to that fact rather than a core part of it like it's interesting that we all feel compelled to like come on and like start to like uh you know make sure we're legitimizing web 3 when it's actually just like this one lunatic in a bank who run out ran off with 10 billion dollars is making us feel this way um like each one of those like the ponzis that happened in the traffic world ended up ultimately coming to bring like regulation but maybe if I'm like thinking with like Rosy colored glasses like well fine then like let's do it because crypto knows how to it's how to regulate ourselves and we have a very strong presence in Congress or in in just like in that legal side of the world uh where I mean I think we're good at that and we've been asking for it for a really long time so maybe there's some good good Silver Lining here yeah I mean I think as long as The Regulators are educated and the political process in Washington works you know I I and and let's keep in mind that SPF and FTX was C5 um whereas you know regulating defy I think is a whole another animal right so um and this might be a useful conversation starter to emphasize that point between defy and C5 that we need The Regulators to understand mm-hmm yeah absolutely that's a great starting point we we probably should have a a website that describes the you know like here's what C5 is here's what D5 is uh here's what refi is um yeah I would look to coin Center and others like them to kind of educate us on how like I've DM them and like let me go on a green pill tour of Capitol Hill and I have a list of 100 different projects that are good for the world and crypto and I just want them to see that you know if they squash this industry what they'll what they'll be losing but uh you know I think that we have to really follow coin Center's lead there yeah and blockchain station might be another good group uh that you can talk to about that uh they work a lot with um with Regulators both in in the US and and outside and uh um look I think right now it's an industry we need to uh get super clear about the difference between C5 and D5 because what is um the kind of knee-jerk reaction here is going to be to say oh look um FDX crypto disaster spell bad and we need to be uh make a hundred percent clear and obvious to everybody in the world that this happened because of traditional Finance rules not because of crypto rules I mean yeah FTX was just kind of Trad fire on on crypto rails yeah yeah it's like of course it's like this is precisely why we're here it's like so that you don't have to trust people to agree on what they wrote on a document right like what happened here at the end of the day is a set of people were supposed to be bound by certain rules and restrictions and they said they were going to do X on paper and they signed it many people and it's not just SPF there's a lot of people here many people did this and yet they went and did something different and that is precisely why we're here so that we can have math that prevents that so that nobody can lie like that nobody can have the ability to take customer funds and move them somewhere else and look it's hard like uh you know there's been a lot of you know another area that we need to improve is making things way less hackable way better smart contract security yeah so that it's not as hard like the reason people go to these C5 things is because they feel safer in some regards than some of it's the bridges that do the do this for me I know how to write a smart contract without re-entrancy attacks but all these Bridge exploits are uh are really are really scary but it seems like so far most of the VCS behind the bridge teams will bail them out so that there's no customer loss funds so it's a little bit different though they will until they won't yeah well you know if we're gonna if my if we're gonna bet on modular blockchains as a foundational layer I just think that the bridges need to get an order of magnitude easier to to use and more secure on that note I think really the solution for that is actually just removing the bridges uh there should just be no Bridges um and I guess is that possible with a layer two I think it's I think it's possible inside I like optimism's code reuse strategy of modularity where like they have different modules and you use that same module over and over and over again I think like modularity is like a probably an important like step to ensuring uh secure code um but maybe it's like the steam engine man maybe but you can always create a derivative in both spots that have some that that track some Oracle somewhere and so on like I I don't think you can like there's one economy on the planet uh right like Humanity has one economy it has subparts and you can try and increase or decrease couplings and yeah we should definitely shouldn't have a bunch of unsafe Bridges um and maybe we should be decreasing the use of bridges for now while we figure out how to get them right um right but if somebody wants to move around value they're going to be able to move around value with synthetic and synthetic instruments it's just a matter of um clearly specifying all the risks and bounding them economically and enforceable by by the code um the fact that right now you can kind of move around assets and they can have lagging prices just opens up an enormous opportunity for all these Arbitrage type movements right so the the Alamedas of the world to move around uh billions from chain to chain to chain um the like relying on kind of uh takers being different and then making a ton of extracting a lot of value it's kind of a movie on steroids um you know cause the MAV problem uh but you know between chains and um that just shouldn't be doable like you should be you should have a much faster information flow between all the chains and you should be able to take much more calculated um uh risks uh with whatever assets you're moving yeah it feels like a lot of this infrastructure is on the road maps not here yet um given that we only have 10 minutes left uh I'd love to reorient the uh conversation around the reason why we're recording this episode which is how can we make crypto good for the world so uh you know I guess that's the question that I'll just re-ask as as we're starting to get into closing here what would have to be true for crypto to be unequivocally massively uh a positive influence on the world uh well I mean I already think it is uh and so like why what boxes have it has it checked that uh makes that true um I I think the answer is like straight up it puts more money and wealth into the hands of more people than it takes away uh and like that can't be true without crypto can't be adopted without that being true like if it's if it takes away money from you people are not going to go there if it gives you money people are gonna go there why do people come in to the top of the bull markets because it's crypto's putting more money in more people's hands uh and like then they leave during the bear markets because that stopped being true but some people stick around because they're like oh I think this still might give me money in the future uh and they stick around during the bear Market uh and it's like why is why is crypto being adopted in Argentina uh well because dye doesn't inflate at the same rate of the peso it's putting more money into more people's hands uh and so uh that's always been it's literally why we were here we're here it's it's kind of about the money money uh and like people that say it's about the technology well the technology is about the money uh and so I think it's just a simple function of like how it is just like sustainable wealth generation at the end of the day it's like crypto is this massive like uh oil well you know you know those oil wells that are like spitting out of the ground and like oh we're all like dancing around this oil I was like oh like wealth generation and now we need to figure out how to make that well never ever ever dry up uh and so like we already have this well spitting out a bunch of like resources that like is enough to sustain this industry at uh 800 billion dollar market cap uh how do we uh engineer using code to make sure that this well never dries up and it actually spews out more oil over time uh that's that's what we need to do one what do you think so same question to you a few things um just one on the on the Oil Well thing it's about uh generating that kind of utility it's like generating the oil type thing and it's not you know it's generating that set of Economic Opportunity um to coordinate us and to and to enable us to improve uh resource allocation um the what I think it needs to be true is first and foremost we need to have um broad digital infrastructure that can give us digital human rights and what that means is uh we need a credible Foundation like robust foundation for speech for transactions for messages for email for broad Communications between humans around the world um that is close like we're relatively close we're not quite there uh but I think once we achieve that Crypt is going to be not dramatically better position in having helped um billions of people around the planet uh the second is we need a we need the financial use cases to be less than 10 percent uh econ economy and economic use cases and financial use case are some somewhat different like individual um uh money and so on an individual private wealth is different from the broad economic um structures that coordinate us and so I think the economy is the world and finance as Wall Street exactly and so like let's make the Wall Street part of crypto tiny in comparison to the other stuff um you know less than 10 ideally um and I think right now I don't know what the percentage is but it's probably like closer to 50 or 60 maybe 70. um and so that needs to get uh much smaller um I mean yeah and that by market cap right probably not by um by maybe the allocation of people working so if you maybe track it by head count of who's working on what um that probably looks different but um the just the the market cap uh probably Stacks it that way and then I think uh one of the things we need to get to is just super user-friendly Primitives that can be deployed quickly right like uh Kevin like we could have we could have avoided This Disaster as a community we could have stepped in and averted the problem we just didn't have the the tools to do it fast enough uh we couldn't coordinate a massive response as a community and even ahead of that we couldn't coordinate the checks and balances on these institutions to make sure they're not drifting people and they're not violating their own rules yeah uh we couldn't could totally establish a a self-regulation type um labeling of exchanges and traditional institutions that tell us which ones are uh legit passing passing requirements um you know don't just count on exchanges out of the goodness of their heart imposing their own rules on themselves like uh you know proof of uh custody and like proof of um reserves and all that kind of stuff but just enforce it at a community-wide level like we don't need any government outside of the outside of crypto to tell us that um and then I think like we need to have a kpi around um being able to have people from around the world billions of people around the world being able to find jobs in crypto jobs to crypto so one of the things that I have always thought has been amazing about the crypto space is that you can be anywhere in the in the world and if you have connectivity to the internet you can find a way to trade your time for money in some in some way to buy food and shelter and so on and that has lifted thousands maybe tens of thousands of people hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty in the world like crypto has probably done that it probably hasn't lifted millions or tens of millions it's probably in the tens to hundreds of thousands um but if we can get that to say the crypto world employs more people are on the planet than almost any other industry where anybody whoever anywhere around the world can look at their own skill sets and find some project to work on some project to contribute to that is going to give them a better alternative than than local employment like that could be a phenomenal place to be in and that's I don't think that's far away from that I also think it's a huge opportunity of growth for web3 because for 97 of humanity their financial lives and by the way we're building the internet of Finance here their financial lives is their jobs and their communities not their their bags and their investment so if crypto wants to grow then I think the internet of jobs and web 3 jobs is is just kind of a necessity this necessity direction that it's going to go to add on to what one was saying the first thing uh one was saying about how like we need to reduce the financial uh parts of crypto to like less than 10 um it makes sense like if you go through the trajectory of crypto like first we made Bitcoin so that's money uh the next big thing that we made was ethereum which is like Finance smart contracts uh and ethereum has largely actually kind of just become one big exchange like if you go to uh ultrasound.money and you look at which applications are burning uh the most ether it's unit Swap and open C like the marketplaces the bazaars um uh and so well that just makes sense right from Genesis like first we make money then we make Finance uh then we make the stock exchanges like that seems like a logical order of operations um now uh we need to put more things on the stock exchange instead of instead of making more money markets or like Leverage stock exchanges or uh like whatever uh we need to make more tokens that go on those things right right and that's like that's the economy side of things that's the culture side of things um and like so bankless for example we're making an nft uh project uh it's one secret uh and this can be like your passport into the web3 into the bank list like version of web3 and like what do you get you get all these extra cool things that will pile on to this token and people are gonna want it because of the things that it does for the owner uh and that's like that's Commerce that's economy not Finance uh and so I I really like that and so like you know we have the stock exchange of this Bazaar where a lot of people go and they trade their goods uh and I think watch is saying like well we need we need like uh neighborhoods and houses and avenues and and business doors for those people to go to and so like sweet we have Wall Street and now we need like the rest of Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens and Staten Island and all these other you know and then and then all of a sudden we have the world um I think that's that's probably what we need we need we need more nouns in the crypto space yeah I think uh what I would do is I would look at the most used applications on the internet so either websites or mobile apps and then sort them by how easy is it to build them in in with crypto in web3 and um then just sort of get started and there are some that are just you can't do today so you know you can't do Twitter on web3 yet there's a lot of work that needs to happen in order to scale to that you know I would guess that's two to three years out but it's not 10 years out um and but can you do um can you make a a much Sounder uh real estate market uh that that might be kind of again close too close to finance maybe uh but that's potentially something I can leverage all of the all of the structures today uh to help a lot of the world especially those those countries that don't have good Financial Stacks um but then you know go beyond that and go into you know what you know whenever I hear people talking about weather games and so on it is always overly financialized like it's like that's not the point it's like hey can we can we go and make the communities and um digital worlds that we love playing and engaging in and we can we make those that activity have regenerative economic Loops in there uh like that that's a very different kind of orientation um and so can hey when is what we're going to be ready for for that kind of um that kind of environment um and yeah look I think I think maybe one what crypto needs to get better is both a an impact compass and a moral compass and if we can make that into websites where you can always go into like you know how how good is scripture for the world dot IO or whatever and you can see the kpis you can see how many people um are now we talked about background Bank well how many people are there really like there are probably hundreds of thousands of millions but not 100 million one what I worry about with that is that people hear that and they just hear ESG and I think that the ESG ratings have a lot of problems with them that people in crypto have pointed out and you know if there's gonna be impact ratings in web 3 they have to be decentralized they can't be capturable they need to actually inform where money and capital rotate into in like a way that has teeth as opposed to I mean I mean I just think that like the ESG thing I I don't think that Reinventing ESG on web3 is is a good direction I know you're not saying that but I just want to say that out loud to the listeners here that we're talking about something fundamentally decentralized uncapturable and uh in a fundamentally new structure that helps rotate capital and talent towards things that are actually good for people and good for the world and and maybe the inverse of of impact ratings for positive stuff is impact rating for negative things like developing an immune system so that we spot the next three AC or the next uh SBF early and almost like a prediction Market where people can be rewarded for for routing those out I think would be the inverse of that and that would be massively useful to the space I think it's also worth noting uh that uh if something like FTX if we're worried about like hey let's make sure we don't get ftxed again uh maybe people should you know take custody of their own assets uh and not do that and like use web three in the way that's meant to be used if we want that world which we do uh account abstraction like has to be mentioned uh like there's there's no way that we we on board the world without account abstraction uh and so I think if this is just like a uh something to be learned about anything or about where to redirect resources uh as a result of this is probably we should make account extraction happen faster yeah and much you know we need I really like Ledger it'd be great to have many devices that are extremely good like that like like why is there only like two or three that are recently good and even those are still pretty hard to use uh and yeah like the kind of abstraction stuff to be able to get you know social recovery and all that kind of stuff is really key um honestly Ledger should really take a leadership position with account abstraction because like they're going to need to Pivot their business model as soon as account abstraction is like uh the new standard new status quo so maybe this is like a call on Ledger like yo like you guys make account abstraction happen because it's going to be super relevant for your business model I think one one last thing I would love to mention is um like this this road is pretty long it's pretty hard a lot of us have been working on this for many it's gonna be like 10 years for me I guess this year is like yeah nine to ten years uh and we've made an enormous amount of progress in a lot of fronts uh I think a lot of us feel that the world is or is magnitude better than it used to be because of some components but it's Pro but we all probably feel it's going too slowly when we look at the social networks and other movements of the internet they've moved faster and so the the big thing that we need to do and coordinate around is understand what's holding us back what's preventing that kind of faster exponential Improvement and get ourselves on a train to to finish that this work faster because we cannot take another 15 years to to get to that success we need to achieve a lot of these things in in five um five to ten and and I think like that's you know um there's a whole other you know um reason to to bet on crypto and and bet on these things around uh it was kind of like describe it here briefly um there's a very strong possibility that the traditional Financial system is going to get something similar to crypto rails like all the cbdcs and so on and it's going to lead to some of the strongest orwellian States ever imaginable because they're going to create a structure where um you know even computers are fast enough that you could literally have before any transaction happens a query going to a centralized database asking should you Kevin should you David right now be allowed to buy this this glass of water or like this this uh this gas for your car or this um this card in the first place and that future could be really dark around the world um we're starting to see it with the Chinese credit system and the prevention of access to infrastructure and prevention of access to travel and and other things um cbdc's and uh the kind of super powerful centralized Financial control that's going to be possible thanks to them um from like enable this kind of very dark potential feature and so there's a a really big thing that crypto is a massive Shield against all of that like if you go back to this afterpunk mailing list and what where it all started uh cryptography in crypto economics it's a massive Shield against that kind of abuse and in if if we're really serious about that and we're gonna complete that work it needs to happen sooner um because these large scale systems are gonna are starting to get deployed um and so the the I I want to kind of like have a really strong call to action in our community to clean up our act to have way higher standards for ourselves than than traditional World um to really focus on the non-financial use cases does that allow for the long term because it's you know it's been 10 years it's going to be a while longer um but really make strong improvements and hold ourselves to those goals like have a mission have specific goals have a plan for when we're going to achieve them and let's get there thanks Juan David wondering if you have any final thoughts no but um I think it's up only from here so there's the place to end all right well thank you both for joining me thank you foreign
