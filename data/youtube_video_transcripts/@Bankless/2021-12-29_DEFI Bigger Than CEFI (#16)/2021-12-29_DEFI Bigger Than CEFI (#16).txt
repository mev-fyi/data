blocking number 16 d5 bigger than c5 and this is a story i think in two parts the first is this we're looking at a tweet from hayden adams uniswap just became the first decentralized trading platform to process over 100 billion in volume and exciting milestone for d5 that on some days was larger than the volume on coinbase also there were some days in 2021 that uh stable coin liquidity and volumes on uniswap v3 dwarfed that of coinbase as well the second part of this story is antonio from dydx i left coinbase and i eventually founded dydx today for the first time dydx is doing more volume than coinbase this d5 protocol deployed on layer 2 now doing more volume than the coin based exchange d5 grew bigger than c5 in a few cases in 2021 and that's a big deal
