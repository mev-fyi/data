[Music] gm gm welcome to overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley very excited to be back again for another recap episode looking at what's been happening over the last week or sometimes last couple weeks in crypto in nfts what are we all talking about what are we all thinking about what are we not thinking about but maybe we should be i don't know here we go we're gonna dive right in so obviously january was a huge month for nfts open c did i think it was like four and a half billion over four and a half billion dollars in volume which is just crazy and the question that we've posed on this show and that i think is being posed in a lot of places is does this mean that nfts are finally decoupled from crypto does the price of crypto have less of an impact or no impact now on what happens in the nft market crypto obviously took a huge tumble and has been holding steady now but after a a big dip and nfts didn't really seem to be affected at all i think the reality is you know the truth is somewhere in the middle as people say i don't think we're fully decoupled these markets will always be intertwined but it does feel like we've broken out in a way where what is happening in the nft market what is affecting the nft market is is more powerful than whatever crypto alone is doing so i don't think that this is something where nfts are simply lagging crypto and a huge dip is coming a dip likely will come in the next couple of months because things are just out of control right now in terms of the way prices are pumping but i don't think that's because crypto dipped and so now we're going to have a lagging dip in in nfts the reason i think we'd have a dip in nfts is again prices are getting really high things are getting really bubbly there's clearly a lot of uh i would say irrational exuberance in the market which is usually a sign that things are gonna settle down i think tax time could be a rude awakening for folks and lead uh some people to realize they need to cash out of their nfts in order to cover some of their tax bills which of course in and of itself will create a new tax bill for next year but i think that i think you will see some some fear happening when people really are aware of what their tax implications or tax situation might be who have been trading crypto and nfts uh but there are plenty of reasons to be bullish too and i want to talk about those uh first and foremost the international markets seem to be hopping heavy on the nft train and the crypto train writ large so i want to highlight a couple things the term nft searches google searches for the term nft passed google searches for the term crypto i think for the first time ever and that was all because of searches coming out of asia so this is something that 999 tweeted maybe we can get that tweet up on the screen here i am believe it or not trying to get to a point someday where i'm just like screen sharing while i talk y'all i know that's probably a more pleasant experience for those of you who watch on youtube rather than who listen on the podcast we'll get there we'll get there we're still a new show we have so many places to grow uh so 999 who uh started open dow and who was sort of famous recently for calling out pudgy penguins and publicizing the fact that pudgy penguins founders were essentially making off with all of the money and that the pudgy penguins project was effectively broke a really honorable influencer it seems in the space uh he tweeted this image of the search histories for nfts and for crypto you can see that search history for nfts is is now above crypto and really it was taiwan japan south korea and then and turkey and russia as well uh but but most pronounced in taiwan japan and south korea where you were seeing just an explosion of people looking up what nfts are now there's a lot being made and i've even speculated about this like is this what's causing certain projects to pump you've got things like azuki's doing really well zip seas is a project this past week that really started to pump though i think that came after pranxy bought some zipsies or or like swept the floor of zipsies both of those um appealing to an asian audience presumably because azuki certainly has is anime style zipsies as well is is sort of very asian influenced and i think zipsies is intentionally trying to appeal to asia it's the cto or or a formal former coinbase guy is the cto for that project so you know there's speculation about what projects are pumping and why and is it because asia's entering the market again i've partaken in this speculation i'm sure there's there's some truth to that i also think we shouldn't you know if you're trying to day trade i wouldn't and you don't know the asian market well i wouldn't overly optimize trying to predict what asia is going to like it's probably a losing strategy in the end it makes me think of poopy talking about when he was running the um when he was running product for cryptokitties one of the failures he he mentioned i did an interview with him recently if you have not heard that go check it out by the way but poopy mentioned that when he was running product for cryptokitties they had a lot of expectations on what it was what was going to happen when cryptokitties entered the asian market they had partnered with i think some apps in in asia and he cited it as one of their bigger failures because nothing happened and you know i think it's really hard if you don't if you're not intimately familiar with the culture and living it every day it's very hard to predict uh other cultures and and probably kind of arrogant to think that we can do so so uh again i've speculated as to what as to you know projects are pumping because asia's entering the market but at the end of the day i really don't know what i'm talking about and uh on that front so uh but it is interesting and it's clearly a growing growing market which is super exciting uh india it just legalized crypto assets or announced that they would be legalizing crypto assets uh this is something biology was was tweeting about and uh sharing links out about i guess there was some uh big meeting the finance minister of india uh made this announcement saying they're gonna be legalizing crypto assets i did not watch the video or read the transcript because it was just way too intellectual for me and i didn't make it happen but that's exciting news and then thailand also out of thailand there was news which is that they are scrapping the 15 crypto tax that they had initially announced they were going to implement so uh this is uh to read this thailand has scrap plans to impose a 15 withholding tax on crypto transactions after facing pushback from traders in one of southeast asia's biggest markets for digital currencies so win after win in the international markets for crypto for nfts uh i'm sure that has some effect on the the pumping we've seen happen lately and uh and is likely to continue so again that's a bullish indicator for the market as a whole getting into some specific projects and and some things i'm looking at uh right now i i think because projects are pumping so much i'm i'm hesitant to buy nfts in bull markets xenica 33 and i were talking about this i think last week which is it's like the paradox of i don't want to buy in bull markets because i know that that can be a stupid time to buy because eventually there'll be a crash again you really need to buy when the market is down and there's a crash but it feels so painful to buy when everything is dropping in prices and so it's really hard to get yourself to buy in a bear market but i also feel nervous to buy in a bull market so i've been trying to look at some things that that i'm bullish on but that aren't pumping right now for one reason or another and one one area that comes to mind are um decentralized metaverse tokens so decentraland and the sandbox both obviously super hyped and got a lot of attention at the end of last year following the meta announcement both their coins pumped quite a bit in the months following facebook's meta announcement and and there was a lot of attention on the metaverse in general obviously corporations everyone suddenly was becoming aware of the term metaverse that has died down a bit obviously metaverse is still uh a big topic and exciting to people but it's not the way it was it's not as frothy as it was right after all these big announcements were made uh and as we focus so much on nfts right now and what's happening to the crypto market i think some of those metaverse platforms are getting less attention which to me signals it might be a good moment to look at at investments in that space so looking at buying sand looking at buying mana both both coins sitting around the two to four dollar range right now and uh you know they haven't they haven't tanked in price by any means i think back when i was looking at it it was like five six dollars uh and i didn't buy then so i think i might buy now uh i think that is exciting rug radio is a project i mentioned on the show a couple weeks ago i want to talk more about it again here i do think this is a really exciting project i'm kind of debating buying more rug radio tokens because there's there's a big drop happening on february 9th we will talk about that i want to dive into a tweet thread in particular that gave an analysis of rug radio as to why they are super bullish on the project but before i do that i want to leave room for us to hear from the wonderful sponsors of the show the groups and people who make this show possible i'm so grateful to you let's hear a word from them axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating

of applications that are available on polygon all right we are back i'm going to dive into rug radio a little bit more here i'm also going to dive into the project creeps which has just been killing it lately and it feels like it's time to highlight and talk a little bit about what they're up to rug radio as a reminder i do own a couple rug tokens i think i bought them after i talked about this project on the pod though so uh y'all had an ample opportunity to buy in if you thought if you thought the project was interesting after hearing it on the pod i bought in at like point three and then i bought it again at 0.5 and they peaked at i think like 1.8 eth the other day i think they're now down around an eighth or so still pretty good return for a couple weeks work and by work i mean doing literally nothing after buying them uh so osf i don't actually know their background let me let me grab this osf nft is the twitter handle here um and they seem to be just a general kind of crypto and an nft investor oh they're the co-founder of canary nft good follower base here general player in the space come for me if you know more about who this account is and i'm not giving them enough credit but anyway they posted this long what they called a mega thread about rug radio they had done something similar i guess for board apes last november they did like a mega thread on board apes and why they were really really bullish on board apes as a project um and they did one on rug radio and i thought it was interesting a couple things to highlight they they said one that they felt like rug radio was likely undervalued because it's a confusing project which is definitely true i talked about it and kind of broke down the project a couple weeks ago on the on the podcast and even at the time i was like oh my god is this just kind of too complicated a process to try and explain on a podcast without visuals like am i talking for too long are people confused because it is it's quite involved there are multiple levels to the tokens here and it's about building a decentralized media company and and it's it's a um it's an ambitious project and so i do think it's quite possible that because of everything that's going on many many people have not really dug deep into what this project is and what they're trying to build or are just confused by all the different layers to it and the components to it and so haven't gotten in so that was sort of argument number one was this is a fairly confusing or i guess i should say complicated project this is not it's not an indictment of the project it's not the project's fault i think faroq has done a really interesting job structuring this thing but it is complicated and that inherently makes it confusing so that's their first point is like look the odds that this is undervalued because people haven't really understood the project yet are high but the the more interesting uh part of this to me was some numerical work that they got into in this thread basically what's going on here is osf is saying is making a couple assumptions one big assumption which is that he's saying okay i think this rug radio platform this if this is a successful web3 media company it'll be valued it'll have a market cap of a billion dollars in five years and he basically works backwards from there and says okay if there's a market cap of a billion dollars here's what the price of the each rug token will be based on what we know the total supply of rug tokens will be and if each rug token is worth this this is then what each individual rug yielding nft should be worth if remember rug is a utility token that gets yielded off of these nfts or that you can you can claim your rug using your rug radiogenesis nft again complicated involved system but that's fundamentally what osf is doing here you can read the details we'll link to the tweet thread and maybe we'll we'll throw up the little chart here but he's working backwards he's saying a successful web3 media company will be worth a billion dollars that this one in particular this one will be worth a billion dollars uh in five years and if you work backwards that means that these tokens are undervalued so i want to give my thoughts on this because i actually agree i do think rug radio tokens are undervalued i think they do have a lot of room to grow this particular analysis do i think this is 100 right i don't know and of course i'm sure osf doesn't know either and they wouldn't claim that they're they're perfectly spot on but i want to i want to poke at it a little bit so first i want to say i think for roke who is the founder of this i think faroq is very talented so i do think that if anyone's going to build the web3 decentralized reigning media company it probably is faroq so bullish on him and clearly bullish on the project i have no idea how to think about market cap or or valuation here and i do happen to have a weird bit of background in uh how web 2 media companies get valued this is a little bit separate from market cap but you know if you're an investor or when you know vcs are looking to fund media properties the way this works is media companies tend to be valued at about 10x revenue so to put this in context if you are a media company if you have a million subscribers who are each paying you ten dollars a month right so each person's paying you 100 120 over the course of a year you've got a million people doing that you've got 100 million or so in revenue you will be a billion dollar media company roughly speaking that's how those valuations work obviously there's changes to this there was an interesting case recently where the athletic which is a media property was bought out for 500 million um and they i think follow that generally they've like a million subscribers at a i think who pay a certain amount i don't know that was a surprising that was like a low ball surprising acquisition 500 million felt like kind of a steal for the athletic but they're apparently on the decline who knows whatever roughly speaking this is generally how media companies in the web 2 world get valued it's really no it's really hard to know how that translates into like market caps and market cap evaluation obviously being slightly different things on the in the web 3 world which is of course what's exciting i'm i'm very interested in media and media companies and how our media functions i think it's very broken i have questions around how much of the brokenness is just fundamental to humans and like humans are broken and so it's inevitable that our media will be broken i don't think a decentralized media platform entirely fixes that by any means and and i might make a note on that as well but i do think it's really interesting i do i am excited about having new models for creating media so anyhow i don't i don't know where this billion dollar number is coming from this billion dollar valuation number i would love to see osf give a little bit more analysis as to how they get there in terms of that billion dollars i think they make comparisons to like facebook which is like a 250 billion dollar company but that doesn't really feel like a fair comparison either and i understand that rug radio is trying to be it's not like necessarily just traditional media it is like broader social media content creation like it's a platform for that kind of work as well so a comparison to something like a facebook who is really like a publishing tool for for content i understand anyhow no idea how to really evaluate this billion dollar number but uh but i'll go with it i think that fundamentally i'll go with the premise that these tokens are undervalued on the basis that these the the the market cap is derived from the dollar value of each individual rug token in supply and the rug tokens will be worth something and if you're holding one of these nfts that is yielding rug your nft will be worth more than whatever it currently is valued at because these rug utility tokens will be worth more so again very bullish on on um on rug radio to be honest we'll see how it plays out and uh it's worth checking out osf's thread i think it's interesting i appreciate them putting it together and putting their thoughts out there anyhow i like these uh call it more quantitative analyses the big big presupposition here is that they will build a successful decentralized web3 media company and that's the nittier grittier stuff that i'm hoping to learn more about and dig more into over the next many months is to understand how they're they're thinking about doing this for oak made an announcement i believe yesterday saying that they had given out the first set of host passes so they've selected the first group of people that are going to be their content creators through this platform so i think it'll be really interesting when those names are announced to see who they are start to dig into are they talented can they sustain a media company so lots to look at there i'm highlighting this because i actually really do think it's an interesting project that that does have a lot of potential always always of course not financial advice but i i do encourage you to look more into it and determine if you are as excited about it as i am i'm like debating buying another one at one eath uh and that's because on february 9th anybody who that's like when the the first rug utility tokens will be i think airdropped to holders and initial holders anybody who's holding them prior to february 9th or prior to the snapshot i don't know when that's exactly getting taken will get like initial reward amounts so like if you hold the the lowest yielding token the standard token you get 555 rug tokens just out out the gate uh you know off the out the bat off the bat uh and so you might want to be holding some in advance of that february 9th date that being said the price will almost certainly drop after february 9th because people who held before will of course have the uh the benefit of getting that that reward drop of like all these rug tokens everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiomfinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto.x or nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts login to web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com okay other project we're talking about today a project i do not own so cannot be accused of shilling my own bag creeps this project has been killing it uh i think two weeks ago the floor price on like the genesis creeps were was like point eight or point eight eight or something and now they're up to like five e 5.4 eth and this project for those who don't know is like a pfp game project right it has the pfp elements but it's it's gamified i've heard people describe the art as very rick and morty ask i think that's true this this project has like a look and feel of rick and morty it feels like a more it's appealing to a more masculine sensibility to me like i can say i am not drawn to this art at all but i've watched like you know bro youtubers talk about this project and they're so hype on the art and i'm like oh this is so funny this is uh this makes sense right this project definitely appeals to a certain audience really profoundly and i am not that audience so the the basic way that this works is is you own these creeps again they do function as pfps but they're also there's this this is really a gaming project and you stake your creeps by staking your creeps you earn lumi which is the in-game utility token that can also be withdrawn as an erc20 token so you can sell it on decentralized exchanges you stake your creeps and then you earn this lumi and the other use for lumi is to use it to buy more things and upgrade your reptilian army upgrade your army in the creeps universe so you can spend lumi within the universe to upgrade your army for an uh an impending game of some sort i believe is the is the concept here and this was founded by two people from from the board ape world uh to board ape holders who i think both come from technical backgrounds the things here that i want to highlight because that on the face of it is is not entirely new right we've seen these stake and earn games now multiple times wolf game obviously is a stake and earn game it's a pretty uh basic uh pretty basic calculation you're making there uh the things that i want to highlight that i think are interesting here is that there are multiple different nfts within the creeps ecosystem so you have the genesis nft but you have this reptilian army series of nfts these shapeshifter nfts and then you have something called the lumi vault and this did strike me as innovative and interesting which is that these lumi vault nfts the amount of lumi that they yield is pegged to the price of the lumi erc20 tokens i think on like decentralized exchanges so i'm gonna read basically how this works so for example if you initiated a claim for the first time so you have your lumi vault token you're initiating a claim for the lumi that you're entitled to because you're staking your lumievault token if you initiate a claim for the first time when the price of lumi was seven cents you'll be rewarded with the the baseline claim of 450 lumi on the next claim if the price of lumi had doubled to 14 cents from 7 cents to 14 cents which is 100 increase on your lumi then you'll be rewarded with the baseline of your 450 lumi plus 100 of 450 so another 450 so you'd get 900 lumi so if the price has doubled then the amount of illumi that you get doubles that's a really interesting mechanic that i personally have not seen before and is kind of a fun way to additionally speculate on the price of lumi if owning lumi is not itself enough speculation on the price of lumi for you this dynamic this like dynamically yielding nft concept i thought was pretty cool uh again the project is killing it so clearly a lot of people are exciting about this you know i'm always a little bit skeptical of these kinds of games that that at least out the gate are a little mlm multi-level marketing e you know they're sort of reliant on new people constantly coming into the system to prop up prices to to kind of keep the whole thing alive but the website is well done they have some legitimate people in the space advising them working on the project the team seems you know legitimate and so they're looking to build a massive brand and a massive game allegedly and and you know they very well might succeed as you can tell i'm not a holder i'm i'm not deep deep into this ecosystem but i wanted to give the overview because it felt like it was time to talk about this project that has been doing very well and to highlight some of the things that they are doing in an interesting and i think novel way okay folks it's story time and this is a story i won't tell the whole thing because i've told it on the podcast before but it's going to get us into the next topic i want to talk about which is not always the sexiest topic and that is nft asset security but it is an important one so here's the story this is a story of a gentleman named rafael lima who started a marketplace that we are going to call hen because the actual pronunciation of the marketplace is unknown i think to all humans i'm kidding there's probably somebody who knows how to pronounce it but that person is not me uh it gets abbreviated to hen very often so that's what i'm calling it hen is is and was a marketplace on the tezos chain that had a lot of activity a lot of users a lot of artists on there and one day in 2021 rafael lima the the initiator of this project he stepped back and like kind of rugged the thing like basically i i think the story was he got frustrated i don't know there was speculation that he was frustrated that other people were stealing his ideas and i don't know whatever the reasons were he like totally walked out on the project and so panic ensued because you had all these artists like what the heck my livelihood is now wrapped up in selling art on hen and collectors were like i bought things on there is all of this just gone and the answer was no the answer was no it was not all gone and in fact the project and the marketplace was able to be rescued pretty nearly in its entirety and at the time i covered the story it was it was you know interesting news and it felt like this amazing case for decentralization because everything was stored in this decentralized way which meant that just because the founder left this one guy left not all was lost well i recently learned the behind the scenes of this story a little bit better which is that yes everything was able to be rescued for the hen marketplace or almost everything but it was not without tremendous effort by heroes and those heroes were club nft which is a i guess company a project founded by art gnome he was one of the art known as one of the first collectors on super rare he has a sub stack that i've read before and liked just an awesome creator content collector in the space and he founded this project or company um club nft in order to help protect crypto assets which is exactly what he did when club nft stepped in to save the hen marketplace we'll get into a little bit tactically how that worked and what that means for you i'm not paid by club nft this is not a shill this is actually i appreciate what they're doing and they are currently running a beta for club nft where you can go on their website fill out some information and be a part of their their beta test to get your crypto assets better protected so that is why i'm highlighting it it hopped on my radar this past week and um and and wanted to to make others aware of it if you were not already so how did club nft save the hen marketplace well folks may know or you may not that most of your crypto assets most of your images that you love so much that are your nfts are not actually stored on chain at all the vast majority of nft images are stored in places like ipfs or aws or any number of other servers and file storage systems so what are these very quickly aws amazon web services that is a centralized way for images to be stored which puts you at risk for if the server goes down you could lose your nft image that's a little scary right you essentially lose your nft because the smart contract your nft is really just a smart contract doesn't actually have the image within it what it has is a is a pointer that says hey that file over there on aws that's the image associated with this nft smart contract so if the server disappears the image disappears oh my goodness your nft smart contract no longer points to anything and you have lost that i don't know how many people are fully aware of that it's worth really understanding that's the risk you're incurring but most or i don't know if that's fair to say but i think many many nft images are actually stored on ipfs which is a decentralized way of storing information so there are nodes running all over the world that you know validate basically the ipfs data system much like a blockchain does and it feels like a safer way to go it is a safer way to go but there are still risks that get incurred and so this is what happened when rafael lima backed out of the hen project leaving everybody freaked out all everything about the hen website the images etc all of that was stored on ipfs and so what club nft swooped in to do was to pin all of that data into nodes they were essentially hosting i i don't know if people want me to go deep into what that means i think i won't and if you're curious we'll put some links below into learning more about what what that actually looks like but the point being there are ways to rescue information on ipfs and and therefore preserve data and information in a scenario like the one that occurred here and so the entire hen website and marketplace was able to be essentially repurposed as it was and the artists were able to save their livelihoods and the collectors felt safe and it's a beautiful story of the power of web3 but it's also a i don't know harbinger's not the right word but it's also a cautionary tale of like we are more at risk than we maybe want to acknowledge go check out club nft what they will do is they from my understanding is they will search your wallet they will look at all your nfts and they will grab the image file and then certain other critical ipfs parameters they'll package that together and they'll send it to you so that if something were to ever happen to your data on ipfs in your particular file storage block by using these particular parameters and the image you have you'll be able to re-upload to ipfs and your smart contract will still point to the right file storage moment and your nft will be protected that doesn't make a whole lot of sense i don't want to dive too much deeper again this is just like the episode for talking about kind of complicated topics and projects so go check it out we'll have links below but their beta is running now wanted to call it out and uh thank you for the folks on twitter who made me aware of this okay last project i want to shout out something that happened this week the ipo epo heroes drop uh i'm gonna talk about this if you follow me on twitter you may have seen me tweeting about this so eponyms this is an eponyms project uh eponyms are i'll just read directly from the discord eponyms are works of art created by the community using a text to art generator developed by art 8 ai so eponyms was this like first series of nfts where folks could use text and then ai would read that text and generate an image based on it the the ai's interpretation of that text which is really cool and if that doesn't set i think it should sound cool but if it doesn't sound cool what you need to do is go to the epo heroes or the eponym website into the epo heroes site where things are still available to mint and try it for yourself because when you actually do it when you actually type in words and then generate this image it feels cool like it's a really cool minting experience and personally as somebody who is more of a words person than like a visual arts person i like music with lyrics more than i have historically liked art of course nfts are starting to get me more into art but in general i'm like a words girl uh it's so fun for me to have an nft experience that's actually sort of text based in this way so what are epo heroes epo heroes are now the the sort of second incarnation of what this eponyms project is doing and they are avatars right you type in a set of words like woman with brown hair and blue eyes and then the ai generates a person for you and you can decide if you like that particular hero or you want to regenerate it so you can play with this thing until you get an image that you like you then name your hero and then when you go to mint it you pick different traits for it like sorcerer or warrior or neo-mancer there's all these different things you can choose if it's good or evil or neutral and then you generate your quote unquote hero these are called the epo heroes and down the line apparently these are going to be animated you're going to be able to make your epo hero talk they're going to airdrop to anybody who has one of these like a 3d character version i believe of the epo hero and this is all apparently in service of building out a game that you'll be able to use your hero in so these different traits you choose like the warrior versus the sorcerer etc all of those will will play into this game down the line and be traits that are relevant in the game i don't even care about any of that i just have fun putting in words and like seeing what characters get generated it is i i do think that they trained this ai on pictures of celebrities because it feels like very often you can generate images that look kind of a lot like a celebrity or like when it first slashes on the screen you're like oh that looks like so-and-so there's one on openc right now that is named scarlett johansson that really does look a lot like scarlett johansson so they definitely trained the ai on celebrities i had wanted to try and get one that looked like me but they're like all of the ones that like they're all just too hot i was joking with my friend last night i was like can i put into the ai like worse cheekbones like less prominent chin like i like i wanted to put in i was like neat just make uglier and so that it can look a little bit more like me because all of these look like goddess celebrity types um anyhow it's a really fun experience this is like truly truly not financial advice i don't know how these will resell that is completely not what this is about for me i do not expect to make money on these this is truly about i think this is super fun and i'm really enjoying the process of minting these and the technology here is really cool i actually realized i think i had heard this team or at least heard part of an interview with this team i think on kevin rose back a while ago and they were talking about what this sort of text ai work could do in the future they were talking about you could end up you know editing videos simply through voice right instead of having to learn a video editing software you could be like hey cut out minute 30 seconds to 2 minute 15 seconds right or you know add a title here right you could use your words the ai could know what you mean and go in and edit the video based on what you're telling it to do rather than you having to manually go in and do it which like blew my mind because as somebody who's like a very mediocre video editor but has has done it at times i would love to be able to just command the thing to do what i want and not have to actually like go in and do it myself or figure out how to do it so a very exciting project i i just think it's sick i encourage you to go check it out and and to keep an eye on this because it feels like they're pushing boundaries and we love it we love a good boundary pusher in this space all right folks that is the show i am hoping this was not uh too laborious for anybody to listen to i hope you learned something i appreciate you all to no end we will be back
