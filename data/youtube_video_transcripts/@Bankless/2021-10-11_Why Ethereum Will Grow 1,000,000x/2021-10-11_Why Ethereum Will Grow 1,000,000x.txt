is this is the subject we really wanted to talk about this is the reason for the roll-up this week so i'm not gonna steal your thunder but i've read everything that paulie uh naya has written i suggest you do the same i know you have two david but give us the tldr take i know we're gonna do a longer podcast on modular blockchains and the future scalability of ethereum how it relates and why we're so excited about this uh concept but uh give us the tl here yeah so we all know the concept of ultrasound money with ether this is going to become ultimately the the narrative of ultra scalable ethereum in the same vein right one half one half of the coin is ultrasound money the other half of the ethereum is ultra-scalable ethereum the way that we get to ultra-scalable ethereum is by this concept called modular blockchains or simply the delegation of labor the separation of labor of how blockchains operate into their respective components where they're where they are optimized for so paulie nyaya who has a great blog who's uh one of the probably the most uh succinct and illustrative um most accessible accessible like yeah illustrators of how this whole rollups plus um data layers of ethereum l1 is going to work the relationships of all these things why naya tweets the first time in 12 years which he is calling the monolithic blockchain era the last 12 years of crypto we had the blockchain trilemma with zk proofs zero knowledge proofs and data sharding we have economies of scale that invert the trilemma the more decentralized you are the more scale there is and the cheaper the transactions get it's a whole new paradigm paulinaya says uh so i think there's a couple more times in the roll-up that we're going to touch on this but basically uh before i get there i'll read the second tweet paulie naya says monolithic blockchains and monolith blockchains are like blockchains that try and do everything at the l1 without any sort of just accessories like roll ups just like cram cram all the things into one one base chain so really quick what that means is ethereum's current state is a monolithic blockchain because it does consensus data and also execution on the same chain and all of the alternative layer ones do that as well solana is trying to do all three of those things as well and that's what he calls a monolithic blockchain but one stuff here is future yes ethereum's future is changing with the merge and then the future upgrades that's undergoing but anyway continue right so polynomial says monolithic blockchains are crippled by moore's law and will only grow 64x over the coming decade modular architectures will grow by 1 million x at the same time the only way the blockchain industry attains global scale um and he finishes off for example 20 by 2030 15 million transactions per second with zk roll-ups on ethereum alone what we are talking about is basically roll-ups but also importantly the illustration of um the execution environment is actually like where when you send a transaction where that transaction actually gets executed you can take that off of the l1 and put it on the l2 then you can leave the consensus side of things to just optimize that on the l1 make the layer one of the theorem really really good at consensus put all of the execution environments where you actually send transactions on the l2s let the l2s bundle them up and then package them in a very very small data footprint and put them on the l1 and this division of labor allows the zk roll ups the the the rollups chains to optimize for being really really fast really really just good execution environments for doing crypto things then the nature of a rollups consolidates it and makes uh and puts it on ethereum which has been optimized for consensus it never ever goes down it's the most up the highest uptime system ever and also has high data availability and basically data availability is like food for the roll-ups right you need the data to be available and you need the data to have the uptime of something that has optimized for up time right so zk roll ups not actually up to optimize for up time like they can actually go down and we actually saw that happen when arbitrage one went down but importantly you can always get your money back out via the the nature of rollups but you let rollups do the execution and you let the ethereum l1 do the consensus and the data availability and this is what allows you to not just like scale linearly like what he's saying with more lot more's law but scale exponentially and this is the future of ultra scalable ethereum and not only is this um really good tech but it's like blockchain agnostic tech and so we're actually also seeing tazos go with this roads map because it's actually a logical conclusion of how blockchains are designed the bad way to do things is try and just like push everything into one single monolithic blockchain and the good way to do things is to optimize the different modular components of a blockchain for what they are good at and allow them to be really really good at those things and allow them to come together as a modular system that is the narrative that's going to be happening over ethereum over the next few weeks and the reason that a monolithic blockchain design is bad is because if you want to scale you have to sacrifice decentralization in order to do it you have to disallow individuals from running their own nodes you have to run those nodes in data centers where large institutions large organizations in order to do it so you sacrifice security and you sacrifice decentralization there's so much to unpack here like we'll talk about a couple more times in the episode dave and i are going to do an entire podcast about this in the future coming up with an agenda for that but keep this in mind ultra scalability uh that is the future for ethereum and it happens through this modular blockchain design that ethereum is kind of silently pivoting to you i don't think anyone's really picked up on this until paulie and i have started posting it's been sort of the it's been the design path but there hasn't really been a term or a narrative or a way to share what's actually going on here's another modular block jane take because it's modular blockchain roll-up today what's this take yeah this is coming out of a chain-link god who i actually had the pleasure of meeting in new york a couple weeks ago optimistic he's not a frog real person he's not a frog yeah all right say no more optimistic roll ups zk roll ups of lydium's volitions means a shift from a monolithic blockchain model to segregating security data availability and execution into different layers the key is to not just mitigating the blockchain trilemma but inverting it aka solving it um so yeah it's just hammering the point home the era of modular blockchains are upon us and that is not it's how we go from just like a little bit more scale to like almost infinitely more scale when you say other blockchains when you say upon us it's like just starting right that's why we haven't felt its effect yet right we still need a few other key technologies uidx users have felt it dydx users have felt it we'll get to that soon too um but let's look at this this looks like a uh a galaxy a spiral nice spiral galaxy image i'll read out the tweet in q1 2021 eth settled 1.5 trillion in transactions more than all other blockchains combined in 2022 zk rollups and a started data structure could increase each max throughput from 45 transactions per second to 100 000 transactions per second setting the stage for eve to become the universal store of value this is a spiral galaxy with eth in the center where sort of the the black hole would be all the you know star clusters yeah clustered in the center and it's all of the various m1 that is like circulating currency 35 trillion m2 currency and savings 60 trillion stocks bonds real estate derivatives all swirling around the black hole the gravity vortex the singularity that is ethereum and i think that's a good analogy any other takes yeah this also lends itself towards the modular blockchain narrative because all of these different use cases need different constructions and when you have a single monolithic blockchain you force every use case to just operate under the same structure the same monolithic structure but these the validiums volitions zk roll-ups optimistic roll-ups they offer different components that you can piece together as you see fit that is optimized for your specific use case and so having this modularity allows ethereum and all of its layer twos to be constructed in a way that is optimized for that specific use case and one thing that ethereum does very very well is it uh maximizes choice for the developers and for the users and when choice is maximized innovation explodes guys if you're having trouble with some of the terminology like you know zk roll up zero knowledge or validiums or volitions never fear just keep tuning in to bankless we will have some episodes for you that dive into these topics in detail um but david and end of the show almost end of the show i gotta ask you the question we always talk about which is what are you excited about this week all right i'm excited about modular blockchains i think modular blockchains are the future uh that is how we solve basically everything when crypto says like it wants to take over or ethereum people say like we're going to tokenize everything well we need the appropriate infrastructure to do that and like i just said when you have modularity you get to optimize for that specific module and what it is good for so let's put the the consensus module in the consensus corner and optimize for that let's put the execution in the execution corner and optimize for that and give all the all options available to everyone how they want to construct their layer two uh and so we are we've been hammering this from the beginning of bank list is like eventually we are all going to live on layer twos and these layer twos are going to have different flavors and eventually all of the flavors to do what ethereum needs to do to put the entire universe on ethereum that has always been the goal and a modular blockchain is how you become expressive enough to allow for optionality for everything to eventually become uh something on ethereum that's what i'm excited about that's cool man what are you excited about ryan you know i'm i'm gonna plus one on that oh yeah you're excited about modular blockchains yeah i'm just gonna riff on that right it's like a different way it's like so i think one of the things uh we've been able to do is identify things a little bit early at least some things right so like back in 2018 we're telling everyone that eth as a monetary asset as a store of value is undervalued that's when we come up with ideas like eth as a triple point asset right staking you know eip 1559 all of these other characteristics that would be built in would turn ethereum and ether as an asset into a bond into a very valuable store of value that um is likely far more valuable than than even bitcoin so we identified that early and it was underrated at the time no one believed it at the time here's the underrated yeah massively underrated no one believed it i believe we're at the point in time where ethereum's scalability strategy is just as underrated as ethi asset was back in 2018 and 2019 okay i'm just gonna say i think ethereum has the best scalability strategy in crypto right now and nobody knows it yeah it's driving me it's driving me crazy okay because like um people are saying oh eth can't scale and that's why x chain or y chain or like that's why we need all of these things and it's like no it hasn't compromised on decentralization security but it is scaling and its scalability strategy is far more robust and uh far more achievable and actually far more scalable than any of these other solutions it's just taking the time to do it right and keep things decentralizat decentralized polynya 15 million transactions per second is a rough estimate by the end of 2030. it's coming like there's cryptography magic like zk roll up zk sync it's all coming people just are impatient and they run and they chase the narrative and they run they chase the next eath killer and i think it's going to cost investors uh some money but like if you don't believe ethereum is scaling today to your point earlier david go try dydx right like it has the deepest liquid we just had antonio on bankless this week the deepest liquidity in all crypto this is not just decentralized exchanges crypto exchanges too for some of their assets the deepest liquidity um they're doing like 8 billion in daily volume 8 billion in daily volume all secured by ethereum don't tell me ethereum is not scalable it's scaling now you just haven't put in the effort to actually like make it scale and you haven't waited until some of these scale scalability strategies come in line and the reason is not the reason i like this is not because like you know people say oh he's an ethereum maximalist right all he cares about is ethereum no i care about decentralization the ability to run your own node bitcoin preserves this okay ethereum preserves this there are few if any other networks that are focused on security and decentralization right now i love solana as an execution layer fantastic for a roll-up avalanche too hell they can all come to the party they can all play they can all be execution layers and roll-ups but let's not sacrifice the only thing that makes crypto great which is it's decentralization it's security it's self-sovereignty that is why we're here in the industry and um yeah i think it's massively underrated right now and people will wake up a year from now two years from now that's how long it took for ethy asset to be publicly recognized and they'll realize that this is the case that oh well back in 2021 when everyone was saying eth is not scalable and eth is dead and now some other chain is far more scalable they actually have the best scalability strategy the entire time that's my prediction right and the reason why it's not here yet is because when you don't cut corners it actually takes longer to get there i think one thing that paul and i said and the reason why this uh weekly roll up is the blockchain modularity roll up because uh paulie nya's writing has just recently come on to the scene at least for you and me ryan other anthony people like anthony suzanna have tapped into this a little bit earlier but like they just make it really really accessible and understandable so definitely recommend reading his blog post if you want to get into the details about why we're so excited about this i think the big point that listeners should understand and i'll do my best to explain it here you're gonna go need to read his own writing to understand why it's true is that when you optimize for decentralization and you put decentralization first under a roll-up paradigm that the more decentralized you get actually scales with how scalable you can get right and so you typically previously when you optimized for decentralization you also you actually reduced scale that's the those are uh the same spectrum you can either have scale or you can have a trilemma that was a trilemma now with under a blockchain uh roll up paradigm the more decentralized you get the more uh the better your your node architecture is and how many nodes there are gives a roll up stronger assurances as to their settlements and so you actually are able to increase throughput on layer twos by adding decentralization at the layer one so more decentralization more scale which is completely like paradigm shift with how scale it should be thought of and anyone that thinks that you scale a blockchain by scaling at the l1 should understand that sacrificing decentralization at the l1 sacrifices the ability to have layer twos and layer twos are where you go from you know going from like 45 transactions to a second to a hundred million transactions per second that can oh 100 million transactions per second can only ever happen at a database layer a no a one of one nodes or on layer twos and the the way that it happens on layer two is if the main chain is maximized for decentralization you actually get the bajillion transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization this is the way blockchains are scaling this is technology that's independent and agnostic of political alignment is it roll-ups are not an ethereum technology like i said earlier in the show tezos is also going by the same road map because developers have come to this logical conclusion as this is how a blockchain should work uh and so that is why we are excited about this tezos uh near too you know a number of them have discarded the monolithic blockchain strategy i think that's what it is for us like bottom line is long-term games right i think this is the long-term game and the short-term game are these monolithic blockchains right now hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how to free yourself from
