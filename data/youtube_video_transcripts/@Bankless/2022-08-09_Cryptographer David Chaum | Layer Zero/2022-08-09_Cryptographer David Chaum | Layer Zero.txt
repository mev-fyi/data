welcome to layer zero larry zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the cryptography community cryptography is of course built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the cryptography community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because cryptography is people all the way down and it always has been now you might have noticed a little difference in that intro and that's because i have not a member of the crypto community not a member of the ethereum community but a member of the og cryptography community and i do admit it doesn't make complete sense to say that cryptography is people all the way down because actually cryptography is one of the few things that is strictly math through and through and through today on the show i have on david chom if you don't know who that is you need to do a little homework because we live in an industry that is built upon david chom's work he's the founder of digicash one of the early experiments into online cash but mainly one of the big proponents of privacy at all costs where not just the data about a message is private but all of the metadata is private too and i'd like to read a quote out to help emphasize the importance of who david chom is and what he's done for this industry this is chom's warning to the world in 1985 where he talks about the dangers of user data that is building up around computing systems he says computerization is robbing individuals of the ability to monitor and control the ways information about them is used already public and private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves individuals individuals have no way of knowing if this information is accurate outdated or otherwise inappropriate new and more serious dangers derive from computerized pattern recognition techniques even a small group of them tapping into data gathered every day in consumer transactions could secretly conduct mass surveillance inferring individuals lifestyles activities and associations the automation of payment and other consumer transactions is expanding these dangers to an unprecedented extent projecting this the vision of these two futures one built with current technology and one will built with decentralized services david chom saw that the two approaches appear to hold quite different answers large-scale automated transaction systems are imminent and as the initial choice for their architecture gathers economic and social momentum it becomes increasingly difficult to reverse whichever approach it prevails it will likely have a profound and enduring impact on our economic freedom democracy and our informational rights david trump said this in 1985 before we had surveillance capitalism before we had web 2 and before we have the state of you know facebook instagram all this collection of metadata and the reselling to targeted ads um and and all these other practices that we now deem evil in this world but we now also have to live with uh and so david trump saw this in 1985 which is one of the reasons why he's such a fantastic character and he's been dedicating his life to building private cryptographic systems that protect users data and not just the packet not not just the contents of messages but all of the data that those messages leak as in who is the sender who's the receiver how big is that message uh what time was that message sent all of these bits of data that create a sudoku puzzle that's solvable to track who we live in the world of what we now call the metaverse what was previously called just our online footprint david chom his name is on this shirt if you aren't uh if you aren't watching the podcast it's the shirt with all the cryptographers that this industry is built on and so i will stop with my gushing and allow this conversation to progress into one of the core cryptographers that this entire crypto industry is built on right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eth by staking it with rocketpool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16 eth to get started you're getting an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled ethe that uses your node to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their

david trum i am so honored to have you on the slayer zero podcast welcome to bankless hey says so great to be here with you david uh so david yeah there was this episode that we did on bank list a while ago called before bitcoin and it was just a reading of one of my friends explorations into the early days of cryptography and i think that's something that this crypto industry really forgets to pay attention to as to the significance of the shoulders of giants that this industry stands on uh and so i really want to go and explore that part of crypto crypto's history like the the pre-currency side of this industry going back to our roots and going back to the cryptography side of this industry uh are you ready to go down that journey with me sure sure it's uh yeah i think you're right it's something that most people don't pay enough attention to these days although it is a layer sort of below what we're using today in a sense but yeah we can talk about it sure yeah and i actually want to start at the very beginning uh cryptography has many different parallels that are less about math right like uh just like it's a it's a puzzle uh it's a it's a lock that you try and break i'm wondering when you were growing up as a child what were like the early indications or characteristics that or things that you like to pay attention to that later would be obvious about cryptography i love you yes i was uh you know really the truth is that i appreciated the super strength of secrets as a child much yeah of course i was interested in all kinds of security mechanisms and and this sort of thing but i really had a reverence for how powerful it is if you know something and no one else does and i thought that maybe there was a way to leverage that to help make the world a better place and what were some of those first things that that captured your attention when you were young well you know it was a different growing up than a lot of i think your listeners have so i've had because you know there was the anti-war movement and i was uh you know very much uh caught up in all that kind of thing and um you know i learned how to program computers by punching the the little squares out of the hollywood cards with a toothpick that would give the deck and then the weekend the next week we'd go to you know uh back to the science museum and they'd give us the output from the you know fortran program and it would say you know invalid punch in column six failed you know to stop repeat this process um you know so it was uh i was interested in all kinds of uh things but i i think the the the really um powerful force in my uh youth was the idea that the world really needed it was going to go off in the wrong direction and it really needed some help and the power of secrecy maybe could be leveraged uh for that so that's kind of you know they say people know their life story when they're six or something have you ever read that you know they yeah something like that do you have any uh what was the indications that that uh came to you that the world was about to go off the rails for example like what don't forget we we think that you know like you know january 6 was a you know unprecedented big deal but when i was growing up you know there was uh the whole watergate thing and people found that you know equally shocking and uh you know it's there's i think there's a common thread running through a lot of that stuff but um yeah it's it's uh you know the war vietnam was not really that popular but it was a pretty tragic thing and i think it it polarized and galvanized but there was a very different era you know people were uh extremely uh excited about the future as well because there was a lot a lot of other uh vectors besides that one you know um the war and all but yeah i think um yeah the power of technology to influence society you know it was very much top of mind also with nuclear weapons for example in those days and uh you know cold war and all these things it was um yeah so as someone interested in technology uh i could see that this was something that you know could be used by the powers that be in their standard way of using uh these kind of mechanisms and so on to sort of buttress their position and not really innovatively or maybe there was a different way through yeah i i'm wondering if you thought about technology back back then back in the 60s 70s but also its relationship to politics and institutions i i'm wondering when did you make that connection or or did you i i'm afraid i did and i you know i could you know i got a little bit of trouble here and there for kind of you know doing stuff and i was um uh also like kind of a student of what the government was doing with uh technology you know and i would call people up and pretend to be like uh you know i don't know much older than i was and find out all kinds of things and then people started like threatening me because they felt that i was you know uh prying into things that that i shouldn't and uh and so forth you know sometimes like these you know i'd call these companies and then they would kind of send me over to some other guy who tried to entrap me you know he was some kind of spook that worked there i mean this scary stuff like that happened it was uh you know there was it was a different different time you know you could order manuals for like you know the kind of uh all kinds of uh stuff for free like how to build an ibm system 360 out of you know or how to um you know how uh the very sophisticated burglar alarm technology worked or uh all kinds of stuff was a little more available in those days and uh so i was interested in all these things um but with an eye towards uh seeing how they could be deployed to in the in the people's interests as opposed to institutional interests i'd like to uh jump to your uh time at berkeley uh what was your major at berkeley oh well uh you know i was a i was a uh a graduate student there i had gotten this like four-year graduate fellowship regions for your graduate fellowship they only gave one every two years and uh for ucla and i transferred to berkeley after the first quarter you know i was like i i felt you know i was much happier there and now but most of the people who are doing cryptography they're left uh at the end you know so there were one guy went to work for the for the government and another guy went to try to influence government and uh so you know and and merkel had left uh then and and so on but um it was uh uh it was fantastic being there it was the beginning of you know we had my advisor will ran the berkeley uh linux unix uh distribution project and so my office mate was eric schmidt you know just the two of us sat in this office looking out at the at the bell tower and bill joy for what i found her son was uh you know kind of around the corner you know you know talked to him a lot and um so it was a very exciting uh uh place but there was also this feeling like you know the government wants you to work for them you know and this is a lot of the funding was from darpa and you know all kinds of government agencies and military organizations and um you know a lot of big corporation stuff and then there were a lot of people that didn't really want to participate in that and uh you know so um i mean i i saw one of these uh you know the the darpa funding all you know they always had the tagline their posters and stuff darpa a mission oriented agency and so i thought you know i'm going to be a mission oriented agency and and i really decided just to devote myself to trying to use cryptography to uh make the world more let's say democratic and that was my mission and i've basically stuck with that over the last 40 years you know so there were uh people who were in sort of the you know the layer minus one of cryptography let's say was public heat cryptography you know and this is a big deal when it was invented and uh you know so i knew all these people like diffy was a buddy of mine then he moved he lived right at the border of berkeley but then he moved to mountain view and uh uh so you know and so marty hellman and so ralph merkel had invented public key cryptography but no one would want to publish it his paper so it was only published like 10 years later with apologies you know he didn't but diffie and hellman their paper was published at a conference and um you know then um uh it turns out that some uh smart summer intern at the british nsa had also invented public key cryptography earlier right than these guys and now he's running that place so it it you know and then there was you know so there was the rsa work you know as well and i i knew uh those folks uh of course as well and um but you know this was also an area that's hard hard to appreciate these days because there was government pressure not to do research in cryptography no public research and in fact the head of the national security agency the nsa you know it's a pretty serious organization started uh in effect saying that that cryptography could be considered born classified right like nuclear secrets so if you just thought of it yourself it could still be classified automatically and so and there was this guy started writing letters to uh the the major you know ieee acm the major uh scientific organization don't have any conferences or sessions on cryptography we're going to throw the book at you and this was reported in science magazine you can read about it on my website charm.com and i saw that i thought well man this cannot stand because cryptography is too important a technology to put you know to empower individuals and so i um you know i sat in my apartment with my girlfriend and we stuffed the envelopes for this we created a you know had a conference on cryptography uh we did it without using the phone so we got the label the address is on paper from lynn edelman and we you know we got went down to this place where they printed the free press a little like off of telegraph avenue you know this little print shop where it was like you know don't ask don't tell just you know pay us casual print stuff and um they printed the invitations and you know mailed them out and so but almost uh most people that were interested that we knew of in the field came uh to the conference about 100 people and um you know i stood up there and because as the general chairman organizer i just sit up on the stage and said okay you know thanks for coming you know lunch will be 12 30 or whatever but bathrooms are over there but now that you paid your whatever it was like 75 bucks you're now a member of the international association for cryptologic research which i secretly founded and these are the officers and the next event will be in italy and this guy's gonna run it uh you know and um so there was a handful of people attending in suits kind of like with their name badges all said you know private citizen from you know laurel maryland where the nsa is that you'd want to say that they were working for uc but they were all there in the front row they were very anxious and i i you could just see them all turn green because it was over you know they were trying to stop this research but at that point um you know because it was an international organization now it's basically backed by the u.n and you know they just do they couldn't stop it so they never like put me in jail or anything so um yeah i said cryptography free and that's still the major organization by far this that does research and photography we have three conferences every year plus a handful of workshops every year and published the proceeding you know the uh journal of tryptophy and a bunch of you know proceedings and it's the main event so it really created a community uh you know pretty vibrant uh still and and of course all of this is going on during the whole uh counterculture of the late 60s and 70s right and i'm wondering how much of that count that counterculture zeitgeist of the 70s worked its way into the cryptography community because it sounds like you you are quite rebellious um but i'm wondering like how were if you were a cryptographer were you likely also a rebel or were you more willing to work inside of state lines or was everyone kind of on board with the whole uh we are not a part of we don't work for the government we work for cryptography so overall what would you say is the rebellious nature of the cryptocurrency photographers i don't want to be lumped in with the rest yeah i don't think it's fair to do so uh because my you know angle if you were my vector my approach my mission has been as i've mentioned to use cryptography to protect members of society and to protect democracy and to allow democracy to flourish and uh that entails what i call and what is called privacy technology basically mixing and blind signatures to put it very simply i refer back maybe to your earlier show you mentioned so um uh you know the rest of the the community was not working on that kind of stuff they're working on the layer below that which is you know encryption and public key encryption um you know it's a lot of good work and hard work but it's all about communication uh security of the very basic type that you understand when you're a little kid you know you have the key you send the message you encrypt it you send the message counterparty has the key they decrypt it and and they get it and the eavesdropper can't hear it can't i can't understand it you know you can't decipher it so that was the uh thing that you know zimmerman and all these guys focused on that and the uh you know the government was trying to block this sort of thing they didn't want people to use it and they were trying to wheel out since they couldn't do the board classified thing they were saying well now it's uh you know export controls and this and that it's military equipment and you can't but um that was a whole war crypto wars unbelievable went on for a long time and there were all kinds of advocacy groups and people focused on that but i steered clear of all that so i was pretty much the only one working on privacy technology the layer above that so hiding who talks to who and when the social graph what's called traffic preventing traffic analysis and allowing payments in such a a context not to unwind uh the protections and so it was a bit different and uh only now with the xx network i don't want to jump forward but you know we have this uh i founded the this project x6 uh network and uh it has a messenger and it protects uh privacy and so forth now you know i have to get i have to include the end-to-end encryption as well and be involved in that but that's another story because none of the messengers today you know even though people moved to them thinking they were more private none of them has uh quantum resistance encryption and we do and we announced it very widely and no one no one followed suit so it's like uh i think that that proves basically that that that has never really been the issue the real issue is is traffic is the metadata since we used to call it was military i used to call it traffic analysis you know because it's far more revealing and harder to um you know compromise by lying or you know misleading people and so on yet there's a paper you that you wrote on this titled untraceable electronic mail return addresses and digital signatures but there was a paper so right uh and but there was a paper but i want to get there but before there was a paper that you didn't write that was monumental in the world of crypto called a new direction in cryptography from martin hellman paper right but that was about that was about you know and then encryption so basically it's a simple it's the thing i was mentioning before conventional cryptography it right you basically have to drag the key that you make up over to the other guy person and then you too can can use it to keep the eavesdropper from listening in with with the advent of public key cryptography which i i mentioned you know the different people that come up with it uh you could publish one of the keys and anyone could use it to uh let's say encrypt a message that you could receive um that you could uniquely receive and and that that made it so you didn't have to physically transport the keys you you you it was a you still had to make sure you were using the right keys it's not a complete panacea but that's right yes yeah that was that was a you know that paper and i think the rsa paper were uh you know widely uh heralded and influential uh sort of brought cryptography out from the you know little codes that you did as a kid out into this uh modern cryptography world but it was fought by governments and you know it was it was a it was a whole war and uh in the end you know you sort of think the government lost but really they won because they were able to delay this uh dramatically and uh and i think then in the end misdirect people into focusing on that stuff and ignoring the metadata for for the longest time until now right certainly yeah and this goes to what you were saying where this whole the this was the foundation that cryptography is built on but what you were doing is something a little bit more applied a little bit more on the data and privacy layer on on top of like this basic cryptography but i but and then you know new kinds of cryptography in order to do the privacy stuff right so the the mixing paper that you referenced you know you could build that just from public key just for the basic but for the payments which are also needed you have to have privacy and payments otherwise it'll ruin the privacy the unlinkability that you would have in communication right uh you know you'd be linked by your payments in order to achieve payment privacy at least in those days it was thought that you needed these innovation the blind signatures which i created and i created a whole bunch of other kinds of signatures and no one else really did you know the undeniable signatures and the all these other stuff so it was uh uh it extended the functionality of the primitives uh with new features that that have proved to be of enduring uh value and so it it wasn't just really building on an earlier layer it used those things but it also had fundamental cryptographic insights of its own that enabled its unique uh protections there's a quote that i want to read that i'm hoping that you can uh help elaborate for for the listener uh this is coming from tom's warning to the world in in 1985 again from this before bitcoin series where you say that there are dangers of user data that is building up around computing systems i'm wondering if you could unpack this quote and tell us what this means well i mean you know basically it it was my realization early on that the only way that there were only two ways you could read in my early papers like in in the uh scientific american and the the earlier version of that that was published in this academic uh cover of academic journals it uh basically always said there's only two ways that technology could go and we see it today you know it's one way is where the powers that be can see everything you do you know and the other way is where you have the keys to prevent that and you run the show from you have the you control the the use of your own information by possession of your own keys and those are the two competing scenarios there's really no halfway middle ground then you know it's really starting to come to a head now because the fundamental difference between china as we perceive it you know in the west here and the and our ethos of of personal uh liberty and rights and so on liberal democracy is uh you know is crystallized in the simple question of does your messenger allow the government to see who you talk to and when or not that's basically what it comes down to we chat people in china know that we chat you know can see everything they do and that information is available to the government so it's a kind of panopticon you know it's it's uh it has a chilling effect on society but it's um uh that's the way they want to do it and what i said in 2018 was that you know our the xx messenger the xxx network project was going to and the xbox messenger was going to be a wechat with privacy built in and that's what we've done now and that's the fundamental difference so you know we talked you hear a lot about cbdc is that something you talked about on your certainly yeah well you know there's only two kinds of cbdc there's the kind with privacy and the kind without and you know when the the european central bank had a whole big comment thing on on cbdc you know the majority of the comments were about privacy that people wanted it and so it's not easy to get in the cbdc uh but you know if if we do a cbdc like that just fully uh surveillance uh capable it doesn't give the actual privacy keys to the users allow them to create them then um you know we're not going to have the moral high ground over uh over china i mean if people are trying to precipitate some kind of new cold war or something i i'm not a big fan of that but uh it would seem that the basis of it is that this is not a free society and they're spying on people and you know the state has too much power and that really comes down to does we can we chat see who you talk to or not and what kind of cbdc are we going to build and what kind of messages are we going to have the ones that actually let you protect that or it's going to be like trust us you know or the government has the keys because we might need to check on you you know and all that you know that's that's uh that's basically the the fork in the road and i i wrote about that and saw that a very early on uh in no uncertain terms and it remains the central issue because it's so fundamental there's no way to protect your own from your own information unless you have the keys to it you know it's you just can't trust other people with your keys because you don't know if they leak what they leak and what they do and so it's as simple as that this is one of the immaculate parts of your story i think is that in 1985 you talked about this fork in the road where one would leave lead to a panopticon and one would lead to user privacy and it seems to have gotten true yes certainly and it seems to only get more and more and more true as our technology these days becomes more and more powerful no yeah people are realizing it now the surveys show you know we hear a lot about web3 but look at the surveys they show international and u.s surveys the major you know giant thousand people surveyed show that people find three quarters of people find privacy of the internet so web 2 as the biggest problem the one thing they really don't like it's also the top three things they don't like you know different different names you know so it's like the world has come around to the you know so if you're gonna build web three you better build something that people want which is something that that that that allows them to protect their own information it's not good enough that you say you're going to protect it or that you know there's a presumption that you will that's that's just not going to cut it these days and uh so that's that's the hope for me for web3 and that's basically wechat with privacy inside that's the thin end of the wedge and then from there you can build out uh more privacy platform and then uh you know there's other things that you want to decentralize of course and you know and i mean and i'm not trying to diminish the significance of you know the new kind of um uh model said paradigms that have uh you know uh emerged from the from the for the crypto blockchain space i mean there's a lot of interesting uh new stuff but uh that's the fundamental uh divide yeah still what would you say can you take us back to david trauma in 1985 and tell us what made it so obvious that there was this massive fork in the road like what did you see that no one else saw back in 1985 i saw it in the late 70s it was like 79 yeah it was the first i published the mixing article which now there's 65 000 references to in technical papers i don't know what that translates into in terms of likes but i think it's a lot and so because it's not you know they had to say something about it i guess so it's um you know that i was sitting in a hot tub in berkeley with my professor okay you know we were wearing you know swim trunks or whatever it was like you know it was like he had this hot tub in his backyard come on over you know a house you know we'll talk you know about your research and you know that's the way it was you know it's not like now you know where people are afraid to you know go to professor's house and hang out and uh so we had like the redwood trees in his backyard you know sitting there and looking up at the redwood trees and try to figure out well if we really need to solve the privacy problem how can we work on that let's see what would be the simplest kind of basic uh uh problem that you could start with you know to tr you know the kind of toy problem to work on it you know that's the way often you sort of get head you know make make progress in science and so you know i said well voting you know we'll just work on voting and so i came up with mixnets to solve voting and that's it's still in that mixed paper there's a couple paragraphs on the voting but it's a little bit broader than that you know then i read this article uh this guy named paul baron at the rand institute you know like these uh kind of government-sponsored think tank that you know was involved in all kinds of spooky stuff um you know they were talking about traffic analysis and all this and i'm like this is bad news so yeah i that's i was like doubly motivated uh uh to to to work on it in uh you know in those days so um yeah i think what gave me the insight that you know circle back your question is is that i knew that you could solve it i think that you know it's still the case a lot of people think oh you know i can't i know there's flying on me they're they're spamming me with fake news they're this and that they're exploiting my data for making money off it but you know what can i do i need to be on this or that platform to you know i you know this you know there's nowhere else to go really you can't really vote with your feet i mean some of the platforms that have held themselves out like i said to provide privacy i now really question i don't want to you know malign them but i i challenge you to find any messenger besides the exit you know the elixir that actually uses quantum resistant security on the end and encryption so they've always been saying using you know end and encryption that's the be all that's why you should move toward but it's it's fake because they're not upgrading it and the us government has you know there's a presidential directive all government has to use quantum resistant uh vpn and everything because otherwise you know the point is you know for privacy if you know you may think quantum resistance has something has some tinfoil hat connection but it actually for privacy it's like extremely conservative and solid because it's not questioned that quantum computers will ultimately be able to break these codes that are used you know because people use public key to set up the communications quantum computers can break it and so ironically so uh you know ed snowden told us that the government was involved in what they called the full take they capture everything and they save it they've always been doing that we knew that back back in the day the the nsa said oh as soon as you use magnetic tapes with all those phone records on them you know we'll give you brand new tapes in exchange and the phone company said oh that's that's great you know it's like yeah they have these huge facilities so you could you know look them up online it's frightening like store all this stuff or they're just waiting or maybe they already have quantum computers or whatever when they're interested enough they'll be able to you know to look into that data retroactively and so governments have taken the affirmative and stop this possibility and i think that the public should as well but the people that we're trusting with to help us seem to be asleep at the switch and that's leaving the whole metadata issue out there is no messenger out there besides elixir that's protecting your metadata so they all just keep talking about how they have strong and encryption but it's not that strong anymore you know it's it's public key based which means it's it can be broken by quantum computer so um yeah i mean roughly speaking you know it's so it's based on uh you know earlier and government standardized public equipment systems which are um yeah uh so yeah i think it yeah it was you know the more i looked into it okay i said well great i've got this communication system that can solve the metadata problem that can solve keep confidential who you talk to and when but then i have to find a way to do payments over that system that that doesn't undo the privacy and i found that and then the third and final piece with bicyclists was that the blind signatures could actually be generalized into what i call the credential mechanism that which you might think of as a kind of zero knowledge or disclosure proofs or something like that but it's a little different than that that allows you to basically answer you know you can keep the full database of information about yourself that normally would be uh under the current paradigm would be maintained piecemeal by different organizations you know government agencies and companies and so on and they could potentially link all your records together by your identity right you could maintain all that data yourself they wouldn't have it because you would deal with each of them under a different digital pseudonym live different public key uh and then if they wanted to know something about you they could ask you and then you would you could answer if you chose to in whatever way you wanted but then you could prove that your answer was correct with like zero knowledge minimum disclosure this was the cryptographic stuff so that you could achieve so basically you could organize society that way only you would know who you talked to when you could do payments privately and the database of information about yourself would be your exclusive property but i argued in those papers in the mid 80s that the the data that organizations would get would actually be better and more useful to them because right now they ask for you to voluntarily tell them all this stuff and you could lie to them and so on uh and then they have to sift through all this and whereas this way you know you just answer the exact question that they want to know are you allowed to be here in this event you know do you have a driver's license you pay your car insurance are you at least 18 years of old you know whatever and you just say yes i am qualified and that's it they don't need to know all the uh you know uh supporting information and why do they need it does it really help them and then so it's just it's a better way to do it and i that was the i showed how to do that in a scientific american article achieving electronic privacy and it's more technical antecedents so but that so once i realized that you could do all all three parts just all you really need that's when i you know that caused me to double down my commitment to to try to push this all forward but the public awareness wasn't really there of course you know back in the day you talk about privacy it sounds like a very kind of wimpy you know issue or some kind of thing but now you know there's a massive uh recognition that this is the whole game i think and that's what i've always watched you said the phrase minimum disclosure i'm wondering if you could just unpack and elaborate on what that means and how you might um organize that as a principle so i was at an event in uh marseille uh the university called lumini it was a little mansion and there were these ladies there and in cook outfits making this giant kettle of uh marseille fish soup to celebrate the end of our one week conference on randomness but at that conference i presented um a model that uh technique basically permuted the circuit diagrams and you can still see it on my website that in my publication strum dot com that uh with crippo and and brazar i believe that um uh included both models both what's called zero knowledge and what's called minimum disclosure and the zero knowledge people just hated us and they kept trying to say oh you didn't really do it and you know suppressing our papers and the references it was so painful uh and you know dishonest in my view but uh in any case um we cut a deal with them that uh they would call the more you know such the the one model minimum disclosure and they would call the model that they created zero knowledge so i showed you could do both one construction that could do either mix and match them and then also if you look on my website the the spy masters double agent that showed how you can uh combine all the models and get the best of both worlds so it's um that's why so it was a weird political thing that happened in science and that's why it's called minimum disclosure it's but uh you know it just depends on whether you want the secrets to be protected unconditionally in other words against the quantum computer and infinite computing power or whether you're willing to allow the secrets to be protected by some problem that you assume is hard to solve and so of course in my early career i was all about protecting secrets unconditionally because i argued that you know how could an individual know what kind of computing power you know governments would have or in the future and so on um but um it turns out that in uh in voting um you what you really want to be sure of is that the outcome is correct and so what we you know we proved is you can't have it both ways you know you have the the secrecy of the secrets and the correctness of the outcome and one of them can be unconditional and that forces the other one at best the other forces the other one to be based on a computational assumption assuming a certain kind of you know problem can't be solved and so for voting you want uh the other you want to do it the other way and uh you know um can i just interject something about voting i don't want to i just want to mention this because it's another thing a lot of people don't realize and it's very interesting to me because we just saw that we just got this paper except in the last couple of weeks so there's this long-standing issue with voting technology you want to vote online you know uh you're not in a booth so someone could bribe you or coerce you like threaten you and there's real you know you could livestream your voting act so there has not been a satisfactory solution to that in the literature you look at my website you see i did a lot to try to create a voting technology community as well um look at the books that i published and stuff so um it turns out that uh we finally found a way to do it and uh it's called vodax.org you can look at you can see it but basically it just says it's kind of like quantum mechanics it's it's an interesting result i'm going into it here but it's quite practical and we we've built the software for it and we're going to uh let a lot of people help us since some people are volunteered to incentivize that process and so we're going to try to make it uh really usable but the basic algorithms are running uh and uh so we proved that with the strongest type of proofs which is the uh so-called universal composability framework proof so it's like really uh really strong but basically uh it it renders voting um un uh improperly influenceable you can't coerce or bribe uh voters really effectively and so uh that's necessary for if you want democracy to flourish because you know i think you need a little more voting and a little more unstruck you know sample voting you can read about it on my website you know that's the way i think it really needs to be done because that that that scales with the complexity of society you know and that uh um uh is a uh and i've got some new results coming out it's you know it it obviates a lot of these theorems like arrows theorem and stuff like that you know big problems with social choice theory so it's uh sample voting is a really really nice um but it means that people aren't always voting in at the same time so you can't really go to booths you got to do it you got to be able to that's what everyone realizes you got democracy to flourish you got to be you can't you have the boost because boost sometimes they spy on you people you know harass you you can't get there all this stuff and you know and here you like in la you know there's a lot of polling places that never open every election a handful of them you know because that and that just that locks out a certain group of votes so any event um yeah uh we solved that recently in the vote xx and uh that it's a subtle thing but it was the final sort of missing link uh to allow uh democracy to flourish because it's not enough just to be able to vote securely online you have to stop this improper influence and so it's proven elusive but now we got it we nailed it certainly certainly uh the the other part thing i'd like to define is um just the traffic problem we talked about that a number of times uh could you just talk about traffic analysis and just the nuances that that brings to the table when it comes to like uh privacy yeah well there's so thanks for asking uh it's a it's uh you know the basic traffic analysis that's what the military used to call it and i mean wanna let me just fill in a little bit to your listeners to get the sense of this because one of the really crazy things about fi trying to find out who talks to whom and when is that it's always been legal for any government agency to ask for that information so there was something called a mail cover you know any agency the us government could fill out a form and get your your po make your postman write down every single address you send to and every single address that sends to you and the weight of each envelope but not open them open them that's different that requires you know a court order and the same thing with the phone company you know like oh sure we you know we can tell you who you who this who calls and who you call and so on and i think that um you know where mobile phones are sort of seems to fall into that category too right and so you know most people are unaware of this and they think that that's information is somehow protected and so when when a company says oh we don't you know we don't respond to you know unless they have a subpoena we're not going to tell them you know but but the traffic data they give look at that you know apple said oh we're not going to give the keys to open this phone you know the password for that phone famously but they gave tons of information about all the transactions that were done with that phone you can read it's in the court records it was known you know it's there's a it's this is the double thing that i was uh referring to right that that people say uh you know oh you know it's like don't look behind the curtain don't look at that the man behind the curtain you know you've got strong end in encryption here that's look at this zuckerberg you know uh statements on privacy that he's made several really long statements even and it's all about that say well you know it's strong ending encryption we're going to move to that but don't worry about the traffic data we'll take care of that we may need that to stop spam you know something like that so it's always been uh something that's never really discussed in a clear open manner but yeah but basically uh you know uh the social graph who your friends are and when you talk to them and so on is so revealing like i said earlier you can't lie about that really you can't mislead you know so for instance when i was at berkeley i went over to the you know the doe library the main library and they had the congressional record on the staffs you know in the basement there and um you could read the hearings where i don't recall but during that period the cia was compelled to reveal their methods in one example of their covert you know whatever they call claims and methods and the congress was gonna get to choose which which instance they would look into and that wouldn't really set them back too much but it would give the congress this oversight and so they chose the the the coup in chile and so that you could read the sworn testimony of the cia about how they did it how did they go in there and just take it over and get you know switch the government there and how did they do it traffic analysis they just put software in the phone exchange at the presidential whatever you know a palace or whatever it was facility uh because of an american-made phone exchange probably right they just put some like malware in there that would every night call washington dc to some random number and upload all the traffic data which which phone called which phone at what time and how long they spoke and then the cia it's also public that it was it they they paid all these universities to develop sophisticated analysis of of data like that you know it wasn't i don't know exactly i think it was in advance so that they had this capability social grass and they could so basically you could look and see oh who called who just before this event and then who called who after it and so on they knew exactly who was running the country and they just went in there and uh you know surgically took it over no big deal traffic analysis that's that's documented so just to double down on the metaphor that you used earlier we have this envelope that has a packet of data inside of it so it's just a letter for example and end to end encryption assures that that envelope is going to stay closed and it's going to protect the data that's inside of that message right but what it doesn't do is all the rest of the data that's outside of the envelope which is who it's coming from where it's going the time that it's going and then what you said also like how how much of a of a payload that data is like how much is there a little bit of data or a lot of data and what i'm what you're saying is that well you would sure if their encryption it hides the actual actual message but when you have so much of the metadata the peripheral data and you have you collect all of that it's a little bit like a sudoku puzzle you can kind of fill in the blanks just by just by kind of figuring it out you can link it to all kinds of other databases like this this data about where your phone is at all times that's like you can buy that for almost nothing from these companies that just capture it you know it's it's so it you could you know any other data you have you can start to uh correlate and and link in and um so let me mention something else real briefly i just presented this at a conference in berlin couple days ago for the first time but let me just point out to you that if you are listening you know maybe some some messenger service let's just say is not going to give you the traffic data because they know it because they write all the messages right you just listen near their location because you have the full take right so or whatever you just tap the internet near their location and you just notice all that the ip address is coming in and going out well it doesn't take long to use statistical techniques to find out how many let's say server processes there they are running how many threads how many cores and threads are running in there and because you'll start to see that certain ip addresses always end up talking to other ones so then assuming that the processing is first in first out which of course it is all of a sudden now you can see the full interconnection which i t addresses are talking to which i.t addresses and then you know and then your you know then you can link that with the phone number stuff and your your you've got it all you don't have to um you know get the the cooperation of the messenger services so that's that's a programming project for undergraduates in my opinion that's not like you know that's not really that hard to do so uh it's you know uh this traffic data is not well protected not not under law and not in in practice the only really way is is this what supports is this what supports the this like surveillance capitalism that we have today where you know i get targeted ads based off of certain data that i like exhaust into the internet is this that same problem that we're talking about it's it's tightly coupled i mean yeah there you know a lot of cases you know you you know web 2 you have no real choice you sign up naively for this service so you start exposing a lot of data to it they they have a lot of data internally they don't need to do traffic analysis i mean they can just link all kinds of things they have the data and that's i think you know a part of it but yes those surprising little ads you get or whatever the funny things yeah that's that's when one service links to another just based on your ip address for example yeah so it's you know it it it's extremely um uh porous and in the wrong analogy it's it's uh easily interlinked based on like just just riffing on what i was saying about uh breaking your messengers uh traffic data but you there's a lot of different sources of data and it's not hard to link them all together because they're all based in effect on your identity it could be your ip address you know your name your google you know whatever but it's it you know your location there's a lot of different clues and you can just link it all together that's why in in like you said in the mid 80s i said look we got it the only way to get to so that you can control your own information is just to make sure that you talk to everyone under a different pseudonym and you talk over a mixed network so there is no metadata linking there's there is no no one knows your ip address right that's how people were surprised it's people to see how much bitcoin that you know what they're doing with bitcoin right gets the ib address you know no one sees your ip address because you you speak over a mixed network and use a different pseudonym so yes you can authenticate yourself as the owner of that account or whatever uh and you can prove that your answers are correct with minimum disclosure as we've discussed right but you but you don't have to um allow those uh entities that you talk to to know enough about you to link whatever it is they're collecting about each one is collected about you to the stuff that the other ones have collected that's precluded by that technique you you divide them up you know you partition them you you you're building you know firewalls between them because use different identities with each one that's the only way i think the the the metaphor in the crypto world is that it would be like if you made a new transaction with a brand new wallet every single time well no but that's not going to do it but yes but with a different ip address with a different ipo oh yes right the only way to get that different ip address is to use a mix network to appear somewhere else in the world so basically you're gonna have mixing and you've got to have digital pseudonyms and you have to have a way to prove stuff between them if you want to benefit from yourself you know you could do everything out totally on the card and but if you want to be able to say well look i paid my taxes i you know i i've got this much money in the bank i paid my insurance i got this this advanced degree or whatever it is this passport this you know i'm at this age or whatever then you need to have a credential mechanism that allows you to approve things about the statements that each individual organization gives you under the respective pseudonym that you uniquely use with them there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the

another quote that i want to read that i thought was really really powerful okay um uh uh this is from an article that says projecting the version of the two futures one built with the current technology and one built with decentralized services david saw that their two approaches appear to hold quite different answers large-scale automated transaction systems are imminent and as the initial choice for their architecture gathers economic and social momentum it becomes increasingly difficult to reverse whichever approach prevails it will likely have a profound and enduring impact on economic freedom democracy and our informational rights now sadly i already kind of know dave david which path we went down it's kind of the one that we give away all of our privacy but i'm wondering like if we go back to 1985 and look and and then and then zoom forward to where we are today is it as bad as you worried about is it not as bad it currently the date the state of like user sovereignty and user data today is it as bad as you thought it could get is it worse is it better just like how bad is it in like what were your thoughts on where we are today well it's pretty bad currently much worse than it seems to be because you know as they say they keep it all hit you know if you had a massive data you're not gonna you know announce it and uh there's a lot of progress in um machine learning and so on that's unreported and that you know this people you know economically benefit enormously from this data capture as you know and they're they're you know going ahead very aggressively trying to you know squeeze more out of it but what i would like to so it's worse than you think however in my own defense i want to say that if you go back and read those you know those statements what i actually let's say prophesized was not so much an inevitability i mean i was trying to you know scare people say this you know if you get really bad uh hard to dig your way out of but you know what i what i prophesized was that you know it it would be kind of a hegelian you know thing with the you know the the people would get all riled up and push back and and win some stuff back it would be it would become a bit of a struggle and uh but make no mistake you cannot win a local war you know it's one thing it's it's you know it's all that data is leakable or or not you're either hosed or you're not you can't can't have it halfway you know like well it's pretty much okay because in this part it's right you know okay but what i will say also though to qualify that briefly and i think and importantly is that and this is an insight that i've had subsequent to those uh publications you know i mean because of the internet of things let's say and all the cameras that people seem to have put up with and all this existing data that's out there right um you know there are certain things that are pretty much hopeless and probably not worth fighting about and there's certain you know when you're walking down the street you know you're gonna wear a bag over your head or what you know it's kind of hard to really uh win in that domain so what i argue now is that what is strictly needed for democracy to prevail is that individuals must have a protected sphere where they are certain that they are free to discuss uh you know political and other matters and pay for information and be paid for information with their let's say friends and family and their people that that they want to communicate with you must have that protected sphere otherwise you cannot have democracy it's a necessary condition and now with the stuff you know about voting and so on it's actually sufficient to have democracy uh and then that democracy can later you know say take the cameras down and do this but you've got to get over the idea that the government needs to see everything you do you have to give people a protected sphere or there is no possibility that they can really be participants in a democracy so you know if you want to say that we're different from china then you you you either have to provide the protected sphere wholeheartedly you know uh no no no no no secret little uh hold backs or or just you know just give it up and say okay we're you know we're just going to find everybody just like they do and there's no real difference um that that that's so that's um my uh you know i think that's a very pragmatic uh approach so it's very optimistic because the xx network has those capabilities already we have a way to have those protected spheres you know a thing that that just to drive it home for a minute you know a colorful thing um is you know that i don't know how many of your listeners realize that coffee was criminalized both in in england and also in the middle east for for the longest time by rulers who felt that if people got together in coffee houses who knows what they would be talking about it's look it up it's startling you know and it's a revolutionary thought yeah it's just it's really it's quite surprising so yeah like 500 years is very so it's like um you know uh this is i think it makes the point you know you'd need uh you know there was this bookstore in san francisco i think it's defunct now but it was called a clean well-lighted place for books i always like the name of it you need a protected sphere a place where you can uh be you where you can have an actual uh political uh consciousness and development and and discuss uh issues and actually meaningfully participate in governance absent that there's no there's no uh democracy and and it's not much to ask for and you know if you try to criminalize that claiming you know some kind of you know abuse of this or that i mean you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater you know yeah sure there might be some trade-offs and i don't want to get into all this kind of you know guns don't kill people it's the people whatever it's but no you want democracy that is a necessary condition so just understand that and get over it and you know like the thing is that you know the nsa said oh we need to spy on everybody and they had all these programs spent billions of billions of dollars they never caught anybody and if you read the reports on that it's just it's ridiculous you know they they had all this the surveillance so they never really found any you know so it's like okay you know if there are a few people that are really doing evil then then follow him around you know use the old you don't need to use the new techniques to to stop that it's there isn't it isn't at that scale there's really no rationalization for it and then if you take it to the next level i mean those countries that try to suppress this will lose out in my view in the in the you know in the in the medium term because there's so much economic opportunity in creating let's say a level playing field for uh financial transactions and services globally uh you know that we're we're paying basically three trillion dollars annually in fees for financial services uh it depends on your school of economics but that's at a huge cost to society and what one thing that blockchain has done is shown that you don't actually need that you you can do financial service i mean two trillion of that is payments you can do it without you know uh all this whole uh huge uh overhead and and so when you you know if you unleash this there's a lot of economic opportunity there and if those governments that don't have a way to allow people to pay their taxes meaningfully in that context will suffer they'll either try to stop it and that'll be horrible for them or they won't get the revenue and that could be a big problem and so those kind of techniques that i mentioned the credential mechanism allow you to say okay i'm proving that i'm paying the correct taxes without telling you anything about what i'm doing and uh that's way better for just like i said for you know for companies that's way better because now they actually have a proof you know you send me in texas who knows it's really true whatever you know everyone's fudging on it depends on the country right in brazil it's like 50 fudging i think that's what i heard when i was there so it's uh you know you you basically prove that you're paying the right amount and that's it done you know so that's far better strategy for a liberal democracy than uh trying to say oh no no we can't let you have your pro you know your protected sphere uh because it's just too dangerous uh to society you know that would that's that's it's really a doomed uh uh take so it you know we we are at a critical juncture certainly uh i'd like to actually zoom back in time really quick because there's this line that stuck out to me while i was doing some of my homework from one of your head teachers i believe at uh i believe at berkeley and it was while you were working on your mix networks yeah and the uh your head teacher said uh and this is this is when you were getting into manuel blum was the head of the department he's a theoretical computer scientist um you know i took his graduate theory seminar and i'm the only one who got an a plus in it yeah because i proved a more general result in half a page all his his you know star students like mccauley and and and uh and so on they did their they didn't do anywhere near as well as but i wasn't a theory student right so but yeah manny was you know quite a uh you know a presence in the department uh-huh and uh again this is yeah going this is going i believe in it with mixed networks which is the concept of like decentralization but you know all the way back then and uh he said don't work on this because you can never tell the effects of a new idea on society that's right what did you what did you think when your professor told you this you know well this was this was about my dissertation topic which was you can see it on my website is actually blockchain it was actually uh uh was called a you know computer systems established maintaining trusted by digit by uh mutually suspicious parties it was a way to do a consensus you know with cryptography with a bunch of nodes and they could add nodes and take them out and so on this was uh you know aimed at providing uh multi-party computation which later i found a theoretical way to solve and that's you can also read about that on my website the the the giant the um the uh uh spy masters double agent problem that i mentioned earlier but yeah so uh in that district that it's it's in the acknowledgements of my dissertation i thanked manuel blum for you know trying to tell me that you could never anticipate the uh effective technologies on society this is a common uh thing that's believed you know uh because it's too hard to anticipate you know so i should not work on things that i thought would make the world better because who knows they might make it worse but i dedicated to him because i said it was the rejection of that principle that you know uh you know is the motivation for for for doing this dissertation because i think that privacy technology is different uh from other technologies in that respect the only known use is really to allow you know liberal democracy to flourish it's really only about empowering people you don't need anything fancy to allow like what i call a monolithic model of security where you know it's all controlled by the government and everything's hierarchical uh and so there's no real evil use for privacy technology in my in my view it's it's it's our main way through it's the way to make information technology create a a real a new world that we would like to live in as opposed to a new world that we really will not like to live in david chom privacy is the way to have a flourishing liberal democracy is definitely one of the the subtext that we talk about on this bankless podcast so you could not have said it better myself it if you had a message for the cryptocurrency industry not the cryptography industry what would it be what would you say to the collective cryptocurrency industry well i mean it's been a blast it's been so you know what has been achieved is so uh fantastic because it you've created so much outside of the the control of government it's it's it's caused a lot of uh heads to turn and and possibilities to be opened up and uh you know it's a it's a it's a very uh exciting um community and um you know [Music] i'm um yeah i'm i'm just i'm thrilled that i you know could have been doing some of the early work that uh you know that led to this and but uh yeah i think it's also you know don't don't forget about the kind of future we're trying to build here also i guess you know uh but i mean it's not front and center you know it's not everyone's focus it is mine um you know and and uh um i mean i'm not naive enough to think that you know you one can force this through i mean you have to find sort of a way to incentivize everyone and then sort of spread the word and and uh create a situation where it's uh you know uh everyone's pulling in together to make it happen but i guess right now we have the wind at our back because the vast majority of the public realizes this is what's needed it's quite different from just even a few years ago it's really uh you know it's it's it's a profound opportunity at this moment and um yeah so i hope we can uh seize it and uh yeah yeah having uh trying to get the crypto world to zoom out and focus on the long term sometimes only works in the bear markets and not the bull markets yeah well that's an optimistic way to look at the current situation yeah people can work on stuff now because yeah when you when things are really yeah i hear you that's that's a good point yeah this is the time to do it and you know i'm certainly uh trying to double down and and move this all forward and um yeah i'm i'm excited i mean yeah it's it's uh it's a little bit of you know unfortunate that we can't all like you know meet and try otherwise kind of wearing me out you know you know you know but uh um yeah it's it's uh hopefully i mean i think yeah it's certain i believe it's certain that we're going to pull through this and uh it's you know and uh and i think you're right we will probably come out way more medium-term focused than we were when we went in and so that's a huge opportunity right there yeah certainly uh the other fantastic thing i really enjoy about this industry is that the cryptocurrency
