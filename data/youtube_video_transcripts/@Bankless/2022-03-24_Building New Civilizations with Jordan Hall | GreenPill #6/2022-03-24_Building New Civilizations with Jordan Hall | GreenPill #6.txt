we can and in some sense must design a completely different infrastructure for how human beings coordinate and operate [Music] hey hey what's up coordination this episode is with jordan hall who is a serial entrepreneur the founder of divx worked at mp3.com has been in technology for 30 years he's someone who i deeply admire and respect i discovered him on podcasts talking about this thing called game b which is basically paying down systemic risk for humanity trying to find a new way to relate to each other that is more harmonious and more focused on sovereignty he's been a serial entrepreneur who has played the game for several decades and learned a lot and that has led to a lot of deeply embodied grounded insights about coordination and how web 3 can be a massive lever for creating more coordination in the world paying down systemic risk supporting public goods creating a better world jordan and i talk a lot in this episode about game b but we also talk about traversing the design space of web 3 with consciousness and intention what is the superpower that's going to allow us to view the game board from above and to more effectively launch projects that are effective in creating more coordination for the world this episode is like rich chocolate cake once you bite into it i think that you're going to need to digest it a little bit i'm gonna spend a couple times a couple recordings of of re watching this episode in order to fully grasp what jordan is saying and the intention behind it i think that it's a deeply impactful episode for our audience who are trying to use web 3 to create more regenerative crypto economic systems so thanks so much for tuning in coordination i give you jordan hall bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new

dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] hey hey everyone i'm here with jordan hall who is a serial entrepreneur and is here to talk with us today about game b welcome jordan hi nice to see you so great to have you and thanks for agreeing to do this episode with me so be curious just to start off you're a serial entrepreneur you're at your mp3.com founded divx how did you get into crypto when i exited divex in 2007 um one of the things or two things that were happening sort of more or less simultaneously one was i was really reflecting on the experience of what it was like to start a tech company with a very specific uh social oriented intent and the particulars of how participation in capitalism venture capitalism and in particular going public impacted the ability for example for the relationship with the community and the the way that the the kind of thing that we were trying to do evolved so i was really contemplating was this thing in particular i was comfortable in this thing money like how does money work let's call it as maybe a medium in the in the larger social environment right and of course the financial crisis was beginning to unfold as well so i happened on my own basis noticing that we needed to think of a different way to allocate resources to productive activity than ipos and venture capital and the financial crisis was making the question of money quite uh pointed so i would deep dive and i don't you probably are aware of this it's become i think relatively common knowledge but the the official scholarship on money at least back then in particular was quite poor like the the thinking economic profession such as it is on money was was thin gruel so i just began to sort of expand outward reading and thinking about all kinds of things and i came across the white paper i think i actually encountered the white paper before the uh the actual first blocks were produced sure are we talking about the bitcoin white paper yes the bitcoin white paper okay cool um for example i was i was interacting with the p2p guys like michelle balon's group and uh that was the first place that i came across it and and then just sort of touched in continuously like every period of time like when when the first blocks were minted i started trying to figure out how to mine with an old laptop i think i might like uh maybe a tenth of a bitcoin with a very old laptop before it was it was obviously not gonna work and then uh very hands-on right so the point twofold one was nice a nice place to actually look at the economic theory in practice and then a group of people that were gathering in different locations reddit and uh the uh was it called bitcoin form or something like that bitcoin talk i think yeah you're going to talk who are coming with a um how did i say it a heterodox perspective uh many very unwashed and had their own perspectives and a really beautiful opportunity to go deep on some fundamental principles and also notice how people think in general um so that's how i got involved and more or less i've been continuously involved since then although cycling up and down so you know right when the altcoin thing came i sort of bought early dogecoin and things like that and participated in that as an experiment of what's happening here and how does this work and what are these characteristics of this kind of thing and then stepped back then of course ethereum came and that sort of thing like washing it and washing out right so i mean it seems to me like the what i heard from you is that you're kind of a deeply experienced operator in the startup space sort of understands money as a means of building a company creating a social movement and um i'm not sure if i heard some sort of like this dissatisfaction with with with that environment or not but it seems like you're experimenting with more bleeding edge forms of digital money and peer-to-peer currency over time and there's kind of an ebb and flow between those those things uh anything to add add there and did i did i capture that right yeah maybe i'll make three little uh shifts one is more in the direction of uh strategist and operator although i did you know i was the ceo of the companies okay my skill my skill set is not actually the level of say uh operations or even frankly hr okay but guiding and vision was just the thing the thing that i was more naturally uh qualified for to be perfectly frank and to some extent communications which is you know part of the ceo role yeah um the big picture uh is guided by actually a theory that i was working with in college and largely has still been uh of course refined over the past 30 or 40 years but continuous i would say that i am in fact deeply dissatisfied both experientially from a personal level and theoretically with how money uh has shaped and continues to shape um how people make choices and how we actually do things in the world and so modifying money at the very at the very base level plays from my point of view a decisive uh role in shifting things it's like one of the longest leapers maybe the longest but certainly one of the longest okay maybe to pull on that uh you know what is your vision for for sort of money as a labor uh to to to make change and i guess me you know maybe another way of asking this question is how did you come to found game b and you know what is your most recent work in exploring uh the game b type idea so maybe just even connected to the previous part there was a dive into for example the nature of money which this kept going right as you start going down you get into things like how did society work how did a civilization work what are the relationships between psychology and culture and technology and as that continued to unfold the primary inquiry was something like um if you consider the current circumstances to be there there are things that you'd like to change um and perhaps may need to like there's a diagnostic where where are we where are we headed what is it likely to happen and what's possible um my particular kind of mind likes to think about things as fundamentally as it can so when i encounter a certain kind of problem i want to say okay what's more fun what's the more fundamental is there something more fundamental and if so what does that look like can i get down a base layer as robust a base layer as possible right so eventually this journey in collaboration with a lot of people actually led to the formulation of the notion of game a so before you get to game b you actually get to game a right okay um and i mean it's more of a discovery to be honest it was okay it seems to be the case and i increasingly i mean over the past gosh almost decade now um no actually more than a decade 2010 was when that formulation really started to emerge um that for example all civilizations everything that is not a strictly indigenous level of human activity are of a kind there's a certain set of conserved characteristics that are what i would call this the civilization form or the game a form okay and that they all have certain characteristics and there are and moving the deck chairs around the titanic by playing with different variations on civilization but from the point where we are now the way i would describe it i have described it is that the the totality of the arc of civilization is in fact playing out reaching at the end of a given civilization reaching the end of civilization is an entire kind of thing which is reaching the end of game a as a kind of thing and this is important from an agenda perspective right because if you're if you're trying to resolve a certain set of problems and you notice the problems are actually driven by a more fundamental set of dynamics then you have to actually deal with those dynamics otherwise the problems will just keep coming back right and and then the challenge is okay if that's the case what does it look like for us to actually find ourselves in a context that isn't driven by those same dynamics right so okay there's a game game a and it has a certain set of fundamental characteristics that lead to a certain set of dynamics which lead to end conditions uh here we are what's something other than that game b and then working backwards actually what might be the kinds of characteristics in fact the necessary sufficient and compact characteristics of such a thing a game that has not had the same uh sort of end states as game a and so as many as a design exercise we can go into as much depth as you'd like on what the results of that are about roughly around 2012 right the process of the diagnosis of game a oh [ __ ] it is in fact in was inexorably self-terminating and kind of nearing the end of it was relatively complete we've done a lot of work on that since then but that's sort of that was there and then okay what does this possible transition look like and how might we make it like there's two steps what's a destination that's a valid destination to get to to use evolutionary theory language it would be what's a a new a hill on the landscape a global optimal right there and then what's the transition like how do we move across the the valley it's called a valley crossing exercise those are the two questions got it so um some just i think that you know what i heard was was that we sort of figured out there's a set of characteristics around how civilizations at least here on earth uh evolve and there's a worry that those characteristics might lead to self-terminating systems humanity blows itself up doesn't pass the great filter and i'm wondering if you can kind of give an example of a game a type game i know when i when i talk to like daniel schmokenberger he talks about nuclear proliferation the proliferation of crispr into many different hands will inevitably lead to disastrous self-terminating outcomes but you know what's a tangible example for the audience of of a game a type system i'll use a different approach because history is one of my uh habits i'll actually just use history the roman empire is a very nice example okay a gaming type system and by the way empire in general like the very notion of empire so you think about what is an empire okay an empire an empire is a a particular kind of culture that has as its its sort of nature the um ingestion and integration by means of coercion other cult and that's an empire and so case in point in our current moment the russian empire and by the way at this point not trying to do any evaluation of that but it's operating as an imperial mode right on the process of using coercion here embodied in the form of military technology there are many other forms of coercion by the way money is a perfectly valid form of coercion quite familiar um to forcibly integrate a different culture the ukrainians into its environment so that's a one of the canonical okay one of the most fundamental gaming moves is that and um if you if you sort of play forward the the story of empire notice the intrinsic dynamics right if the story of empire gets is played by more or less anybody on the planet um everybody else in the planet is now game theoretically stuck you either become feedstock right you're somebody else's lunch or you have to start playing a very similar game and now you have conflicts between empires and so the boundary between the american empire and the russian empire and the chinese empire now becomes the boundary of the way that the world is is uh created but think about the implication like the notion of the use coercive capacity so i've got multiple different groups that are constantly endeavoring to use coercive capacity with the with the sort of the intrinsic necessity of grabbing resources from each other so now i'm in arms in arms race like not metaphorically an actual arms race the limit condition on that is going to be the limit condition on how far the arms race can go i might find myself in a temporary equilibrium where the expansive capacity of the various empires the auth capability of technology at the moment and the defensive technology capability of technology at the moment mean that the boundaries are relatively stable say for example yeah the implications of mutually assured destruction in the mid-century right um but if the underlying generator function is just you wait i'm going to [ __ ] you eventually then it's a temporary equilibrium and if anything changes in the technical landscape in the uh socio-technical landscape in other words the interior capacity of one of the eight one or more of the agents uh the offensive defensive so the emergency for example of cyber war my hypothesis um or frankly what i call the war on sense making psyops offensive technologies that maybe changes the equilibrium the nash equilibrium actually mutually sure destruction and you get another shift right and so the the end state of this dynamic is um ultimately if you kind of run the clock forward particularly given one more characteristic by the way so this is this this last piece is important in the arms race notice that the arms race has an implication of by necessity a an escalating and in fact accelerating technological capacity right so we go from uh sticks and bones to nukes etc right it's an arrow that goes a certain direction and it may actually down cycle a little bit you know during bronze age collapse there was a a small uh decrease in uh military capacity but most of that was actually operational not not too long after the bronze age collapse um actual military capacity broadly speaking was was higher right obviously um so just it's not too hard to draw the logical conclusions right if you've got a uh an escalating arms race on a field that is defined by escalating capacity to engage in conflict and any kind of conflict is naturally going to be throwing multiple different kinds of externalities into the environment right producing things like radiation and things like that um there's a terminal point at some point in the future that we called either the the eye of the needle or the keyhole the bottleneck or the great filter like so that's an example like that includes a bunch of different ways of looking at it um and of course you can expand from there got it okay so what i heard was basically there's a mode of human operation game a uh that basically not only is ultimately self tamara terminating on the long term but in the short term anyone who doesn't play under the game a rules kind of is maladapted and so they get sucked into game a type operations and at the same time this is happening we have exponential technology which is creating the capacity for self-destruction at larger and larger scales destruction to the environment so the stakes are getting higher all of the time uh as this is happening i'm trying to say back to you what you just said to me but let me know if that was a fair summary for the audience right there well yeah very nice uh i would just expand on one one notion of the notion of environment okay but there's essentially three qualities or kinds of environment um that are important to think about one as we might think of is the external or the ecology right so the physical uh the second is the culture so the environment of the nature under which human beings are interacting with each other in some positive some way and then the third is the environment of the interior of individuals or the mind so these are three different frontiers each one of which has uh externalities thrown into it by game a conflict so a terminus of a given game a moment like an empire might be that it destroys its ecology and collapses on that basis say for example by by at least some hypothesis the mayan empire another terminus would actually be something like civil war or a breakdown cultural uh integration and the third would actually be something like uh internal breakdown like the actual psychologies of the individuals um becoming less and less capable of operating the their own machinery and interacting with each other which creates sort of a hollowing out effect of the uh of the environment so multiple different ways for it to fail all of which are of course code they're all they're all always in play and always in relationship with each other and of course in relationship with multiple different uh game a forces that are happening in the same uh global environment okay i see so i guess you know one of the sort of reasons why i wanted to to chat with you is that you kind of speak this like deep theoretical game um this game theory but you're also a technology entrepreneur and spending time discovering crypto and and i want to bring it back to crypto in web3 you know i've watched a couple of your videos about olympus dow and a few other projects that you've been following how do you think crypto sort of connects to solving these problems if at all what would have to be true for web 3 to build systems that pull people into more of a game three mindset or do they connect at all well they connect very deeply i mean one of the reasons why i've been so involved in this thing is that um well let's take it two steps you you might imagine although i suppose it's possible to be otherwise that i um yeah i take my own way of thinking seriously and i actually do believe that we are at the end of something very significant and the consequences are large and as you said i have a history of agency i have a history of creating things in the world that change things and so i actually am trying to be agent in this environment so when i think about that at a very very high level of strategy okay what are the levers that we could move on so let's just take go back to money for a moment and i want to bring out a particular point of where we are now then oh this is obvious but i think it's very very important which is uh we're conscious of money up until relatively recently money was sort of perceived by almost everyone and even those who were involved in it at the fed federal reserve for example kind of like out there it was it was a it was a function of universe that we might participate in like the rain falling but it wasn't something that we took as being a subject of our intentional design particularly not everybody or most people obviously if you're involved at all in the crypto universe um you're on the other side of that conception right it's obvious at this point that we humans design the money right tokenomics is a term it's actually becoming an actual discipline uh okay let's not just design it at all but this now think about how we design it skillfully i call this alchemy the conscious design of the various kinds of sociotechnical systems that guide our collective choices that's what you might say alchemy got it here we are now this is a very important thing if you take a look at the arc of history that i've been describing in the context of game a motive is actually driven by unconscious which is there's certain kinds of landscapes right at least which is arms races for example and basic game theory that drive choices in a direction towards termination at a certain point but if we are conscious if we're actually just able to look at the underlying landscape and and consider making choices on the landscape itself this is a qualitatively different circumstance that's the essence of game b is the being about designing our own landscape which is not right by the way so it sounds like the agency over these problems is sort of like a key inflection point for humanity is that multiple people can sense make if they're not even at the if they're not at the federal reserve then before they couldn't they had no agency over these problems but but now with open source money you can program your values into your money you can sense make about what how to build the more game b system and you can actually begin to you've got a better starting position yeah well okay i'm gonna actually break that into two points and make them very sensitive so one is you you actually have agency you can and then the second is you can actually become aware of the possibility of thinking about how to design so those are different modes and it's actually the the first mode is obviously critical we have to actually have agency over designing our landscapes but the second mode is okay what is this thing where like how do we go about thinking about this what does it mean to take um you know tokenomics as a field of design and you know as a whole discipline that fact of being oh we can actually now do game design no game a game b game a in many ways was a was an unconscious discovery right it was just participating in humaning of a particular set of constructs that produced results in the world and in this explosion of the imperial mode for example in cities by the way b is oh [ __ ] we can actually engage in game design what kind of game would we like to design and that actually is a completely different set of questions it involves things like wood right the subjunctive um so let's see so web 3 is i think the defining moment is the question whether or not web3 individually and collectively steps into consciousness of what it is it's like well wait a minute what are we this question what are we doing right not unconsciously exploring the field of how do i make more tokens by playing in the game right which is right i mean fundamentally running the essence of game a but actually stepping out big pictures say well what are we doing here and what what what would effective choices look like in in the context of what we're doing like that just in that space just sitting right there is the essence of the shift and of course the possibility so yeah let me hit on that and it's obvious for you and i think for almost everybody who might be listening but that accelerating technology field and then the fact of the capacity of technology moving on a curve um you know if you're if you're looking at the context of uh late stage neoliberalism right which is the environment we're operating in and you say geez it's going to be really hard to fix that there's a lot a lot going on there's a lot of inertia there's a lot of power in the world right if you want to address it you need to actually have something which in principle has the capacity to have at least that much of power or more right certain metaphor if you say you know late stage globalism right the whole neoliberal global thing coming out of the 20th century is very heavy and it has a certain weight to it then if you want to move it you need to have something which has at least that amount of power they can lift that weight and move it right well it looks like the technologies associated with blockchain have that amount of power right you've got this accelerating curve the coordination capacity that is implicit in these kinds of technologies which the current environment doesn't operate on right the current environment is basically an analog environment that's somewhat closed into digital right they're sort of like i mean it's a fax machine bureaucracy that uses emailing that's the the operating environment of our sort of legacy regions and if you can teleport from that which is let's say operating it at one into something which is designed thoughtfully and intrinsically on the basis of what's available in a truly digital context it has a power of i don't know 10 to 100 a lot and that's enough to move things right so it's it's actually we're sitting here going hey guys two points one you actually have the capacity to build something which could in principle completely move the entire world like all of it like literally lift all the result everything that's happening could be shifted because the power is implicit in the underlying infrastructure and you can be conscious about it you can actually thoughtfully design the things we're trying to get to with sort of purpose and values behind it so those are the two things and to the degree to which web three realizes holy [ __ ] that the end game of this is not to make slightly more money in us that's not even vaguely the end game the end game is actually no we can and in some sense must design a completely different infrastructure for how human beings coordinate and operate that has more than enough underlying implicit power to shift as at a purely military level like to use the gaming language it is more powerful than existing empires right but if it's held in a particular quality of consciousness it can do so from a new basis the game b basis and therefore things at a true in a qualitative level not just become the next great empire right so i mean i think that what i hear in in your voice is a lot of um potential energy in the ability to use crypto as a basis when rooted in game baby thinking with in rooted in conscious thinking to solve for systemic risks um not to just use crypto as a tool to enrich yourself but when you realize that there are deeply systemic risks to humanity that are proliferating in the world to start to bend your entrepreneurial activities your work in the web 3 ecosystem towards creating a more game b type world which hopefully solves for those existential risks and i guess i'm just wondering is that what you see out there like let's really pressure test this like you know when you look at web3 are people actually doing that right now or is it all you know nfts like what are you observing out there and how can we bend more builders towards orienting and game b type thinking uh if if the answer is that there's a disconnect between that potential energy and what you actually see out there well let's see um i would kind of maybe make three three points seem to light up so one not at all unexpectedly i would say the vast majority of activity is still very much operating in the unconscious mode okay which is called an evolutionary exploration of the possibility of the landscape and then like the migration to empty gox from mt gox across to coinbase and then d5 right this is in many ways almost like feeling out the landscape by hand noticing upgrading trajectories and then and then going there right yeah very inevitable so that's uh that dominates and that doesn't isn't surprising okay um the second which i think is quite hopeful is the trajectory of the evolutionary process does actually seem to be oriented towards how did i say this right discovering or in many cases rediscovering uh deeply fundamental characteristics that are say part of a hopeful future and then i'll maybe let me just expand on that uh let's use nfts it's a fun one um so yeah for sure and the nft space is very largely driven by a an unconscious exploration no but this concept and this is gonna i don't know how many people this will land with but i'll see how far i can how clearly can i can articulate this i'll make a proposition that the the naming convention tells us a lot and the proposal i'll make is that it tells us that we're actually very backwards in our in our thinking fundamentally because we have a we have a distinction between uh tokens and non-fungible tokens right and what i would say is in fact it ought to actually be the opposite in a in a healthy thoughtful universe token should intrinsically be non-fungible fungibility should be the unusual characteristic and so what do i mean by that it's a very weird story but i think it's worth worth sort of hitting on because if it hits nicely people will get it um if you look at the etymology of the word token and by the way i think that a lot of the uh the naming elements have an interesting poetry to them like the name of ethereum which doesn't feel at all like the kind of thing that would come out of an earthquake yeah quite an interesting esoteric orientation so the word token is one of the most sacred words right the word is means to speak solemnly to token right it's a it's an anglo-saxon you know dramatic word and it's very much associated with like the shamanic role of assigning a symbol to a an aspect of the subtle reality right so when we perceive something like let's say a god or you know a natural event that we want to give a to orient towards we name it which is a very interesting process that humans do only humans right we we see like you know tree or oak and we say oak we actually utter this sound which is nothing at all like the physical tree but we bind the two together right and that notion is is tokening to give a name to something it's a solemn act right this to be token something is about as fundamental as solemn act as there can be it is magic per se in the sense and it's singular it is non-fungible something is precisely singular oak is an or is a is a pointer a single pointer a single word that points towards essentially an essence it calls for into the mind the notion of essence like the platonic idea so to be token is in fact to discern singular essences in universe and then assign them unique tags that allow them to be legible in communication right that set of words by the way that's a really good set of words i just uttered i'm be tokening something i'm like i'm literally adding action okay well that's singular right and singular and non-fungible are the same term the oak is not alder is the point right the essences essence is non-fungible and fungibility is a really weird thing fungibility is like okay well i'm going to kind of pretend that they're all alike shifting from a qualitative mode to a quantitative mode so well okay how many oak well now i'm going to start taking the uniqueness of each distinct oak tree which is of course itself perfectly unique right everything in universe is in fact completely singular and will never return in its specificity i'm going to analytically alive i'm going to decontextualize that specificity into an artificial characteristic whatever i particularly care about that i'm trying to optimize for right and going to be the fungible thing right so my proposition is that the contextual the fully contextual which of course not means a field of singularities in the context of an infinite wholeness which navigated by be tokening uniqueness is more fundamental and is more by the way life and game b and this movement of of making things fungible is a part of the fundamental characteristic of game a and is let's say artificial and i don't necessarily mean horrible i just mean that's that's a different kind of thing it's a it's a uh well it's finite but it's the very nature right and it's right ending of the process if in fact uh closure it moves into a thermodynamic uh entropic uh cycle so so in our evolutionary exploration of nft space we are on the one hand operating under the logic of fungibility which means we're looking to monetize things but on the other hand because it is actually more fundamental we cannot help but actually be discovering the contours of what all essential space or the essence it's sloppy to be sure right it's very sloppy right in many ways being driven by vibes right vibes is a very nice mode like vibes is actual aesthetics right orienting towards essence from from a modality that is not driven by um but is actually endeavoring to navigate the the the underlying topography of the essential landscape and we're actually rediscovering we awakening in ourselves many have called this actually a medieval mindset a more mythic mindset that had a proper relationship with the underlying ground of being and that's good right so then my i would just propose hey okay cool why don't we be conscious about it why don't we actually use our capacity to think clearly about things and achieve a higher level of effectiveness by just knowing what it is we're actually doing let me just hit on that note for a moment because this is um you know i think one of the you're really really pushing on well is this question of public goods yeah and yet to use a certain kind of set of concepts that are uh how do i say powerful they're very strong concepts right the distinctions that i make are between the rivalrous non-violence and anti-rivalrous goods and and the public goods category is sort of the right hand too so the non-rivalrous and the anti-rattlers so an example which i think is quite nice um let me take a a book and then in fact let's take a specific book do i have it here well i'll just take funny i won't take that one we'll take this one looking forward to seeing what book this is yeah i'm actually let's see which one oh i'll use this one there we go they're off off screen but i'm not going to share with you all the ones i'm choosing so we'll go with this one it's a very nice book by the way intelligent machines i was hoping that i had a copy of mcluhan's understanding of media but it's not right there okay i've got a book okay this subject is rivalrous i've got this book you don't have this book and if you haven't had this book rivalrous right anyway to the degree to which this book degrades over time and tropically yeah spill coffee on it i burn it whatever it's just gone right the lab has two primary characteristics one is um it is it's not shareable other than by moving it from one agent to another agent and two once it's gone from universe it's gone from universe but it is it can be taken as non-rivalrous in the context of being a public good by putting it in a library so i don't i i currently have it fully rival this i own it it's in my house you can't even [ __ ] touch it but right out of the library and then i put it back in the library and then you can access it we are able to sort of more fully share its utility and in terms of degraded right so that's public goods from the point of view of the non-rival risk we're trying to find some way of sharing right to share right the difference between a personal car and say a train or a bus that's more [ __ ] but then we have the anti-rivalrous and it's almost like you know if you think about this as a line i think it's a metaphor it's actually more like that right or if you go from the from the rivalrous to the non-rivals when you go to the anti-rivalrous you're actually making an oblique term into a completely different dimension like from the x to the y plane content of the book which which is fully transcendent to any given specific mediation yeah medium yeah i can say okay if i were to take this and put it into a pdf it's the same content maybe slightly different the medium is the message but more or less the same and there's something about that because that has shareability in a very different quality than this yeah i mean the content is now um plausibly universally shareable everybody in the entire planet could have the pdf of this without any particular constraint there's a very some small constraint which is the energetic constraint that is the binding of any piece of transcendence instantiated in physical reality and that's that's right uh but we're on a very different trajectory if we're orienting ourselves around the anti-rivalrous characteristics and trying to build something which is coordinating around the anti-rivalries the reason why i'm bringing that up is let's take all right let's do this so this is the notion of consciousness you know thinking in terms of meta strategy so let's say i take a particular book understanding media by martial and i think well what is the more fundamental lesson of that like so there's a the book itself is is nice but the the thing the content is more fundamental than the uh in the book uh clearly i want to learn the lessons that he's teaching i don't necessarily care about the book like i use it as a doorstop but that's not the point yeah but when i think about the lessons of that particular book i noticed something that there's something more fundamental than that itself the actual content of that particular book points me to the practice of thinking about the implications of media on mind do you notice the the move there it's like well okay i could give you a fish i could teach you how to fish i could teach you how to learn how to teach yourself how to fish right that second move is a very different kind of move actually empowering you not with the specific capacity of fishing but the general capacity of learning skill then i can orient your consciousness of the general capacity of learning skill around the universality of learning about learning this is not sufism as an entire discipline is essentially that how do we go ahead and say all right well the most powerful potential move would become exquisite in meta learning and because everything else is a derivative of meta learning at a at a human level okay if i get sort of super high quality capacity at meta learning when i find myself in any given context i can instantiate a optimal learning capacity in relationship with that context then i can learn the characteristics of that context now that's an extremely powerful abstraction that just articulated but this is you know it's not that complex you know lots of different people have thought the thing you know you think uh sun tzu and the art of war right the strategy is exactly what i'm just describing saying hey guys we can actually think about war as an object we can actually step outside of it and we can think about how do we just get good where are the principles of war like [ __ ] this is not just random there's character this [ __ ] thing let's think about the characteristics and get really really good at the stuff that matters how about that how about our capacity to think about things discern the principles and the characteristics how they relate to each other focus our limited time and energy and the stuff that actually matters and get really good at it that missing idea if i take that and i just feed it into itself a couple of times then i get a very powerful machine a very powerful engine okay how do i get find the things that matter in terms of discerning the things that matter and get rid of that this by the way is the term sovereignty that i think you mentioned in the document is that living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitrary and arbitrary's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting

bridge.arbitrum.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free uh the thread i want to pull on here and you know i'd ask you like basically how does web 3 build more game b systems and then we started talking about the evolutionary trajectory of the exploration of the design space of web 3 being a trajectory of like just framing it as evolutionary to me is i think so important because there are several epochs and you know there's there's you know memetic selection and um and it seems like the evolutionary process like the question i was gonna ask you was you know like how do we just speed run this evolution so that like all the you know like this stuff that's unconscious like dies out and like how do we speed run it till we get to the evolutionary equivalent of like mycelium networks or dolphins or like mammals or whatever which is you know evolution is not omnidirectional so it'll go in many different directions but then um you kind of told me that about this this sort of like metaphor for like instead of like giving someone a fish or teaching them to fish you teach them how to learn and then from there they can learn how to fish and i think that you know the way i connect those two thoughts is that if web3 builders are learning uh about learning and and they can they can save the all the time of traversing the design space by trying things but they can learn about how to learn about how to build systems that create more coordination as a meta characteristic and this is the way i connect the thoughts in my head am i at all pulling on a thread of where you're going with this yes it's a very nice way of putting it by the way i'm really using this the simple sort of the legible metaphor of speed running yeah i think you're dead on you know the notion is something like um i can either sit on a landscape and run around the landscape and and look at that ground level and say oh [ __ ] okay there's a i keep being in a maze like i'm in a maze the walls are very tall so i'm just running around the maze and i have to explore the maze or what would happen if i could just go up and look at the whole [ __ ] thing from above yeah let's give the typography yeah can you take a higher perspective on the entire problem domain notice its basic characteristics and then and then and then make a very simple teleportation to the location that you want to get to that's the the human thing that's what humans can do and i should say by the way every single human being who is more capable of engaging in that exercise is able to actually out-compete everyone else so that's the anti-rivalrousness of the book i think going back to that point if i'm not mistaken well it's a very interesting dynamic between the rivalrousness that is embedded in the capacity to more fully participate in the anti-rival risk this is a very important point so if i can navigate the intrinsic anti-rivalrous more effectively than you can one of the things that happens is i can actually out-compete you in the domain of the rivalries but if you and i enter into a space of collaboration right our collective capacity to navigate the anti-rivalrous is better than any given individual individual capacity so that that move is like a funny like it gets turned on its head so yes for example elon musk is a perfect example of somebody whose individual asymmetric capacity to simply navigate at the level of the anti-rivalries to step outside of the maze and say well [ __ ] spacex tesla battery solar they're all kind of part of the same landscape if i do this this and this i'll sort of teleport across of course the electric car is trivial right that's more or less what he did remember he sat down and said here's what i'm going to do over this period of time how did he do that well he just popped up from the landscape looked at the characteristics identified some fundamental levers like the implication of moore's law in the context of batteries was able to make some shifts on the basis of a completely different view of the landscape wasn't engaging in an evolutionary process it was engaging in design or consciousness process and outcompeted you know essentially everybody in the entire automotive for example but um there is a a limit of his particular individual capacity to engage in this exercise um which is very high to be sure and there's a valley crossing associated with collaboration meaning whenever if i enter into collaboration with you our our collective intelligence just to use that as language our collective capacity to navigate the anti-anti-ravelrus actually goes down for a while then either of us individually because of course i've spent a whole lifetime being coherent with myself so i'm really really i understand my own language i have a lot of capacity to do my insights you are you're optimized and toned for yourself we don't really know each other very well so it takes a while to learn how to collaborate but if we there's a point at which the potential of our collaboration is actually larger than the actual of our individual right so our actual collaboration is going to go down but if we if we're skillful at collaboration and we work our way through it to a certain point the actual collaboration of we all right that a new agent which is now both of us is higher than where we were as individuals right by the way just super clear that state but what i just said there is me teleporting outside of the landscape of navigating the anti-rivalrous a whole other move right i made just two people first move is moving out of the domain of the actual looking at it and saying well the anti-rivalrous and is a way of navigate oh [ __ ] what if i think about the anti-rivalrous as a domain and pop out one level higher and that's of collaboration in principle a uh a collective intelligence that is composed of the largest number of nodes where each node individually has the highest capacity in itself and in collaboration so two characteristics will have the highest total potential and and two degree which is coherent which is to say that it has achieved a a frictionless or noiseless integration of its ambient potential it'll actually have the highest actual capacity to navigate the space of the anti-rivalrous that by the way is an end that's that phrase i just said there's sort of an end of the journey of exploring the space of game b right so if you're trying to think of what would be the sort of the ultimate strategy in in sort of all possible worlds that's it that's the ultimate strategy in all possible worlds is to uh inculcate or to catalyze uh or participate in the autopoaces of such a kind of thing not a kind of collective intelligence which has as it's intrinsic that it brings into itself individual intelligences in a fashion which actually increases their their specificity um and their particularity meaning each individual person who participates in game b is able to live their own values um even better than any circumstance where they're not in game b and becomes more sovereign more capable of expressing and living their lives functionally and effectively in the world by virtue participating in game b that's the essence of what it is and is able to do so in a space of increasingly effective collaboration with everyone else right so and that some of that that integration across the number of people is the largest possible field of capacity to navigate the anti-rival risk which then of course means it has decisive strategic advantage of everything that's happening in the space of the rivalries right now back to the web 3 folks the question now is not not theoretic it's actually practical like the theoretical statement is there now it's the practical question of how how do we actually implement various kinds of coordination structures that are guided by these principles that actually begin the process of moving individuals increasingly along the trajectory right because you are where you are if you haven't yet even learned how to learn we're going to have to and if you're if you're if you're stuck in a certain location that you have to take first step and that that i think web 3 is is moving from the unconscious exploration of nft space to more people actually having a conscious location and saying okay how do i build things like the onboarding problem it's very practical right yeah that this [ __ ] thing's hard to use and yeah they're really sort of either super greedy super motivated or super nerdy to to on board [Music] well we need to onboard effectively everybody uh in a certain order by the way not to say everybody all at once it's a very practical problem and it's a learning problem we actually have to find a way to help people learn how to navigate in this new environment it's a learning problem in a lot of different ways it's not just a ui problem we're actually teaching people whole new ways to um identify to find out how to meet their needs in the world like it's a whole home so we can pivot everything i just said to the very practical of the onboarding problem in web3 and think this architecture say okay what are the things that are ready at hand like what are the low-hanging fruit in the landscape that we already have our hands free do that and can we think what are the most meaningful ones what are the highest leveraged ones what are the most urgent like that kind of stuff yeah one of the things that you know really stuck out to me from what you said is that like this increasing field of collective intelligence comprised of several different nodes that are increasing in intelligence and capacity can learn for themselves um and catalyzing that movement is sort of like the first thing that that could possibly happen and and i'm wondering you know it kind of reminds me of how i think i kind of have this theory that education is anti-fragility the more people understand the importance of public goods and can say it in their own words relative to their own sovereign place in the world the more that creates anti-fragility for the world's public goods like that movement is is important but i guess i'm you know i'm wondering you know once we've established that that increasing field of people learning to learn and and looking at the ecosystem like what else do we focus on like you know if you're if you're looking at the landscape from from up here uh what else do you see up there like what else should people be be focusing on once we've catalyzed this increasing uh collective intelligence field like from within that what do what do we focus on next okay well um let's see you've got a fundamental scarcity in in the domain of attention so what we want to do is we want to liberate people two-dimensionally we're going to liberate them from wasting their attention so it's if [ __ ] jobs is a good example and we also want to liberate them from spending their attention foolishly these are not quite the same they're similar but not quite the same so endless doom scrolling on twitter is spending your attention foolishly and your [ __ ] job is um being stuck or being is constrained and how you're spending your attention now the first these are these are two kind of different sorts of problems one is we want to generate con environments and just think about at a leverage what i want to do is i want to identify the individuals whose attention is the most leverageable you know so vitalik's attention is more leverageable than most people's right because he has a capacity to lead the generation of ethereum which has a lot of implications right so i want to identify the individuals whose attention is the most leverageable i want to liberate them from wasting their [ __ ] time but then i want to go deeper i want to actually work with them in a developmental educational program so that they can increasingly more effectively orient their attention towards the most relevant location for their particular quality of capacity in the world as it is right so look at sort of the the what is it called there was a great book there's a the education of young werner something like that there's the education of young vitalik like okay vitality your sort of basic developmental environment caused you to orient towards this thing blockchain as world computer nice right i've noticed and i pay a lot of attention he has continuously had a series of epiphanies right [ __ ] right right about it dao yeah you know uh governance [ __ ] okay right about it right so he keeps having this is of course what you'd like to do is have them have a meta epiphany how do i what is this arc of epiphanies what kinds of practices might i personally metallic undergo what kind of context might i put myself in both physically and relationally that have this characteristic of of maximally upgrading my own stream of epiphany so that i am unlocking my own attention into more meaningful orientation right so it's like the second derivative of more epiphanies like optimizing for that yeah exactly now notice what happens um to the degree to which we're actually able to identify and liberate those whose attention has the highest amount of leverage and then support them in on the second derivative of the stream of epiphany so their attention is increasingly relevant and meaningful in attending to the world you're getting right and every single person who is on that field is now freeing up more possibility for liberating more people across both dimensions that's what we need it's just that just do that we've kind of established that we're gonna identify the people whose attention is the most leverageable liberate them from wasting their time and liberate them from spending their attention foolishly um you know whether that's reporting on a [ __ ] to a [ __ ] job or endlessly doom scrolling on twitter and you know i can't help but but think that you know some of the work that we're doing at get coin with trying to get people to be able to quit their jobs and work on public goods we've kind of just like stumbled up into this domain that that you're talking about here not to you know talk my own book at get coin too much but like you know i guess like how can you know what it what how do we how do how do we like liberate the world's attention i mean so it reminds me of at the start you were talking about having to compete with game a type systems uh to to even survive like how do we compete with twitter with a mechanism that's better at like sense making and doesn't like attention hijack you with with these crazy like limbic hijacks and race to the bottom of the brainstem like how do we get out of that hmm so let's let's um let's sort of do the thing um first order is noticing that asking questions is a useful thing to do yeah right that until you've actually gotten to the point where you're asking the right kinds of questions you are ultimately behaving in a random fashion um now that doesn't necessarily mean that we are at any given point in time able to actually get to the deepest most fundamental questions and certainly answer them well but it does generally mean that if we're not operating in that mode of saying wait a minute slow down what are the relevant questions here to what do we understand what we're about can we maybe ask let's just take a pause and ask some more deep questions and get to some level of okay yeah we've got a good handle on the shape of the space that we're operating in now we need to go out and just explore it and there's an evolutionary process in every phase right you still have to explore the space that you're operating in to some extent um so i'll give you an example from my point of view there's nothing that's happening right now in the in the broad strokes it wasn't obvious back in 2010 right it was evident that we were going to i mean literally i remember sitting down and writing down it's going to go there's going to be nfts literally we were calling them nfts i don't understand how we got that language but we're you know nfts i don't know what they're going to be called but the n t nft right non-transferable non-functionable token right soulbound is what vitale calls them yeah soulbound well i like that that's very nice that's super nice because it calls off the notion of soul which is the intrinsic right the most fundamental aspect which is non-fungible and non-transferable is actually your soul um and then everything that is accumulated to that by essence would be sold out see this is this is beautiful that's the aesthetic that's the vibe good vibe um so we can actually and we can do that or there's a mapping process can we step back for a little bit and take a look at the overall landscape and identify what are the areas that have certain necessity we're going to need to deal with them right and by the way can we have a sense of timing like okay at what point do we need to be thinking about how do we deal really really deal with the the the regulatory consequences of of the legacy financial system about nine to 12 months ago right that's the threshold where this was something where we could in principle begin the process of actually organizing using our collaborative capacity and the resources under under control to begin consciously designing new approaches to jacking the regulatory system i mean we're jacking right because it's already jacked we're just sort of taking over the existing kind of cybernetic control structure that finance built over the last 50 years and saying hey cool you've built the cybernetic control structure over our political and regulatory environment we're just going to use that we'll just plug into that and use that better we're going to lobby more efficiently we're going to kind of like create new kind of uh gateways for politicians like all that kind of stuff we're going to fund elections more effectively that kind of [ __ ] like we're just going to play your game and maybe we'll do we'll invent two or three more things but we're going to we have to win that piece of the strategic landscape if you're looking at the map going hey i want to get to this hill over here and across that hill there's a valley right here we're going to get across that valley is called navigate the political and regulatory environment around finance and in conflict with to some extent tradify okay cool that's a piece um that's one part right literally just that part of looking at the long arc trying to see what the map looks like identifying where the you know the significant values are and where are we on that trajectory and when's the right time for us to begin focusing right so that's that's one answer to the question um another answer to the question is let's call it like developmental like at the level of like what what are the various things that are very large leverageable and very general in terms of developmental arcs of individuals so how do i accelerate a given person's trajectory across the second derivative of epiphany and what are the things you want right there's a lot by the way we've got a huge amount of understanding of of how important it is to become embodied as opposed to being in a disassociated space a lot of web 3 less web 3 so if i say like bitcoin um let's go bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain web three it's kind of like names of certain kinds of uh uh eras right web three is is more embodied than bitcoin was uh by a lot uh and by the way blockchain cryptocurrency there's just more awareness of of being bodies in the world and not just pure abstract uh uh minds but the point is that that that there's a bunch of practices that are associated with embodiment and there's an awareness there's actually a science a whole sort of discipline understanding why and how embodied intelligence has a fundamental role to play in navigating environments particularly collaborative environments like this question of governance in dallas let's take that one let's say actually very nice dallas yep it was gonna happen for sure and i [ __ ] wrote about it a long time ago yeah and it's gonna look like this and one of the problems with dao's at the very top of the stacks gonna be this question of governance the question of governance is going to involve more or less three moves one is the the conscious or unconscious dis uh aggregation of the habits and inertia of legacy concepts around what governance is and how it operates this is sort of about reinventing we come in with a new governance which is basically just a copy paste oh it's like you know congress and constitutions and [ __ ] like that it's like old stuff not really right it's more fundamental we have to kind of like dissolve the forms that it's congealed into in the past reduced back into its fundamental characteristics then we have to explore how to embody it in new forms so the first move is chemical dissolution the second move is the the discovery of the new forms but then the third move is in fact the recognition of the embodiment of entirely new kinds of beings in the context of the new forms they both they they relate to each other you know if you're right to use kind of an old-fashioned example if i'm building governance around literacy around books like around like constitutions i have to have people who know how to read right both are important i have to have both sides of it right now dow governance is at least 50 percent individual human beings becoming more capable of engaging in self-driven collaboration right so the practice of becoming ones who can participate is as fundamental as kind of like the formal rules yeah and the structures and the intuitions and then of course we've got the actual instantiation of the institutional structures which much of which will be embodied in code in this environment um a lot of which will be embodied in pure culture by the way not so much in doctrine doctrine like law and sort of uh written stuff metal it's that you know yeah odin culture are the two places that are actually stronger so that by the way so there you go like that's a way of looking at the problem from above noticing the sort of the primary things need to be thought about and then we can say okay now how do we begin the process of doing things like what's the most effective way to address a given problem you know let's just run through that as a question well one answer is put the people for whom it is the most fundamental inquiry for them right it's not a good idea to put me in a problem that i don't really care about the people who really care intrinsically should be the ones who are oriented towards a given problem um design the approach to the problem which is a proper for the nature of the problem itself right right this again these are these are just sort of principles that you may in fact seem banal but for god's sakes if you actually just go through the steps notice notice what is the totality of the human typologies that need to be present to a particular problem to have an adequate perspective to perceive the problem in its wholeness so to actually grasp the problem properly and address it for real that's another site this notion of diversity is thoughtlessly applied there's a very thoughtful approach right i don't need three guys right now i need two i need two to have binocular vision a fifth guy but not really particularly helpful so now it's diversity that's getting confusing it makes my my visual cortex have a hard time processing one the problem i need two right what's that look like in any given problem can i get a sense of have we actually got the right perspectives here to really hold this thing in all of its in its in its particulars so that we can address it comprehensively and effectively is everybody you're actually motivated by values and you actually you truly care about intrinsically you know maybe not again we're we're we're moving from a place to another place in many cases you have to would call it you fight with the army that you got nothing army you want yes right and you're constantly trying to evolve the quality of the army you've got so that it's more and more effective in the context of where you actually are yeah um by the way i so i could go on and on but you kind of get it right this is a whole sort of basic set of of heuristics and principles and rules that allow us to use conscious process to grasp the particulars of a problem domain and make the most effective choices that we can at a given moment not the least constant upgradient of the aforementioned right yeah and i think that the upside out there for the builders who are listening is that as opposed to unconsciously exploring the design space and maybe stepping in a bear trap this allows you to kind of go above the design space see it from above and then more skillfully navigate the design space yeah and you know i i again back to this notion of uh there seems to be something about the nature of this space where it is uncovering this stuff on its own i'm seeing this all the time i'm seeing things like um principles of composability and that's that's actually in complete alignment with what i just said um i've noticed that a lot of the the conversations are actually operating at a level of thinking about what they're trying to do before they do it yeah um basic orientations towards of collaboration uh what's his name punk6529 is that right yeah that's right right some of his tweet threads are [ __ ] gold and they're tweets yes all right so that's that's the the anti-rivalrous he's actually in himself right at sahih contemplating deeply certain problems expressing one with a care for certain levels of clarity and precision in a public forum for all who choose to hear that's very high leverage very good stuff now by doing what i'm doing to the degree to which you think my discernment is useful i'm now providing you my quality of discernment orienting your attention away from something that may be less valuable or less effective towards something that may be more valuable or more effective and by the way i'm also calling out hey punk six five two nine how do you continue to do a better job we mm-hmm a collaboration i'm i am completely in a conspiracy conscious conspiracy with punk6529 to makes punk 6529 the best punk he could ever be because everything he does better in this fashion recurses back to the entire environment anti-riotous right and the whole system gets better you know so those are those are that's like public goods on public goods um yeah the derivative of public goods is there anything i didn't ask that you want to say to this audience yeah um so i've been around for a little while i'm a little older than 50 and i've been involved in the tech space since i was like nine maybe eight yeah and paying attention like watching like noticing how different things have cycled through and one of the things that i i feel is is uh sad and just makes me feel about is how often opportunities have been missed the best possibility like my own particular arc of the cypherpunk arc oddly enough p marker commented on this recently i don't know exactly man but he said like cypherpunk sure turned out differently than my teenage self thought it would and i said i hear you because my teenage stuff was also tuning into the cypherpunk thing and thought it would turn out differently than it did um and i would say let's not do that this time yeah let's [ __ ] nail it like let's do that let's set ourselves the objective of [ __ ] nailing it let's dial it in no point in not i can tell you this the great filter is a thing we're heading towards a split uh but we can stick the landing on this it'll be amazing if we pull it off and vastly better than any number of bags getting bigger whatever number goes up feels like yeah meaningfulness itself and its most fundamental characteristic is literally waiting to be had if all we do is set ourselves the absolute commitment to nail it um i love that what a place to end let's nail it um jordan where can people find you online where can people find your work i feel like we just scratched the surface of game b in your work where can people find you well i don't really have a public persona per se i mean i have a twitter i tweet occasionally i've got a youtube channel i used to make videos i don't do it that much anymore i used to have a medium channel i don't write that i do have a sub stack but honestly i don't express that much to be frank i'm i'm kind of operating with to be i'm doing working on a version of the project that i call the sybian project which is just doing it when something seems worth sharing i'll express it usually frankly on twitter or on youtube um so if you subscribe to those and you care you might get notifications although i'm probably downloaded quite a bit these days um but i would i would say something more like this just attune to the things that are most relevant to you and if anything i say is relevant it'll probably get to you through the right channels um all right well you were too humble to mention your twitter handle so if you want to follow jordan on the bird app it's jay green hall uh twitter.com jay green hall uh and i discovered you i think on the rebel wisdom podcast so i think that you've done a little bit of work with them and there's some really great content out there for people who want to dive deeper as well um jordan this has been a fascinating conversation i learned a lot i think our audience is going to learn a lot and really love this and so thank you very much so much for coming on the green pill podcast really appreciate it yeah well i hope that it was uh helpful it's always such a hard thing to know oftentimes i listen to myself speak at the end i'm like holy [ __ ] that was nonsense um but other people seem to sometimes find it helpful so that's why i keep going on these things um thank you very much for creating this context by the way i really enjoyed the conversation yeah i think there's a huge opportunity between uh game b thinkers people who have been around the block and people who are traversing web3 to create a synthesis between them so appreciate your your step forward in doing that jordan beautiful bye man all right peace [Music] you
