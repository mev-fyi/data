you kind of think about the chaos of the decade and you're wondering yourself is there going to be a world war three welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys great episode today World War III versus the machines that's the title of this episode those are two of the topics we unpack in this episode it's a super ambitious episode but we have Dimitri kafinas who is a fellow podcaster host of The Hidden forces podcast also an aggregator like David and I there's a lot of things about a lot of things because he talks to a lot of people so he's a perfect guest to have this conversation with a few takeaways for you on today's episode number one what's the probability of World War III I know you're wondering so are we we ask that question we get into the details number two should the U.S actually fight China over Taiwan what would that even look like number three we get in a discussion about the Unabomber Ted could Ted Kaczynski did the Unabomber actually predict the future he had some prescient things to say about it certainly number four will the U.S survive the rise of the Machines a lot of conversation about AI the machines how they are taking over number five the ultimate question I think have we as a society lost the ability to solve hard problems or can we find it within ourselves to solve the hard problems that confront this decade and the generation that we're in David really cool conversation I think we just uh sort of talked about a lot of things that were in our hearts on our minds with a fellow podcast or got into some heavy subjects but uh Dimitri is an individual who um I think likes to think in the same way we do which is like let's just if we got something heavy to talk about let's just dive into it and uh it'll make us feel better about the subject when we can actually get into the the gritty details and see if there's a way to solve it specifically with another podcaster because a podcasters maybe I'm just gonna chill our own class type here but uh like we in order to be a good podcaster you have to think at a kind of a meta level because you know it takes people that can like zoom out very very broadly to talk about people like deep down at the protocol level and then all the way Zoom back out to the macro and talk about like social stuff and so like Dimitri does the same thing on his hidden forces he goes and talks about the problems of uh ETF investing on the stock market compare and cross-references that with like the social dynamics of the United States and so there's podcasts related to these it's all related but it's like podcasters that are really the people like stitching these conversations together and and zooming out so far broadly that they are actually able to link very distant Parts about this world and so I I really wanted to do this episode with Dimitri is like what happens when we get like a third another podcaster as a guest and like can how meta can we get and I really enjoyed the conversation that came out of it um and so it we the idea here was to ask some very basic questions that everyone kind of knows should be asked but doesn't really know how to ask or who to ask or even how to take seriously the questions the other the question like what is the probability of World War III what is that stage what would be the relevant like actors and players and hidden forces to name the Pod the name of his podcast that would play in this in this role and we kind of let the conversation go from there of course we talk about China and the United States and Taiwan but it quickly zooms out and gets a little bit more meta to talk about uh the forces that are making some of these huge huge geopolitical forces collide with each other why are we on this Collision Course what about today's society is making this reality happen and how what do we do about it and it gets back down to the social layer of the domestic U.S politics uh this who we are as a people and and who we are as a society really really quickly and I really just appreciated this episode with Dimitri yeah it's a really fun episode to do and and certainly by the way for bankless subscribers stick around after the show where Dave and I do the debrief that is the episode after the episode and thoughts some of my favorite conversations happen in the debrief where David and I just take a breath digest give our unfiltered raw thoughts right after the episode we just recorded and if you want to become a bankless premium member there's a link in the show notes to go do that so you can listen to

Free bankless Nation we are super excited to introduce you once again to our friend Dimitri kofinus he is the host of The Hidden forces podcast hidden forces is one of David and myself one of our favorite podcasts out there it's kind of like you know those uh cities have sister cities in a different country I feel very much like hidden forces is a sister podcast to the bankless podcast and Dimitri has just a fantastic way of synthesizing a lot of different information across a lot of different subject matters today we're talking about power we're talking about geopolitics its effect on macro we're asking some big questions that have been in the back of my mind in the back of David's mind and I think probably listener in the back of your mind as well some of these questions were afraid to surface in other channels but we're going to ask Dimitri about them today Dimitri welcome back to bankless how you doing today I'm doing great guys thank you thank you Ryan thank you David for having me on Dimitri the name of your podcast is hidden forces can you talk about that name and kind of the subject matter of your podcast and and why you decided to call your podcast hidden forces that's a good question um why it uh I think it really began with a philosophy around the nobility of Truth the nobility of reality and that what we experience as reality is is a is really perception and that there are these quote hidden forces that are at the bottom of the ontological world that Define the what we view as reality but we can never actually know those things with absolute certainty and so we're always trying to get deeper down closer to the bottom of the vector to understand as as well as we can what truth is so that we can develop models that are more predictive of reality more predictive of the future so there there was it it combines both the Practical elements that are important to investors and also I just kind of those the philosophical ideas that have always interested me as a kid I think one of those hidden forces we've been kind of unpacking lately on Bank lists have been the hidden forces around macro which drives macro markets uh and as we've been digging into kind of some of the macro experts uh it has surfaced that um one of the one of the biggest hidden forces I guess behind macro as a hidden force in and of itself is geopolitics I think we want to talk about that a little bit today and I got I got to tell you as we like I guess we're two years into this crazy decade already uh and it feels a lot different than the previous decade and you know I think it feels a lot more uncertain a lot more chaotic and uh the potential for conflict seems to have escalated and I I can't separate Dimitri whether this is just sort of a internal gut feeling I have or it's like the books that I've been reading or the headspace that I'm in but I think it's kind of shared uh with a lot of people like this deep feeling of unsettlement what's going to happen next we're not too sure I want to ask you about um the stage and kind of get this this question top of mind uh because it feels like maybe we are headed closer towards some sort of a global conflict maybe we'll start there why do you think everyone feels this feeling of unsettlement this feeling in the air like conflict could be in the future uh and it's a great question I think a big part of all of this is that the the world feels increasingly out of control you know I don't know how old you guys are but the world I grew up in I'm born in 1981 the world I grew up in which was really the 1990s all of that seemed settled it was the unipolar moment and everyone was pretty much on board there were very few countries that weren't and they weren't really deemed as significant or we seem to have inexhaustible resources to deal with those one-off cases of Iran or North Korea or whatever uh or Iraq to begin that's really how we started the post-cold war period it was Iraq went vote Rogue we mustered an entire International Coalition and we dealt with it and so there was a sense of unity a sense of unity of purpose everyone was more or less on board with the international institutions and it was blue skies all the way and I think that we've come to a place now which I think was pretty much made absolutely clear politically geopolitically I think the moment was the invasion of Georgia by by Russia in 2008 but geopolitically I think it was or sorry but politically I think it was really with the election of Donald Trump and and that really changed the tenor and also U.S China relations and of course these are the two biggest most powerful economies and Military powers in the world so I think that the the recognition of all the uncertainty and this lack the sense of of instability particularly in the U.S because the Chinese political system is at least externally so stable and things here are so unstable that I think that is what is making us all feel the sense of well what's going to be the next shoe to drop because just been one shoe after the other after the other and American politics in particular sort of feeds off of that instability because both parties are able to use it in order to further their own political agendas which is really sad Dimitri in your answer just now you gave off a list a list of things right like a list of sources of chaos or symptoms of Chaos in the world and my mind kind of just goes to the model of a binary star system versus a trinary star system and a binary star system is famously like stable like these two stars just rotate and they just don't change but then sometimes they'll run into a third star and then things get extremely chaotic and eventually one star gets ejected and like this is also part of the uh metaphor of the three body problem right this is that that book where uh there's just a random set of parameters that are just very chaotic and they become chaotic until a moment happens and then they stabilize again and then like this is kind of my model for as a child of the 90s you know I only interpreted that that stability for so long but things have been more seemingly more and more chaotic and this rate of chaos also seems to be accelerating and I'm wondering if you if we can just kind of run through the list of all of like the different inputs that seem to be injecting instability into the like Global World Order uh you know once upon a time we had this superpower the American superpower that seemed to be just wholly dominant and that seems to have gone out the door we had the election of Donald Trump uh we have the rise of social media uh we have the rise of authoritarianism in China I'm wondering if just like you can think of the biggest sources of just like chaos that has disrupted uh what was once an equilibrium in this world it's a great observation and it also holds some promise because historically by yes unipolarity theoretically though maybe the US is the only real case of it's certainly the only case of global unipolarity but bipolarity is more stable than multipolarity and so I think that does capture um one of my concerns which is that we still haven't reached a new state of of equilibrium which presumably will be a bipolar world and so between now and when we get there it's um there's just an enormous amount of uncertainty by the world do you mean China and the us being sort of the two states exactly exactly but I think I I your your question David if I want if just to make sure I I follow it correctly was what are some sources of instability was that your question yeah well I think I think about this quite a bit um in terms of like I wanted to you know going back now a year I wanted to do episodes focused on different either potential conflict areas or frozen conflict areas and I think those areas whether it's whether it's Cyprus whether it's Greece turkey whether it's Kashmir whether it's the 49th parallel um nagorno-karabakh we saw that recently flare up these areas become more unstable in the kind of world that we're talking about because they're like stress points so I think they're they're clearly and of course Taiwan it's not a frozen conflict but it's a uniquely unstable equilibrium because China and the Chinese governing Elites have been very clear about their sense of ownership over that and over Taiwan and that it's a non-negotiable issue an existential issue for them and clearly there isn't the same level of consensus in the United States I mean so that's the other thing that's so interesting about all this stuff it's so intangible but especially for for a country like China but the US does this too cut so much of what happens on the international stage is actually it's not the application of force but it's the uh installation and cultivation of norms and so for the Chinese that it I think again I'm not an expert on this but I think it is clear to me that they put a premium on this on this kind of thing and they do cherish stability and so if their their ideal with uh Taiwan has been to actually try and slowly for lack of a better word cook the situation so that the Norms change which is why the visit with Pelosi while destabilizing I think actually probably benefited China because there was no strategic purpose of the mission on the part of the United States but a lot of the Chinese to engage in um fire exercises and to surround the island in ways that they hadn't up until they're awaiting their desires escalating exactly so um that's how I mean for me the the I would look there are specific parts of the world that are more unstable than others I think also it um it changes the security dynamic in Europe as we know which all of these things I think will ultimately lead to a more stable world but they increase instability in the short term also I I think we'll probably return to some of the the other factors at play in this kind of chaotic world but let's uh continue on that line of conversation of like U.S and China um I read Ray dalio's book not too long ago I think David you read it too it's called The Changing World Order and he makes um the observation it's basically a list that kind of Chronicles different uh World orders throughout history whether it's like Dutch or British or different Chinese dynasties that sort of thing and he talks about kind of the the cycle of power they hit their Peak and then they um they crescended downward and it's it's it there's always a cycle right it's like none of these Empires last forever and he's makes observation his book that that uh the US appears to be from a list of relative metrics on the decline relative to China on the on the incline I don't know if you agree with that but if you take his thesis uh and you continue that forward he also makes the observation that something like of the last six times a reigning power declined relative to a rising power there was conflict between the rising power and the reigning power four out of the six times so four out of the six times there have been some cases where uh that transition that torch was headed off gracefully uh you know you might think of like kind of the torch being handed off from like um the British Empire or something to the American Empire like that was I don't know I don't know what you consider that but there wasn't war between the the British and and the Americans again but this is the prospect right and so like you read books like this and then you talk about kind of the what I would call maybe like a conflict of Visions in the way the two societies are organized right now which is uh you know America has its Republican democracy sort of you know a classically liberal values at least you know it's best it purports to have these things and and China's very clearly uh not that uh much more top-down control um authoritarian you might say totalitarian others would say you know State surveillance State kind of managing things that's very important and it appears culturally important to many members of the society too so you take that backdrop and then you kind of think about the chaos of the decade and you're wondering yourself is there going to be a World War Three in my lifetime like is that is that an actual threat now this decade I'm gonna tell you I wasn't thinking about that in the 90s when I was growing up right maybe this is past the Cold War I know like earlier Generations were uh doing the duck and cover thing in the classrooms because of nuclear Holocaust Cold War stuff Russia in the U.S but it feels weird for Our Generation now as we've moved into adulthood to be facing a similar Prospect of wow is there the potential of a world war three do you think this is all like Doom porn or do you think that this is a a real concern that like we need to be cautious of and what do we do about this yeah I think it's a real concern obviously that we need to be cautious of I I when you were talking I was thinking about the different interest groups that are involved in making policy and what those different interest group groups want and traditionally corporate corporations multinationals Corporate America et cetera have wanted stability and many corporations many corporate leaders Founders Etc uh supported Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany and a lot of those people support the Chinese Communist party they would rather just see a stable world and also a lot of these folks a lot of these Tech Titans for example they they don't necessarily again when you're so well the truth is that like for a lot of these guys especially as the concentration of wealth has gotten Tighter and Tighter the what what's in the best interest of the people that are in a position to make policy doesn't necessarily jive with what is in the the best interest of ordinary people and because we've gotten to this place in American society today where there's such an extreme distribution of wealth and income the danger is that left unchecked this kind of corporate power for lack of a better word and and In Cahoots with government just basically folds and either develops A system that is very much more similar to the Chinese model and maybe we don't go into war or we have kind of just proxy wars that don't mean much or that we elect populist forces in the U.S elect a very braggadocious um sort of uh the blanking on the word for it but um uh a kind of really a powerful populist figure and that that person leads the us into a destructive War what we really want is we we want as a as a as a democratic liberal Society to become very clear on what what's important to us and to actually craft policies that take moderate risks but are willing know kind of where what hill we're willing to die on so like the issue of Taiwan is a good example because you have really smart people if some of whom have been on the podcast before like Elbridge Colby who put forward very compelling cases for why the U.S should draw a line in the sand when it comes to Taiwan similarly there are some other people who who put forward compelling reasons for why we shouldn't and why the U.S shouldn't expect that it should be able to maintain some level of influence over Asia Regional influence that in other words the Chinese given this their size and given their Ambitions should be expected to have Regional hegemony over Asia I don't know what I don't know what the answer is there and I don't even know if there is one quote right answer because I think the right answer also depends on what people are willing to do and because of where we are politically in the United States I've said this many times I've said it to you guys too I think the single biggest risk that we face and the biggest challenge that we face is not internationally it's not International it's domestic we're in this period of time in our society and the societies go through this they go through these kind of Cycles where we're we're doing we're in a process of undoing and remaking our own Society and becoming clear on what's important who we are identity is a big thing that's going on in our society today and it's exacerbated by the technological forces which are changing in many ways what it means to even be a human being you know I think people really are trying to understand what that means to live a human life in this world where we spend more and more of our time intermediated between screens and also where so much of our interaction is intermediated by technologies that steer Us in any particular direction interpret the data for us and so we're we're really in this kind of fog of war in addition to the larger quote World War III spectrum that we may be dealing with we're also dealing with an information War which I think is actually primary because it risks putting us in a really dangerous place because again understanding everything we just talked about with respect to politics and the uncertainty of American politics if you're Chinese or if you're Russian you're looking at them at America it can look pretty scary we're still the biggest dog in the kennel you know we have the the the largest military in the world at least the most powerful military in the world and we've fought many wars we know how to fight and America is a very militaristic Society so if we don't get our act together politically America could itself be the biggest threat for Global Peace like America could actually be the bad guys like that that could be a real Threat Vector yeah dude totally well so often times uh people act I mean I don't know any I don't know of any case where any country Acts you know it thinks that it's not righteous the Nazis thought they were acting righteously they felt deeply aggrieved by the terms of the peace after Versailles and they felt entitled not just as a result of what they felt they had lost and aggrieved against their own against the Democratic Republic that they overthrew but also that they were the master race I mean these are these are like deeply held beliefs and the United States has a tradition of exceptionalism so I you know I don't see any reason to believe that the United States could not elect a government that would speak to that exceptionalism and uh and that's a real concern I think to uh tie a few threads together that you just uh articulated we have everyone kind of understands that they're well there's absolutely like um National powers that have emerged like Russia just invaded a country uh the first kinetic war in Europe uh China is now showing Force around Taiwan and so you know paying attention to these things I think the American populace is like okay like there are some really hard questions that are on the table that we have to answer right now and whether or not I think when you said you know America needs to you know take accept some moderate risks I think what my interpretation of what that meant was like okay we actually we need to actually plant a flag in the ground and say hey we will defend Taiwan or no we won't but we need to make that decision and take accept that risk of it being the wrong decision but lead and execute on that and I think a lot of Americans are looking at these looming decisions that must be made about the future state of the globe and the powers that control it and then we're looking internally and being like wow we just effed up covid-19 so hard we couldn't even like manage our own country and like wow the 2016 election like has started to implode America internally and so we're looking externally at these massive looming clouds of decisions that must be made and we can't even like help ourselves and coordinate ourselves and I think that's starting to trigger a lot of fear in internally as like okay the next if covid-19 was worse than it actually was it would have been disastrous and so like throw one more like Match Into the pile and I think a lot of Americans would say like yo we we couldn't deal with that we couldn't do that is that a fair take when you say we can't do that we couldn't do that we can't deal with like we can't coordinate around a solution and like look more than just like our own infighting and left first right Warfare and like all this tribalism that we've had yeah so I think but that speaks to the fundamental breakdown of trust in society that we have a huge part of the population possibly I think likely more than half of the population fundamentally distrusts American institutions I don't mean have a has a healthy distrust I mean categorically distrusts anything that comes out of mainstream institutions the intelligence Community the mainstream media and so how do you build a coherent policy around that Dimitri what what percentage of that trust is deserved do you think versus undeserved very little very little so little um they're aren't totally unaccountable they're unaccountable with covet too you know the president got coveted again he's like triple freaking quintuple boosted and he just got coveted and I got it again you know and like every time um we end up having and they built they they were so much shame around this there was so much certainty around all the the the the covid um ordinances and and I mean even the social distancing we found out later it was just a number they threw it out there just like when they asked Hank Paulson why'd you pick 700 billion dollars for the Bazooka because it was a really big number you know and and so these guys and gals they're they're never held accountable and so of course that's the problem I mean that's the single I think I think if I I think the single biggest reason why we have so much distrust and there are many but it's the lack of accountability because every time this happens George Carlin has like this great um comedy skit from like the early 2000s or late 90s where he talks about this because every time you have something like this they always say okay let's move past this now let's move past this let's time to look forward and they always do that because it's in their benefit to look forward because then they don't get held accountable for all the stuff they've done so I totally agree with that I think where I differ from a lot of folks then the sort of um I mean a lot of the people in my accounts are Finn twit people but lots of people in this sort of um in this group of people that distrust because I'm also distrusting but I think that where I differ is that I feel like a lot of people's reaction to that is off it's all I'm just gonna believe whatever I want and I'll come up with a some ridiculous Theory and I'm just gonna stick to it because why not I think it's totally responsible and and that's the challenge um how many people want to get serious and and put their cynicism aside in cautiously move forward you know the kind of the Reagan trust but verify that's sort of my mentality yeah I totally agree I I do want to get back to kind of two pieces but like one one piece I'm back on the kind of this world war three theme and tying that out and the kind of the China like in America and kind of rising power and maybe sun setting power I don't know but um like when we talk about something like World War III right like the stakes couldn't be freaking higher right like world war three could genuinely be like not a planet Ender but like Life as we know it I mean we're talking about billions of lives potentially destroyed or impacted no it could be a civilization under that that was true during the Cold War that it could end civilization we've got that these kind of stakes that we're playing with which is like already how ludicrous is it to live in a world like that where that's kind of in the back of your mind and that we could be like you know life as we know it we could be verging on the edge of existential crisis and then David when you brought up like kind of uh you know the U.S having to make a decision on Taiwan does it fight over Taiwan or does it does it not does it let China do it and I read Ray dalio and you know dalio says China absolutely wants Taiwan and they're going to get it and they're going to flex all of their muscle they're going to play the long game and they're eventually going to get it but that is a non-negotiable and he posed the question America do you want to go to war over this of course he does it more eloquently like different words but I'm getting straight to the point and I have to ask myself if like to like I believe very much in state sovereignty and like the sovereignty of Hong Kong and sovereignty of Taiwan its citizens to like a democracy Western liberal values I'm a huge believer in this is it worth going to war and potentially ending civilization in a World War III for Taiwan a conflict over Taiwan like these are very heavy heavy questions they do not have clear answers and I don't know that we're going to get an answer on this podcast obviously to these things but I don't know I also don't know how they get resolved Dimitri and all of your like tours of things the guests you've had on do you like has there been anything to like answer questions like these for you and what do you think of this yeah well let me see if I can try to respond to that so clearly it was worth the risk over Cuba for the United States and I think this the thing the thing that is I think difficult to Grapple with is one we don't actually know what could happen given given how the world is structured ever since really the development of nuclear weapons and especially ballistic missiles it's always possible to blow up the world and so you're always dealing with that possibility but at the same time simply folding every time there's any kind of conflict doesn't actually solve the problem one because you could fold yourself into what becoming a subjugated state to another Power but even more likely and we you know I mean anyone that's ever been like in a fight knows this you know um if if there's one party that party gets pushed around enough if it keeps submitting and keeps submitting it itself may not know its threshold and at some point it just explodes and it shoots back in the other direction in other words it's in the best interest of both parties to find some kind of a stable equilibrium and so I I don't know I don't the analyzes that I've been um that I've I've seen on this issue and they are so tainted because you know I'm I'm speaking to a again there's lots of people that that uh deal with the issue of Taiwan I don't I haven't had a single expert who's actually Chinese and uh speaks Mandarin actually some of them do speak Mandarin but I I it's again it's there's so much uncertainty around it but I would have to err on the side of saying that the United States has to do has to make it really really hard for the Chinese to take Taiwan or to set new Norms so that they actually control that territory because what I have come to understand in my own reading is that Taiwan is essential for any kind of force projection by China outside of Asia and it's also very very very important for um maintaining on our part for maintaining our existing Coalition structure and a line structure in Asia and if the Chinese are able to dominate the Asian land mass and and have have control over those economic relationships they are in a position to then grow and project power further on and I should also just say this because again I just I did preface this beginning with it just kind of acknowledging just how complex this is and how I'm not an expert on it but I'll also say that I think the US would constantly underestimate the power of the United States because we have traditionally been such an open Society so it's so easy to see the costs of that openness and all of our disorganization and the hot mess that America is but at the same time we our economic model has led to much more growth than a much more sort of closed again for lack of a better word totalitarian granted the Chinese State capitalist model is not Soviet but it's still much more closed and it's not clear what kind of economic growth would they would be able to have with other Asian economies with that kind of a growth model so I I don't know it there's a lot of uncertainty there but if I had to if I had to put my foot on the scale I would probably say that the re the U.S really needs to step it up and prioritize developing a a long-term Strategic Defense framework for Taiwan and they need to do it urgently because from what I understand from the people I've spoken with it's not at all clear that the United States will be able to win in a conflict putting aside whether or not it escalated to nuclear war well that's interesting yeah can you get into that really quick uh is it quick yeah they I mean they do war games that they do war games and it and uh the U.S has lost some of those war games uh uh so it's not it's it's really not clear how prepared the US is the Chinese have built an entire like the the whole south of the country they've built all these huge installations for missiles for missile systems to to attack Taiwan and they would presumably be able to attack parts of the of the Pacific Fleet you know this would be like this would not be a joke you know what I mean it's not like um the U.S blockading um I I mean I I don't it's again like I said I'm not an expert on this guys but and I'm relying on the work of other experts but I think we've gotten so used to American Force projection and being able to just go in and do whatever we want that we don't understand that this is a completely different animal and we just don't know what a war like that would look like and the problem as as Russia saw is that when you bite off more than you can chew you're in a completely new ball game so what were to happen if the US decided to actually throw its ring in the Hat and it turned out to be much more difficult than it thought now it's really stuck because if it turns tail and runs it's on it's we now have a completely new dynamic in the global geopolitical order and that would also embolden the Chinese to go bigger so I mean again and in all of this guys we all know and think about the possibility that we could be paranoid you know like a declining as you say I don't know that the US is declining I I mean in relative terms militarily yes but in absolute terms I don't know if I would agree with that and I still think the U.S has many long-term advantages to it that the the Chinese economy uh does not but um yeah I think I lost my train of thought well one one quick um you thought on this when it comes to World War III and kind of the Weaponry involved right it would become like the difference between World War one and World War II and the level of Weaponry it's like such a complete order of magnitude yeah like I mean think about from like you know for pre-World War one and World War one yeah exactly or like the Civil War to World War One like just the differences and so we are talking about not necessarily the tanks and planes we were talking about like cyber attacks that disable power grids we're talking about potentially biological Weaponry viruses we're talking about we had um biology on the podcast recently talked about like a a cloud a drone cloud of you know basically unmanned uh drones that are you know programmed as killbots you know it's like technologies that exist now on a harnessing harnessing commercial drones in in other in foreign this is not something bankless has discovered that has uh done episodes on but like have you done anything on this no but I mean yes I have I've done a number of episodes on cyber security and cyber terrorism I did two with Bruce schneier I did one with Josh Corman I did one with uh I can't remember the other person I did one with I also did one with Chris Bros Chris Bros is uh I believe his title is um he leads he leads business development at Auto rail Auto rail is Palmer Lucky's company Palmer lucky is the developer of the Oculus Rift Auto rail is a a military tech company uh look I mean I I again we're we're now totally in a place of sort of speculating here but if you can compromise all sorts of commercial drones and you can create a botnet using a bunch of commercial drones you could swarm a whole area I mean this is the thing about the world we live in today that I think is fundamentally different than the previous um the previous World in which we experienced Total War which is that it's kind of like the you're in you're when the United States went to war against the Nazis and against the Japanese neither of those countries none of the countries involved were in a position to harness the other countries resources and Military to project Force against itself today we're all running the same software I mean it's that I guess that that's another thing we could talk about which is to what extent are we going to begin to see segregation and Technologies but exploits exist if if the U.S finds an exploit in if the NSA finds a Windows exploit there are lots of computers all over China that run Windows now we're both vulnerable in this case and that exploit can be used to attack Chinese systems and so like we have to not only build Technologies that we can deploy to defend ourselves but we need to also be able to secure those Technologies and we also need to be able to secure the exploits that we ourselves need to use in order to build quote cyber weapons to attack adversaries and so you can see how complex this is and I think a lot of the anxiety that people feel is that people haven't we have an awareness of this complexity but we don't have a sense of is there is there a grip on it you know like we do we we don't trust the people in charge everyone more and more people see that Joe Biden is not well mentally he's not well you know what I mean and whatever your views of Donald Trump is he is he is very bombastic he's very aggressive um he's not stop someone that makes you feel I think like he doesn't he doesn't uh he's not a stable guy let's put it that way so it's it and and it's not at all clear to put it back to Joe Biden it's not at all clear to me that he's gonna run in 2024. I don't think he's gonna run I don't know I I don't see how that guy can run he it just seems like he's he's in in he keeps declining and it's not clear to the Democrats would be able to run Camilla Harris I don't know guys I I feel like we're when it comes to the politics internally in the US I don't think we've seen anything yet I don't I don't think we have any idea of how things are going to shake out and I'm not just talking about whether or not they're going to prosecute Trump whether he'll be able to run who's going to run on the Republican side who's going to run on the Democrat side are they going to have primaries on the Democratic side for the Republican for the Democratic nomination for president United States so I just think there's so much uncertainty and if you guys remember what was the political climate like when Trump was President like it was all the media could talk about all the media could think about it suck the oxygen and of everything else again as the world becomes more and more unstable the stability or instability of American politics simply exacerbates that you know it's like 11 is a feedback loop yeah yeah and I think really the point of all of that like the uh you know uh Army of commercial drones sweeping over Taiwan I really like this is a Sometimes some of these conversations we're talking about World War III is like a little bit of hyperbole but the point is is that you know we don't know maybe maybe not maybe maybe it's all chaos yeah maybe maybe oh sorry go ahead the point is that there are a bunch of unaccounted for attack vectors in our technology that we aren't aware of that if we talk about the leading powers of the world going Head to Head we would discover these exploits very rapidly and we all kind of know that they're all around us and then going back to like domestic politics is like our domestic politics would not be able to I think about these things Joe Biden does not have a solution for an army of commercial drones I can guarantee you that um I I want to take a yeah you have a comment uh I'm just going to say that uh and it wouldn't even necessarily be something like that because I think what's um you know I did uh I'm gonna bring up two episodes now that I've done that I think are relevant here directly relevant one I did with David kilcullen who was special advisor David Petraeus and I think he was also he worked directly with Condoleezza Rice or under Condoleezza Rice and it it had to do with the the transformation of warfare and there's this one particular thing that he calls liminal Warfare and if he came up with a phrase but liminal is that threshold between what's real and not real it's like the surreality right and I think this is what's particularly scary because you know a swarming cloud of drones is very clearly you're under attack there's no doubt about it and then you just have to ascribe who did it which gets a little complicated but you can be pretty confident at that point what's going on especially if there's a broader context of conflict but you know look at what the United States did with stock stocks now the U.S and the Israelis did with stuxnet in Iran I think it was free for years we were sabotaging their nuclear program and they had no idea they thought they were just making mistakes the scientists were messing up they were getting something wrong the subterfuges were blowing up they thought it was all on them they had no idea that it was actually the US and and Israel that were sabotaging their equipment I think we're in a world now where people are much more attuned to that and so the risk also is that you begin having attacks that are conducted that are sort of on under under the level of perception and that develops creates a lot of paranoia so now you end up having countries being thinking maybe ascribing attacks and actions foreign actions to things that aren't actually one of those things and because and and this brings up another episode that I did I've told you guys about this one episode 28 um where I also pulled a clip from one of my favorite movies ever probably my favorite movie ever or trilogy The Matrix and it was I think it was the second Matrix movie and Neo was down in the machine room with uh the chancellor or the whoever was the the head of the High Council of Zion and the counselor made the point that while we were trying to destroy all of these machines while the the resistance was trying to destroy the the machines that were enslaving Humanity they were dependent on all sorts of machines to keep the city alive and to keep them alive and to fight their resistance and we are in a place in the world today where we need machines we depend on these machines to survive and the the vulnerability of those machines is greater the interconnectivity I mean maybe they're as vulnerable as ever but they're more interconnected and that interconnectivity allows them to be allows those those vulnerabilities to be exploited so we talk about nuclear weapons and nuclear war but that may not be the vector of escalation that we experience in this world that we live in today Juno is

think that brings us to I think the the second half of this podcast that we want to get to which is the conversation of the machines uh and after this I'll kind of ask you about um trying a solution to this but uh just leaning into some of the content that we've talked about prior to this that we that we know we wanted to cover you gave us this article by a Bill Joy titled why the future doesn't need us and I just want to read an extra few excerpts that I've pulled out from this article uh that's following along with what you just said so the expert starts we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power what we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift in a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machine's decisions as society and the problems that face have become more and more complex and the machines become more and more intelligent people will let machines make more of their decisions for them simply because machine made decisions will result in better results better results than the man-made ones eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that the human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently at that stage the machines will be in effective control people won't be able to just turn off the machines because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide in a completely this is uh skipping forward a little bit in a completely free Marketplace Superior robots would surely affect humans robotic Industries would compete vigorously among themselves for matter energy and space incidentally driving their price Beyond human reach the price of obviously matter energy and space is what that alludes to unable to afford the necessities of life biological humans would then be squeezed out of existence there's probably some breathing room because we do not live in a completely free Marketplace government coerces non-market Behavior especially by collecting taxes judiciously applied governmental concern can support human populations in high Style on the fruits of robot labor perhaps for a long while a textbook dystopia uh he goes on the author goes on to discuss how our main job in the 21st century will be ensuring continued cooperation from the robotic industries by passing laws secreting that they'd be nice and describe how seriously dangerous a human can once be transformed into an unbounded super intelligent robot some super cool sci-fi topics here that definitely paints a dystopian future but Dimitri I want I'm hoping you can unpack a little bit of what this this last half of this was where the machines are and we understand this when we look at you know I don't know how to navigate a City without Google Maps anymore yeah uh Spotify picks better songs than I could ever hope for like I'll just give over more in my life to just some basic algorithms but sometimes those algorithms like now like the interest rates of maker down like not like dictate my life and crypto people will know what that meant um and so I'm kind of wondering can you just like unpack this question a little bit more and talk about the way the various ways that the US has tried to like solve this machine control problem either implicitly or explicitly and also China and the differing strategies there yeah so that was a big question but we can unpack it uh first of all I'm curious when you guys read that or in the first part of the passage that you quoted which as you guys know was actually lifted from Ted kaczynski's industrial Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber his paper uh industrial society and its future and when I first read that when I was a senior in high school I remember how remote it felt you know it was like this is pure sci-fi I might as well have read this in a you know um or something yeah yeah but when you read it now it's like whoa this is where we are today we can't turn the machines off yeah that's we're past that point I'll tell you um this week uh in our so we do all of our company stuff like content planning stuff in a chat application called Discord I don't know if you've ever used that Dimitri it was fantastic we now have an active member of our team who is an AI who is a robot where we basically it's called mid-journey and when we need mid-journey to spin up a graphic for a Content piece we uh spin out we type what we want and mid-journey is an AI tool that produces fantastic images for us graphics and in a lot of ways it's Superior to what a graphic designer could come up with language processing so you just say um person haircut like short hair riding a horse and mid Journey spins up in 45 seconds four images of that like yeah it's crazy and then like we think about like the algorithms we serve from a Content perspective right so like we're always trying to optimize how we tune things for like the Tweet that's gonna fire off what will the Twitter Algos support and propagate what will the YouTube Algos support and propagate like at a certain manner like these algorithms are the machines and we are serving them aren't we I guess someone programmed them but they are now programming us a hundred percent so I have a few thoughts about that high level I believe that you know in answer to what David's question was originally about you know what the the Chinese model the American model kind of what the dangers of not addressing some of the um disparities in power really because I talked about it in terms of wealth and income but it's really power in society we risk while we while the elites haven't really taken full control of society that the the level the Democratic levels of power will allow us to elect a populist uh demagogue who could blow up the whole world um at the same time that's honestly for me blowing up the world versus becoming enslaved and becoming as Ted Kaczynski writes in his paper domestic animals they're domesticated animals that's I I don't really see the difference for me I don't I'd rather I don't I want to want to live as a domesticated animal um and or to live under the control of other of other people to the extent to the kind of control that we're talking about here um and so the real question for me is first of all if I'm right and I think I am that at least those of us who live in Western liberal societies that have had a taste of Freedom against Freedom's imperfect all that stuff yes yes but if if I'm correct in believing that people if they really understood what was happening here and I think more and more people do understand that they wouldn't accept it and they'd want to come up with some kind of a solution if I'm correct in that then I think the that's where we need to focus our energy and we need to come up with some kind of we're talk this we're talking about here what what's needed here is a a kind of a revolution in terms of our relationship to technology and our control over it are our our Democratic control over technology so I've I've been beating this drum for many years um which is that when it comes to platforms like Facebook and uh even Google of course but we Facebook such an easy example or Twitter we cannot allow private corporations to control to control to to be able to to to develop algorithms that decide not not only serve us what those algorithms think they want because they get to know us so well but actually begin to manipulate our behavior in order to move us towards the commercial objectives that their advertisers or clients seek because one that in of itself is unacceptable because of where it leads eventually but but also eventually the governments are very powerful and governments always have relationships with the with the private sector and that's just way too much control and so we need to develop some kind we need to we need to regulate these these types of companies um these business models are the issue in my opinion not necessarily Monopoly power we can talk about trust and Anti-Trust but the real issue is that these companies are incentivized through the ad model through developments and knowledge in the behavioral sciences AI big data to basically hijack our Consciousness hijack our will and basically turn us into mindless surfs that's where this thing is going everyone sees it that's why all the people that work in these companies have been ringing the alarm bells and if we don't fix that we're not going to be able to fix anything else so um unfortunately I haven't seen people I've had Andrew Yang on the podcast but even you know Andrew who um is more technically astute than than other candidates I haven't seen him really banging the table on this issue and I think I think it's the single most important one it's more important than climate change it's more important than nuclear weapons it's more important than any of those things because without this we don't have democracy this is part of the reason why I think David and I are in crypto by the way is we see a remote chance of being sort of like building kind of a third way here uh even though we're very far from what you said but like I want to go back to back to this because we opened this episode we're talking about how our uh our institutions are really failing how no one trusts them and indeed they haven't really earned our trust in fact they've probably earned our distrust right so we acknowledge that and yet we're asking or we're we're putting our hopes on Democratic institutions to rein in our technology platforms and the powerful AIS that would govern Our Lives and I'll just say Dimitri this like China has a fix for this already okay China is like no State's gonna own and control all of its major social media entities and all of its technology entities and they are going to do our will they are 100 regulated right they can't do anything outside the machines or the subservient the machines are the subservients of the state right and not necessarily the people mind you but like of the state and it's a different thing but at least they are subservient so like China will tell you oh cool Dimitri like we're like two decades ahead of the us like we fixed that problem the machines now work for us the state and we have complete power over them and you kind of look at I think we were talking about this as we were preparing for this conversation you kind of think of China as like they're in front of VCS and they're pitching a business model and they've got this slide deck and they've got really great product Market fit because they're like problem statement the machines are coming they're going to dominate your lives you see it already solution we clamp down the state owns the machines we control all the algorithms problem solved other are competitors by the way they're taking a different approach they're taking this decentralized Democratic approach and it results in some and it results in some half-assed authoritarianism as I've called like kind of the plan of the US right now which is like it doesn't really do anything well and so we're gonna beat them out of existence that is the slide deck for China right now and I gotta say seems a little compelling seems like they got some product Market fit here what do you think about this yeah they're like the guys pitching the VCS on being like the Uber of totalitarianism sure and uh and and yes and I think that that it makes sense why they're they're the initial customers that they're targeting are authoritarian countries that are threatened by America's foreign policy which definitely tries to export democracy and I think we've kind of been a little too um I I I would agree that we kind of overdid it there I never quite understood why we went so extreme on the Saudis if we're going to be extreme against societies we should have been we should have been tougher on them after 9 11. given what has come out over the years from the from the 911 Commission but um yeah I mean I completely agree with that framing and I think that is the challenge that they've got it together they have uh they have a product as you say they have a deck they have a working product that's out in the field and they are developing a kind of a of a franchise model um certainly with their digital currency which is a technology that a lot of other countries are going to want to uh adopt and in what's beautiful about America is that we are a much Messier Society even though we've become more military militaristic and authoritarian you guys talked you and I talked about this as well which is you know one of the reasons I love countries like Argentina is exactly because of how dysfunctional it is but you have to strike some kind of a balance so I recognize that but I still think I would rather live in the in the balance that exists in America than in what exists in China so that's the that's the challenge and I think I have all have again this is something else I've believed for a long time but I don't I might be wrong here it might be too simplistic of an analysis but I felt that ultimately this this comes down to leadership and yes it's going to be my view it's going to be a populist leader that's going to have to solve the problem in other words the same pathway through which the United States could become destabilized and flip into totalitarianism or some kind of crazy dictatorship and kind of blow up the planet that same channel is a channel that would be used to fix the system right so whatever you whatever you think of FDR he wasn't Stalin and so FDR though was an extremely powerful political figure Lincoln was an extremely powerful political figure and again no matter what you think of Lincoln ultimately it took that level of power in the executive to um get through a very very difficult period in American history in that case the Civil War in the case of FDR the depression World War II so I think that's where we are and the question is where are those leaders going to come from who is going to speak to a majority of Americans and that doesn't do it from a place of anger divisiveness um who is willing to speak honestly and that's where I think the Democrats and the Republicans are currently failing is they're not speaking honestly and there's a lot of anger and a lot of attacking and a lot of dividing by both parties and I haven't seen um a better alternative yet and so that's what I'm hoping for but I don't see it right now I've alluded to this um this number of times on Bank list before uh and it's uh Nietzsche's goddess dead statement uh and the idea here is that uh Niche realized that the global order was no longer coordinated by religion as in fear of God was not the thing that made people wake up every single day and go and harvest the fields and go get stuff done is it wasn't the force that was organizing the world because we had the Renaissance and you know people shed their religious um their religious don't you know uh the dominant religious like organizing force in their lives and then you know instead of just Waltzing into this like enlightened society that was all about science first we had chaos and then we had order like it's not you don't just hop from order to order you go from order to chaos to order and so you know when when nizishe claimed God is dead it was in the middle of the 1800s I think uh late late 1800s uh and claims like all of a sudden like we need a new organizing rule set to organize by or else we're going to delve into chaos and the next thing that happened was World War One World War II uh and then we found our order again uh and I kind of think we can if we're going from this place of where we had you know the stable America from you know 80s and 90s and early thousands uh to to where we are now which is uh this a new Force guiding over the world which is the machines we first have to go through a time of Crisis and then we rebuild on the other side that's kind of how I kind of mapped this out as the Future Would you agree with that General progression I agree with that and I think that um probably for guys like you and in your community some of my solutions to this may feel a little heavy-handed but another thing that I think that I would Institute if I could would be for example we send people abroad to study I'm not saying this has to be mandated that people have to be sent to other states of the Union to study but I would I would I would try and do things like that try to incentivize anything and everything that can cause greater degrees of unity and self-exploration both as an now so we what what I think we need in this Society is to come to two um more concrete Notions of identity one we need a more concrete notion of national identity because the nation-state is still a powerful actor it's not going away anytime soon I know uh one of your guests who's also been on my podcast biology disagrees with me but I I have spoken to biology many times both on the show and and over the phone at length and I I really value those conversations I appreciate his different point of view but I've never agreed with it I've not been convinced by it I think the nation say it's a very powerful entity and it has very powerful institutions and can project Force so because of that we need to get to a sense of common identity that incorporates those power structures that we can all be on board with and we're not there right now what we're doing is we're actively tearing those things down number one and number two and this is not necessarily the purview of the state we need to come to clear a clearer sense of our own identity as individuals because I think this is something else that's happening today you see it in the um transhumanist movement in other areas where people are constantly creating new forms of identity trying to understand what it means to be a human being you see it in terms of gender Norms you see it in all sorts of other places and I think that that speaks to me that speaks to some kind of internal internal crisis around what it means to be a human being I think it goes that deep and I think that has to do with technology um that's my guess I mean you know you're very fair to point out religion and how religion the um the slow sort of disillusionment by members of the public with the with with religious institutions led to a kind of Crisis that Nietzsche talked about as the death of God um but I think that where it's coming from today there is of course that that lack of religion there is the neoliberal sort of commercial value system that many of us grew up around which was that oh the point of life is just to make more money to develop more efficient Supply chains et cetera Etc which has never been fulfilling but I think technology has really created a kind of crisis in humanity and people's people and around a sense of meaning which you guys know I've talked about as as nihilism so um I don't know if that makes sense I think that that breeds like you know first kind of a comment there's also in the Bill Joy article I think he was quoting someone else he and I'm paraphrasing here said like at the end of the day there's nature there's humans and then there's the machines and nature is on the side of the machines uh and like this speaks to like basically this folding in of humanity into technology right and that Bill Joy article is very much about kind of this simula uh the assimilation of of humans and machines together and what that would what that would look like over time and I feel very much Dimitri like we're in it we are totally in it that's what's happening with all of us like the amount of time we spend on screens uh versus previously on the internet now serving the the algorithms like that is happening and that is having an impact existentially on uh our reason for existing both at the identity level and the societal level and I want to go back to this um the kind of the question about values um David and I say something like turning this into crypto parlance where it's like um uh the the layer zero is is people and what we're really referring to here is like underneath the different layers of a blockchain there's actually this the social values structure of like are people willing to run the no that has censorship resistant software or not if they are we have censorship resistance if they don't we don't and it all collapses back to layer zero the people and I feel like um getting back to the story of America I don't know if the US really knows what it values anymore like I feel like there is this sense of what are our base principles and things that I thought were base principles for society like uh like democracy and and truth and um the right for everyone to vote it turns out or like uh just just freedom of speech right it turns out that like uh if the person is red and you're blue or if the person is blue and you're red you don't necessarily subscribe to those base principles for the other tribe and I feel like as Americans maybe in the US has sort of Forgotten its core value set what do you think about this and like is this something that is a precursor says David said getting out of this chaotic era for the US and emerging with something that's free and open and maybe there's some space for the nation-state success on the other side of this chaos but in order to get there do we have to remember what our core values are and like what are those core values do we even know a hundred percent man um I couldn't agree more so I want to say one thing before I address that specifically um I don't remember exactly how it came up but you know we have this idea or it's been put in our heads that technology is synonymous with what we have today that in other words we have to just get get used to not having privacy for example that this is just kind of part and parcel of what it means to progress technologically and that's not true that's a choice and it serves the people who are in control of these Technologies so like when we were growing up you know the the back Jetsons Back to the Future Etc even dystopian visions of the future none of those involved a version of the future until the Matrix that I remember I'm sure there might have been other ones where that future that dystopian future also involved technology as a source of disempowerment for the individual you know because like in those other versions people had technology start on the start Wars movies everyone's got you know these oh they're almost like analog Technologies they have full control over their brains and they can use them to amplify their brains but they're always in control we're not in that situation today we're losing control over our minds you know what I'm saying like it's it's a completely different situation and we just need to be able to really understand that because our framings are are off but I think people more and more understand it but it's like being caught in a spider's web you know eventually people might get it but by then it's too late and and I don't think it's too late it's certainly not too late when it comes to social media now though I I do think it's too late to shut off the machines as we were talking about before but in terms of values I totally agree so let's go back to what you said about um you know using an AI chat bot or a Search bot to find pictures I thought about this too I thought about like if someone gave me an application that could write all of my headlines for my shows and all of the summary texts I would take that I would do that in a second because I don't enjoy doing that anyway okay and then I just thought about more and more like what would I be willing to do to offload and then what would I actually not be unwilling to do and then I realized that there was this point at which I may run out of things that don't bring me joy and that then I would want to focus on you know what I actually like doing but there are many other things that I like doing that other people don't like doing and machines might people do those things better and so the the game theory of that kind of a situation is that we all basically there's no room for Humanity there's no room for a human life I drive manual transmission cars I love driving manual transmission if you go to any car dealership any of these new faster cars they will tell you hands down do not get a manual transmission car it does not perform as well but what I really this is just a good example because it's kind of I really mean it in other areas it brings me joy to drive a manual car I don't need to go faster than everybody else but if I'm competing for my livelihood if I'm a professional driver I'm not going to get a manual transmission car and so I think that the the problem becomes that in this world we're all incentivized to out compete one another and so everyone wants an edge and machines give you an edge and in that context we basically out-compete Humanity out of the gene pool um or we basically out compete normal people and what you eventually get is the other there are two possibilities in Bill Joy's article one is the example of the Matrix where machines take over and the other one is the example where basically a set of elite controls all of these Technologies and they basically turn human beings they either um kill he kill off the human race in order to be to save the planet or whatever you can come up with all sorts of eco-fascist ideas that actually seem to align very much with a lot of the the Orthodox they live in today or um they turn them into again domesticated animals where people just get pacified on ssris and and we kind of have that this is the kind of the crazy thing I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist here I'm not trying to be some kind of off-the-wall person but I think you would be I think it's I think most people would agree that there's something fundamentally wrong with the spiritual constitution of society you know like the I brought up ssris and the the prolific prescription of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication why are so many people feeling this way is it just because all of a sudden we discovered this I don't believe that I don't believe that I think that people are getting over medicated and when it comes to this particular area I think it has to do with something else something's not right I mean people I've done episodes on this as well people get prescribed antidepressants all the time when they lose someone they love well you're depressed not because something's wrong with you it's not because you have a chemical imbalance but because you're grieving and in the past people saw preachers or they saw their friend and they talked through it and they cried and that was okay you know but it's not efficient today if you're suffering that's not efficient you got to get through that and I just think we've lost all of that and we don't know how to talk to one another and that that's that's a real crisis in our society and we have to address it because if we don't address that we can't address anything else and that's that's been my concern the way we talk to one another the lack of good faith in each other's conversation the cynicism the anger that stuff needs to be addressed and you can't expect Joe Biden or Joe manchin or whoever other else or Nancy Pelosi don't expect all those people to solve your problem for you a democracy is about taking responsibility for yourself you can't just expect them to do it if they're not going to hold themselves accountable you have to hold them accountable you have to hold yourselves accountable accountable and so you know as you can tell I feel very strongly about that and I think it's just one of those things where we have to grow up and we have to take responsibility and that also that begins by really trying to have constructive relationships with one another and having empathy and caring and um yeah so I don't know if that resonates that no that you opened up a door that I want to dive down actually um and just to explain to listeners SSRI is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor this is going back to my psychology days uh basically it allows for serotonin in your brain to be uh not re-uptaked as in reuptake inhibitor which if you can't if you don't re-up take it it passes on to the neurons and causing a buildup of chemicals on one side of the river and dousing your neural receptors with that chemical so it makes a single molecule of Serotonin more effective basically uh and so this to me the way that you describe this trigger the uh uh book Brave New World by elderless Huxley and that that drug soma where like this this very docile uh populace would take this Soma drug and they would just be happy and they would also would not do anything and they would be extremely unoffensive and they wouldn't cause any problems and so like you can also apply this to like uh alcoholism is on the rise like uh male suicide is at all-time highs uh like our our consumption of carbohydrates is at all-time highs and our our obesity is at all-time highs and so we have all of these like ways that the psyche of the West is manifesting in these very like maladaptive patterns and it's because we are not exhibiting like very basic normal normative behaviors of just like you know hugging your mom and like talking about your emotion and and I I live in an apartment with uh 24 other units don't know a single neighbor like haven't said hi to them yet uh and and so like there's all these behaviors that are causing these like pent-up psychological stress and it's not from one particular Source like everyone has their own everyone knows their own like deficiencies whether they don't go to the gym enough they don't get enough sunlight they don't like hug their mom enough they don't have enough social interaction enough but like The Meta of like Western and maybe also Eastern Society I don't know uh is that we're losing our humanity and I'm wondering if this is running in parallel with the establishment of these machines I'm wondering if that's if that's that connection of like we're either headed towards A Brave New World future in a 1984 feature I mean like it seems like this is what we're saying yeah more of a Brave New World future than a 1984 future um I um I mean I totally agree I think we are losing our humanity and and many people are giving up their humanity and I think that a lot of this is pretty simple you know people don't have a framework for thinking about who they are you know like I think the Frameworks that they have in their heads are like some of those that we talked about one is kind of like be a good consumer being a be an entrepreneur make a lot of money I'm I'm always amazed at how many people chase more and more money as though I mean I one I understand the chase I understand the the satisfaction of attainment I understand and this is something that I think is also very important it speaks to this point about Ai and what is a human life worth if AI does everything which is something that also Ted Kaczynski talks about in his paper which is the power process you get satisfaction from solving problems you get satisfaction from doing things there a whole needs to be dug digging that hole even though it takes time energy there's a sense of satisfaction that comes from having done that as opposed to just having paying someone to come do it right if you have an infinite amount of money which is the equivalent of a machine so um you know I totally I don't know exactly where what what track I was on when I was answering that but I do totally agree that oh right about framework so I you know I think the Frameworks that we have that tell us what life is about and what the point of life is about and kind of those are many of the Frameworks that the Europeans relied on increasingly as they sought to go into deeper and deeper amounts of integration it's kind of like a lot of the stuff that comes out of the world economic Forum it's based around this sort of like greater living standards and you know more efficiency but like that doesn't satisfy people that doesn't give give people a sense of meaning in their lives and and I think that is also from from you know from the political point of view I think it's destabilizing because I think people want something more which incidentally it's why um dictatorships always invest in sports and athleticism because that's not just a way to get the testosterone out of the male population but it's also a way to actually give people a sense of accomplishment that they did something people need that on a very visceral level and they also I think need a a way to address the spiritual questions of Life which science cannot address Dimitri one of the biggest reasons why I appreciate your podcast it tends to be macro economics Finance related uh you definitely also tap into some social conversations as well but when I listen to you and what you very clearly get animated about it goes back to what I think me and Ryan try and also emphasize in our podcast which goes back to what Ryan was talking about with the layer zero where the only stable Society is built on top of a stable populace and our structures are democracies or even even the Chinese nation is ultimately built on the people that are that it governs over and so I'm reminded of this phrase uh there's we've talked about the fourth turning a few times on Bank list but like the idea that uh Hard Times creates strong men apologies for The Accidental uh uh male dominated idiom here but like hard times create strong men strong men creates good times good times create weak men weak men create hard times and it feels like this America has been in this like my childhood it's pretty easy like I I didn't really like struggle too much and like now and I feel like a lot a lot of my cohort were about the same and so like now accidentally we were raised in this good time and now we're they're turning the wheel turns and all of a sudden there are these hard problems that no one really wants to tackle head-on and now it just creates a worse problem triggering a crisis there's also a a attack on the male archetype the strong male archetype we all know this and I think people are becoming increasingly comfortable talking about it you know at for a while they were terrified of getting canceled but that's also happening and that fits back into what I said about this this thing where we're tearing down institutions we're tearing down archetypes we're tearing down values but they're not being replaced with anything nor are they being replaced with anything that people find compelling you know and I think that's that's the thing that um that's the thing that's very difficult because like I don't necessarily this isn't necessarily an argument for a natural form of identity or a natural order so many of the things that we view As Natural are just conventional they've become practice over a very long time but they were adapted to particular environments you know so certain types of values don't work in an agrarian society versus a migratory Society people that are moving hunter-gatherers different types of society require different things but we haven't we don't have here is we don't have something that's actually adapted to the current time while we're destroying what has worked for us so um so I couldn't I couldn't agree more and by the way that thing that you said about weak men the Chinese and the Russians use that domestically in their propaganda to attack the United States they attack us as weak they think that we're soft specifically that Notions of our masculinity so um yeah I mean I agree with that also um I guess uh getting back to kind of the the values piece of this it almost seems like um we've uh just opened up the uh the curtain the window of all of these existential issues that that we're going to face and we are facing right the prospect of World War II we didn't even get into kind of U.S and uh world war three world war three excuse me U.S politics but like the the prospect of civil wars in the back of my mind as well you know it's like what's gonna happen in 2024 and then the backdrop of like the machines are kind of taking over uh and uh We've forgotten our our reason for for why we're here and like what we're doing um but the last piece that that I think really stuck out to me is like where um tearing things out without replacing them with something new and I think that has been very um crucial for uh our journey in crypto which is we are trying to build new systems bottom up like that are new it's just like we've said from the beginning it's not about um like burn it down it's about build it up because this is what I get so frustrated with when you probably call it nihilism in Hidden forces and like you know so do we but it's this apathy or this it's just this like learned helplessness where we've got these institutions that are broken and like circumstances that we don't like and what do we do like nothing matters and as if we can't take control and build our future and build our way out and so I feel like as we get to the end of the the podcast you'll probably agree with us Dimitri that like the way forward is we have to build better systems right like the way we get out of this mess is actually inside of us all and collectively uh and we do have power and we do have autonomy to change the future uh and part of that is adopting systems that that um that we want to promote part of that is adopting the values that we want to promote part of that is having conversations like this I'm wondering Dimitri if you have anything else actionable for us like um what should we do with the prospect of all of these uh all of these existential issues and kind of like the 2020s and the 2030s and this entire Century that we're going to have to live through uh do you have any advice for us or things that we should do if I have advice but you know to your point about building better systems I think I think it's always important to build better systems but I also think our democracy this our the systems of that we broadly called Democratic governance actually are pretty intact they can work you know so like we haven't we have the ability to use those systems to make really positive changes look Donald Trump got elected president United States with zero political experience okay granted he was a celebrity and he had the role in The Apprentice and that gave him you know that created in people's minds uh again a template a framework that they could understand they could see him as becoming president they could see him as a leader but I I firmly believe that we have the ability to elect somebody who is less divisive who isn't a compromised hack and especially because of social media because of um the I guess the how quickly you can scale a message in society today I think it's easier than ever to elect a candidate in a populist on a populist wave that can actually reach a broader part of the population that can address some of these things um I know that that scares a lot of people that word populism but I don't really see any other way of doing it because you're not going to get somebody that's going to come through the Democratic Republican party so I just wanted to say that I think we can't we can't give up on that but I get I also get when I say that that well there's where where are they it's like fermi's Paradox but for politics right it's like where the are the aliens you know like where are the candidates you know is there a giant filter out there and they all get filtered out I don't know um so and you know build yeah I think look man you said advice I mean like we're all nobody's perfect um you know we're especially like those of us who work really hard compete with one another it takes an enormous we're talking about podcasting as you guys know it takes takes a lot of work and effort and drive and ambition and vision to build a show to build an audience to monetize it Etc but we all I think need to where we can try and devote more of ourselves towards a greater cause whatever that is I mean for me the way I do it is I try genuinely to use my podcast to help move positive conversations forward when I find interesting new people I try to bring them on the podcast you know again I try to filter out people who I feel are kind of self-motivated or kind of primarily motivated to for themselves or their egos I I really want to try and help um build up this a a sort of a culture of of empathy communication and that addresses the the issues that we talked about today because we all kind of know on the one hand these are all problems but on the other hand we all kind of default to what's best for ourselves you know like what's in our own best interest and I understand that tendency but I think we have to fight it and I believe that we have to fight each on an individual level I don't think that's something that you know government's going to do for us so I don't know if that's advice Dimitri as we all move forward in the next few years what would be the things that you would look for to happen on the global stage or in the domestic stage and you you could look at that thing that happened be like okay we're on a good path that was a good thing or like perhaps and also in the opposite direction like what are the signals that you're looking for that we are improving and what signals are out there that we're actually continuing to break apart yeah before I'm so sorry I do I can't help this this happens to me sometimes and it's like once I see it I can't unsee it I started laughing because um when I was transitioning from my question about advice I thought about I just did an episode with Alex Lee Moyer who is the documentary filmmaker behind Alex's War which is a documentary on Alex Jones which have been really popular and if you ever see Alex Jones you know he always takes opportunities to be like because I was going to say like well they should listen to Hidden forces by the way that's a piece of advice Alex is always like infowars.com TV so he's always throwing that out um and uh so yeah um what kind of signals would I be would I see to make me think that things are getting better well first of all we have seen some things people like Tristan Harris you know Tristan Harris really did a lot has done a lot of work to kind of raise people's awareness he spoken intelligently intelligently about the kind of issues of surveillance capitalism that we talked about before um I just think it's like that if you see if you see more people look I'm not gonna this is not the best example because their comedians are always truth tellers but um uh well I don't know I don't know why I just blanked on this great comedian who I love who was in Half Baked why am I blank on his name um I'm gonna talk about wait is Sandler in half picked it's been a while no not Sandler um I don't know why I'm blanking now but anyway um I think also well I don't agree with everything Joe Rogan says I think Joe Rogan's uh you know he yeah seems to have his heart in the right place he has a huge platform he tries to have good conversations you know you may not agree with everything he says but that's not the point I think I think the look the more people that do that the the less ego the more um more if you begin to see I guess um evidence of a of a common identity forming and a sense of common Humanity I think that's what I look for that's what I feel like I want you know like because we all talk past one another so often you know and especially with technology and having more more of these like disembodied conversations on text you know what I mean like I have so many open threads in my brain and that changes the way we think too you know we we lose patience we we have shorter and shorter attention spans so I think if it's seeing that seeing anything where there's more of an Embrace of our common Humanity a willingness to talk to people's Souls their Spirits I don't mean that in a religious sense I just mean the Mystery of Life the things that you know are are um are unknown and that speak to some common Humanity I think that's something that I look for and I feel like I've seen more of that but I also see a lot of confusion and a lot of anger and uh but I I look I I am fundamentally hopeful on this I mean we have we've made it like how many millions of years you know it depends on where you start the clock so I agree we have some really destructive Technologies today and there's a lot of Doom pouring out there so um but I think I think we can still make it uh he's making a strong Lindy I guess as we might say in crypto um Dimitri it's been a pleasure man thank you thank you so much I enjoyed it too guys thank you so much for having me um some action items guys one thing is through this podcast Dimitri mentioned a whole bunch of hidden forces podcasts we're going to get those from his brain after the episode and include those in the show notes also Dimitri what's this Alex Jones podcast you got coming up like where can people tune into that what is this about so you can you can check out our entire episode library at hiddenforces.io where you can also subscribe to our premium tier and that will give you access to the full two hours we use usually we record for two hour long podcasts sometimes their premium only podcasts in which case that whatever it is is it's on the premium feed um so the episode with Alex Jones which again they can find on hiddenforces.io or any major podcast platform is with a girl named Alex Lee Moyer who actually made this wonderful film uh I think in 2017 it came out called TFW no GF which you guys will know stands for that feeling when no girlfriend and it kind of covered what a lot of reporters at the time called the quote in cells but I actually didn't like that it talks about wojak it talks about Peppa the Frog and it really I what I found it to be was I found it to be this really great ah almost like a I don't want to call it anthropological because that would kind of dehumanize it but it was a kind of cultural exploration of people that grew up during a certain period of time where they were pretty much always on on the internet I mean my generation is unique in that I grew up without the internet up until the early 1990s when we had AOL so by the time I was in Middle School I started getting on AOL and aim but you know a lot of kids pretty much grew up with the internet right from the get-go um and a lot of these folks we know this particularly among uh among the male demographic a lot of young men really are lost and so this documentary that the first one that she has Chronicles a lot of this and what that looks like speaks to the nihilism speaks to a lot of the stuff we talked about today so this is the filmmaker and she did a second documentary on Alex Jones she spent two years following Alex all over the country and really um I thought I found it to be an excellent documentary it's really not uh a judgmental documentary it is just it's really kind of like an exploration of the person I found it fascinating I mean I've watched hundreds maybe up to a thousand hours of Alex Jones content because I got quote red pilled it's true you know after the 2008 financial crisis as someone that had been starting studying studying Austrian theory of the business cycle and was following and reading people who were telling me and explaining to me compellingly why we were going to have an economic recession crisis of some sort how bad it was going to get I don't know but what I didn't see was the government intervention and so that kind of broke my brain just dramatically upended my sense of reality and it sent me down all these rabbit holes back then of course there was Peter Joseph Zeitgeist American Zeitgeist movie I don't know if you guys ever saw that that was the first thing that pulled me in and I just started watching Alex Jones David Ike um uh you know Webster Griffin Tarpley who all these different people he had this guy Alan watt not or not the Allen not Allen watt Alan Watts different guys anyway all these different people and I started reading all these different books and etc etc so I'm very familiar with uh with Alex Jones and so um anyway I think it's it's worth it's fascinating to explore him because so many people have sort of really buy into so much of what Alex says and I think that while I disagree with so much of what Alex says thus the conspiracies that Alex comes up with exist and are compelling because of the vacuum that's been created by the the lack of trust in society the lack of trust in institutions like we discussed for good reason so long-winded response I hope that didn't lose listeners that's good yeah I think that is a symptom right it's like everyone is looking for the easy answer to the very complex problem uh anyway that's a lot of good stuff in there between Dimitri's podcast I probably might one of my top three podcasts at least for me or it's like Lex Friedman's fantastic hidden forces with uh Dimitri and Sam Harris these are my go-to's outside of crypto and you like Sam he's great man you know Sam's a great example more people like Sam more people like Barry Weiss too same thing Sam has Sam was a huge um inspiration for me when I started this show you know I didn't distribute I don't agree with Sam on everything every position he has but I love his intellectual honesty you know and how he tries to hold himself accountable to his ideas I so I'm so glad that you listen to the same the ability to talk to anyone is something I highly value and I
