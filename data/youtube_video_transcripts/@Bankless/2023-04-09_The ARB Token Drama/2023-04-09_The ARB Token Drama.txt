arbitrum drama here's a tweet arbitrum foundation made a proposal to allocate 750 million ARB tokens for admin and operational costs but Arboretum holders voted against it now they said that the vote was just a formality and they have already spent 50 million tokens your vote is not a vote and arbitrum team says this AIP number one wasn't actually a proposal it's just a formality all of the decisions in here were made before the token went live and before the Dow went live it was silly for this to even go to a vote to be honest because it set the obviously wrong expectations crypto people love drama one billion dollars worth of tokens getting sold by arbitrum like very hot thing to tweet it was really easy to turn this into a very viral dramatic event
