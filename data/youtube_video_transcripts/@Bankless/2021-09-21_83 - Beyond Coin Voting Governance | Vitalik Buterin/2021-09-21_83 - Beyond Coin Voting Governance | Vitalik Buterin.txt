[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david vitalic on the podcast got to listen to every vitalik episode sometimes two or three times this was a fantastic one would we cover yeah we covered a bunch of different subjects every time time for our our quarterly check in with vitalik uh he put up two articles that we wanted to to go through one was uh vitalik talking about how we could you know graduate or evolve from co coin voting or token voting in d5 and also just token voting in general um kind of the the the issues that token voting presents and how we can circumvent around them with new governance mechanisms for defy apps and as ethereum becomes more and more valuable as these defy apps become more and more valuable the conversation as to how to govern these things in ways that aren't just centralizing control into token holders is going to become even more important then we also turn to the con the conversation which is resurfaced lately with the regardless regarding uh the infrastructure required to run a node for a blockchain uh all of the different bottlenecks and requirements that you need in order to run a node and how these different choices that are made about hardware requirements impact how scalable a blockchain is both in terms of its actual throughput but also in terms of its decentralization decentralization is also a scale that you can optimize for different ends of the spectrum so we revisit that conversation as well and then we finish off with some really fun stuff we ask uh vitalik about the metaverse and whether or not ethereum with this whole loot phenomenon has gone full circle vitalik uh you know made the always made the joke that he made ethereum because he wanted to not ever get nerfed by his like special uh spell or item and now that we have a 60 warlock or something exactly right and so now that we have the metaverse we have this uh this final this gaming structure that you can't actually get your assets or your spells rug pulled from you and so that conversation uh happens towards the end and then of course we just check in with ethereum about where he considers ethereum to be in its current state in history both at the protocol level uh but also in uh just the mass adoption society level so a bunch of different things here in this uh episode with vitalik yeah really relevant things too like you know number one is relevant because everything is a coin vote right and we talk about decentralized governance but are we actually moving towards decentralized governance you know the second thing is relevant because we have all of these high-performance blockchains david you and i just did a panel it was a kind of a debate-ish but not really it was a panel about solana and comparing and contrasting a high-performance blockchain like solana to ethereum and it really centered around this question of how important is it for a user to have the ability to run a node it turns out vitalik and the ethereum a set of values think that it's very important for users to run a node have the ability to opt out so that the elites don't control the system right this is the trade-off you're often making with a high performance you know high transactional throughput blockchain and doesn't get a lot of press because it's easier during a bull market when price is rising and um you know people want unlimited block space to just make these kinds of trade-offs so we we discussed that and then of course the metaverse is always a really interesting conversation the state of ethereum so guys we think you are going to enjoy this episode with vitalik before we get into the details before we get into the conversation we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer 2 to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord bankless nation we are super excited to have vitalik buterin back on the podcast he is the ethereum co-founder researcher guy who will never give you free eth on twitter i can guarantee you that vitalik welcome back to bankless thank you very much it's good to be here it's awesome to have you again i feel like um this is an opportunity to have sort of a conversation with you um and uh just pick your brain almost like an ongoing conversation um the last time we chatted we we talked about the topic of legitimacy and that was now three months ago that was in may so three months is a long time in crypto it's probably like three years in the regular world we've hit new milestones there have been new issues new insights you've written a slew of blog posts we want to cover those as much as possible um this time i think we want to lead with a topic that is top of mind in the crypto community and i think it's it's you know part of your mindshare as well because you wrote about it and this is the topic of governance so um read your article about moving beyond coin voting and if i could maybe you know summarize and give the headline here it feels like after reading that you kind of think coin voting sucks that the community shouldn't settle on it as the only solution but that instead we should explore better decentralized governance protocol so we want to start there and pick your brain on that subject i guess my first question is this when we talk about decentralized governance do you think that's even possible or is this somewhat of an aspirational goal that we'll never quite achieve um i mean i think um you can definitely have governance that's a much more decentralized than um you know the average thing that people call a centralized org um obviously the question of like how much decentralization can you achieve is um a complicated and fascinating one and i mean that there's uh the the question of um like what kind of benefits they um you can get from that decentralization um but and i do think that it like it is a worthwhile experiment um i think uh in particular because like blockchain based in decentralized platforms like they had derived their entire value on legitimacy from a creative credible neutrality as we've talked about before right and a it's very difficult for a platform to claim to be incredibly useful if um there is a very small team that's uh controlling every uh everything and all of the decision making behind it um so uh coming up with uh forms of uh governance that do not depend on a small a small team making all the decisions it's uh it's definitely something that's uh very important for a bunch of reasons um but you know at the same time like have coin holders voting is definitely far from the only way to do it so when we talk about governance baked into that conversation implies that there's some sort of objective or direction that governance actually points towards and in your article we we you you juxtaposed to uh the difference between um uh or at least imply the difference between public goods and private goods right um and there are and when we have these defy apps these this financial infrastructure and also ethereum at large i think there's a question outstanding as to who governance is actually governing over these systems for and so like one possible interpretation is that the governors of the maker dow system are governing in order to prioritize and uphold the value of the mkr token above all other things or an alternative uh interpretation might be that mkr is a token that is used used to direct the maker dao application to become the best uh financial services product on ethereum for the betterment of the users and so when you think of governance what how would you answer who is governance for when we talk about all of these things that we are governing over yeah i mean i think that distinction between like is it for the benefit of the holders or the benefit of the users is really important right because like especially in the case of these platforms that contain a lot of what i call internal capital right in this case it's like the east that's locked up in the maker tail contracts like potentially you could imagine a world where for a well like let's say for example that like rai does uh really well and it ends up taking over and there ends up being this public consensus that rise better than die and die is kind of on the way out um but at the same time there's like a couple of legacy organizations that still hold a whole bunch of dye but like you just know that over the next few years they're going to stop using dye and they're the platform's going to kind of slowly little way to having nothing right like in that situation if you were an mti mkr holder it's that like if you feel like you don't have the long-term prospects anymore it's absolutely in your long-term interest to just make a vote that just says okay guys we're just gonna snap up all the if that's locked up in the collateral for ourselves distributed among the mtr holders and like screw the die holders because well we don't really have a long-term reputation anymore right and like to me that's sounds like an outcome that's pretty fair to describe as being like bad right um so there's like i think uh in a lot of cases there is uh alignment between the uh token holders and the users but also in a lot of cases there really isn't right in a lot of cases like for example sometimes um you know the the thing that the that the platform is trying to provide and just uh ends up requiring trust and so you want governance that can actually like satisfy the user's trust even if it's not in token holders interests um sometimes the participants in the community or even the creators of the project like they have particular values that they care about that go beyond the interest of token holders so like for example i might care about economic equality and i might want to um build if like if i create a new token build in a gadget that distributes say one unit of that token to every human per year like just because like i want the supply to be more egalitarian now the existing uh token holders might not want that and so and they might want you know if they control the government state governance they might end up like shutting it off or like basically a kind of stopping you know registration of new humans completely um so that's another example of where like there is some other goal that it seems reasonable to try to um like have a governance mechanism to achieve but that goal does not end up being well aligned with the the interest of any particular token holder another thing i think is also that like token holders they often end up um holding tokens of a lot of different projects right like it often ends up being the case that like if you just uh try to use your token holders as a representative of your community um then those uh like the set of token holders that you get ends up being the same right like you know there's these big investment funds and they have a big chunk of you know the uniform they have a big chunk of a whole bunch of these other projects and basically yeah like you end up losing the ability to have kind of uniqueness to have different uh communities that actually have like different values and that are making kind of earnestly different attempts at pursuing whatever their goals are um so there's also just this kind of like this sort of risk of just you know homogenization in terms of like strategy um before if uh utility holders end up controlling things right so i feel like those are some examples of reasons why um governance that uh ex like explicitly tries to do something other than satisfying the desires of target holders for their token to make more money is something that's important um and it's as something um like basically the reasons why it's important to empower other cons other kinds of constituencies or at least create structures where even if token holders are part of their structures token holders have some kind of like incentive to actually participate in the in the system in a way that serves those goals so vitalik when you were writing your article uh are presenting an argument about why token vote sucks and we need better and better and stronger and more aligned mechanisms who are you trying to that first off i i think i can claim that there is a values judgment baked into even writing the article in the first place implying that you know you actually think that governance should be different and more inclusive uh and so when you were writing this article who were you trying to get more included into governance or what was the the goal of even bringing up this i conversation like i think it's uh first of all it's a conversation like that definitely did not start with that post right like yeah i have been writing these posts on like you know uh the one on collusion and on coordination problems uh the post back in 2017 and 2018 on uh governance where i yeah i was criticizing what was going on in in the eos ecosystem with all of the bribing that was happening um so it's definitely something that like i have been trying to express for a long time and i guess i i i definitely felt the need to express it just much more cleanly and plainly in one of these i know blog posts were just the the whole point of the post is the title um but uh the the reason why i felt that way is just because uh you know we have been seeing over the last year and a half this big emergence of these new uh d5 protocols and and taos of all kinds right um and we've been you know seeing people do all these different experiments um some of these projects that are launching from zero so you know they they just start off being dowse right from the beginning and the thing that i've been seeing right is that people feel the need to add decentralized governance and i think there's good reasons why they feel that need um but at the same time like there just aren't any ideas available for how to implement that decentralized governance beyond like just uh token voting um and like someone needed to sort of just express that alternative and it would just express the idea that there is an alternative to so good voting and that alternatives is no good voting or not like automatically centralized or whatever um in the absence of these alternatives you think people just you know settle on token vote as almost like a shelling point just because everyone else is doing without doing it without even thinking about it yeah totally i it's like that's a natural effect that happens everywhere right like uh the this is the whole um you know if you do the same thing as everyone else um and you fail then like ants not your faults but if you do if you try something uh different uh from everyone else and you fail um then like everyone yells at you and you get fired right um like this is the story like that's the sort of thing that ends up causing a lot of problems in a lot of contexts i mean even like you know we have uh we have 206 different countries but we have very far from 206 different uh approaches to policy and a whole bunch of important questions some of them some of which really could use a lot a lot more diversity and options um so the i guess uh yeah i i definitely am worried that if alternatives to coin voting don't kind of get expressed and at least intellectually expanded on then like things will settle on coin voting by default and then we'll be having this conversation in five years anyway but we'll be having it like just because um you know the coin voting uh dallas will have all been captured in some way in uh some way or other and it will be much harder to steer away at that point they used to say in enterprise sales circles like nobody ever got fired for buying ibm right it's like so hard to get your product in there because if you buy ibm it's just that's what everyone's doing vitalik i wanna we definitely wanna get more into the nitty-gritty details of this conversation uh but i want to finish off this part this uh introduction part with this question i was recently in a debate with a bitcoin maxima self-identified bitcoin maximalist and one of his big critiques about ethereum and proof of stake is that the proof of stake actually instantiates the value of the ether token a little bit more strongly than it does in proof of work and so the bitcoin a bitcoin or critique on ethereum is that ethereum is not a public resource it's a private economy with private products that are meant to enrich ether holders what say you about this i mean isn't that true with uh bitcoin as well um right uh i mean bitcoin is even more strongly enshrined into that bitcoin blockchain than ether isn't trying to do the ethereum blockchain because like for in the ethereum blockchain while okay fine you have to pay eip 1559 fees and if but in the bitcoin blockchain like bitcoin is literally the only thing that you can transact um and yeah that's uh like the bitcoin blockchain almost explicitly exists to support the the bitcoin currency and therefore like to support the economic interest of existing holders of the bitcoin currency does that preclude these two things from being a public good then so um i think in general um publicness is always a spectrum and not a binary right like i think there's almost like there's very few things in the world that are truly public right like there's uh and even like national governments right like you know national governments will often have talking about themselves as like you know we're quote public you know the public sector and unlike these private uh uh entities that merely represent their own interests you know we represent quote all of society but like you know the reality is we live in an interconnected world and like you know does the us government actively represents the interests of say society in afghanistan right so like every like pretty much anything that it exists in the world as it is like it's uh somewhere on the spectrum between um you know being something that exists just for one person and uh being something that exists for the entire world some things come close to existing for the entire world but some things are further some things are even further um i think in the case of uh cryptocurrencies like it's definitely true that their supply is uh kind of supply distribution is kind of unbalanced um and i think uh like that is a legitimate problem like it would be nice if uh the if the supply of cryptocurrencies was more widely distributed though at the same time the yeah i think ethereum did do a better job than most other cryptocurrencies right i can i don't know if you read my recent uh article on the like the genie index and inequality um one of the charts that i had in there was just like the percents pre-mined and like the percent allocated to like existing kind of like closed-off pre-investors and all these different blockchains that like eth and cosmos i think it was that that were the only ones that really looked decent and the rest of them were like pretty much completely downright dystopian um so that was uh um so it's an issue um but uh right it was yeah there it is and oh right no it wasn't uh yeah cosmos is up there oh tesla's does a good job that's nice um i guess uh cardano as well um eos i don't know i mean in the yeah in the eos case i guess like what wasn't there a lot of just like accusations of all kinds of wash trading in the sale so i'm not sure how genuine the ten percent figure is um but like you can just look at the chart right and you can see you know like which of these uh blockchains like are like which of these blockchains are the ones that like if ethereum disappeared tomorrow like you would personally feel like at all comfortable migrating to right again so as far as coin holdings go that's a legitimate issue but then as far like the other thing is that blockchains aren't just about empowering people hold the coins right they're about empowering users and they're about providing value to people by using those blockchains and the ability to use ethereum definitely is something that is like i think truly global and like and you do have people in all sorts of places that are like just benefiting from the ability to build things on ethereum and actually you have those applications that interact with each other and have people use those applications um so it is i guess ethereum is not a perfect system but also like pretty much anything else that calls itself public is very far from a perfect system either so you know you like you can't have perfection but we can um try to kind of keep getting better and better than what we had before okay so we can't have perfection but we can try to keep getting better and better than before but i i guess that um begs the question almost why is decentralized governance better in the first place you know some some people would say hey like why why go to all this trouble i mean we have shareholder vote in in corporations uh centralized governments uh do fairly well um i know you mentioned in that you know the top part of your article that uh some of these cypherpunk values are kind of embedded in the blockchain movement to minimize coercion uh maximize coordination with with uh you know minimal coercion private property and markets but like why from a values perspective do you think decentralized governance is important you mentioned credible neutrality right so is this like a legitimacy and social scalability argument when you have decentralized government governance then you can get more people on board and it benefits more users or what's kind of the art argument for all of this so that's one good argument another good argument i think is that users want systems where the governance of those systems is just clearly not something that can easily screw them over right like if you look at like twitter and facebook and all the centralized web 2 companies like this happens all the time right you have this ecosystem of startups that build themselves around facebook apis or twitter apis and doing interesting things with those apis until eventually well you know once they get big get big enough like facebook right close them it says like you know hey guys you know either we buy your company that you spent years developing for hundred thousand dollars or you know tomorrow we're going to shut off your api and build our own competitor um and that's uh ethereum is not going to do that to you right um you know bitcoin is also not going to do that to you um so that's like like the fact that ethereum governance just has so many stakeholders and the facts that users have to actually like choose to download and accept um any of these software package patches um and uh you know all of these things that together basically means that like there isn't this kind of ability to just you know immediately go and flip the switch on someone um which is uh i think something important um and it's uh something that can easily make um people feel much more comfortable building applications on um ethereum than they would feel building on like some of one of these platforms that's just run by a single company that's a good teaser for the second part where we want to talk a bit more about how users download the software but before we're you know still on the subject of decentralized government uh governance i'm just curious for people who aren't sure of the types of decisions that actually need to get made in blockchain systems or even in d5 apps um i think you did a good job sort of splitting this into two areas like number one there's this category of decisions around funding public goods right how do you fund things for the continuance the good of the protocol itself and the second is upgrades and improvements so if there's some upgrade that needs to happen who decides what you know features that should include or how that's pushed out could you get into these two things and the decisions that need to be made through decentralized governance right um so there's basically a yeah i mean i i outlined two categories of uh decisions that decentral like some kind of governance is needed for um and so if you want to be decentralized that decentralized governance is needed for one of those categories is funding public goods just funding people who um or teams that do things that are useful to the get projects ecosystem or even just more generally to the project's underlying goals um so this includes things like documentation like software development research but basically anything where the benefit provided by what you're doing isn't something that can be kind of packaged up and separately sold to individual people right like uh you know we are um are doing this podcast and then that podcast you know either it doesn't get published or it does get published and once it gets published anyone can see it um and then if i come up with an idea and i write it up on either research like i can't you know charge subscription fees for that idea and only give access to that idea to people who like pay some amount of money right it's you know either i do it for the world or i do it for nobody um and they're in the internet world um a large portion of like pretty much all things are like that right um so though like funding those things is often a challenge because they because they suffer from the free rider problem right like if one person funds it and another person doesn't find it well both people benefit and and so why would the first person find it um so the hymn basic the the solution in the crypto space is basically like well if you have these protocols that do end up having some some kind of ability to monetize then you know like that funding could then be directed into these public goods somehow right like basically not every project that's useful has a monetization strategy um and so you what you basically do is you take the things that monetization strategies and the things that are useful and you kind of like plug line them up and plug them into each other right and so it's um so this is one thing that needs that you need to have some governance governance for because once you start funding public goods uh other than things that are really trivial to measure like for example network security like once you start funding public goods um such as like software development and documentation and translation of research that you can't measure programmatically then you need some kind of governance system in order to figure out well which projects do you actually support in the first place right so that's one thing that governance is needed for the other thing is protocol upgrades and parameter changes um so one example of this might be like you know in maker dow you have this question of like which assets are considered acceptable for collateral i mean i've actually been critical of like that aspect of maker down like one of the reasons why i liked rye is because it just says well no eth is the only collateral that's ever going to exist um and but even then you need governance to figure out like what is the oracle gonna be like who are the oracle providers um in a system like uniswap um you would need governance to figure out um say that right now i think they use it to just well right now just for public goods funding but in the future it could be the side used to decide what parameters of like fees of existing markets and things like that um in anything more complex um like you would let's see like in something like ens um well in the case of ens i mean they have these like they want to charge fees that are denominated in dollars um but then you know what happens if like do they charge it in one particular stable coin what if that one particular stable coin disappears do they have to switch to a different stable coin like there's these decisions that have to be made right and then there's just protocol upgrades in general like what if you know they come up with a just completely better version of the protocol and they want to switch over uh the current protocol to that feature protocol without users needing to like move everything that they're doing over manually so that's something that's uh important as well um i mean these could be pretty major decisions right when we're talking about like um you know just even 10 of 8th annual issuance is like hundreds of millions of dollars right and the the governance power to direct that fund that funding is uh is quite a power indeed many of these dows also have you know billions of dollars in their treasury and the power to direct that is is quite a uh quite a power indeed so we're talking now about pretty high stakes not like the early days of crypto where you know it was just kind of fun money but like now we're talking about real systems high stakes many users billions of dollars absolutely um the other thing i wanted to bring up with protocol changes is that like sometimes you might not even realize that you need to do enough to do an upgrade but you end up needing to do an upgrade like one example of this is um let's say for example like you take a ride right it's a you know this stablecoin project they really value governance minimization and so they're just going to say we have this fixed formula we're going to target um a price stability with respect to the us dollar with this kind of slightly floating mechanism to it to have an adjustable interest rate and that's it but what happens if let's say 20 years from now the us dollar collapses right like this is um i mean obviously you know i tends to be kind of critical of you know the bitcoin maximalist types that say this is definitely going to happen but also like i'm definitely not the type to say that there's a zero percent chance this is going to happen and so if the us dollar collapses in 20 years then like buy holders are not going to want a u.s dollar right because uh the us dollar is just going to be something that's going to you know increase at a rate of like ten thousand percent one week and then forty thousand percent the next week um and so like they're go in order for ride to continue to be a useful product in that world it has to basically make a decision and say like no we're violating our original social contracts and instead of targeting the u.s dollar we're going to switch to you know either targeting some other national fiat that somehow stays stable or potentially just like making their own cpi and targeting that um and the government in that kind of extreme situation you know the governance is going to need to be able to make that kind of decision um so like how that could be done is um one of those uh also very challenging questions um but you know this is um the sort of thing that like decentralized governance could be really useful for because it's been like especially decentralized governance um because uh it's the sort of thing where if you require lots of different participants you agree in order to make that kind of big step then like you can be confident that if there really is an emergency that demands that kind of drastic move then it will then it can happen but if there isn't an emergency and someone says like hey guys you should stop targeting the us dollar you should like start targeting um you know bob's like uh um in index emporium number four two five five um then uh you know people even if he manages to corrupt a whole bunch of insiders everyone else is going to go like wtf made and it's not going to happen right so that's uh you know not like that's another good example of where a governance can be needed but and that decentralized government specifically could do even a better job than the governor said that's controlled by a centralized team because you know if the governance is controlled by a centralized team then the centralized team could like even if some feature is intended to be only used in an emergency well the centralized team chooses what the emergency is so you know you don't have that much protection every new technology that we invent as humans brings something new to the table and as we know blockchains cryptoeconomic systems are coordination technologies they bring new coordination tools and lets us play with them so what governance or decentralized governance tools has specifically blockchains like ethereum actually unlocked for us like what are the new mechanisms of governance that we have now that we didn't have before um so things that you can do with ethereum in general um i mean large-scale votes are definitely one thing like there obviously exists other platforms to do large scale votes but just the large-scale votes where you know the outcome is verifiable where the outcome is actually tightly coupled to the implementation so you don't have to trust someone to execute the outcome once the outcome gets made um that's like a simple thing that you know can be done uh and you could even like use something like macy um as that a project improves over time and make the votes like privacy preserving and coercion resistant um that's um so that's one thing that you can do other things that you can't other things that you can do like avoiding with more advanced uh kinds of algorithms like quadratic voting like quadratic uh coordination pairwise bounded voting and all these fancy types of voting um another thing that you can do is uh well actually one of the nice reasons one of the nice reasons why blockchains are quadratic voting friendly is that quadratic voting inherently involves like making payments in order to vote um and blockchains just happen to have a built-in payments platform um another thing that you can do with other kinds of mechanisms that kind of mix together markets and democratic approaches um like one example of this is a retroactive public goods funding that i've been a big fan of recently right like basically you know you have a kind of voting base now that funds public goods retroactively so after they've already been finished and they've already had some positive impact and then if you want to um invest use retroactive public goods funding to get grants for something that you want to do then what you can do is you can create a project token you can announce that you know this project still can reflect this my like my attempts to make this particular thing happen and i'm going to pre-mine some of that token to like my team and people that i think are like are responsible for making this happen and obviously if the team disagrees then they can kind of fork off and make their own project uh token um and then i can also sell some of that projects token to people who wants who who wants to provide seed funding to this team right and then once uh the retroactive once the project has a positive impact then the retroactive funding dow can choose to basically use its funds in order to buy up the projects token and then like anyone who participated in building the project and also anyone who bought the project tokens to give seed funding ahead of time like they both uh and end up getting rewarded right so in that case like you have a democratic mechanism for funding thing but for like doing this kind of end stage resurrective funding but then you have a market mechanism for a kind of carrying over that end stage funding into uh figuring out what things are i actually need funding in this heat stage um so that kind of like mixing of kind of market mechanisms and voting mechanisms is something that i think uh blockchains are very uniquely friendly to as well um so you know but we have a lot of kind this kind of gets into like some of the solutions that you're proposing toward the end of the article right like different ways to uh govern some of these applications besides just a simple coin vote uh you talked about the hazards of coin vote i you know i want to get maybe to the to the to the base layer though here it's like just with the advent of bitcoin say and then later ethereum i mean they're governed in a similar way maybe we would call this un-governance maybe we would call this off-chain governance i'm not sure it's interesting because it doesn't really fit in a um i don't know that there's a name for it that people uh would understand like what is blockchain governance we know what democracies are we know what you know uh autocracies are and theocracies and all of these things we know what a shareholder vote is in in corporations but like what fundamentally is bitcoin's governance or ethereum's governance would would you call it ungovernance would you call it rough consensus off-chain governance and what are the characteristics and properties of it so this is actually the topic of a post that i wrote way back in 2018 i think this is the other one called the notes on blockchain governance where basically talk about how like reviewing governance as a kind of what i call a decision function um and basically some kind of like mathematical function that takes inputs and possibly payments from different participants and then like you know you have a piece of code that then computes an output and then output is guaranteed to be executed like that it doesn't even necessarily cover like everything like what we want out of um out of governance right like it's uh like the way that governance of these systems ends up working is much more subtle right basically what happens is that like at the bottom layer you have this system where anyone can run whatever software they want normally people agree with each other but then if some people really disagree with the majority they can fork off and they could do their own thing and forking off is obviously messy and expensive but if that's the only alternative to accepting some changes that you consider really unacceptable then like people are going to do it right so that's like the bottom layer and then the layer above that is well let's take that kind of layer zero and let's build coordination mechanisms to ensure that the yeah like the nastiest outcomes that layer zero could lead to and end up not happening right so let's build mechanisms to ensure that like most of the time when there is possibility of agreement people do actually end up agreeing instead of like reserve resorting to their you know natural uh right to mute to exercise mutually assured destruction um and that's uh something that you know we you know we do with uh like all sorts of uh community signaling there's all core devs votes um there's uh you know informal kind of um signaling uh coin votes uh there's uh kind of implicit votes on github there's uh just conversations there's all sorts of these mechanisms by which people can kind of gauge them you know if some proposal is looking like it has broad agreements or looking like it doesn't have broad agreement so on on blockchains we have this base layer of italic of like it's the right to fork it's the right to opt out right that's so important and the the next layer above that is basically this this rough consensus idea all of these different you know signals social signals that um feed into some signal as to whether the community will accept a change or not or whether they'll fork whether they'll resort to kind of violence in that bottom layer i'm curious even with these two layers maybe there are other layers you want to describe too but are these two layers new for humanity is this a new thing that wasn't possible in the analog world i think to some extent the analog world has this as well right so like let's say like you know take the us as an example like let's say the 2020 election went even crazier than it actually did and let's say for example that um you know the supreme court um just decided to um make a nine out of nine decision that well let's go crazier than 2020 the supreme court um like got like guy was given drugs by aliens and they made a nine out of nine um decision um that um i don't know can we like um uh pick a crazy guy like kim jong-un is the president of the united states that is the president of the united states of america right like technically you could argue that like you know quote legally the supreme court decides what the law is and then plus like i'm not sure exactly on the these knowledge of like who technically has to agree but the aliens can drug a couple of other people and they could make them just like decide this uh just some incredibly crazy thing and then you know if your model of uh governance is that it's a decision-making function then like hey the law says that like if these people say this then like that's the decision that's to be executed and all the americans are going to have to bow down to kim jong-un now but you know the reality is that if that happens then um you know the red and the blue are both going to be on the streets and they'll be on the same side of the streets and you know they're going to storm all the buildings and um you know the the people who got drugged by aliens despite their legal power are gonna find uh you know them us themselves um you know hopefully it'll be more more polite than literal ropes around their necks but they're not going to be in a good place and even the military is probably like even if you drug the the aliens drug the guy at the top of the military like you know they're going to rebel as well right um so it's not going to work out well it's a coup it's a revolution you know it's that's what a hard fork is in the real world right exactly so it's uh like the this idea that the like what actually happens in governance never matches what is formally described um to happen by any kind of like attempt any kind of math like descript description of the legal system like but that's something that exists in i think lots of contexts today um in other contexts that's a bit less extreme and less violence uh language um like uh you know who decides whether or not the word literally can mean metaphorically um urban dictionary right or if i uh like if i start using that like um um i don't know the word ammons for am not like that's something i was i was thought i should not be doing in school but you're kind of uh i don't know like i personally am not really the type to to care about such things so if i start using the word and if a bunch of other people like the word then like guess what it becomes part of english um so like there definitely are lots of uh like rough consensus based uh constructs uh in just all sorts in society in all sorts of places as well um i think where blockchains are interesting is that they yeah they seem to like occupy the sort of niche that's maybe somewhere in between how um let's say national governments work and where and how something like language works right like i think uh corporations they tend to be closer to following the decision function view of governance because like you can't make a revolution because like um ultimately um you know like people end up uh end up suing each other and then the court um accepts uh you know it comes up with a judgment and everyone makes the judgment and that's like ultimately kind of the like that's ultimately the last resort um but you know in the case of like a of a country like that kind of last resort doesn't exist but you know still at the same time like you know they're like it's it's only in these very difficult and extreme cases that this sort of like extra legal pressure um and it like can influence the outcome but in the case of a blockchain right like it's this sort of like informal pressure um and this knowledge that like you know if you piss the community off they're gonna fork like that's something that has a lot it definitely has a lot more significance but at the same time the difference between a blockchain and say the english language is that in english language forking is just trivial right like like the three of us can just decide that the word ammons is like an okay word to use that's okay with me is it okay with you yeah i'm a fan damn it okay well you should have said i am it's an opponent yeah um so the i right and the three of us can do that and like anyone else who wants to join can do that anyone else who doesn't want to want to join cannot and like there is very little uh kind of like net like social damage that comes as a result right blockchains are not quite as extreme but they're sort of in the middle um so they do occupy this interesting space and i think the fact that they're not quite so extreme does allow them to do important things that languages can't do right like blockchains can create like maintain rough consensus on like valuable assets and on like who currently controls valuable assets and who currently has like some position with respect to some kind of a valuable asset and that's not really something that a language can do um but so yeah so in some sense like blockchains are both a different combination of existing ingredients but they're also but they are also something that's genuinely new and offers new possibilities yeah it's super fascinating because like forking a blockchain of course is is it's it's a bloodless you know revolution if you will and uh you know because blockchains are generally open source you know technology uh it you know it is fairly easy to do essentially it's it's always an option i think that might be part of the solutions you get to as well it's like making these things easier to fork but i i want to ask about this because so we have this on governance we have this off you know rough consensus sort of uh mechanism at the at the layer ones of blockchains and that feels like a a good mechanism to use at layer one um but maybe you could comment on that why is kind of ungovernance the right to fork a good mechanism for layer one and then why does it feel like it's just not a good mechanism for many of our defy apps like it feels like we need some more significant governance for something like maker down maybe not rye but like for maker dow there are some decisions to be made that can't be achieved by rough consensus and it feels like we we need token vote so can you talk about that i think the difference there is actually pretty similar to what i just one of the examples they gave a couple of five minutes ago which was like corporations versus governments right like in a corporation if there is a dispute at the end of the day there is this uh like you know there is a legal process and ultimately people can see each other and there is this kind of court system as a layer one that you can appeal to whereas in the case of a government like if there is a disagreement about the law itself then you know well ultimately it gets uh yeah it goes down to some of these kind of more raw and chaotic uh kind of extremities that we were discussing um so in the basically the fact that um applications like like corporations in a nation state like they are a layer two that sits on top of a wire one um like means that and also the facts that they control um external assets right like maker dow controls eve right and so the problem is that if you try to just make a revolution inside of maker down and fork the thing that the community like accepts as the legitimate makers out then the problem that you get is that well even if you you know you have this community agreement that the new fork is you know is the legitimate maker yeah well guess what who controls the eth ultimately is dependent on like what the code of the smart contract says and so like you better hope that the code of the smart contract is uh damn good at actually reflecting what the community's values are um and like that's a hard problem in that case like that's uh the problem that you actually do have to go and solve right whereas like if a layer one does um on does on chain governance and the unchained governance screws up well you know you can still do a dual fork to um you can get around that on chain governance whereas uh with the lawyer too like you know failure two gets ahead gets or if the application gets hacked then you know the application is screwed like you can't fork the application even in that case but you can sometimes so like for example one of my examples was like if ens gets hacked right then well okay like maybe there's money inside of ens that would get stolen but like people like everyone who currently pays uses the ens system they would just download updates to their software that start pointing to a fork of ens and so that situation would resolve itself pretty peacefully right so the question is like is the app does the application control internal assets or does it control a kind of externally defined assets right and like a corporation inside a nation state like if the only thing the corporation controls is the corporation's own shares then like theoretically you don't even need a legal system because like if there's a dispute then you know you can fork the corporation and the fork would have new shares but corporations they usually own like nation state defined dollars the nation stayed defined office space nation state defined um intellectual property um icann defines domain names right like corporations own the kind of external capital in the same way that applications on ethereum often own external capital and whenever something owns external capital then like you can't resolve governance with a purely internal forking system and so you do need a you know quote unchained or kind of like codified governance of some kind when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigramps.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you swap for sponsoring bankless so we've gone and talked about um what parts of a tech stack need what kind of governance you know layer ones have rough off chain uh offshoring governance but when we talk about applications on the layer ones that's when we have a wider array of possible governance strategies we've also talked about why we need to have governance in the first place and why we can't just completely strip away all governance sometimes things happen that needs to be updated and as we've been circling around we're coming to this point of conversation is to okay we have a bunch of things in defy on ethereum that do need to have governance and they are generally all just using coin votes for governance um but you are advocating that there's more more diverse and more rich possibilities uh that we can get into to have better governance but let's talk about why coinboarding sucks um what options do people have in defy that kind of taints or ruins the power of coin voting right so the thing that coin voting really relies on um for kind of the philosophical arguments for why like it makes sense is this idea that it couples economic interests and governance power right like coin voting governance is supposed to work because the people with the coins have the votes um and so the people who have economic interest in the protocol success are the ones that have the governance power to make the success happen the problem is that financialization is extremely good at separating out um like different parts of an asset if the people in that um in that asset want them to be separated and like most people like because each individual each individual person only has such a tiny and insignificant share of their governance power most people do not value their government's power that highly right like even if there aren't any attackers it's very hard to get people to be willing to vote at all like voter participation rates in most coin voting systems are tiny and then if there is the ability to just kind of like split up your your token that has to build the economic interest and the governance power and say like there's gonna be token a that has just the economic interest and so it can be that has just the governance to power and then you can go like rent out your token b um and keep your token a like that's a deal that a lot of people are going to find attractive right and financial systems are just inherently about doing this kind of unbundling and so you know of course there's going to be lots of different ways to do that kind of unbundling um in my post i talked about two specific ways to do the unbundling right like one specific way is you just have a smart contract where like it's basically a wrapper token right like the same way you know you wrap your ether and you have left you can wrap your maker and you have wrapped maker except this raft maker has this very specific property that well it's now the raft maker contract that that controls the the that that kind of technically owns your maker it has the rights to do governance with the maker and so the raft maker and the rap baker contract is just gonna like uh auction off like every single vote and let's say it's going to give half the auction revenue to whoever wrote this rapper contract and half the auction revenue to you right and so you know every maker holder that is going to like individually find it in their interest to and just stick their maker into the rap mirror contract because it pays interest but actually like well it's uh concentrating ultra governance power kind of collectively in the hands of a few potentially unaligned actors right so that's method one um sometimes people find method one unrealistic because it work it just requires token holders to do something that's just feels so blatantly unethical um but like which is fair right like i think like even if uh token holders like like even if the amount like they are suffering from this kind of tragedy of the common sprout problem where they have the ability to sell their governance rights to the highest bidder well like a lot of them they do kind of like feel this altruistic concern for maker dow as a whole they don't want to they want to feel like they're you know part of this exciting community and they're not selling them out and so like you know they might not want to stick their maker into the into the system um also sometimes like if people stick their maker tokens into this rap maker contract while other people might like analyze the blockchain and figure out who they are um and then they're going to have social consequences and all these things right um so you might argue that for these reasons like this kind of super blatant um driving attack is unrealistic but then there's also a much more subtle governance that's accurate and the much more subtle attack basically says well let's just use like define lending protocols right like let's say um i have some maker tokens then one thing they could do is um i could use my maker tokens and like or i could lend out some of my maker tokens and it could get paid interest and then if i am an attacker who wants to like participate in some governance decisions then what i'm going to do is i'm going to take a whole pile of eth and i'm going to stick that into the into a cdp and then i'm going to borrow some maker and i'm going to use my borrowed maker to have to do whatever governance things i want to do now if you analyze that situation right the person who borrows the maker they don't actually have an economic interest in maker because whatever the price of maker is they're gonna have to pay it back right um so the person who is borrowing the maker they have governance power they do not have economic interest and then the person who is lending them the maker the person who actually stuck the maker into the defined lending system and is getting interest rates off of that they they still have the economic interest because they still have the right to eventually get that maker back but they do not have the governance power because at that particular time that maker is in someone else's hands um so one person has uh governance rights but not economic interest the other person has economic interest but not government's power and so even though it does not look like a bribe the the the practical consequences are exactly the same as it as they are in the uh in the raft maker driving contract case right so and that's just decentralized bribing there's also like examples of centralized kind of de facto driving that already happens like one example is that lots of people store their coins on exchanges and if you store your coin on an exchange um like that exchange offers you personally a bribe in the form of services in the form of convenience and in the form of like fast ability to trade and all of those things um but then the exchange like has formal control over your tokens and the exchange can basically controls the governance power right you have the economic interest the exchange has the governance power and now a lot of the time exchanges say oh we're going to be nice and we're going to not either not participate in governance or we're going to run internal polls among our users and so we're going to kind of like pass through the governance power but sometimes exchanges do exercise it right guys yeah i talk about the tron steam situation where justin's son ended up like basically making his final attack by cooperating with exchanges and using coins that people had inside of exchanges in order to vote and so these kinds of things do actually happen right so basically like the conclusion is that like once because of just all of these different forms of like financialization and like just the d5 and c5 being really good at unbundling like you just have you end even though the system is supposed to bundle um governance power and economic interest it ends up it can easily end up not bundling those two things anymore um and once it stops bundling those two things then like basically governance just becomes an auction and every decision gets sold to the highest bidder and like that can start looking um ugly very quickly kind of uh sounds like how congress maybe works to uh to the skeptic i'm not sure but like so there are these issues but like also um there are issues i think um people see every day like whales kind of controlling uh the vote in in many of these systems and maybe you'd argue that's a good thing because they have the most economic incentive but there are cases where like you know i i don't know all the particulars but like let's say there's a raid on uniswap right and this including set of actors rewards uh you know with nepotism their friends or their family and they award these people a specific uniswap grant for instance rather than another set of people so there's issues like that too i i'm curious vitalik though like where do we go from here so we have it seems like these two governance forms that are active and working in uh blockchains and that is the rough consensus you know ability to fork and then we have for everything else really all the the app layer that's built on uh cryptocurrencies on ethereum it's all token vote but like where do we go from here you you uh mentioned a couple of uh solutions um there there are a few more maybe we should cover like um is there a way to do some sort of one person one vote proof of participation uh do we need to centralize identity first what are some of the solutions that the community should pursue so i think like before i get the solutions actually i wanted to comment on the whale thing a bit because uh like the whales are an interesting double-edged sword right like one of the points that i make in the article is that i think the reason why despite all of this economic theory that says that coin voting governance should break coin voting governance mostly has not broken so far is because in practice the token holdings of a lot of those projects are very centralized and like if more than half the supply is controlled by 10 people and the 10 people know each other then like each of those 10 people is not going to go betray everyone else by sticking their rap maker contract and collecting one percent interest right there's off-chain reputation at stake yeah exactly and those op chain reputation effects are strong precisely because there is there are these kind of whale boys clubs that control a large portion of the of the supply of these systems right um so you have this effect where the systems are like secure from being outright attacked in part precisely because of the centralization um but at the same time like the centralization is something that has genuine risks right like one example might be like you know what if there is some decision in the future to like stick mandatory kyc into one of these applications and the whales end up being in favor of it because you know the whales have close connection to say c5 interest some that wants to be friendly with um whoever those regulators are or whales um like they yeah they care about you know institutional adoption and and um in the the institutions like they yeah they want a like a system where you know kind of quote unidentified actors can't participate in all that and so you know you could easily have a small group of whales that will want decisions to go in that one direction of just accept but throwing in mandatory kyc to just to use the platform but while that's something that the rest of the community does not want um and so there are like these kinds of real like misalignment risks from kind of quite like coin centralized coin voting or i guess vote coin voting with concentrated coin holdings and you know we do want something better um but at the same time you know we want something better that's not attackable so what is that thing that's better and not attackable yeah tell us yeah so i gave a couple of ideas um one of those is um incorporate kind of like one person per uh or one vote per person voting of some kind um so i talk about proof of humanity a lot right it's this project where you know if you're a human then you can go like put up your your profile and you can you basically get like essentially an nft that says like hey you are a unique person um and that's something that other applications can then link into and they can say like hey like for example you know if you are one unique person that you can get up to one unit of governance power um or if you are a unique person then you know you get like there is even a ubi token that just like gives a some number of ubi points to every person like per uh period or i think it's like it might even be given continuously um and so you just have like actual sort of formally democratic kind of like one per person governance that's one approach um my concern with one person one vote is that one person one vote fails to distinguish between a kind of different levels of commitment that different people have and like like in any of these systems like there are people that should have hundreds of times more of a voting power than other people because those people like care hundreds of times more 100 uh put hundreds of times um like bigger chunks of their lives into the project and like that's something that also needs to be recognized right now coin voting does try to recognize this but it recognizes it in a way that also ends up empowering whales a lot um one idea that's interesting is uh like you could have quadratic like if you uh use a proof of humanity things you can have quadratic coin governance so you can say you know if you have n tokens then you have square root of n governance power and that would be an interesting um kind of hybrid that gets us the best of both worlds now i think like in that kind of situation you know to prevent this kind of governance financialization that i talked about you would need to use like something like macy or one of these um anti-collusion gadgets to prevent people from like basically like credibly selling their vote their governance power to other people but you know these are things that are being worked on already right which is great um so that's one idea another idea is instead of having governance be done by token holders you could have governance be done by like what i would call badge holders like basically holders of something that is like some kind of non-transferable token that gets allocated to participants that are kind of decided like somehow like it could be bootstrapped with some centralized setting and there could be some mechanism for updating them over time they're just somehow selected as being like just good contributors that provide like important governance input and like that could be used as just like providing a kind of an alternative chamber of governance that's like reasonably like both high quality and dedicated to the project and disconnected enough from the uh token holders that it can provide a check and balance in case like the um in case token holder governance just goes in a completely crazy direction um so that's another idea a third idea is like you can say well we're gonna have coin governance but in order to limit the harm that they can do we're going to try to limit the power of coin governance in certain ways and projects do do this to some extent right like for example in the uni swap the coin governance can only do like one thing which is he can only issue new uni tokens um and like you can basically turn on turn the fee on it like the 0.05 percent portion of the fee on and off um and in that case like the good thing is that if the coin governance completely breaks and someone can just fork the token and they can fork you in a swap they can still fork everything and like it's not that even until the fork happens like you know swap continues to be useful um the people who like put their liquidity um uh shares in but they can still take their what a shares out there's no way for the governance to steal the liquidity shares so the power that the governance has is very limited another example of limited governance power is that a lot of d5 projects they have a time delay before the any governance decision takes effect and that time delay gives people time to like move their money out if a project breaks now a lot of the time these time delays are fairly short they're like one day or one week i personally am a big fan of time delays that are much longer like i'm a fan of time delays of at least two months um but basically you want something that's long enough so that even lazy users who barely who only pay a little bit of attention to the protocol have like enough time to discover that like hey there is something crazy happening and they should consider moving out of the project and moving on to a fork some of these trade-offs are like don't they affect your decision-making um like speed yeah and and it doesn't doesn't can't that potentially put a protocol in a an uncompetitive position relative to its peer um they can um i think but i think in general like if something is decentralized at all then like it's not competing on like a rapid like like day-to-day scale agility like it's competing on the ability to provide its um its users promises of stability and now i do think that in early stages while a product is still rapidly evolving it makes sense to have shorter time windows but like i personally am a fan of time windows that potentially even programs do increase programmatically like maybe the time window should be proportional to a percentage of that of the time since the project launched like after a year it's a week after two years it's two weeks after three years it's three weeks or something like that um like basically i think um projects like there is a need for rapid decision making especially in early stages but the rapid like the early stages should always be designed designed with the mindset that eventually the rapid stage is going to end and the project is going to transition into something whose rules are like more focused around giving people stability and then um being able to like adapt really quickly that changes the circumstances in one week instead of six so vitalik i feel like we've um we've extensively covered this this topic of decentralized governance and it seems like the uh the key message is like uh hey let's not build this entire d5 ecosystem this entire app layer ecosystem on coin voting it's brittle you know and maybe there are some other mechanisms the community can start experimenting with let's not just um you know you use coin vote as the shelling point but i i wanna you know pull back another thread that that you were talking about earlier when we were talking about the ability of users to opt into software download their own software um this is something we where we're kind of seeing when we see maybe every bull market this conversation of when uh transaction fees start to to go up because there's demand for block space then inevitably there come you know a number of projects who just say hey we can create more block space we can solve the scalability trilemma um and you know this decentralization thing like maybe it's not so necessary and maybe it's not even necessary for users to have the ability to run their own nodes maybe scalability of transaction speed is more important you wrote another post called the limits of blockchain scalability that maybe we want to want to tug uh on a little bit but this was like in response to um elon musk i think it triggered this uh conversation where he's talking about doge speeds and um he said ideally doge speeds up block time by 10x increases block size by 10x and drops fees 100x then it wins hands down right it's kind of this notion like hey um we're coming to crypto and we need more scalability and and i've got the solution we just increase everything by 10x or 100x can we have a conversation about the limits of scalability i think in fact that's um that's your post uh title but uh maybe let's start here why is it so important for individuals individual users to have the ability to run nodes david and i were just in a conversation with um uh you know group we were talking about a another non-ethereum blockchain and we're having this debate as to whether indeed is important for individuals to to run nodes they were making the point that it wasn't we could get into some of those critiques but from your perspective why is it so essential for individuals to have the ability to run non-val validating blockchain nodes um so the thing that a blockchain node does um i think non-participating might be better might be better than non-validating because the thing that the note does is it validates like in the sense it verifies the every block that's coming in and it checks that everything in the blockchain actually is happening according to the rules right so if uh like ethereum users all switched to using like clients for example then what would happen is that um the like more than 50 percent of the consensus participants the you know miners or stake validators could just come together and say like hey you know we're going to make a change to the rules like we're going to like say throw in a def funds that that distributes like an extra 5 billion coins to our friends or we're going to double um staking interest rates because we decided that we need that or whatever um and users are going to be at an extreme disadvantage and like even being able to rebel against that change because like their clients are going to accept the blocks by default right because a user does not see um that a the uh the change was made and the the new blocks are no longer valid according to the old rules because all they see is the headers like the the users aren't by default is not going to reject the new blocks they're just going to kind of keep coming along as though nothing went wrong and users are only really going to detect that something happened like possibly hours into the future right like maybe one some one community actor is going to be make an alert um and then over the course of a couple of hours that um alert is spreading the spread over social media and then a couple of hours later more people are gonna wake up um well well by the time um that and like users um understand what's going on and they're really upset about it um basically there will have already been like eight hours of watching activity that happened um and that like there could have been really a lot of really important things that happened there and like well guess what there's going to be large constituencies that are already going to be against uh reverting the chain and it would be the onus would be on the users to successfully coordinate reverting the chain right or the owners would be on the users to make a fork and even when the users make a fork they would be disadvantaged in making a fork because well if the blockchain is big then syncing the blockchain is hard and seeking the blockchain they're going to take like a week instead of an hour and so there's going to be a huge amount of downtime before a fork can start now like basically the entire game ends up being tilted heavily against users that are that that are trying to rebel against that sort of situation there's no protection against the elites is how you phrase things in your article exactly like the game is tilted in favor of the elites winning by default um whereas if um you take something like bitcoin or ethereum where you do have lots of users running though it's them ethereum by the way definitely can be better at this and like a lot of the things like stateless clients like for example that we're doing are fundamentally about ethereum becoming better at this um like basic if you have at least lots of note users running notes then what's going to happen um is that once the if the majority of these speakers kind of quietly agree on this vertical change and they push the protocol change through then the uh like by default the users are just going to see that those blocks are invalid and they're going to ignore them right and so when the users wake up like what they're going to see is they're going to see that there's one chain and that one chain has like for some reason 80 of the stakers from their point of view just once offline right like all they see is they see their chain and they see the 20 percent of stakers or whatever it is that are still staking on that chin and so they think okay well 80 of the stakers once offline when in reality of course 80 of the stakers are continuing to make their own chain that follows different rules but the user is just by default they get like they might see some invalid block errors but like from the user's point of view it looks extremely close to those eighty percent just going offline right and so here the default is tilted very much in favor of like this cabal that wants to change the rules of losing um and when the cabal loses um then like basically like they don't just they end up uh in the case of proof of stake even like their validators would just all get inactivity at least they lose a huge amount of money um and for the rest of their users like their user experience only experiences like a tiny degradation because well for like a couple of days instead of uh having a block every 12 seconds they're gonna have a block every 60 seconds or whatever right and that's something that like okay fine you know the gas price goes up to 2000 way for a bit but like you know the chain keeps on running um so it's the sort of situation where like uh they yeah the the default is tilted in favor of the uh regular users and people who oppose the fork not suffering that much and the people that tried to force the forks through um suffering a really huge amount um so that like the closer we can get to that world the better right um and the further away we get uh we get from that world the worst um and so so in order for that world to exist though it needs to not only be possible for regular users to run a node but it needs to be easy enough for regular users to run a node that regular users choose to do it and don't get too lazy right like if the uh the amount of hard disk space needed for a node is two thirds of your hard drive then sure you can technically run it but you know realistically if you want to like have your video games on your on your laptop as well then you're not gonna want to run your node and so you're gonna still feel like ah you know whatever i'm just gonna go like uh hook up to a light client or hug up to a furore or whatever um but if on the other hand i know it only takes up like 10 of your hard drive then suddenly running a note is a much more reasonable value proposition um so that's the sort of uh like the sort of world that we want to live in right like oh the world where running a node is something that's both possible for average users but even something where users like can do it even if they're very even if they're furious lazy and that they're not that willing to like endure a large amount of inconvenience and i think it's a world that we can get to um i think you know even with ethereum blocks being as large as they are like there's been the guest team has been doing an amazing amount of work on improving client efficiency um statelessness could mean that you can have verifying nodes that do not require any hard disk space um state expiry could mean that the hardest space required for even a state storing node goes down to like 40 gigabytes or something small um you know eventually you could even you know we're gonna zk snark the evm and so on a node can just verify a stark instead of verifying transactions um the node would still have to verify data availability um but you know we we can get to a you know a world where running a node is very easy um and even today even without the fiance technology um ethereum is still like much closer toward a world where running out is easy then like almo basically any other of these kind of high through uh blockchains that's that has a large amount of usage um so that's something we that we want to preserve and build on fatalic i want to keep on actually parsing this apart but i want to ask this question from a different frame of reference than what you were just talking about you you talked about how the ethereum community could be better at running nodes and that's how something that you kind of aspire towards as as a part of this ethereum community is like we could all be doing this a little bit better um then there's a relationship between like the culture that we want to have of the of the people that make up our our blockchain with the actual technology that is a part of the blockchain and so you talked about how like okay great like we have i have my computer and it has a terabyte of data storage but i just have my computer i don't necessarily have a computer that i specifically dedicate for all of its resources to running a node and so you're talking about making as a cult as a values choice for the ethereum blockchain you want it to make a reduce the cost so that the individual user can be uh enabled to run a node where we've seen other like i would imagine binance smart chains which are forks of ethereum or avalanche which is a fork of ethereum have just juiced up these um juice up these metrics about running a node to the point where like it actually sucks up every computational resource that a computer has so can you talk about the importance of establishing a culture around running nodes and what that can do for the security of a blockchain and as that relates to the hardware requirements um sure um so i mean the culture of running nodes basically just means that you know there just needs to be all of these different kind of infrastructure development and just like mindsets of you of users that are just running a node is something that happens by defaults right and that's the sort of thing that you can have more of and that you can have less of um so one example of this for example like one way that ethereum can improve is um when the merge happens right the merge one of the things that we have in the proof of stake design is a much better light client and uh when we have a much better light client so one of the advantages of this is that the light it will be possible to just have the likelihood the inside of right inside of your browser right so you could imagine a metamask like wallet or hopefully metamask itself i'm upgrading so that instead of just trusting in if you're up for information about the blockchain like it asks for merkle branches and it actually verifies those vertical branches against the light clients and it checks that you know hey like the you actually have this light client that's run that's kind of listening to the blockchain itself and getting the information about what the latest blocks are now the like client is still not doing full validation so it's still vulnerable to a 51 attack um but at the same time it's still much better than you know being vulnerable to an inferior attack right um so that's uh one of the like that's one example of a way that ethereum can improve and i think i'm i'm hoping will improve um after the merge one of these kind of underrated benefits of the merge uh to having some more of a node running culture um another example of this of course is that if it continues to become easier to just run a node on your local computer and like there's all sorts of these work streams that are trying to make that happen then that's some you know if more people start doing that then like you could imagine more people just running their own node and then you could you could just have more people you know instead of uh talking to and fiora they could just um have this uh uh when they access um just random ethereum applications throughout the world they would just talk to their own node um and their own node would give them information about the blockchain um i think that that even offers them uh potentially um a bunch of privacy benefits like there's potentially even even like good reasons for the user to do that right but once you have a critical mass of users doing that then that just makes it much harder for a kind of proof of stake validating elites or like pools or mining polls or mining elites to kind of do do any kind of like um hostile takeover without people's consent um and also like it reduces uh the decisive power that um the uh like centralized providers have in uh deciding on like whether or not to adopt a hard fork that like isn't evil but actually just is controversial um so like the more you have a node writing culture the more the kind of the layer zero this kind of final um layer of last resort in decision making um actually yeah ends up being a genuinely democratic one so vitalik we've had a number of conversations with i would say maybe uh high throughput chain apologists right let's call them that right and so this is kind of how they would counter some of the things that you're saying right um basically everything you you said would be really nice vitalik if everyone ran their own node but practically they'll say vitalik how many people do you know who actually run their own ethod and now you probably know a lot of course but like for the average person are they actually running their note that like the subtext is hey the the battle is lost right it's too late ethereum already like relies very heavily on third parties like in fiora and alchemy to power some of its app layer uh services so it's kind of like if you can get past having all users have the ability to run their node i understand that that that would be a nice i guess balance of power but if you can get past that and realize that's not practical in the real world then we could boost up throughput by a heck of a lot and um you know is that so bad and is ethereum like practically not allowing everyday users to run a note anyway today and so why don't we just make that trade-off is it kind of a trade-off like i mean you've you've written posts before about you know bitcoiners not being comfortable with weak subjectivity but uh ethereum is for instance you know or is this is there something even more important about users running their their their own nodes that make this kind of an iron-clad trade-off that change shouldn't make what's your take here i think um like this gets back to the concave versus convex post that we talked about a while ago right like i think people think people seem to keep wanting to trade-offs to be binary but they're they never are right there like in the like 10 people running ethereum nodes is better than one person running an ethereum node 100 people running ethereum nodes is better than 10 people running if you're in nodes and 10 000 people running ethereum nodes is better than 100 people running with your m nodes like i think there are more and more things that you lose the further and further away you get from ethereum being a node running culture so like just some examples of this right is that you obviously lose a lot when you move away from ethereum people running nodes by default um you lose even more when you move away from the ability to run a node as a hobbyist you lose even more once you start thinking about not just users but services like even exchanges deciding that they're too lazy to run a node um and you know it's complicated to figure out how to get this five thousand dollar server working and they have they're running like 57 different chains anyway and so and once you have services like exchanges of themselves making the trade-off to be lazy and go and talk to a centralized provider right and then once you start talking about you know staking pools um like sharing node infrastructure like the more centralized you get like you know it's not it's very much not binary you either have it or you don't like either you could have all of it you could have less but you could have even less of it and the the more and more you lose the more the progressively more and more dystopian the system gets right i think like there it might i'm pretty sure there have even been cases in the wild of like either staking pools or exchanges or other kinds of major actors like that just sharing node in um and node infrastructure or just kind of offloading that decentralized providers right and like the more of that you get then the more the set of people you have to like you have to get on your side to make a heart a hostile hard fork happen like shrinks from you know 10 000 to 100 to 10 um or potentially even lower um i think i believe actually even in the case of eos i can't i can't remember exactly but i remember vaguely hearing about this sort of thing happening like i remember hearing about this kind of like some like basically running an eos though it took so let's took a lot of resources and so even some of the validators um like even some of the like 100 delegates um ended up being too lazy and ended up kind of outsourcing their node running to someone else um so yeah like you know you think that we've given up the fight but no like there's way more fights that we could lose alec uh vitalik i recently asked you this on twitter and i'd love to dive into the subject even more and it's becoming very very uh in vogue to to talk about this subject because we're all kind of realizing that it's here or at least the beginnings of it so what in your mind is this metaverse thing what is the metaverse hmm i guess um like it's this general concept right that you know you have like like you have the internet but then you try to you're trying to sort of take the internet to the next level with some kind of like greater level of immersiveness i guess now what that immersiveness is i think is still really big in a lot of people's minds like to some people it just means you have really good virtual reality um and you have like some kind of internet that feels like it's seamlessly integrated with a virtual reality um to some people it refers to some notion of like shared objects in shared state like you know you can have like you know the magic sword from one game and then you can port it over and like move it to your other game or it can move your entire character to another like a world and still keep the same skin and the same like uh other uh kinds of details um you know you could even have these kind of virtual environments that all um that all talk to each other like you can have you know nfts that have that get assigned a meaning that gets respected in like multiple people's kind of applications and sort of sub-universes so i think uh like people use the term for a lot of things and it's still very vague in people's minds but there is this notion that this sort of interconnectedness is something that people want and i think like that's a big reason why something like ethereum is really well suited to be as a central part of the metaverse like because you know ethereum is this environment that's really well suited for like creating these objects where those objects like once say you create them they can then easily be moved around between different applications and they can have like value assigned to them or value respected by different platforms um like one interesting example of this actually like i said there was this salute project that like i think popped up a couple of days ago right look you have these nfts and every nft by itself is just like a bit of text right it's like you know like wizards robe of the tiger and like magic sort of excaliburness or whatever that or whatever whatever um and uh like okay fine you have nfts that are a bunch of texts and you have this ecosystem of all sorts of different like applications created by community members where those applications those applications then assign meaning like it could be assigning pictures it could be assigning like stats it could be assigning all sorts of things um to these objects right and so you have this uh basically virtual world that not only like it even goes beyond decentralized decentral lands type things where like you just have a decentralized substrate you have a virtual world that's here that has collaboratively created laws of physics um and that's something that seems potentially really powerful right now what people are going to do with the metaverse i yeah and i don't know yet i mean it seems like there's a lot of space for creativity like i could use i i definitely see it becoming a a really powerful kind of interesting place to do all kinds of gaming things um what other things people will do like does it make sense to um you know have uh like have a work meeting inside of the metaverse as opposed to just like doing it in a zoom lesson call or whatever whatever i don't know i think people are still um figuring that out we'll see um you know are we going to have like social platforms that are like more deeply connected as part of the metaverse somehow like are there going to be conferences and you know in the metaverse and what does that even mean like i think these things are still being figured out um i do think that the ethereum like ecosystem has a big opportunity to be in the middle of this whole transition um so we'll see how that goes well yeah i was about to bring up loot next but you did it for me and and took and ran exactly where i wanted to go with this i right before we hopped on a call with you i tweeted out loot is ethereum coming full circle uh because uh vitalik originally created ethereum because of his world of warcraft items that got nerfed by blizzard and now we have this metaverse that is actually instantiating the values that you wanted to have loot in your world of warcraft account exist in the first place um and so like uh you said ethereum is has the opportunity to be at the center of of this whole thing and i recently just put out an article on bank list that more or less talked about exactly like this where ethereum is an object issuance platform and that's all it needs to be to offer this skeleton or this structure to allow this metaverse to ascribe meaning and and purpose to the value to the objects that ethereum has uh inside of its state and so the the kind of the what i'm trying to wrap my head around is like is ethereum like this first imp uh skeletal structure that allows for the metaverse to kind of like envelop around it yeah and i think ethereum's definitely like gone further than anything that we've um that we've seen before right now again in in a lot of different ways right like there's definitely been this kind of this rich object ecosystem in ethereum there's been this rich kind of gaming ecosystem in ethereum and you know with like dark forest the zk game and all these other things um there's been this rich also financial ecosystem that's also a type of object um like actually seeing these different pieces like start talking to each other and it'll be very fascinating but as we come to a close here uh and again thank you for your time uh we want to just kind of check in with the update on ethereum since we last talked roughly three months ago eip1559 has come live with the london hard fork beacon chain has launched this new nft mania has made ethereum closer to a household name than it ever has before so how would you describe ethereum in its current state in history like where where are we in the course of ethereum history help us help us uh find ourselves where are we um we're on the finish line to the merge right i think that's the most important thing right now with the eip1559 behind us like there's basically nothing else that's like something like right in front of us that was that um lots of people were really putting their souls into and focusing on um and efb1559 i think in addition to um you know both correctly proving out the burn and correctly proving that it manages to actually really increase the uh user uh experience efficiency of sending transactions and i don't know what experience you've had but like for me it definitely feels like it's much easier to just send a transaction and get it included in one block and i don't have to like worry about adjusting gas fees anymore um but like in addition to all of those things eap1559 also proves to the world that the ethereum ecosystem really is capable of making big changes and like it's not just vaporware um and i think people are increasingly confident now that like the merge is something that is going to happen too right it's a big shift like um it feels so long ago but even as little as late as um like at the beginning of 2020 it was still a common bitcoin maximalist position that the merge will never happen right i mean you know since then they've obviously moved on to other arguments and like they've even you know just embraced the whole like you know proof of stake will happen but it's bad um thing so you know when i when you make enough progress to force other people to to shift their narratives that's definitely something a sign that you're doing things right so that was an answer from i would say like the inside out of ethereum focusing on where ethereum is as a protocol but what about viewing ethereum from the outside in from the we have government regulators looking at what's going on in defy and we have you know cute penguins working their way into like the zoomers like computers that they come home after school what about from the the social level where is ethereum in its acceptance as a social technology i think it's finally breaking out and i think it's amazing that it's finally breaking out the nft space did a lot i think because the nfc space showed in a constituency other than finance people that if your admin has something real really cool and interesting inside of it right like you have all of these artists that are selling these nfts um gamers um are obviously increasingly interested um you have uh just you know this like ecosystem of people just doing all sorts of really cool and creative and fun stuff um like ens is kind of slowly contin continuing to you know make its way forward maybe having a bit of a wall just because there's high transaction fees and it's expensive to interact with anything but you know once uh roll-ups come online which is very soon i mean arbitrarily my understanding is that it still has training wheels but it did launch a kind of available to everyone version um a couple of days ago so like you know big congrats to our patreon amazing progress there um the and optimism obviously you know they're continuing to run they're i think they have about a hundred thousand the dollars a day of uh transact uh transaction fees now um so they um made that blog post right where they promised to put a large portion of a sequence of revenues into retroactive public goods funding um and like we're talking a hundred thousand dollars a day for truck funding public spending like that's bigger than the get going matching full budget so um bless you bless you yes so roll ups are increasingly being used um i think it is definitely like one of the places where i was over optimistic before is that i thought that you know once you had things like loopering and zk sync people would just start adopting them immediately for payments but i think what ended up happening is that we showed that like you actually do need the richer kind of fully evm capable ecosystem with all sorts of applications on a rollup for people to like really wants to jump onto one on mess but that's actually happening now and i think the jumping is happening and once that happens then the fees are going to go down and all of this kind of flattens interest in just doing all sorts of like interesting and cool things on ethereum like that's going to really blow up even more um so looking forward to that yeah we talk about packing our bags and going off to the layer two suburbs because it's cheaper to live there what technologies do you think we will finally be able to unlock now that layer two is here that we wouldn't have been able to use because of the prohibitive computation and fees on the main chain so ens becoming a much bigger deal something i already mentioned um like even like something like status for example like i think uh you know high enos fees are probably one of the biggest barriers to adoption at this point and at the same time like the other barriers to adoption like how syncing between devices doesn't work well and like you can't really see people's names clearly and all these other things like those are things that the team is also actively working on fixing and they have a whole bunch of other awesome features that are in the works um so i expect status quo to become considerably more amazing once it both integrates layer 2 is anza does all these other things um all of this gaming stuff obviously like hopes hopefully zk game is not going to be on a test net forever um there's um like basically all of these non-financial applications some attestations um like just like claims being made about different about different accounts um just much wider adoption of like pope and proof of humanity and all these other protocols just yeah i mean the entire non-financial um ethereum ecosystem being able to just be much bigger and be accessible to people who are not like basically already rich from having held on youth for the last few years vitalik um eth just just passed its sixth birthday so that means we're in the sixth year and it's been a pleasure to uh to have you on the podcast uh sir we've gone over so much but i want to ask you kind of this this final question um each year maybe has had kind of a like a feeling a trend something about it that that that's new you know you know 2015 there was launch then there was you know dow maybe 2016 ico 2017. what do you think is that you know the the word or phrase or theme for the year 2021 for ethereum hmm i would say scaling um both in the sense of technical scaling of roll-ups finally coming online also and in the sense of social scaling of uh communities other than finance caring about ethereum for the whole for for the first time um and just uh ethereum becoming much more culturally mainstream um and of course some you know in the sense of uh kind of the ethereum layer one scaling things not quite happening yet but definitely um like being on a path and getting onto the path where people are increasingly convinced that they're going to happen so scaling in many ways
