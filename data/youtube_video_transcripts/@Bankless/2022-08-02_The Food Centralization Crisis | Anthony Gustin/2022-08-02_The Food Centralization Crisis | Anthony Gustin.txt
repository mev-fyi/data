welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code was composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cyberpunk's understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been lately these shows have really not actually resonated with that intro so i'm considering redoing that intro but that's a conversation for a later time today on the show i'm having anthony gustin and this is the podcast that i've been teasing about on crypto twitter all about food production the decentralization of our food production carbohydrates and what we need to do about it now if you are expecting an episode where david and his guests just rant on carbohydrates and nutrition this is not that uh this is i think one of the most informative educational podcasts that i've ever produced on this show and also it's critical information for you to know the decentralization of our food production is something that we must do uh in order to live on this planet for more than the next like 50 or 100 years or so this is a code red this is a fire alarm and anthony helps me tell the story as to what the hell is going on with our highly centralized highly fragile systemically risky state of food production uh and there are one one of the cool things i'm actually really proud of on this episode is there are a number of words that we use in the crypto space that we carry over to talk about this conversation centralization versus decentralization fragility versus anti-fragility scalability of systems culture cultural diversity and not just culture as in like music and arts and literature but culture and cultural diversity of a a biosphere there are we do have we also talk about just like debt and how we have the federal reserve with a bunch of debt on its balance sheet and our soil has a debt to pay with a lack of nutrients in it we do we do a very fun and creative job of carrying over a lot of the parallels and the themes that you've been listening to on the bankless podcast for the past six eight ten months and applying them to this world of regenerative agriculture uh and so while it's a little bit weird like why is this crypto podcast bank list doing this thing on regenerative agriculture it's because these same patterns exist and so hopefully you've been learning about these themes on bank list that we've been pounding into your head and now we can take a step back and take these themes into a different corner of the globe and apply them in a new way and we can learn to refine what it means to be decentralized we can learn to refine what it means to be anti-fragile and we can take some of these lessons and apply it to a new industry and hopefully you can go from zero to 60 about the world of food production because it's really important food production is really important we joke on bankless joke uh that if we can recreate the money and if we can recreate the financial system there are so many positive downstream effects as to what we can do for the world the same thing applies with food if we can recreate and reconstruct how we organize our food production systems there are so many second third fourth order consequences that are so positive for this world it recreates our relationship with our own human selves it recreates our relationship with our community and our family and just reorients our spiritual awareness of what it means to exist in this world uh so this is something that i hope you hear my voice i'm extremely passionate in i extremely much believe in this no this is not a nutrition advice podcast but if you got pulled into it because of my rantings on crypto twitter haha gotcha i hope you stick around for the next 90 minutes because this is i hope going to be one of the most informative podcasts that you'll ever listen to and it's a nice beat off the of the path of crypto while still using crypto principles and crypto values so anthony gustin he's a he's a personal hero of mine i've been listening to his podcast before i've been podcasting uh he's just super sharp super attacked and it's got a great head on his shoulders so i hope you enjoyed this fantastic podcast all about regenerative agriculture and decentralized food production we're going to get there right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get r eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can

just being blindsided by my food tirades on twitter but they actually had there's actually a ton of context and backstory to this uh part of that backstory is i started relentlessly listening to podcasts and one of them was your podcast way back in the day uh when i learned about podcasts through the lens of like nutrition uh and keto and and good physical movement and it was one of yours was the first podcast i started listening to so i have to thank you for getting me into the world of podcasting and it's actually quite an honor to have you on my podcast so many years later well the honor is mine man to have you listen to my show in the first place and then to be in yours well okay so here's what here's why i'm having a actually can you give me a little bit of a background on yourself like uh uh wha what's your educational background and what do you do and just who are you for the listeners yeah i i don't know how to how they even do this anymore so i'll start just very simple i grew up super fat and sick in the midwest became a functional medicine clinician in my doctorate in chiropractic and master's in in sports rehab did a bunch of functional medicine work then it went into online world and started figured out that you could use the internet to actually help people instead of in person so then launch a bunch of e-comm health-based brands quit foods perfect keto a bunch of other stuff then switched more into investing advising and now i'm a small farmer so i don't really know how to concisely have that make sense anymore but that's the easiest thing i can do yes but for one big theme and you zoomed if you could zoom out and just focus on one one theme your your current your your podcast has gone through a couple rebrands uh but now it's uh what is the name something health the natural state natural state natural state podcast yeah and would you say that that's a good uh summary of the theme of your career trajectory yeah i think it's just the investigation of why are humans so sick and how do we fix that and i think it started with humans and then it has transitioned now into so many other things i mean it was a physical health first then it was oh man our emotional health is messed up our spiritual health is messed up the planet's ecological health is messed up like so many indicators of health globally universally are just completely destroyed and the more i dig into it the more it's obvious how many common threads there are and so it's it's fun to get into farming because i'm using more of the land and paying attention to the health of animals and then how that impacts humans and how all this stuff is intertwined and how i think i mean even mental emotional health spiritual health etc when you strip humans away from the food system a lot of that also degrades and there's a lot of really great people who write about that but yeah it's just the once you start going down this rabbit hole i think it's it starts to all make more sense and i you know the thing if the more you the more you learn the less you know is very true for a lot of stuff that i'm into but yeah just the the health overall that i can perceive with my senses i guess is what i'm interested in certainly and i think listeners who are probably wondering like why the hell is there this like nutrition health podcast coming out of of bank list this crypto podcast the the answer to that is that this i think this is going to be a very fun exploration into the ties not neces not between crypto and food production but with the words and themes that we use uh anthony just used the word like rabbit hole we are very familiar with that in crypto but it goes far beyond that we're going to talk about the decentralization of our food production and where the centralization of our food production has created a lot of significant second order consequences that are bad we might also use the word how like scale how do we scale this effort um and overall i think you're going to find that there's a pretty strong mapping of some of the concepts in crypto to some of the solutions that are also broken about our current food system like uh our banking and financial system is not the only broken part about this world there are many other broken parts about this world uh and uh while many in the crypto industry are like myself are maximally bullish on well if we can fix crypto we can fix so many other things in the world well anthony is going down that same rabbit hole if you will but saying like well if we can fix our food and our mental health and so much other things you can fix so much else about the world so this while the concept of food and nutrition and health is completely divergent from crypto and finance the structures here are actually the same and that's what i want listeners to walk away with at the end of this episode saying oh i learned something about a completely different industry but the patterns are still there the patterns are still the same anthony you think we can do this journey together let's do it man i'm ready all right so let's start with the current state of things the problem statement our current food production is highly centralized can you illustrate just like the centralized nature of our food production and what are the what are the consequences of this design that we have in the world i mean i guess to illustrate it i would ask the listener out there and no judgment to your listeners i'm sure they're all amazing people but how many of you know the soil which your food came from have you seen it have you seen where the food grows whether that's plants animals or even packaged food everything comes to the ground at some point do you know where that comes from the chances are that comes from an enormous multinational corporation that whether it's plants animals packaged food whatever it is that is beholden to their shareholders to make a profit on you eating food they don't have your health interests and they don't have any sort of connection to the food system for you it's just about making money and it's and it's not like it's you know a bunch of different places doing this these are we're talking about a handful of multinational corporations and that's it and so the centralization of food in the food system in my mind comes down to a few big corporations and them trying to make profit off you that's it so it boils down to that i mean there's so many problems which that leads to but that's at least like the the core root of it is that i mean i tweeted this a couple weeks ago that the problem with our food industry that it's an industry there's some things that i think make sense from maybe some centralization and maybe some oversight regulation etc and some that i don't think that should be the case and one of those is our food system and what we consume as humans and so this this really just boils down to as all things do just raw human incentives and we see the same problem like perhaps playing out in the the healthcare industry you know pick your industry like the the web 2 social media facebook instagram industry there are humans human wants and desires and needs and then there are corporate shareholder interests and those things diverge and they create a bunch of problems and because like you layer on a bunch of hyper-competitive capitalism the winners start to like snowball and all of a sudden we have these incentives that are highly divergent from the actual which we would desire to see manifested in the world base of our human values would you agree with that that's 100 correct okay so can we talk about the perils of centralization in our on our food supply like in our food production what is the products the food products that come out of these centralized manufacturers and versus and how are those products divergent from what they otherwise would have been in a more natural state if you will yeah so people give me a lot of because i talk about the plant-based industry quite a lot and use them as an example of how the food industry is pretty messed up and the reason is is because they give me more material to work with and they give me more examples um we saw this a long time ago with and again we we have these big corporations we have these big institutions the government namely american heart association american diabetic association etc that make up the decision of they tell us what is healthy to eat and then they sell us the food and they have all the marketing money to put all the stuff out there so they have all the money they have all the information they have all the credibility they have all the distribution this is not good for our health and when it comes down to it all of food all the food industry is centralized and i also think that factory farming for from a meat perspective animal race perspective is also abhorrent and we shouldn't support that and we'll get into that in a second but when it comes down to it the ultra processed food is by far and away the worst thing for human health and this is stuff that's been engineered by food scientists again these massive corporations to be as addictive as possible using the cheapest ingredients so that way they can make the most money so your repeat buyer they have most margin and on and on the cycle goes meat doesn't have that much margin that's why yes the conditions are awful because the same thing the incentives for price lead to really poor animal conditions by the end of the day it's still far healthier food yes there's ethical problems with it yes there's a lot of ecological problems yes it's not the healthiest food because there's other examples regenerative models which i'm sure we'll get to later in the episode but overall these fake food alternatives are what are destroying your health at large and i think the most when you think about centralized food it's possible because if you go in your backyard and raise an animal have a garden etc and you would go to the grocery store and buy meat and vegetables or fruit or whatever it looks roughly the same right so even if the distribution and manufacturing all that stuff is centralized it's it's not leading to as many problems relatively speaking because you can still make that at home but when the food becomes such that only a multi-billion dollar company can make complex supply chains that run across the world and these huge elaborate factories with ultra expensive machinery that cost crazy amount of money and have complex systems with parts from all over the world distribution fossil fuels that run all this stuff now you're making things in these again huge multinational corporation factories that we call food this is not the case this is this stuff is what poisons people the most and as you know my material i've been on a tirade against carbohydrates for a very long time and that's just to give a clarification on that it's not real food carbohydrates that i really care about at all if you eat real food carbohydrates again stuff that you can grow stuff that you can pick off of a tree a fruit i grew melons yesterday i ate them i have a garden here with melons and awesome potatoes whatever i don't really care it's the super processed foods that again can only happen in an ultra centralized sort of dynamic that come out that poison the entire system they're terrible for the environment they're terrible for our health they lead to crazy health care costs and that's where i think we get into trouble is this maximalized over-processed food carbohydrates go out of control we can now consume 300 400 grams a day you're eating real foods you never get that point and so that's why i think the crux of the centralization issue comes into play and let's uh make it really concrete for the listeners what's an example of one of these foods we're talking like cheetos doritos oreos this kind of stuff yeah that's a quintessential stuff which i called you know big food big food is you know the general mills procter and gamble these big companies where if you are you know especially 30 40 50 years old plus you know these companies from your childhood the box cereals the chips the all this type of stuff it's really only like four companies that own all the stuff there are all these different brands but it's only about four different corporations on all of it there's now though a new big food that's coming out which is the impossible foods the beyond meat all this type of stuff it's the exact same model it's the exact same model but they're putting a new skin on it and so just like when we had margarine before people used to have homesteads where they churned all of their own butter made their own fat it was totally fine then we had cresco come along procter and gamble made crisco which was hydrogenated oils said okay this is way better and then we had this huge like anti-butter crusade happening against the world that only this factory could provide a super clean convenient fat turns out this kills people you know we figure out 50 years later and the reason why they do this is because again the incentives are not aligned with human health they're they're aligning with a corporation making money by selling as food that's not actually food and so the same thing is happening across all animal foods now they there are fake meats fake you know fake beef fake burgers fake chicken fake chicken nuggets fake shrimp fake fish fake eggs fake milk thick butter and it's the exact same thing we had when we had margarine which was stuff that you cannot make on your own if you did not have a lab in a factory you can't make this can we talk about uh where where does this incentive come from like why why is it more economic to produce all these fake foods than it is to get the real foods like i'm assuming their cost of production is lower um is there a common denominator as to the ingredients that goes into all these fake foods that make these foods more economically viable than the real foods yeah i mean the biggest thing is that they they are nutritionally poor but energy dense and the way that this is done is typically by you know the old version was super high fructose corn syrups things like that so you take these enormous mono crops so you plant either seeds or other sugar containing things sugar king corn et cetera and these enormous fields and you have huge combines which are giant tractors that go through and harvest these things then you have fountains yeah a mono crop is is a very large swath of land that's planted in one type of plant that's it there's mono one crop so in nature diversity is resilience and the same thing i think across any sort of system diversity breeds resilience and so when you put something in a mono crop this is why we've had to now increase year year pesticide use fertilizer use etc the one crop growing in a huge area mono crops don't exist anywhere in the world yet we do this we centralize all the food intake we centralize the crop into a huge farm only grows thousands of acres of corn or soybeans or sugarcane it's terrible for the environment then that gets distracted and then turned into these ingredients that are super cheap because they're done at scale a lot of times these are you know subsidized by the government which that's another huge long story but then those are made into cheap ingredients sugars and seed oils which when combined are pretty much the most toxic thing a human can consume and there's a couple words that you use there uh you know model crop one crop for a wide swath of land is very fragile and i'm gonna put these into into crypto words and say centralization uh puts everything into one sort of system and that makes it very fragile whereas the inverse biodiversity is robustness it's anti-fragility uh and i'll try like i'll uh translate like diversity into decentralization where there is no top-down coordination of these systems there is just bottom-up auto-organization of nature making it highly robust highly anti-fragile and also misaligned with corporate shareholder profits which is why they kill the the decentralization and add a centralized system in that place um and actually i do want to go next right into government lobbying because in the we talk about the banking system highly centralized banking system stays entrenched and incumbent largely because of government government regulation uh and so can you take us through that same parallel through the food industry and talk about how it's kind of been able to support its own business model through government lobbying and regulation yeah i mean yeah how government has screwed up the food system is a very long probably several books long many documents uh documentaries long but um i mean the biggest thing is getting into and incentivizing farmers to grow certain crops or not grow certain crops that's i think one of the biggest problems i think the other really big one is demonizing certain foods so the recommendation of certain foods so when we come out with things like the food pyramid now it's the my plate people actually pay attention to these things and so over the last 50 years for example we've eaten more grains we've eaten more vegetable oils which are recommended which are these again you can't eat these things on your own you can't grow all this stuff on your own we've eaten less animal products and it's been catastrophic and so these two things are the most important but i think one of the things that our government has screwed up the most which i think again i think is is a mirror for our financial policy is we've exported this type of thinking to the rest of the world and so there's been countless communities in self-sustaining civilizations tribes etc all around the world that we go and we think oh these people they're impoverished they don't have much let's give them our nutrition we hook them on our shitty oils flowers sugars they forget within a generation how to make their own food then they're now beholden on this again centralized food system exported from the us it sounds a lot like the the path of the u.s dollar yes to me it's the same exact thing you strip away all independence of these sovereign communities and hook them on something that they didn't ask for and then the whole system is crumbling with under them i mean it's insane one of the uh the tin foil conspiracies that i have is that what the the corn industry is one of the most heavily subsidized industries that exists to my knowledge uh and basically we have manufa like uh manufactured corn uh like what's it called when you tinker with the evolution of a species gmo yeah we've created this corn that is like optimized to produce high fructose corn syrup high fructose corn syrup being extremely addictive uh and like lighting up the same centers of your brain that like heroin and cocaine do uh but now it's in our food uh it's like nine out of ten aisles in a grocery store is filled with box stuff that has high fructose corn syrup in it and it also happens to be the most heavily subsidized industry that the government subsidizes uh and it's also one of our biggest biggest exports to the rest of the world so we have this like pseudo drug that we have this uh very centralized food production and big food manufacturing all this stuff uh doing like research as to like which flavor is most desirable by the consumer and you know all happens to have high fructose corn syrup in it and then it's not only are like the opiate that uh we consume internally but it's also the opiate that we produce and send it uh externally and so we like just like we have the us the the united states economy and the globe just addicted to the us dollar and addicted to like free cheap money we also have a globe that's addicted to like cheap subsidized highly addictive carbohydrates which as you've alluded to like are fake food you can't grow them in your own backyard it doesn't resemble any of the good carbohydrates like out like out of fruit or like something like that we're familiar with uh and so these parallels between like getting the world the world financial system addicted to cheap to cheap money seems to run directly with the getting the whole financial system addicted to cheap calories does that resonate with you too yeah i mean and it's a it's a house of cards that we continue to build i mean all this stuff with centralization across the board is very few people are winning and it's screwing the entire population i don't know if that's how you view it overall the whole financial system yeah but that's how i see it with everywhere else that i like where i see it before we start to get into like the solution behind this whole thing is there any parts left that we haven't talked about about the problem what's left to talk about the problems of this whole state of food in the globe yeah i think that we we talked about the the problem of ultra-processed foods i think that's very obvious to a lot of people but i think that there's a lot of harm when you centralize a lot of other things in both animal and plant agriculture if people are eating real food even the centralization of food has led to overall the disconnection of humans and their food system and that severing has led to a lot of weird uh assumptions and obsessions especially with with people who you know are vegan and again some of your listeners are vegan i'm sure they're great people but overall there's an argument generally that death is bad and we saw this with kobe everyone was so afraid of dying and i don't know with the technocrats out there also listening like we don't have singularity yet we're not living forever and i think there's this expectation that we will we will dominate nature and we will live forever and when you actually participate in killing animals growing them killing them growing plants and killing them and participating in the food system you have a connection that is irreplaceable and i didn't really get this until i started hunting and then even more so after i started farming and i had a small farm in texas and it's something that you can't buy and it just it creates a different perspective on food and it's hard to even explain until you experience it but i think that that separation of humans and nature has actually led to a vast majority of our problems like i said before digging into our mental health emotional health physical health all these things i think the root is really the separation of of humans from nature which brings back to the you know the natural state of all the stuff is an organism in its natural environment and us in a natural environment would be mostly procuring food i stayed with this hunter-gatherer tribe last last year in tanzania and that's the bulk of the quote-unquote work they did was going out to hunt and gather food and that connection of life and death always as i think a spiritual reminder for for people who are generally disconnected with it but even to bring down a practical example they used to have even as soon as like the the 1920s they used to when there were cities and we were stopped having everybody in homesteads and everybody sort of eating from the land they would bring animals into the city still alive and slaughter them there because it was the freshest way to do it and fresh way for people to get meat and it was this big spectacle where children and families would come and watch the animals get slaughtered now we may think that this is crazy and barbaric or whatever but it gave them appreciation that things die life is sacred it's important what you put in your mouth don't waste things and now we're so disconnected because of centralization of even real food that people have no concept of where this cut of meat comes from of where this broccoli is grown doesn't it like they don't know that the broccoli maybe was grown also in a mono crop with terrible conditions the farmer was abused and sprayed pesticides all over we're just completely disconnected so it leads to all these weird other perverse things in our life i think this is a really important conversation and something i definitely feel strongly of because there's these documentaries that exist out there that like show you the perils of like factory farming and why you shouldn't eat meat and like they they did the whole like secret bring in the camera secretly bring in the camera and film some of these atrocities that haven't made its way out to the mainstream uh and then now it's like a netflix video and then turned like 10 million people to go vegan because of how like poorly these animals are treated in these factory farms and i i'm privy to this argument that the people that work in these factory farms where there's just like it's a it's a holocaust like every single day of like these cows that are put through these terrible terrible living conditions they're cramped quarters they all they're all diseased uh and the worker that has to work and observe these conditions it's it's this it just it begs some whoever does that job has to be so incredibly like desensitized and brutal because they are taking the responsibility of like the whole world to understand what it means to kill an animal on their shoulders so rather than like all of us as individuals participating in this process which has in our ancestors been like a very ritualistic ceremonious coming together community oriented process and has taken the butcher the butchering of an animal and just like centralized it into one very like evil looking location like the factory farm and so these few people bear like the burden of like being the butcher for an entire globe's population and those people become insanely desensitized to the the livelihood of the animals so they are extremely brutal they're i mean they're also paid minimum wage they're just paid to slaughter animals but like when you watch these videos of like inside factory farms and you see these people have absolutely zero care for these animals because they're just a product to them it's because we force a few members of society to butcher everyone's animals on our behalf rather than like us partaking in this adventure uh in this ceremony together uh and so like this centralization has like you said like disconnected us from our own relationship with food and it and it's and now as a as a backlash to that instead of people getting closer to their food perhaps like going and finding their their their local farmers market instead they just go to like this pre-packaged pre like uh like food and safeway or whatever they become vegan because they think that that is the answer instead like if we want harmony with animals we must become vegan rather than having an alternative closer relationship with with our food um uh would you agree with this assessment yeah for sure i mean again the centralization not only forces these hired mercenaries to take that responsibility that's a great phrase in that just nightmarish situation it also shrouds the amount of death that is normally occurring in all food production no matter if it's in your backyard or in a large scale it shrouds the truth really if you go out like if i go to my garden right now and pick something like i'm stepping on 50 bugs to get out there that are gonna die the plants are dying all the time if you are alive you you depend on death anything alive depends on death plant or animal and generally speaking most of the plant production requires far more death than animal production even the centralized uh factory farming which a lot of people don't like to understand this but when you account for the amount of death on a monocrop system like we talked about before there's so many snakes and rabbits and gophers and bugs all these things get just get crushed through when these fields are harvested then when you're looking at raw death i mean all that stuff is wiped clean and when you see these fields you see more of a void then you see an active thing that's living that's going to die and i think that that's the contrast again with the centralization that like it hides the truth which which again like if people just participated in like killing an animal especially is not an easy thing i've done it a decent amount now and i i don't think it's ever something that i don't take ultra seriously and understanding that a living thing needs to die for me to be alive it's a very important thing to go through and i think that if more people could participate with it we wouldn't have the stigma we have now about it which would again lead to people to this false narrative that somehow being vegan allows them some free past ethically which it just factually does not right right can you um talk a little bit more about just like the the fragility of a monocrop culture uh i really like what you said where uh like if we see a monocrop pasture like just like a field of just like one crop that's like 99.9 percent thing other things had to die for that one crop to live in that one space and like we've created this farmland very far away from the cities very far away from our mental space um but just like the diffusion of one thing to be alive like when you're alive and you're breathing air that's air that somebody else could have breath could have breathed there's a limited number amount of air on the on this planet and if that metaphor doesn't land with you well i mean there's other resources that we can talk about too uh like water also is paid for money like food like if you buy food that makes food more expensive for others like your existence like there's a limit as to how many humans can exist on this planet and so like your space comes at the cost of other space and so when we clear out like these areas these swaths of land and just put mono crop culture it creates it creates it forces everything else to have died in its wake whether it's animals or other plants but also can you really talk about just like the fragility that that makes in that um biome when we have a significant uh monocrop culture paradigm yeah i mean i alluded to to it earlier about how much destruction you have to do to to do it but i think that the the most important thing is that we have these amount of crops based upon an artificial support system that should not exist same thing with our financial system it is all propped up on stilts and if any one of these things topple we are screwed so we are at a point now where we the only reason we can feed the amount of people we can feed right now is due to this thing called the haber bosch method that was invented after world war one these german scientists basically figured how to make synthetic nitrogen which allowed monocrops to be very very productive after that method our population in the world absolutely skyrocketed but now because we do that again we've never seen monocrops in nature ever doesn't exist anywhere in nature and we do it and we have to kill all these species of plants that naturally occur we have to destroy the habitat of thousands of different animals but not only that now we're starting to spray artificial fertilizer on that so that we have crazy yields that destroys the soil underneath the plants the soil gets extracted so we have to spray all this stuff on top and then we have to start because it's an unnatural ecosystem we get huge amounts of locusts huge amounts of pests we have to spa pesticides and then herbicides because other plants are coming up and that stuff destroys the ecosystem even more and so now we're basically engaged in this constant escalating warfare with nature but all these chemicals all these tractor parts all these fossil fuels are all again dependent on these enormous fragile corporations that are harvesting the nitrogen the fossil fuels the pesticides the herbicides from every corner of the earth to centralize it into one field to spray it everywhere to come up with this artificially cheap food food-like substance that we consume that makes us sick it is the most insane thing that i i don't know why most more people aren't freaking out about this and this is why i hate vegetable oils so much is because as much as you hate about hate on corn and i agree it's a huge problem especially in the united states worldwide the top five five out of the top five a greenhouse emitting crops land top five land use for crops top five water use for crops all go to making seed oils vegetable oils which are basically growing these huge amount of crops pesticide use herbicide use fertilizer use all seed oils top five all of them so that way we can make cheap rancid fat that is poisoning people that blows my mind biggest biggest problem i think it's i think it's worse than any sort of carbs again green off track here but it's the the mono crop that i am most gutted by when i see it happening and again it's most removed it's not grown on the highways of the u.s this is what we mostly clear rainforests for amazon is not cleared for beef production amazon's cleared for seed oil production and then when the land did not support that they have to bring cattle back on to bring back the fertility of the land which is what animals do and then they take them off and plant seed oils back in there we'll we'll dive into that at that angle a little bit because that's that's illustrative in of its own right but i'd just like to bring up the fragility of when we have this these mono crop cultures which is like a system of food production where it feels like holding water in your hands like if you have these mono crop cultures first you have to prevent all other future plants from growing there so you got to de-weed it uh but then then you have like this food source not just for humans but for bugs too so you got to play on spray on the pesticides and like you said it's this escalating like arms race to protect this monocrop culture from from nature because it is it's like this temporary like order where where the easy fa the easy state of the universe is entropy this is like like fake order like monocrops are just fake order and we have to like keep on making this order structured and not fall into disarray and fall into nature and then like you said that eludes are like we need to have all these supply chains that are shipping all of these pesticides and other goods to help keep this monocrop state of agriculture alive and working and as we all know in the last year and a half or so our supply chains have really broken down and you've talked about these fragile companies but we also have fragile like supply chains and nation-state relationships and when we have this state of like global mono crop culture food production along with geopolitic geopolitical instability all of a sudden like not just like a parts of our food production become fragile the whole damn thing becomes fragile so this is actually like a national security issue this is a global population food uh food a sustainability uh issue uh like is there do you fear of a world where like all of a sudden like the whole system breaks down because our supply chains break down and we literally cannot produce the food in our systems in the way that we do today anymore it's not a mistake that i am now on a farm that got scary yeah it's been a well-thought-out thing like okay well i mean i'm just lucky that my interests also align with my doing the day scenario and i it's not a matter of if in my mind it's a matter of when and maybe it's in 500 years maybe it's in 50 years maybe within five years i don't know but the machine we have cranking right now is inherently not sustainable it is nowhere even close to sustainable it is intensely extractive and intensely destructive and again what i said earlier does anyone know where the actual food comes from the soil the soil quality is degrading so rapidly because most of these mono crops which is what all the plant-based people actually depend on to survive and what we're exporting to all these other foreign countries to help them survive so our population is dependent on all these cheap calories to survive not to thrive to survive that is going to crumble eventually like we we are not in a path to figure out a way to do this there's there's no you know fermented food there's no lab grown thing that's going to save us all those are extractive processes just like if you have a national debt or a personal bank account and you keep spending more than you're earning eventually you're gonna screw yourself and you'll be completely belly up and that's where we're at like we are so negative on the ecological balance sheet we're not even close to sustainable and so when i think about food production centralization things like that there is no form of sustainable centralized food production and sustainable would be we're making the same amount we're spending regenerative which what i advocate for is you're earning more than you're spending so the soil fertility is improving the biodiversity is improving the waterways are improving the food production is improving all the other stuff right now is declining rapidly and i don't want to be at a point where i am cough my pants down and don't have any access to food or at least the food that i want to eat and again it's something i'm already interested in fully and i don't mean to be alarmist that everybody needs to go get their own farm but yeah it's it's again like it's not a mistake that i'm that i'm learning what i'm learning and getting real skills and living on a farm certainly and you you definitely alluded to it but i'll just make it super concrete um the federal bank the united states has an enormous amount of debt the central government of the united states has an enormous amount of debt we cannot pay it back therefore we are about to go through this currency crisis crisis on a global scale and like i think you're drawing the metaphor of you can apply that same thing that bankless has been talking about in all of our last like five macro episodes that like we are going to have to come to terms with with our debt by inflating our currency at least we have that escape valve with our food production if you're telling me that there is like we have a debt to the soil as in we have pulled out all the nutrients of our soil and replaced it with poison of pesticides and etc that is not something that we have an escape valve for like we do our us dollar currency that is something that is going to have to come to a head uh and so it doesn't sound like this is a you know anthony what is the probability of this 20 40 60 this sounds like this is a an inevitability based on our current paradigm of food production is that correct yeah it is um there's a term in agriculture called carrying capacity so for example if i have 100 acres i maybe have 10 cattle and they're totally fine ecosystem is good at 15 yeah maybe it's like it's they're still good if i go to 20 those 20 cal are going to survive for a while but they're eventually going to eat too much of the ecosystem because a natural ecosystem is a finite resource you cannot make more of it randomly if you just want to even though we think we can right now because we you know don't like to think of any sort of limits to it to to the world anymore um and then what happens is those 20 cattle now instead of like 10 crushing it living as they would now there's not enough resources for even five and so the population plummets to below five and then the grass starts growing back and then we start getting back to ten and there's always this balancing act in nature you see it with wolf and deer populations and we wiped out all the wolves and now the deer are going crazy and like there's there's this ebb and flow always and then when the deer get too much then they start eating too many plants and then those plants go down and the population balances out and i think humans are just we're past that point we're up like the 20 cattle range where we're consuming too much of our environment in a finite thing the the levy hasn't broken yet but i think it will due to a lot of calculations that i've read and that i've done myself around rough estimation like again we're propping this all up due to artificial means of artificial fertilizer extracting extracting extracting extracting again this is a finite resource we cannot continue to extract things without putting them back and we're not putting them back yeah so yeah unfortunately it's it's a matter of of when not if let's uh get perhaps unless there's any other angles of this conversation we haven't tapped into late yet let me know if there is but should we perhaps move this conversation to the putting it back part of this conversation yeah i mean it's the most important thing and to be fair i don't think that it's going to be a tomorrow the food system collapses and three billion people die in the next week sort of thing i think it'll likely be over hundreds of years but it's it's a challenging thing when you think about solutions as like a segway to that that i try to think about in balance all the time is you essentially have to play these two games one is try to get us off all these things but if you do that you again you go from 20 cattle to five and you have to build back up and i think that it's going to be very painful thing if we stop for example if we stuffed all the seed oils if we stopped all the high fructose corn syrup we did all these things that i think that from the surface seemed like a good idea it would be pretty awful for a lot of the world or you can say like okay well let's let's not do that because it's very harmful let's keep building the population and then maybe we go to 40 cattle and then plum it to one and that's way more violent and so it's like okay either way it's like the worst trolley problem of all time right and so i don't think there's any good solutions to be fair but it's something that i'm always thinking about personally and yeah just i know it doesn't sound very optimistic that's just where my brain's at but again not to think about it in like terms of good or bad but just we see this in nature all the time and it just is a thing that happens in nature and humans just haven't gone through it in our sort of like history that we know of and are like modern global civilization but we've gone through in the past probably thousands of times with hunter-gatherer tribes where they've overhunted an area that you know grew to 500 members and then had to die down to 100 members and then just sort of ebb and flow always through history i think we're just at that point where we've contracted and we're going to go back but yeah i i'm hopeful for a lot of really cool things that are in the works of basically how to start you know there's no going back there's as much as i you know think people idealize hunter-gatherer tribes like i said i stayed with one last year for a couple weeks it's crazy experience there's no going back to living like hunter-gatherers i think that assumption is insane it's more like i get excited for how are we moving forward and how are we really evolving and changing through this process and learning and coming up with like new amazing things to implement so that's what i'm excited about the uh you talked about how um we could keep going on this path and we could go up to like 40 cattle when the carrying capacity is like only 10. but if we got that far it would crash even further again just to keep on putting this into metaphors that we've been using on banklist this very much sounds like the the fed trying to have a soft landing for example with their monetary policy if we keep on if we they they let inflation get too hot too long and then now or excuse me they kept on allowing for free money lose money to get uh to be rampant for too long and all of a sudden inflation showed up and now they have to turn on uh the interest rates and then all of a sudden like because we were too hot for too long and the interest rates come all of a sudden we crash and the idea is that if that had happened if that goes on for too long it would send us into a depression if it goes on for a little bit too long it goes into recession and if it goes on for just the amount of right of time right amount of time you end up at a soft landing and so like hopefully we can create a soft landing with a new paradigm of food production so let's go let's go ahead and get into that that's the second half of this conversation which is the optimistic side the the the path forward the path through uh is not necessarily a painful uh a a happy path it's perhaps a a little bit of a painful path but on the other side of this it is an optimistic one um anthony maybe maybe you could guide us as to where this conversation is to start with um regenerative agriculture and like sustainable food production yeah so again it sort of defined these terms earlier as extractive is 99.9 of what we're living in vegetable produce production fruit production nuts and seeds animals processed food everything is extractive and i think there's a small outlier that is sustainable of basically it's the same sort of ins versus outs and then you have regenerative which is you're putting more into the bank out than you're spending so you sort of restore things which is honestly if we sustain things where they are right now i still think we're sort of off the cliff and we need to like if we sustain debt and we're in the red that's not good do you want your bank account a negative balance do you just want a bunch of credit card debt of course not do you want much of federal debt no we need to get at least get to break even and then start trying to start getting ahead and like saving a little bit and having some reservoirs and that's why i think we need to be focusing that's why i think even sustainable permaculture things like that are not really great models and so when people talk about plant-based stuff and we need to do this for the environment things like that the reality is and this is why i'm doing all this stuff on my farm i have a bunch of produce that i actually am not even interested in eating just because i want to experience what's the best possible way i can grow these things and generally in agriculture you have inputs and you have outputs it's really that simple and so can an ecosystem like survive like can i grow on my farm things without any external inputs and what has the most amount of inputs versus outputs and it seems to me so far and i've scoured many books researchers etc that plant production most vegetables actually are the most resource intensive things possible and people go what are you talking about i heard you know that meat and all this stuff and there's this report out of whatever and we can get all that stuff what's generally not talked about is the longevity of these things and what's required so for example you cannot grow produce especially in texas that doesn't have incredible fertile soil and a lot of water the feral soil needs to be the you need to have animals for that fertile soil and we don't put animals back on the land the soil fertility collapses you can't grow anything what are the animals putting into the land that is adding stuff to it the animals chew up all the plant matter they basically fermented in their stomach they poop and pee all over the land and that adds both nutrients but also micro micro uh microbes the most important thing is like uh feces are a very biologically active thing and so they're licking the ground they're spitting all over they're peeing all over it they're pooping all over it and that breeds ecological diversity in microorganisms those microorganisms go into the soil and create a living web of microarrangements that end up breaking down the rocks that are in the soil dirt into nutrients this is the biggest thing that people i think don't understand about how the nutrient cycles work is that you need microbial activity to break down dirt into soil into nutrients and then the plants the seeds extract those nutrients but if you just grow the plant and take the plant away and then keep doing that and you're not adding back any of that fertility or any of that microbial activity you screw the entire system and you can't again you cannot do that indefinitely uh i think a close second to that would be chicken in pig production i think a huge lie that the agriculture community has told people which once they find out they're going to be really pissed about is that pasture-raised pork in chicken is a huge scam what i mean by that is that 99 plus of pasture-raised pork and chicken are fed gmo corn soy there may be some organic outliers and even these outliers are fed mass amount of grains so you're having to grow an enormous amount of grain externally truck it in and feed these pastured animals corn and soy which you get is not even close to sustainable you're having to rely on mono crops for these animals to grow at least these animals are putting in fertility where they are and that's why i consider them like a very small step above the plants is because they're adding into an ecosystem somewhere and they're making more nutrient-dense food than plants generally are for humans yeah but that is an enormous issue as well i mean i i've been dealing with some feeding issues on the farm like trying to figure out one what's the most sustainable crop what's the most local crop where the most healthy species appropriate things and again it comes down to carrying capacity when you look at chickens and pigs a pig a wild pig wild pigs are have a huge problem here i have eight pigs and we're having to feed them over the course of six months about 6 000 pounds oh no sorry 12 000 pounds of grain to grow how do they do this in the wild you ask well they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of acres and so if you're growing food for humans you can't even like i could maybe have one or two pigs on my entire property i gotta eight if i have green i could have hundreds of pigs on my property and so it's just not a feasible thing to have either chickens or pigs on a property without external inputs grains etc and so sort of what you're left with to again when you're looking at what is good for the soil long term what is good for the biodiversity long term what is good for the waterways what's good for all this stuff generally speaking for the busted land worldwide that we have and this can be repeatable everywhere around the world there's ruminant animals so these are animals that go around eat things that humans cannot eat generally in places where we can't even grow plants to begin with and then their presence there rotating them around like how nature would have pushed them around with predators leads to reclamation of the busted ecosystem for every ruminant you bring on a property seven species minimum are thought to then re-enter and so a lot of people i mean there's a bison ranch here that's outside of texas called rome ranch and i've seen them now over the last five years just more and more action their entire property has changed into this oasis it was this dead land when they got it and i think they're like a year into it when i first started visiting there and now they're six years in and it's been five years since i've been there there are like countless species of birds that they hadn't seen before there's insects butterflies snakes beetles all these things even when we got our pigs here and again this is a system where again they're bringing infertility it's grain fed yes i i looked into when i first got them the first week i saw so many types of things that i had never seen in a property before beetles worms snakes etc around these animals like life begets life and this is the thing again when you're when you're planting these huge amount of crops and animals are meant to be in large herds plants are not meant to be in large amount of crops and so we can grow hundreds thousands of bison at a time hundreds thousands of ruminants they are herd animals they're meant to be in enormous pots and that brings ecological diversity it builds the soil carbon for every one percent of soil or soil organic matter that you add which again can only be done with animals can it only go as negative with any sort of plant material you do if you're growing vegetables that only soil organic matter goes down with animals that goes up and for every one percent per acre you store an additional 20 000 gallons of water and so you're storing more water which is again in texas we have this crazy drug going on right now i mean most of the u.s is in a crazy drought it's very important you restore the ecosystem you grow grass way more even if you pull a chicken tractor again this is not even ruminant stuff chicken tractor is something where you you pass your raised chickens in this little pen and you move it every day i've had friends i go see it and there's a very clear difference between where the chickens were and where the chickens weren't the grass is like five times higher in green the entire season where it's not it's basically a very little wasteland again where the animals are and this is the the problem is people have all these stats that they measured some methane from some cattle and said well methane stays in the atmosphere and there's greenhouse gas therefore the cattle is killing the entire planet and they haven't actually gone to the farm to see what it's like when a herd of cattle is managed appropriately is an ecological oasis and you don't get that from a factory that's producing impossible burgers like go there and see what sort of ecological diversity you have you have humans in in massive buildings

um we have a sister podcast green pill and it's hosted by my friend kevin owaki who's a big proponent of this meme called regenerative finance and it's all about making financial structures that are regenerative right they feed back into themselves there's a there's a loop of regeneration that allows for sustainability and inclusion and diversity in the participants and it's like this thing that he sees the pattern for hasn't yet been able to like meme this thing into existence but it's definitely working on it and when you tell me that there's this world of regenerative agriculture where we have these large ruminant animals that are in harmony with nature so we have the the yin and the yang you know the the animals in the soil uh and having the animals walk around and have biodiversity spawn in its wake uh it is like the sustainable agriculture side of things and there's the the this thing that i've been obsessed with in the world of crypto is i'm obsessed with cryptoculture and i think if we layer on regenerative finance we layer on like the ability for artists to create nfts and those nfts be able to have feedback loops inside of their own economies we get to spawn new culture because of all this new art that we're able to finance and we have this financial system that is regenerative that can create actual human culture in its wake right and like this culture works twice so culture you know arts performance of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively uh custom arts social institutions ex the word the word culture that people are familiar with it also means to maintain tissue cells bacteria organisms in conditions suitable for growth uh and so we have this world of regenerative cryptoeconomics regenerative finance trying to create human culture and make human culture more economically viable so we can have a flourishing of crypto culture and then we also have regenerative agriculture where we're trying to create a harmony with nature and we're trying to establish a a back and forth conversation between plants and animals to have a self-sustaining agricultural system that allows cultural diversity culture diversity in the wake of these like large ruminant animals to hopefully restore a lot of our broken ecology that we've created over the last 50 100 years um what one question i have anthony is in in as these animals you you talked about like the methane coming from from the feces of cows and but then in instead when we have like these large plants being um uh grown in this wake how much carbon is actually being sequestered as a result of these plants being grown is there any conversation to be had there yeah i mean a very basic study that was done just comparatively speaking between regenerative beef and impossible burgers so for every impossible burger made there's 4.5 pounds of carbon that goes into the atmosphere it's a carbon emitter for every pound of regenerative grass-fed beef that has grown 4.5 pounds of carbon goes into the soil and it's the only thing that has been shown again ruminant rotational grazing which is not the same thing as grass fat a lot of times grass fat actually is bastardized and it's just a bunch of cattle out think about the the 40 cattle on one big field but they're given alfalfa pellets and they're they they're our their ecosystem is artificially propped up so this regenerative thing is very important they have a diverse forage so they're eating diverse plants and they're being moved around in a species-appropriate way that mimics a natural ecosystem that's the only thing that's been shown to produce food that is equestrian carp sequestered carbon but even still like i think that i think people [Music] when they look at the sustainability regenerative extractive nature focus solely on carbon i think it's a it's a silly thing to get so single metric minded it's like looking at human health and assessing overall human health on calories in versus calories out that's insane it's one simple metric i think it's a terrible metric in isolation i think it's the more you you optimize for single metrics gdp is another one optimized for gdp nice it's all great yeah well does that tell you anything about how people are functioning in an economy right no of course not and the same thing with carbon and carbon dioxide gives you essentially no information about how the ecosystem's actually functioning or that the longevity of that ecosystem the predictive longevity of the ecosystem which is in my mind the most important thing again looking at the carrying capacity the predicted longevity is what i'm most curious at can we keep doing this yes or no and if we can sequester your carbon for the next 20 years but then the whole system breaks apart because we have too much carbon the guy was talking to this this venture capitalist he was raising all this money for this this green fund and he was all thrilled about their technologies one of them was he's like yeah um we have this company in australia that's doing this really cool thing they're they're creating these sensors that are pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and they're putting in the soil and they're making these little carbon rocks i was like what do you mean they're making these carbon rocks he's like yeah um so it crystallizes its carbon and puts it into the soil and it's not going to break down for like you know i think a hundred thousand years of what the estimation is okay so you you're just gonna pull carbon from the air make these carbon crystals and fill our soil which we need to grow things in with something that can't break down the field of carbon that can't break down for hundreds of thousands of years like this is the type of that happens when we look at it from carbon versus carbon out and it's a complex biological thing that when you try to simplify it just ruins the entire way that you appreciate and interact with the whole system and also it's just like to illustrate methane for example everyone thinks cattle are bad why because they burp in for and fart and why is that bad because it has methane and why is methane bad because it's a quote-unquote greenhouse gas but when you track methane it is part of a biogenic cycle and so the methane that the cattle excrete which i think it's absurd that people talk about living creatures emitting greenhouse gases it's insane that it gets reincorporated back into the soil and the water we need that methane to keep the whole thing going it's part of a living cycle it's not like we're taking it from one place like fossil fuels burning and going the atmosphere it's part of a thing that goes around and there also there used to be 75 million bison in this country hundreds of millions of antelope etc there are less cattle than there were bison before and we're saying that the less ruminant animals now have the methane that's the problem the problematic thing it's just these simplistic ways to view things without looking at in the entirety of the complexity which i don't think that i don't think we can put on a checklist it's it's not that easy which is again why coming back to solutions here the centralization like you talked about the executioner and the slaughterhouse killing thousands of animals a day that guy or girl has not even been to the fields where the animals are raised so why would they even care about the animal's life they're just pulling the trigger so the more that you can support people who are actually doing farming whether that is plant agriculture growing fruit growing vegetables growing animals i don't really care those people who are actually interacting with the land who are living on it and are responsible for maintaining that if you're doing that and you're actually that person the chances are extremely low that you are going to take poor care of that thing and and so again going there seeing for yourself what is this ecosystem like where is my food coming from i think this is a vote for resilience in literally where you live this is the thing too right how much of your food is coming from further than 45 miles away from you if it has to or if it does that is not a very resilient situation you found yourself in or if you want to extend it to 100 miles 200 miles whatever driving radius i was looking at different places to move and if you know we were gonna stay in austin or not when we were looking at farmland against some cities one of them was in this in the south charleston and there's basically no farms in like a 300 mile radius the entire city because it's all swampland and again i'm not like doomsday i don't really like i'm not a mad max sort of i don't hope for this stuff to happen but i just find that really weird that all of the food this entire city is consuming has to be coming from so far away right it's a dependency right and it's a dependency on something that you need to do every single day to stay alive which is scary three times a day typically yeah and yeah and people have zero idea this again it was the most important things for the for the tradesmen that i stayed with is finding food and it's the thing that people know least about how their world works and they're least connected with blows my mind right one thing you said about like oh yeah everyone hates cows because they like they fart out methane and they poop out poop and that also has methane and everyone everyone hates that because it contributes to greenhouse gases i think the reason why everyone hates it is is it because it's largely happening in a centralized paradigm where all of these cows are all in the same spot they're pooping in the same spot and all that poop isn't being put back into the soil and may i don't know what happens to the methane when it's all happening in one spot but i would imagine in a centralized paradigm all of that regenerative part of that cycle is not happening because we've centralized it too much so when people hate on like meat and red meat and cows because of their methane and their byproducts what they're actually hating on is the centralization of these things it would actually be the the argument here is that if we decentralized the the physical locations of large ruminant animals things go from evil to good things go from unsustainable to sustainable things go from the methane goes and turns into a greenhouse gas to being reintroduced part of part of the cycle is that a fair take yeah this is the biggest thing that people complain about when i talk about this stuff on online is especially the the people with vegan in their profile um to to proclaim to the world what they eat which is weird but they get very well we have this in crypto twitter it's like what chain are you a part of it's the same level of tribalism that's funny they get very mad because they say well there's this factory farming stuff and blah blah blah i should eat plants instead but again talking about my experience as a literal farmer doing the best i can in all these systems and researching the best i can do if you go from eating factory farmed meat to eating plants you're leaving out the eating the regenerative animal which is which is an option which is a total option for most people where they're at they can look up actually built their free resources go it's um near home just go to groundwork collective.com actually if you want to find we ported in like 2500 farms in the u.s that have regenerative standards to them there's other regenerative farm finders but 99 of people can drive within you know a couple hundred miles and find some form doing this it's yes it can be expensive for what it is right now but if you buy for a half or a whole cattle or split with friends it's actually much cheaper than even the commodity stuff that you can get the processed food the plants the feedlot beef if you go buy direct from your farmer and buy the whole animal and have that relationship they'll throw in stuff for free they'll give you discounts it's remarkable when you actually have a community and know the person that you're buying your food from and know where your food's grown how different it is and how much easier it actually becomes interesting now yeah imagine it's it's when it's a math problem of some forms of cattle require all these inputs all these external feeds uh all these you know external capital expenditures to maintain their livelihood versus the regenerative agriculture regenerative cattle model which is how do i make a plot of land where this cow and this land is just self-sustaining doesn't require any capital inputs that's the whole point of that whole model and so naturally i would imagine it would be cheaper um than than the alternative mechanism which is like okay i need to spend money to feed my cow yeah i i mean there's a thing too about it's interesting about animal agriculture versus plant agriculture especially when you talk about like doing things the quote-unquote right way if you're doing plant agriculture where you're doing no-till which means you're not devastating the soil so what happens with these mono crop fields is that every year once the the crop's done traction goes through cuts all the plant matter down and then scrapes and digs through the soil so they can plant again when you scrape through again i told you that soil is a living thing tons of all this microorganism when you scrape the green stuff off the top of that soil and you expose that soil to the sunlight and the uv light it kills all life all microbial life in the soil and basically kills the soil and then you plant back into that and so if you're doing production especially in a no what's called a no-till way which is what i recommend people look for if they're buying a lot of produce no-till which means they're just planting straight into the ground it's harder because you have to read all this stuff but it's a very linear input to output from from a human labor perspective so if i have one garden bed versus 10 garden beds that's 10 times the amount of work for me as a human if i have one cow or 10 cows or 100 cows it's the same amount of work there's it scales exponentially for labor so same thing with chickens like i have 20 chickens right now getting systems down all i have to do basically is give them some feed give them some water and take the eggs that same scale works from zero chickens to about 200 chickens of collecting the eggs and all that type of stuff so it takes about the same amount of time but if i quadrupled or 10x to my garden space that'd be 10x more time for me 10x more resources whereas the animals it's all exponential which is a very interesting thing because it's more feasible in my mind one thing you said that i have a question on is just how sustainable is this when we talk about just like a geographic area question where you talked about you how it's uh you had like these pigs and they they require acres and acres and acres of land space in order to be sustainable uh if we scale this model of sustainable regenerative agriculture out to the whole entire population of 8 billion people do we have enough physical area on this planet to sustain the entire population using this model well this is where i think it comes back to what i'm excited about is we don't really know and i think we're starting to figure out really interesting things so for example the carrying capacity thing we currently see cattle as you know in some places it's like one animal unit is what you call cattle per acre we're finding out that if you do it in the region that's been known for all of like animal husbandry time turns out if you do rotational grazing in some places you can forward it 6x that we didn't know about that and so using old calculations maybe we're like oh yeah we're screwed but we're starting to find out these new models in different regions that are really interesting and i would say even if we can't it's worth trying to figure it out because again look at this soft landing thing if we can only feed four billion people in a regenerative sustainable way that's going to be much better than if we say oh screw it we can't feed those people and we can only feed you know 500 million people eventually because we collapsed our entire ecosystem and sort of like if you i'm not even convinced right now that we have enough clean water for the world to drink clean water and not to get sick on does that mean that we shouldn't try to still drink clean water and to improve the capacity of filtered water no let's continue to do that uh and so i i i don't think about the the scalability of it per se i think about how can you with context replicate what you're doing in one place and another place because this is the thing about nature you need humans you you can't offload this stuff to machines you need humans a living thing to be in a living ecosystem to sense what is this need how do we respond how do we interact and stuff it's not it's an art and that may differ from my plot of land i mean it does differ i have friends all around here are farmers five minutes this way 15 minutes that way they all have completely different land completely different needs completely different animals that close it changes and so you're not telling like here versus another country another continent man we're going to have very different approaches but the principles still mean are maintained how do we start having this look like a normal ecosystem we've hunted all the megafauna off the planet basically so we don't have any perspective on what it should look like when i was in africa visiting this tribe we went to some of these game parks it's very clear to me oh this is what it actually should be looking like we have this immense cornucopia of living things large and small that are inhabit you know habitating this entire area that live in harmony together like that's what we need to be doing like this guy west jackson writes a lot about this he's old now but doing some really interesting stuff his concept of nature as measure but now like we've essentially destroyed all areas where we should look at be like that's what we should aim for it's really hard to imagine what nature should look like because we've turned it all into you know a zone of extraction for humans uh but but yeah i think it's incorporating animals increasing biodiversity increasing soil soil microbiol biological activity increasing water quality increasing water holding capacity sure sequestering carbon like there's a variety of things that you could probably make some sort of judgment call on just like what i think for humans like there's a bunch of different measures you can look at by the end of the day you can have everything on paper when you look at somebody you can tell something's not this person does not look healthy you know their skin's a little weird they're you know something's wrong with their energy or whatever like you you have this intuitive sense this person is not healthy this person's not a healthy organism the same thing happens when you're on land which is why i want people to actually go to the farms and see it because when you see it you go oh it's sort of like um sort of like porn you know like you you know when you see it there's not like a that's hard landline the same thing with ecological health the same thing um okay so let's let's talk about scaling scaling this out to the whole world you just labeled out a bunch of principles is it as simple as getting as all these as many farmers as we can to start operating their farm under these principles of you know increasing uh you know the wa the uh i can't remember the term like how much water a land can hold increasing the biodiversity um et cetera et cetera is is the formula for producing a world that is sustainable and regenerative as simple as getting all these farmers to fall on the same i'll follow along on these same regenerative principles or is there like a more coherent like direct strategy for scaling this whole like revolution out to the whole world yeah this is where i think it's interesting i heard this guy um frederick lawal talk about it he's this belgian food scientist guy and he made a really good point that changed my mind i used to think that it's like all you know ground groundwork bottom-up sort of thing grassroots like everyone every man for himself got to figure it out he made a good point though that sort of top-down centralized things are not always bad in this case like having some sort of for like communication or organization level at top where people can share learnings and figure it out and be like hey these are the general things that we're finding are working here now you try it there and some sort of system i think would be helpful again it's not going to be able to be like hey what worked for me in central texas is going to work for you in mozambique or in costa rica or in india like it does not work that way again i told you somebody five minutes away their land's completely different like how the hell could it work for somebody across the world and so i think it's about getting people back on land and actually being intentional about this stuff which i think is the most you know the most important thing we need to solve is land access and i don't mean to be the guy kind of encrypted podcast talking about how blockchain is going to save the world but i think that there's there are models there that i think as land prices go up most people who want to get into farming can't afford land so how do you do but a lot of people want to support it and want to be part of it and interact and have like have ownership in their food system and i think some sort of shared like fractionalization of ownership of land needs to happen to have more people get back on land bill gates is now the largest farmland owner in the united states that's an enormous problem do you think that he owns all that land because of he understands a little bit of what we're talking about here and all of a sudden like knows that land will be super scarce in the future man you know like we could go down the conspiracy rabbit hole bill gates all day long but microchips and the whole thing but at the end of the day i don't know but i i get the sense that it's not good for the average joe who cares about their their food system like if some billionaire owns tens of millions of acres in his underground lair i can't go interact with that the person like you you need the person there who's doing the thing right you know regardless of what it is and so to have somebody own that much land is terrible let's talk about centralization having one person remotely own that much land you can't give a about the land that you own if you don't interact with it ever right right anthony what advice do you have for the listener what what do we need to do um so like let's start from like the easiest actionable advice which is what food can people buy that doesn't interrupt their like day-to-day behaviors because if it does they're not going to do it so like what's the easiest lowest hanging fruit that people need to do to help be a part of this movement yeah so it's i think about like what you not do and what should you do and what you should not do is buy anything with the seed oil in it again for the ramifications can we define seed oils and seeds like let's make that super obvious any oil that doesn't come from a large fruit that you can actually squeeze fat out of so with avocados olives palm coconut these are things that you can squeeze fat otter like you can literally squeeze in fat come out seed oils are just growing these seeds and massive amount of crops that we talked about earlier and we press these seeds and have to use harsh chemicals and high heat and all this weird machinery to extract the stuff out of it then we deodorize it so you can't tell it's rancid um but the things that you'll probably see here soybean safflower sunflower corn cottonseed canola rapeseed grape seed rice bran peanut are some examples of seed oils they're in literally everything they're 99 of restaurant foods again they're completely destructive to the planet they're awful for human health i actually think the more that i thought about going through the arc of perfect keto and all the work we did there and working with thousands of people i think that most insulin resistance and carbohydrate intolerance actually comes from exposure to seed oils that break your mitochondria which don't allow you to process carbohydrates effectively because there are so many people that stopped eating carbs felt really good even introduced real food carbs still couldn't handle it i mean this doesn't make any sense and then we started playing around with seed oils and like cleaning up the fat in their diet finely corrected so if there's one that you shouldn't do it's eat these things they once you consume them they stay in your body for two years because they embed in your nervous tissue and your cell membranes and then they auto oxidize so they create inflammation in your body for up to two years after you eat them so if you eat chips that were cooked in soybean oil or whatever or you eat a restaurant meal and again 99 of all restaurant food is cooked with this stuff insane that meal because of the margins because of the margins because no one can tell it's in there because it's a flavorless thing yeah that meal lives in you and causes inflammation for two years which is absurd so there's one thing you should not do it's cons it's that and then refined carbs so i think you're stuck into that but what you the easiest thing to just to do to not even think about what should i avoid is just buy as much local food as possible have a relationship with the farmer go to the farmers market go to that website i said earlier groundwork collective.com use a farm finder or whatever farm farmer you want go visit a farm because no farmer anywhere can make a seed oil like you you're not going to go to a farmers market and see a bottle of like artisanal canola oil it's it's impossibility so it just filters out everything and you go okay great i can know where my food comes i'm gonna have a relationship with the person who's grown my food like that's to in my mind solves 95 of any worry about what what should i eat how much should i eat whatever like it'll give you seasonal foods it'll put you into ketosis in the winter likely like you'll get some swings in and out of carbs versus not carbs protein levels or not and i think it's like a really easy way to think about nutrition that's really really really good advice um yeah go to the farmer's market establish a relationship with a local farmer who uh you know fits the rule of a farm that is perhaps close enough that you could eventually walk to if you had to walk really really really far um and uh there's also the conversation of like uh sunburning in seed oils this is kind of a meme on crypto twitter uh can you can you walk walk us through like the relationship between sunburns and seed yeah so what happens again i told you that it the seed oils embed into your tissues so they also embed you know heavily into your skin and also the vast majority of skin care products especially that women use have these seed oils in them which is really crazy and ironic especially sunscreens because you're putting on this thing that has this highly oxidizable and highly damaged by uv fat on your skin so then you have this thing on your skin and your skin's made of this thing that gets highly damaged in the sun and so there's a lot of anecdotal stuff about people cutting out seed oils and still having um you know having a massive reduction in in the incidence of sun sensitivity and sunburns i'm there's a lot of egregious examples where people say like if you cut out seed oils you're not going to burn and i think that's insane i think if you live in canada and they're inside for the year and then go on a trip to cancun i don't care if you don't eat seed oils you're going to burn because there's no great exposure to the sun and your body needs to build that melanin to have you know you need graded exposure but yeah it seems to you know when you take a take away the thing that destroys the skin and literally destroys the dna my hypothesis and a lot of people have done really great work on this uh the the dots between seed oil consumption and skin cancer prevalence are insane and so you don't think people summer you know had skin burns sunburns in the past of course they did we also didn't have sunscreen and so now we have this massive amount of sunscreen but our skin cancer rate is going through through the roof it matches almost exactly it looks like cigarettes in lung cancer it's a very similar chart and the same thing looks with obesity and heart disease and diabetes and skin cancer and seed oils not to say like we know exactly all the mechanisms but you know i think that we'll elucidate it eventually and it'll be a primary driver uh but it looks very close so get those damn things on your diet this is definitely something i can speak from experience on where uh you know years and years ago before i went down this path of just like understanding nutrition would super burn super super hard uh and in the last few years uh in the last two years i'd say there's been a number of times where i've been out in the sun far too long and i'm gonna be i'm always thinking like oh man i'm gonna really regret this tomorrow and i wake up the next day and i'm not that bad not bad at all uh and it is a it feels like a superpower honestly it's like oh i can last in the sun um the the other the other reason why like uh some people burn another stone as you've alluded to it is you know hunter gatherers generally were far more ex skin exposed than humans are so like you know we hide indoors from for nine months out of the year until we wait for it to be like 85 plus and then we rip off all of our clothes and go to the beach without having any sun exposure for the last like nine months and then we burn right like the the so like you you combine like a lifestyle that doesn't have any seed oils with a lifestyle that puts skin on your sun on your skin light as much as possible throughout like the whole entire course of the year and all of a sudden like your sun immunity your sun resistance is super super high and you also have a nice golden glow um so this has been the lifestyle i've been trying to live for the last few years or so i think it's smart yeah anthony is there any other tips tricks or tips or advice that that we should all be following here i think it's that that local living you know like how can you be part of a community and how can you live locally i think is the antidote to many of our modern problems when it comes to you know i said i was digging into emotional health spiritual health ecological health i think all of those things tie back to us again not being in a real natural state in a union with our environment and that environment includes like how are you showing it for the people who live around you do you know your neighbors do you actually have a real community or is it just a bunch of friends that you have in a city like like like-minded people you know how much are you actually engaged with the people around you versus just ordering stuff on amazon like do you support your local businesses do you buy from your local farm do you know where your stuff comes from do you have any skills you can offer people in the real world instead of just typing away the keyboard for strangers on the internet these are the things i think are important that actually when i see people adopt them you know people can master their nutrition and they go oh i still have these chronic diseases i still have this depression i still have this anxiety are you going outside do you interact with nature at all do you move your body through space these things just seem very basic when you think about it but when you look at an average person especially who lives in a city they never had this sort of connection with their natural environment because their natural environment is shrouded from them because they live in this concrete jungle so it's it means it's really hard to do and i'm not trying to tell people everyone needs to live in a farm like me but you you can do it in small steps and just try to live more locally which again if if and when things get get tough again i mean you saw people who did this covet times pretty resilient and did pretty well and people who didn't was fragile it was scary it's a lot of fear anxiety certainly certainly well anthony that that lesson is definitely one of the reasons why i wanted to pull you on this show because the what we say on bankless frequently is like if you fix the financial system you fix so much that's based on the financial system and quite a large part of the world is based on top of the financial system i would say most of it um but food also literally the whole entire world is based on the food system and the food system has so much more than just food production and it also has just values values and ethos and sustainability and just like community all based in mind and so uh i think together if we can fix the financial system and if we can fix the food system with some of the strategies that you've brought to the table here i think we have um a fantastic world ahead of us uh it's doesn't sound like it's easy but good things are never easy uh and i think the first step of achieving that world is like we always say on bank lists tell stories about it uh so thank you for coming on to the show and and helping me tell the story yeah i have one question for you sure how do we if we take down the financial system or rework it or whatever how do we get away from this world where we have these corporations extracting all that's profit and thus not having the incentive to actually take care of the human population like what how do you imagine a reworked financial system incentivize properly for the food system if any yeah um that's a that's a big question i i think uh uh it doesn't necessarily have to do with the food aspect of it but baitin that question is how do we just prevent the recentralization of capital and money and finance back to look exactly like something that we already came from like how do we prevent that the centralization of of resources and capital um but my answer for that would be we have this cool brand new invention called private keys which really disrupts equilibrium in a way that we have never seen before um and so we have this this meme in the web three space where we have this system that can like distribute ownership to the individuals uh and so like there's this like meme of uber uber on the blockchain uber actually did try to give its uber drivers equity um but they were hamstrung by regulation and and just like a system that didn't support that kind of strategy with private keys we have ways for these dows defy apps we'll call it whatever you want to call it to put ownership straight into the hands of somebody with a private key and not have to go through a payment network like visa not have to go through a commercial bank like wells fargo and there's and doesn't have to ask for permission from a from a regulation standpoint and so the real like in the same way that you talk about getting closer to your food we can also have people getting closer to these institutions that own capital uh and these institutions that own capital you know used to be built in the meat space you know nation-state regulation built on you know lawyer pen and paper contracts but in the ethereum world they're built on code uh and they're inherently community oriented and there is no middlemen that separate the ownership and the asset being owned uh and so how like that that is in my mind this thing that it has sustainable a new sustainable equilibrium because we have a bankless financial system that is a direct relationship to community to you know community ownership to the actual community like there is no like uh mediator between this relationship uh and so as it would relate to food production i would hope to extend the same pattern of like you were talking about how do we divvy up land uh and but and have it you know fractionalized so people can own this plot of land and maybe that's their source of food there's something there in this pattern where we have a more direct relationship between ownership and the same way that we have a more direct relationship with our food production it's a little bit like you know step one invent a blockchain step one uh uh put private keys into everyone or step two put private keys into everyone else's hands uh you know step three inform everyone about sustainable regenerative agriculture step four question mark question mark question mark step five have a regenerative financial ecosystem that is paired with a blockchain i don't know about step four i think it would take a lot of time and experiment experimentation and iteration and innovation um but i i you know question mark it'll it'll just happen question mark i don't know yeah i think i think it's a little bit past the headlights but i'm excited for it certainly anthony uh it's an honor having you on the podcast thank you so much for i think being making one of the most informative podcasts i've ever made on the show well thanks ben it's it's fun to to speak to audiences that maybe are not primed to a lot of stuff that i typically talk about because i go on you know health wellness nutrition podcasts all the time i think it's same stuff people hear but yeah i'm just curious what people are the feedback's gonna be like so if anybody has any questions feel free to reach out to me directly twitter dm instagram dm and i try to answer as many as possible and happy to help anybody along the way i am of service to you awesome we will get after this show i'm about to ask you what resources you want us to put in the show notes uh so listeners anthony's answer will be in the show notes it'll be his twitter some of the websites he's mentioned and some other things uh anthony on that note of a new community i think like i said the parallels between like money finance crypto decentralization anti-fragility i really think that helped that will help it land with a lot of people uh and hopefully point a lot of new people to this very very important cause thanks man i appreciate it hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did
