hey guys this is called a debrief episode it's an episode that David and I record right after the podcast this one was delayed by a few days I think it took us a while to to catch up after the episode with World coin but we wanted to release this on the public feed so everyone has access to it and you can see our thoughts coming out of the conversation with World coin uh usually this debrief is available only for bankless Citizens available on the bankless premium RSS feed but today we are releasing it publicly so we hope you enjoy this should give you some insight into the conversation we just had with worldcoin thanks a lot hey guys welcome to the debrief after the episode that I wasn't on with worldcoin Sam Altman the cool thing about debrief since it doesn't matter okay tell me about it uh we had on Sam Altman and Alex bologna of worldcoin um first time Sam Altman's been on the show um first time Alex has been on the show um and so yeah uh it was uh so you weren't there so I have to tell you about what the what the episode was you guys recorded on Mother's Day I couldn't be there oh that's right that's right there it was also it was also a Sunday and I don't think yeah would it out anyway yeah um so it was it was just a straightforward uh ooh we'll download on world coin okay so for people who had never heard about Work World coin before this would be a great episode for them talked a little bit about like the drama about world coins launch which we actually had uh not like uh it wasn't like how we had to uh play in the we had like a quick story about the the world coin launch way back when because they were gonna come on the show uh and then their PR Company canceled because you sent out the Tweet what the [ __ ] is going on with worldcoin and the PR Company thought it was hella hostile so we're out yeah you don't remember did you guys bring that up uh not in the recording but afterwards yes and Alex was like oh yeah we fired those people for like long ago like they were terrible and I'm like thank you that's so stupid man uh I like okay so that put a bad taste in my mouth when that happened and that's not the only two times that's happened actually besides like maybe um I won't count Charles um from cardano but uh Gavin wood okay right yeah polka dots scheduled yeah uh we're like hey couldn't and then um could Gavin come to the podcast haven't explored the polka dot ecosystem and then like I think maybe a few days before uh really close yeah the the comms lead at polka dot reached out and was like Hey I you know we went back through some of your previous tweets like years ago and like we don't like what you I mean and Gavin's not going to come in the podcast so we should cancel this and try to substitute someone else at polka dot in in the podcast and I think I asked for like what the fending offending tweets were and they were so tame there was a week it was just so tame like um anyway that kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth when projects do that but uh yeah I guess they're they're saying so I'm giving I'm Giving World it was a PR firm it was an imperial company and I knew that it was we knew that it was because like when the PR Company like canceled on the show originally on us that I went to Alex just straight on Twitter and it's like hey [ __ ] your PR Company like you need to you're getting worldcoin is getting the absolute [ __ ] slammed on them right now like the backing away from like the public Spotlight is this is not the right time everyone is asking the questions that we would ask you on a podcast yeah and I and so I said I basically said that to Alex and DMs like you need to ignore your PR Company just come on um mainly hey that was very valid and real and authentic advice and B I also did not want to emergency find another another good guest he just like he he didn't he didn't go for it anyways uh the cool trivia about that episode is the episode that came out of that was Ultra scalable ethereum which turned out to be an absolute Banger oh the one that we did last minute yes yeah across the agenda yeah exactly yeah um anyway so that was the precursor to this whole story so finally well I like hey that was like that had to be over a year ago that's a long time ago um now World coin is still still around still building um has won some hearts and Minds to have joined the team and support the effort um mainly people I respect uh DC Builder I don't know if you know that name floating around on crypto Twitter um this is not DC investor not DC investor DC Builder um uh this is uh zero knowledge cryptography researcher guy um yeah everyone generally trusts and appreciates in the space he joined World coin a few other people joined World coin optimism and World coin are collaborating on op mainnet op stack stuff um I think they still have a major uphill battle so I am about what Okay so let me just say two things about this one is I am very excited to listen to this episode actually and thankless listeners should know I'm coming in the debrief not having listened to the episode so you guys are at an advantage to me so um we actually are recording this because uh schedules David was in uh zizalu and just schedules uh permitting we're recording this I think like Weeks Later really uh this debrief but I still haven't listened to the episode and I am excited to listen to it and I intend to go into this episode with an open mind I also don't think it will answer all of my questions I think it'll be like too high level it'll be a high level all right 60 minutes yeah it'll open up the door for other questions and I think one of my big questions is around sort of probably the privacy of this network probably like how decentralized really is it like how public goodsy is it how values aligned is it I'm actually not sure what series of questions this will um completely unlock but I guess I don't want to hear a VC marketing machine tell me these things I want to hear like independent Community like representatives in that people that I respect in privacy into centralization uh talk about these things so but I guess so that's one part of it the other part I would say I think that they are just it's just hard I mean I said this on the roll-up last week David but like the crypto Bros want to orb you right and like it's not great I mean to what to catch your identity and who's to be who's behind it it's the guy who's building the most powerful AI in the world Sam Altman and like I don't know that's an uphill marketing battle I think and like maybe it should be it's a very if if you're going to do something of this type of magnitude and make these types of vision commitments then I think like you owe the world um a commensurate level of uh transparency auditability um openness like that's a pretty high bar to me and they say all that stuff is on their roadmap um they say uh and I'm a trusting individual I tend to believe them um I think like there are some projects out there that are very in the crypto world that are very like beloved um like get coin comes to mind uh protocol Guild optimism I would say has some of this world coin has like the opposite of that it's like oh whatever is the opposite of beloved I don't know but it's like it's easy to hate World coin just by the nature of what it is which is like if you trust real coin and believe World corn then it's like totally unfair because they're doing the same thing it's just like yeah we're trying to but you just said so you just said David you're trusted you're trusting individual why are you trusting individual after all the [ __ ] we've gone through in crypto like why why would you trust anybody in this space to do any like this is a trusting individual before crypto first off and so it hasn't encrypted interesting individual my disposition is Jaded you hasn't hasn't crypto kind of like um shown you but to be less stressing in some cases particularly when you have sort of the setup of large VC allocation a coin super ambitious kind of promises lots of ways to cut Corners like I'm not saying worldcoin could be fantastic I I have no idea but I'm just saying the pattern fits many patterns we've seen in the past of like this not working out very well and I think that's what that's what the um the white blood cells the immune system of crypto is just kind of like indiscriminately attacking and I think if you want to get more precise in the white blood cells you really have to go dive deep most people don't have time to do that including myself honestly it's like I'm gonna be relying on third-party privacy researchers people in the crypto Community I trust I'm going to do a little like I'm going to be able to do levels of due diligence but I can't vet this thing from the ground up anyway the the this um distrust like why should we why should we trust what they say at all like why shouldn't we default posture to like oh this is a bunch of [ __ ] and then you know work our way out of that so I well I'm not going to make the case for why one should trust worldcoin but I will make the argument for let's see I'm not okay let me say that sorry that again I'm not saying that you should trust worldcoin but here is the argument for like why it why you could why why there there are some green flags here that are different from like all of the 2022 like mess that we don't want to go back to um one is like the idea if you accept that the idea that um biometric scanning is the most civil resistant mechanism to produce proof of humanity then then you get something like the orb and so you can start to like Cast Away the negative connotation that Iris scanning and the orb has which is like a very source of like distrust it's just like the whole Aesthetics of the whole thing so you have so you can like try and shave that from your brain then there's like okay VC like allocation uh serializing humans like all all that kind of stuff uh evil like say like do you trust Sam Altman like maybe maybe like what does Sam Altman have in it that like uh three hours capital or do Quan or SPF he just doesn't fit those types and neither does Alex blania right like maybe if Alex Blaney was loud on Twitter and and they're not populous yeah that's right yeah exactly yeah so there's not that right there's not it doesn't seem like a get rich quick scheme they actually have a roadmap to produce something uniquely valuable and unique in of itself to crypto um I I don't think it maps on to like the whole like uh things that we should snap onto like a VC coin VC alternative layer one that we've seen so many times I know it's not actually an alternative layer one so that alone makes it kind of different but you know we've seen many um just ridiculously funded yeah alternative layer ones that kind of like go liquid and then you just sort of get this feeling and and kind of seeing the data that the VCS just dump on you once it once it gets into the market uh and they don't really go anywhere they don't have product Market fit it just feels like corporate top down it doesn't feel organic there's no Builders there's no community and so I guess the where that usually turns into is not an outright scam but just like I don't know exit you become exit liquidity in some cases for VCS and then it becomes sort of a zombie chain which is not like the worst outcome that's not like a SPF FTX style outcome or a lunaterra outcome but it's still not a um is not a great outcome and so like it's it is heavily VC weighted there's there's two things that there's two ways to approach like VC waiting there are like the easy like yo let's Fork ethereum Fork the evm which the ethereum researchers have been building for like almost a decade now more than a decade now uh and then like let's raise on it and then like keep all the tokens for ourselves and dump on the followers so like get other people to do the lift work pump the token ourselves with our VC marketing dollars and then dump so like not much work a lot of upside so the world coin project is a ton of work is a ton of words it's not like a fork it's not like a metoo of something like the VC raise the amount the VC dollars are legitimate because there's no way that they could get the orb mass produced in a way that other people can produce the orb and they there's no way that they could get people to scan other eyeballs like that aren't in the world coin in like um aren't worldcoin employees like that whole lift side of things requires VC dollars it's very legitimate use of a capital raise and then like the whole like so so that that just checks out to me like you need VC money so it still doesn't fit the mold of a typical VC exit scan kind of thing and I I put scam in quotations because it's usually just ghost chain low product Market fit where you become exit liquidity if you if you buy this particular token but you don't have to right and also it's not even the point of worldcoin isn't even the token like that's one of three points what are the three points uh proof of human Hood the the coin and I'm missing one maybe maybe just two I feel like there's there's World ID there's the world app which I think is pretty solid to World ID it's like yeah it's the wallet your authentication but I guess that's pretty similar to World ID this is built on a layer too right so right now they're deploying on op mainnet and eventually they will make uh op stack trade and so this will be their own sort of will be like a layer three type train or it'll be an independent Ops to actually independent op stack change which in theory like fits into the optimism super chain model I mean that's kind of cool right yeah I I guess um so like as an OP stack chain the app that this so it's like an app specific chain and what does that app specific chain do it provides proof of human Hood the world coin way okay to the op super chain which is eventually just a theory and by the way the the reason I'm coming in a little like hotter in this is because I think this this is how the white blood cells these are the questions yeah I guess maybe the the last we don't have necessarily full satisfactory answers on on what you just raised already but um I think you are offers offering some valid points of how this kind of breaks the pattern typical pattern we've seen that's all I'm doing right now and I think that's what the crypto Community is doing pattern recognition Mission but there's there's this third kind of negative pattern that I think people see and that is the figure of Sam Altman which is like all right Tech bro I I put him in quotations billionaire I don't even know if he's a billionaire I I heard him go in front of billionaire okay so but he went in quacks like one in Congress I mean he has no equity in open AI like I I just don't even know how this works yeah he has no equity in open AI I think that that you can't necessarily take that at face value because like he could have no equity open Ai and then open aai could get liquidity and then he could get like a billion dollar okay okay open AI so there's like roundabout ways where that doesn't really matter he feels like the Mark Zuckerberg of the 2020s in that he is um he has created this technology that is clearly going to change everything about the fabric of the way humans organize and uh interact in open AI right and so he is sort of this and now we're at um a phase I think in in the world where like Tech Bros from Silicon Valley are like all kind of grouped into this um parasitic extractor type of motif and um some people might think that's fair some people might think that's unfair I think the majority of society though just doesn't trust that sort of individual at this point in time sure uh and so I guess a question to you is like or maybe just just a question to mull over is like is this guy legit or is this guy going to be like somewhat evil or somewhat influenced by uh moloch traps and all of the things that we've seen Tech billionaires get influenced by and leading to you like bad outcomes for society I guess the question is can you really trust Sam Altman is what it comes down to so yeah the archetype of like the web 2 extractor the Zuck web 2 idea like I'm reminded of the um this quote from um Sam Harris where he was um talking about how everyone is like they are no fewer people and like there's a modern movement to ignore expertise just like oh experts are wrong they're all they're all wrong like experts like told you to wear masks and they're wrong and so he was throwing a flag at that whole like movement that's going on in the anti-intellectualism so yeah exactly okay and he's like the way that Society progresses is like there are experts and then they say things and then we prove those experts wrong that's how Society moves forward but who actually proves experts wrong other experts yeah like more experts not the masses and so like in the to carry over this analogy Zuckerberg is the old expert Sam Altman who knows if he's a better newer expert who proves the old archetype wrong but as me as a trusting individual I would like to leave that door open that the way through that that bad branding for Tech Pro VC Tech Pro founder innovator type is actually we find one that like does good for the world like who fixes the problems like it's not going to be like the average Joe that solves proof of humanity proof of human Hood in the AI world it's going to be a VC Tech Pro that's why he's a VC Tech bro because that's how you solve these problems and what was your impression of him during the conversation I'm slowly liking him more and more and more why what do you like about him um seems authentic he seems nice he seemed he's he's not um running away from the alignment problem um I mean I think so if he if he is uh good in the front and then bad in the back he is a world-class sociopath what does the um the AI safety Community think about this guy I mean I know I don't know Caskey is like burned down all the gpus like yeah he's an extremist okay but I'm surprised that AI safety hmm I haven't really seen AI safety and Alignment groups come out in like torch open AI or Sam Altman very publicly anyone right they don't haven't touched anyone is that is that sort of happening or do is there the general impression in AI alignment communities that um hey while open AI is not perfect um they've done a fairly good job so far and they're not um completely ignoring safety uh they're still trying to remain competitive I think they're trying to do the open AI has an alignment um division inside of them and apparently contribute to this world well there's another factor of why people are scared and that's just because these Tech billionaires are so powerful these days it's like how how powerful is Mark Zuckerberg at this point how powerful is the uh individual who is masterminding open AI right and that now you're doing decentralized identity as well you're doing World coin as well uh I think that that a nurse people um one thing I'd say though because this has been somewhat you know me throw it lobbying grenades and criticisms what is the alternative to decentralized Identity yeah like that is the threshold to cross is like um basically what we're going to be left with is some sort of nation-state digital identity right and that's all we have I mean India has already has that deployed now and that is completely centralized now um You Might argue well that's um you know this is the uh uh probably the Roman Gray argument that well yeah of course decentralized identity it's great it's you know Democratic nation-state sort of uh proposing this and putting this forward and so that that's a great thing but that is definitely centralized technology and I I do think that is the only viable alternative that we've seen for all of the decentralized identity experiments in crypto so far none of them have really taken off so as long as this thing is better than that or different enough than that it feels like a worthwhile experiment to to keep running like what's the down side I guess would be my question that's where I go back to like the claim that biometric scanning is the best form of civil resistance if that I don't know there's probably some measure of Truth or falsity to that but still it's biometric there's a reason why we do biometric scanning [Music] um so turning biometric scanning into proof of human Hood I think is a noble Endeavor and so that is why I am categorizing myself as a world coin apologist wait you'd say a world coin apologist yeah so that like apologist means like you're fighting for World coin like you are evangelizing for World coin you are sort of making the arguments I'm just saying that like the world the existence of worldcoin is not the thing to be upset about I guess my take is um and this might be a more moderate take I'm just open-minded um I think that sometimes the crypto white blood cells attack too hard and um just and Destroy things without like without good reason and so I am pretty open-minded about this one and excited to see how it plays out uh when are you gonna get orb David all right like well I'm not getting orbed if you're an apologist though you have to get orbed at some point I will get orbed when I need to do something that requires me getting what's the benefit of getting orbed anyway is it just you get it yeah you get World coins sooner you get a distribution of world coins and that the idea is that world coins like any crypto token appreciate in value over time in certainly yes Sam Holman actually talked about that on the podcast like explicitly like yeah yeah well I don't never go up like so like the interesting thing you think about world coin is that like not only is this a currency that might be Goose but it might also be like um uh a graph for like things like airdrops or distributions so if if World coin as a distribution um mechanism becomes legitimately decentralized and distributed to humans equally all over the planet then it becomes a very good like uh graph to distribute other things to remember remember you read bill bowder's book um red notice yeah yeah so like there's a big problem when the Soviet Russia went from communist to capitalists like how did they distribute the equity of the companies of the to the to the people of Russia and so they gave out like these vouchers things and to to people like if there was World coin they would have just been airdropped here's the equity of the company to the citizens of of Russia right it's just like a it's a legitimate mapping of equity and capital as as far as like the most legitimately distributed asset of all time is the thesis that they're going after by World coin why are they calling this thing World coin it's just I don't know I don't I don't know all right well open-minded uh and then when's this thing launching did you did you find that out uh they do not have a republic date yet okay well I I do know that um is like rolls out it does it's not like one thing that launches it rolls out over time do you know uh our editor um Luke of bankless newsletter he got orbed actually on Thursday New York City La Lua yeah Luma got orbs yeah he went to offices and uh got orbed as a test no [ __ ] yeah so I haven't debriefed with him is it gonna be like the what's that Dr Seuss book star bellies niches or whatever orbs if you're or if you're not yeah have you been orbed or not yeah yeah um I just I feel like they could have done something different in the marketing but maybe there's no other way I World coin that's what I was thinking about like okay so if you once you commit to the biometric scanning thesis like then you then you conclude this is like outside of of just crypto stuff then you conclude that irises are the most legitimate um like biometric scanning technology so you are scanning irises if you believe in biometric scanning you believe in scanning Iris so you're saying there's no way for that how do you how do you make a thing that is mass producible so that we can capture eight billion irises like what shape do you put that in you just wanted to be a box because the Box isn't much better like do you want to like dress it up like a teddy bear because that's kind of worse like how do you do it how do you do it in a way that doesn't make people squirm it's not possible maybe could you do that all right yeah it's probably not possible if you have to have an independent hardware device you can't like create an app for it or something like this right yeah well you know what once we make it once you make its own device you have to cut it has to be custom it can't look like anything else like what how do you do it I still think Chrome orb is like as good as idea idea as anything I still think that even though this is very well funded given the names and given kind of the the ambition as well it kind of should be um I still think that the most likely scenario of a product like this is it doesn't reach product Market fit right and I just say that because that's generally what happens with startups this is the startup phase and so maybe um I I think a few things to watch is like how's traction going um is it able to resist civil attacks or not that's a huge one question um what's you know I guess how many new IDs are they getting over time um it's stuff like that I think that the big question is because like Sam Altman is doing this because the world of AI is coming and so I think without the world of AI because you need to prove who the humans are on the internet yeah uh and so like World coin without AI I don't think is has much legs like I think Sam Altman is going to simultaneously produce the need for World coin using open Ai and that has actually been his plan all along he's like first I'm gonna make openai and then there's gonna be AIS everywhere oh then we're gonna need to figure out who the humans are so I'm also gonna make this world coin thing and also the solution I mean you can you can see how this gets very uh the good business model yeah anyway to be determined we'll see I um it would definitely be great to have Sam on the podcast again and talk about um AI stuff as well but I'm sure we'll get into that some future he's gonna owe the world a handful of conversations while bankless Nation let us know what you think of worldcoin and this conversation as always we appreciate you being bankless citizen thanks a lot
