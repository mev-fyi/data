the stablecoin wars finance did a thing this week they have stopped supporting usdc essentially they have converted all of the usdc funds over to their own stablecoin which is called busd this is the binance stablecoin yeah and it's actually not just uscc it's also pax dollar and true usd so if you had uscc or pax or true usd deposited into binance congrats you now own busc instead a different stable coin a different stable coin and actually there are some huge proponents of this saying it's actually really a really good move mainly because you can actually still withdraw uscc it's basically making all dollars on binance homogeneous which is actually a good move
