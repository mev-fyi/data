roll ups are tight meritocracy is tight and i'm thankful for vcs all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on everything that happened last week in the bankless world uh as always they're gonna be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to shout out our sponsor opolis opolis is a dow type co-op employment thing that offers payroll health insurance and membership perks it really plays into the web3 future of work that we always talk about and also there's a bonus 1 000 work tokens and a thousand bank tokens when you enroll by the end of the year so that's cool uh check it out at bangladesh okay so i have some catching up to do so we're gonna try to breeze through uh some of these things but first uh chris john carlo aka crypto dad came on the podcast he's the former cftc chair and i think i love the cftc uh we had another former chair on a couple weeks ago brian quintenz if you remember and that was an awesome episode too um these guys get some really important things right they have a big picture view of our institutions what works about them what doesn't work and what we can do to improve them we have a massive financial market infrastructure a massive financial industry infrastructure that is very close with its regulators as well it's a legacy system that was born in the 20th century you know it touches our lives in so many ways it's fundamental the economy and uh it was once state of the art uh in the last century it's showing its age now you know i i actually liken our financial system to a lot of our physical infrastructure our bridges and our tunnels and our airports and our railroads that were once state-of-the-art you know are no longer so and they're decaying in front of verizon we need to upgrade them a lot of that is simply true about our financial system and i really believe digital token technology and digital asset technology has the promise to actually help us modernize the system and upgrade it for for generations to come if we let it our regulatory regimes worked pretty well in the 20th century uh credit where credits do and we saw an unprecedented level of innovation and growth for what i'd described to be the climax of the analog world but now we live in a digital world it's time to update how we organize and optimize for that because there are fundamental differences between an analog and a digital world we need to foster growth and development for innovation in this space and lean into what the free world has gotten right all along and that's being free i love chris's quote where he discusses america's remarkable history of saying yes we need to say yes to digitally native open economies and i think this growth is happening as we speak the analog and digital the metaversal and universal they they're mixing and that's where the d5 mullet comes from uh we covered the blending of fintech and d5 with kai sheffield avisa and diego monica from anchorage and a couple takeaways here uh big infrastructure type institutions are becoming more and more crypto friendly visa is playing this liquidity settlement layer role where it allows for banks to talk to each other and stuff for seamless payments and people always talk about oh can i pay for my coffee with bitcoin or whatever and i think that based on this episode like that just becomes unnecessary like the idea here is that at the point of sale between the retailer and the consumer like you should be able to pay with whatever asset you want to and the retailer can receive payment in whatever asset they want like this means infinite liquidity infinite parity any to any transactions like this just seems like the future of the d5 mullet so that's an update on i guess i would say the crypto foreign policy if you'll allow me to make that like crypto nation state analogy but for the crypto domestic policy uh i think the world of roll-ups is just endlessly fascinating and i think that we well at least i am or i have been uh like collectively sleeping on the giant that is starkware so zero knowledge cryptography the mathematical magic stuff uh behind zk rollups makes for an incredible amount of capital efficiency and increases the power of ethereum block space which is becoming increasingly scarce and the thing is it's already here uh dydx is an application built on starkx zk rollups and it's a pretty absurd demonstration of the technology this isn't a demo and this isn't like a nice sort of case study that we ran for an hour that brought down this is day in day out the past 24 hours we're at 10 billion i believe trading volume for dydx at the end of another one of their fabulous epochs uh cumulative to date over 230 billion bias and boy uh dollar settled on ethereum uh starkx in total over 55 million transactions dydx is probably around half that in total so a very very dramatic scaling today already uh on ethereum right we our estimate at six hundred thousand gas that's about three hundred thousand gas per trade that's roughly uh three tps would have consumed all the ethereum's layer one capacity okay we're doing on a very regular basis 15 times that um on on star kicks starkware is opening up its technology to more permissionless development with starknet which is launching imminently and these rollups are where you will likely be living in the crypto world soon enough and you maybe already are to a degree um this all comes back to modular blockchains you have consensus on the beacon chain that's security you have data availability on the shards and that's expanding surface area for roll-ups and then roll-ups themselves are the execution layer that's you that's where you will be doing stuff but for now and for the most part like we're still on main net and you can do really cool things here like earning yield on stable coins frax is innovating this space in the algorithmic stablecoin space and it's partially collateralized decentralized and capital efficientized another how-to we covered is doing group bids on nfts with partybid you can team up and collectively purchase nfts which are then fractionalized and distributed out to the party you can basically make your own pleaser dao and speaking of pleaser dao a people pleaser came on layer 0 to discuss her career as a digital artist in the space the big inflection point i think for people pleaser was the x times y equals k animation for the uniswap v3 announcement which directly brought about the inception of pleaser down since then she has done the fortune magazine cover and a bunch of other really successful projects and i dig her art i think it's really cool and i think it only adds to it that the art is backed by an interesting charitable thoughtful person uh crypto can reward good things it can reward cultural significance and contributing to the net good whatever that is not all of crypto does this uh but i would say that i'm exclusively interested in the parts of crypto that do um i thought that the layer zero with g-money was an awesome example of how crypto can do that g-money is kind of a legendary trader in my mind after watching the episode and now he's a person of note you know an influencer a thought leader whatever you want to call it like in the nft community and when he moves from talking about trading to talking about you know the crypto space i think you see a real change of character like an evolution to to caring about profit to caring about community caring about culture and i think that in the end what we are looking to achieve is a better society and the means to achieve that is coordination like the humanity machine has an input of humans a coordinating function or engine and then the output the product is society uh and it's it's hard to change that input right like humans are humans but i think we can definitely influence that coordination function the engine and ultimately the society that comes out of it and i think dao was make a pretty strong case to be a massive upgrade to that coordination function and as samantha says in this article bear with me because it's kind of a mouthful um daos are the most equitable organizational primitive of all time because they exist purely in the digital realm the potential of the digital space changes everything in the history of the analog world you've always had to make a choice between centralization and efficiency you know a king can get things done more effectively than a senate and both you know complexity and execution uh and definitely way more than a mob but it's easier for a king to be evil than a senate like a council has more points of failure more inherent checks and balances but when you have an order of magnitude upgrade and your ability to coordinate that's this whole digital internet thing daos can achieve the productivity of a dictator while maintaining the fairness and uh inclusiveness the equity of a democracy meritocracy is the unachievable ideal right where capital and resources and power go exactly where they should the the things that deserve it people are incentivized to behave as they should and i keep saying should because it's subjective and so is meritocracy i don't really think that it can be achieved but i think with daos you have a once in an epoch opportunity to move closer to that meritocratic ideal dows are an engine for justice but we obviously aren't there yet if you want proof just go look at crypto twitter i mean it's chaos and it's only getting more chaotic as energy just continues to flood in this space uh and especially you know when the price isn't doing what you want it to and there's this whole like abandoning ethereum shouting match uh which if you're caught up on it i think it just boils down to intentions and approach i think the fundamental disconnect here is between traders and builders uh between those who want something right now and those who are looking to the future i'm not really a ta guy so i have no idea what this chart actually means uh but i like to visualize this cloud is you know the range of reasonable prices builders are fundamentally minded implementing technology like eip1559 proof of stake and rollups that you know raise the bottom end of the cloud this is the the floor and i think on the other hand traders and speculators seek to push the limits of the top end you know the ceiling and whether we like it or not i think it's sealing season like where things are driven by memes you know more than capital efficiency narrative driven not fundamentals driven and i don't know if i have a conclusion here really but seeing things from this perspective have definitely helped me understand like get a sense of what's going on here and get more insight from my feed you know see what's actually happening but yes the price isn't doing what we wanted to at least right now i don't know people seem upset about it my feed is oversaturated with bearish sentiment and the markets have been looking very i think i don't know i'm once again not really a trader uh but that's okay because it just means that crypto is on sale we had ben cohen on the show to give us his perspective on the markets and i really like his takes on corrections and drawbacks uh they help to extend out bull markets and allow for a more sustainable rise over the long run i think that whenever people get reminded of the floor then that can help buffer up the ceiling and if you're worried about the old portfolio well check out the best barbell strategy for crypto finding balance on the risk reward curve is challenging so the barbell strategy is basically going with heavy contrast one really risky one really not risky side to help you sleep at night from a safety security standpoint and also from an avoiding fomo standpoint so when in doubt zoom out and also be thankful thanksgiving is kind of a funny holiday you know but i think it's also a nice cozy time to sit back and be grateful for things i'm grateful to be in this space it's a really challenging and important time in the world and it feels like crypto is kind of worth a make it or break it is happening i'm grateful simply to be a part of it as a spectator and also helping move the space forward in any way that i can i'm grateful for the people around me both in and outside of crypto finding community in fellowship is crucial to i don't know achieving satisfaction and i think that's what we're all going for here i'm thankful for the vcs and for selfish capital and for soulless heartless traitors or whatever uh who give me an enemy to fight against and also to complain about i'm thankful for you guys you know the people out there who are giving me the time of day and trying to figure out what's going on in this crazy wild complicated exciting space also i'm thankful for our sponsors arbitram ledger matcha and alchemix they are making crypto better and this video wouldn't be possible without them so thanks a lot and finally none of this is financial advice eath is risky d5 is risky but we're headed west
