if you look at the original Xbox games the the graphics sucked and then if you looked at the late stage Xbox games the graphics were like orders of magnitude better but it was the same Hardware how did that happen because the software got better and so this is the software of ethereum layer improving what we can do with the hardware layer of ethereum hey bankless Nation we've got a new show format for you this one's short Punchy it's a deep dive into a crypto rabbit hole that David and myself are exploring these are our takes take them or leave them 25 minutes max it's gonna be our punchiest episode ever right David God it's pretty ambitious if they were going to do this in 25 minutes it'll be a first each of these episodes will focus on one specific theme on today's episode we're talking about an article that David published recently in the bankless newsletter it's called A Hitchhiker's Guide to riding an Mev bot David why'd you write this article why is this topic important yeah because every once in a while we go down collectively the crypto World goes down the crypto rabbit hole which we're all carving out and then we find something new we find something while we're digging in the crypto rabbit hole and what we have found recently is this what the world of the Mev industry of crypto is calling intense intense as in I intend to do something and the idea here is that this brand new fertile field that we've just unlocked could be real big real big and the why this is such a big deal and why this uh why I wrote a whole entire article about this is that an intent in theory inverts the relationship that the average Joe swapper on ethereum the average on-chain swapper has with the Mev vertical right now there's an average aerial relationship with swappers and Mev Mev wants to eat up the value of all the swappers and the swappers wants that to not happen and then with intense we actually can make these people be on the same team and actually get them to collaborate and cooperate which is part of the Bold case of crypto is learning how to align incentives and so intense is a mechanism for swapping that aligns incentives between swappers and Mev that's the big idea and that is the thing that we have potentially discovered while we are going down the crypto rabbit hole I completely agree this Rabbit Hole goes deep so we're going to begin exploring it in today's episode but first we disclose nothing big or specific in this episode both David and I hold ether uniswap X is the subject of today's episode uniswap has previously been a sponsor on the bank list podcast this is my time to remind you that we are long-term investors we're not journalists we don't do paid content there's a link to all Bank list disclosures in the show notes at all times before we begin we also want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible including Kraken our number one recommended exchange for 2023. extra thanks to Kraken our preferred exchange for crypto in 2023 whether your dollar cost averaging into crypto to prepare for the bull market or you're taking profits out of crypto be sure to do it with Kraken the newly designed Kraken Pro makes it super easy to do both your basic Financial transactions while also taking your trading to the next level Kraken Pro is truly the trading ux that you've always wanted so if you're a bull market archetype is the trader class you need Kraken Pro in your tool but if your character class is more of a defy journeyman or a woman then metamask portfolio is the tool for you many mass portfolio is your defy multi-chain battle station any asset on any ethereum layer 2 metamask portfolio will present it to you so don't get caught for getting assets or missing opportunities make sure you're prepared for the bull run by prepping your my mask portfolio moving on from tools you need to Playing Fields to play on the arbitrum layer 2 is one of the main Arenas in which this bull market will be fought on whether your character class is a D5 DJ airdrop hunter or yield Seeker the arbitrum Coliseum is where a ton of the action is going to be so whether you're on arbitrum 1 for defying nfts or arbitrum Nova for web3 gaming or a new frontier on Arboretum using an arbitrim orbit chain there are so many opportunities to sink your teeth into but as we know the ethereum roll-up Centric roadmap produces all kinds of layer tubes and mantle is one of the newest layer twos on the scene with some of the newest technology that ethereum layer 2's has to offer in the year 2023. mantle is built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expense of ethereum layer one reducing gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos with billions of dollars standing by from bit Dow to investment mantle make sure you stay ahead of the game by building and growing your on-chain footprint on mantle let's not forget about the each staking character class and stator makes it easy running a staking pool with stator just requires four ether for a deposit letting you charge a fee to the remaining 28 ether that uses your note to stake their Eve increasing your yield by 35 seder's staked ether token ethx allows you to stake your ether and use it in defy at the same time for all you D5 swappers out there this one is for you uniswap X has opened up a brand new landscape to play in and it's the world of intense this is where those who employ this swapping ability get to team up with the evil Mev butt Army and they get to band together to discover the most efficient liquidity route through the ethereum landscape gas-free swaps Med protection and theoretically optimal pricing when swappers and Emmy veers come together new metas happen and as thanks to uniswap X so the next time you trade as well consider clicking the unit swap x button to get your Mev protection and so if we're truly entering a bull market phase in crypto which we totally are then tokens are going to start flying all over the place so if you're an organization looking to grow with token incentives then look at no further than toku if you want to distribute tokens to your employees team members or for payroll toku can help you comply with labor laws tax obligations and reporting for whatever country you employ someone crypto is entering its regulated era and toku can help you achieve your token incentive award goals with compliance so thank you to all the sponsors that support Bank lists and all the podcast editors newsletter writers and operations managers who make the bankless organization the best that we can be we truly appreciate your support and for all the listeners out there who listen to the mountains of content that we turn out each week especially this one right here so let's go on to the show A Hitchhiker's Guide to riding an Mev bot okay David what's the big idea here so I uh use metaphors when I write uh I think it's the best way to explain some of this stuff uh and so I start this article with this metaphor of ethereum as just one gigantic ocean of liquidity if there's like one activity that we do on ethereum uh it's swapping tokens like ethereum if you want to be ultra reductive and kind of make a jab at ethereum you'll just call it like one gigantic decks like that is what ethereum is it's just it's just an exchange it's like it's a Marketplace for marketplaces so it's like a meta Dex like you can host many dexes on ethereum but really ethereum just is a place to swap tokens and assets if you don't really want to dumb it down the term ocean is kind of interesting too because the ocean implies some depth right you can have more shallow uh parts of the ocean you can have deeper uh parts of the ocean yes there's that yeah and that relates to this term called liquidity right and we all know what liquidity is in crypto it is just the how deep Market uh like um order books are on an exchange or how much assets are in a uniswap liquidity providing position there's this like fundamental relationship that uh like at a very deep level that water and liquidity and assets and markets all have with each other and it's why it's why we use the words liquidity that's not a coincidence it's because people would people way back when discovered that there's a relationship a pattern between like actual water and the liquidity of Market structures and so this is why I call ethereum a reservoir of liquidity it holds a bunch of liquidity in uniswap amms in like you know God forbid ether Delta Once Upon a Time Zero X and actually the originator of off chain order 0x and now we have uniswap right um curve is another Reservoir is so like think of curve as like a very big lake or maybe a curve is an ocean uniswap is also another ocean uh we got velodrome which is a smaller little tiny ocean on Layer Two but really in with you summate everything ethereum is like you know the Earth with all of its oceans put together and in order to navigate across this landscape of ethereum if you've viewed the ethereum as a landscape which you ought to because like every single contract address or your ethereum address is a destination and in order and then you also you also have tokens inside of your addresses and each of those tokens have addresses little destinations all across this world and we need sometimes to do our transacting we need to go from place a to place B from token contract to address a to token contract address B and this is what the activity of swapping is you're going you have uscc in one contract address and you need to turn it into another token or ether which is at a different contract address so like we're putting this into metaphors we actually need to travel across ethereum's liquidity pools pools of liquidity and we actually need to do something we need to make a transaction to get that job done for us and this is like starting to set the scene for like what is this big metastructure of ethereum but we have these liquidity pools with different assets all over ethereum and then we have to go across these pools in order to get our jobs done and that's kind of where I start off this article with this metaphor yeah and you're using so if you picture ethereum as this ocean of liquidity right uh in the rest of this this article this kind of resonated with me you use this metaphor of ships and you say this at the beginning as swappers on ethereum we're about to upgrade our ships moving from gas guzzling Clunkers that blast through the swells to Sleek Yachts oh Yachts that stealthily send you where you need to go without disturbing the waters you've got this image here um and on the one side it says on chain Dex trade and this looks like some sort of I don't know standard ship that is uh you know going through the ocean yeah it's a tugboat or something there's there's a massive amount of wake it's just pushing water back of it it's like it's like a bulldozer going through the water just like pushing the water around it just leaving a massive Wick it's got this like messy like uh pipe that's just burning oil at the back it is just brute forcing its way through the water yeah all right and you're calling that the on-chain dextrade which is now that's where we live yeah I use uniswap that's an on-chain deck straight so you're saying that's like a big freaking Tugboat and then you've got this other side juxtaposed as you say off-chain signed order and I don't have no idea what I'm looking at but this looks like a stealth yacht it's making it's going through the ocean but it's making very little waves uh you know very little movement not much wake and you're calling that the off chain uh signed order looks like also the you know the scene is at night so something stealthy is implied here as well so why this metaphor why are you painting this picture yeah so both of these images are actually made with mid-journey just some aesthetically pleased really viewers yeah I could tell the second one was I didn't know the first one yeah the first one definitely was well think about how big all those wakes are I I think the prompt was like metal heavy Tugboat with massive wake okay so I I was the so okay actually can you pull up another Tab and type in Sea shadow ix529 c c Shadow yeah Okay C Shadow ix529 yeah stands first what's this thing okay okay so now now type in F f117 Nighthawk you can just do f117 f117 Nighthawk okay f117 yeah so this is this is a stealth scene this is a stealth fighter famous stealth fighter right developed by Lockheed Martin they have uh all the the ship the the this is a plane this is a jet um this is a stealth jet one of the first stealth jets ever and the angles on this ship are meant to absorb radar and also not leave awake and so they also were charged with building this Navy Sea Shadow ship which is a like kind of the same version but as a ship and it's built in this way that is a is absorbs radar so you can't see it and B also doesn't leave awake because it's like it's great if it doesn't show up on radar but if you could just see the wake of this ship that it leaves behind the white churny waters behind it in its path then like all of your stealth technology goes so nothing if you just leave awake so it's also built in this way to cut through the water so that you can't detect it as it goes from point A to point B and then on the other and that's supposed to be in contrast to like this Tugboat which is like I don't give a f just like get out of my way liquidity I'm pushing USI and I'm brute forcing my way and so the these represent two different strategies from Crossfit for crossing ethereum's Waters you know remember ethereum doesn't do like doesn't have an army and so you're allowed to do as much Mev as possible which is why like you know in the normal world we have like armies and militaries to protect us but in the ethereum world which doesn't have an army and anything is fair game we actually need to be more adversarial in how we choose to cross its liquidity oceans because there's no Army to protect us and so we all need to develop strategies that are protective of our payloads which are our swaps oh these these metaphors these analogies are starting to stack up here okay but and so before we continue on that we'll park this idea of two different ships an on-chain Dex trade messy huge like wake it's just pushing the water out of its way off-chain signed order stealthy Sleek cutting through water uh below radar undetectable but what is an off-chain signed order we know what an on-chain Dex trade is okay that's where you go to unit swap you make a swap it's all on chain you could everyone can see it what is an off-chain signed order what does that have to do with what we were talking about the intro this this word intense yeah so an off-chain sign order stands in contrast to an on-chain Dex trade um so an off-chain signed order it's actually pretty similar to an on-chain Dex trade except that you don't actually execute it as a transaction and because of that property you can construct your transaction differently than if you had on like uniswap or sushi swap or curve or anything that's an on-chain Dex trade so with an on-chain Dex trade you put in certain parameters that are like fixing fixing variables in your transaction because if you don't fix them then the Mev Bots come and eat them right so like with our Tugboat who's just like bulldozing through the ethereum's liquidity it's a lot of things are hard coded into them because if they're not then the Mev monsters will get in and eat that transaction up and so like what am I talking about here um we want we have token a we want token B uh we are setting like Hey we're only accepting three percent slippage and then and we're also going to go through this route and so uniswap actually as a product and so does sushi Swap and um you know anything that has an order router an order router think of that as like loading up your ship your Tugboat your slow heavy Tugboat with like a predetermined path through ethereum's liquidity pools to get from point A to point B and so you're saying this is my path and I'm only going to allow for three percent slippage to get there we're hard coding all these parameters in in order to make sure that like when we get across this path that Mev monster is only eight like three percent of our transaction or two percent whatever we set our slippage to but these are parameters that we're all encoding into our transaction to protect us it's like adding panels to our ship big metal panels to our ship and it actually every single parameter that we hard code is also an additional gas cost and that's just what it takes for individuals to get across ethereum if they are going to construct their own chip using an on-train Dex trade we need to get across somehow so we got to build our own ship and that's what uniswap and any order router does when they help us make a transaction that is an on-chained Dex trade we are basically custom building our own ships an off chain Train sound transaction is very very uh is like the inverse of this and so all you're doing when you sign an off chain intent and off chain just means that you're not actually going to execute this as a transaction you're going to with your private Keys sign a transaction but not broadcast the entire transaction with an intent so no gas no gas you just assign transactions yeah so like you can take an ethereum transaction that you would broadcast to the mempool and then you can just sign it and not broadcast it to the mempool and that becomes an off-chain signed order so like an off-chain sign order is like a precursor to a transaction that's on chain but it does not become a transaction on Chain by you and so what do you do with this off chain signed order is that you just State your intent I have 2 000 usdc on the ethereum layer one I would like one ether on the ethereum layer one or I actually would like one ether on optimism or arbitrum or ZK sync or whatever you decide you just sign what you want and your minimum amount of desired tokens on the other side and so you're saying I've got 2 000 uscc and I will accept no less than one ether and anybody who can service this is free to take this transaction and execute it so that's why we call these intense right it's an intent so I intend uh to uh provide 2 000 usdc in exchange for one ether and you kind of broadcast that you're not broadcasting that on chain you're broadcasting this to all of the Mev Bots you're broadcasting it to the Mev stack which is usually the thing that you're trying to hide from but instead you just actually tell them what you want and that that is the big unlock who's in the Mev stack what is this this is all the Monsters uh so you you have Emmy you have Mev arbitragers like liquidity pool balancers sandwich attackers um you've got like just Dex arbitragers so if two different pools on uniswap and Sushi swap are unbalanced then they'll reorder reorder it the entire spectrum of possible Arbitrage opportunities are encoded into Mev bots on ethereum around ethereum they're like this swarm of things around ethereum that make sure that everything inside of ethereum is maximally efficient so like when you say like what is it it's like it's everything that is relevant to markets it's the hive it's whoever can make a private profit whether these are like uh market makers or Bots or some combination you know it's any anyone who who is willing to to make a profit on this exchange here right and part of this stack is it's probably becoming very very verticalized so so market makers and Mev Bots are probably collapsing into the same same vertical for example so this just turns into a vertical of like the the efficiency Checkers of ethereum markets so like if anything is Disturbed in ethereum then they will rebalance it and this is why we go back to this metaphor of liquidity and disturbing uh or here's a word dislocating pools dislocating ethereum's pools or liquidity is like when you take 2 000 usdc out of the uniswap pool and you put it into the uniswap ether pool like you're taking you take water scoop it up out of one pool and you dump it in another pool because you just made a trade well all of a sudden you've dislocated ethereum's pools and that is like signals to enemy the Mev boss like ooh chaos disturbances I need to go consume that chaos and rebalance the pools because of that's what Arbitrage Arbitrage is so this is why the tugboat that's like blasting its way through the waters of ethereum because it's just a super inefficient ship it like attracts every single Mev bot under the sun because it's creating him balances in its wake that's why you don't want to leave awake because you attract Mev Bots and so all of these custom built ships that we're making when we make a transaction on uniswap or sushi swap we're just using we're making like a one-time ship to get us from point A to point B and it's like super messy and heavy and Laden and gas inefficient because we have to layer on all these Mev protection mechanisms or else we'll get eaten and so this is what Mev Bots do they rebalance dislocated pools and this is why there's this antagonistic relationship between Unchained Dex trades and Mev Bots because Mev Bots abhor chaos they want to absorb that chaos and turn it back into order and that order is an efficient market this is kind of cool going back to that example if you have 2000 usdc and you want one ether for that so say You broadcast your intent to this bot Network that you're saying to buy one eth on optimism using 2 000 usdc you start your offer a 2010 usdc and Ratchet the order increments downward to to 2000 usdc with this a million ships appear to inspect your offer all in a standoff with each other the order begins at 2010 usdc but that's ludicrous eth isn't worth a tenth of a penny more than 2003.75 where in some other Market that's trading of course and this process goes goes down until some you say to some bot finds the price point at which it wants to fulfill this order and then suddenly pop out of the Swarm a single ship emerges darts forward grabs the payload and stuffs it inside of it and Zips off to the Horizon to fulfill the job what was the execution price in these made up numbers examples 2004.31 cents all the Mev Bots update their price Model for eth and now we have the market price of eth it's two thousand four dollars and 31 cents so I'm glad that this uh like little scenario that I made up uh made sense to you because I actually effed up and got the numbers wrong it should actually go up not down and so I should have said like restart the price at 1990 and then it increments upwards until right until a block actually fulfills that but like the idea is that you actually get the idea so like here's the idea this is the Dutch auction this is the part that uniswap X has brought to the uh intense landscape is this idea of a Dutch auction so what is the Dutch auction it's like you start selling something and you start really high traditionally so like saying you're you're selling a widget for 10 000 units and then you start incrementing down like 10 000 units nine thousand units eight thousand units until someone buys it and the person that wants it the most that's is going to pay the highest price is going to buy it first and that's what the Elegance of the Dutch auction so this is what we're doing this is what uniswap x is doing with its off chain signed orders and so it creates an off-chain signed order that is also imbued with a Dutch auction in it and so swappers want the best price and using induction auction we can naturally find the Mev bot that is the best most suited Mev bot for that one particular job that is better than all the other Mev Bots for that one particular job to fulfill your order at the best possible price and the mechanism that allows for this is by not actually hard coding and entering this on chain but allowing this to be just broadcasted across the landscape of Mev Bots and saying hey I have this desire for this thing to happen I will pay the minimum amount necessary according to the most efficient Mev bot that can execute this order to get this job done and so you invert the relationship between Mev trying to eat you and Mev being a service provider for you you've got this uh analogy of like poly tradies from uh from Dune riding the sand worm here and you say instead of fighting Mev bot monsters we ride them it's basically what you're doing is you're using all of these sand worms essentially and um you're using them for your own purposes uh when normally they they just want to kind of eat you and steal your lunch instead you're kind of harnessing the power of these things to um give you the best price on a trade and that's all uniswap X is essentially so what are the implications of this David like what how does this change uh the landscape it seems like now we can start to fulfill these types of orders off chain does that have an impact on um you know how much liquidity is actually on chain does that create kind of a stealth non um mempool style transaction market like it's this good is it bad just how what are the implications of scaling right how many transactions per second can this thing support have you given any thought to these things uh so yeah there's a number of like second third order consequences I think the easiest one to understand is that you actually don't need to um spend gas anymore um the gas cost of your transaction just comes as a spread and so it's just part of the usdc that you pay to buy your ether you're just going to get like a slightly less amount of ether because the gas cost is a part of the calculus that the Mev bot does when they are looking at your order but the point is is like if you're just trading two tokens that aren't ether you will trade tokens and The Ether balance in your wallet will stay the same because you are not the one spending gas the Mev monster is the Mev bot is gas is spent an equivalent amount actually this less gas will be spent per transaction because we don't have to load up all of those like hard-coded parameters to in order to get this done and so the average swap on ethereum is actually going to become more efficient because of this and that's the first reason why the average swap on ethereum will become more gas gas efficient the second one is that part of the competition for Mev Bots is to actually aggregate intents and so say you intend to buy one ether for 2000 usdc and someone else is meant to it intends to sell one ether also for u2000 usdc in the current example of in the current meta you would have both buyer and seller line up at the uniswap desk and they would each take their bucket and scoop liquidity out of the uscc pool and put it back into the ether pool and then the next person would come and they would take the same size bucket and they would take it out of the ether pool and put it back into the uscc pool both cost to gas both got arbed by me V Bots and both happened in two separate transactions that were both on chain if they were both intense instead of on-train signed orders an Mev bot would be able to match these two orders together and just like cancel each other out and almost like no gas cost between the two of them because they can each they just can just pay each other and so like all of the aggregation of intents can kind of like you know like remember in algebra where you have like things above the line and below the line and you like cross off the variable above the line and the blow the line if they're equivalent variables kind of like that that's what that's what you can do with intense because they haven't settled on chain yet so in every and Mev bot can aggregate many many different intents together and they can cancel a lot of The Coincidence of wants between intents out before going on to ethereum and settling up in one gigantic settlement that disturbs a bunch of liquidity pools so instead of having 10 000 transactions disturb ethereum's liquidity pool 10 000 times an Mev bot can aggregate 10 000 intense cancel out like most of them and then just disturb ethereum's illiquidity pools in aggregate of the 10 000 transactions which would be like I don't know one one hundredth the amount of disturbances across ethereums liquidity pools that would otherwise be the case all of that makes sense it does yeah you say this in your article with intents a lot of the complexities between cross-chain liquidity chain swapping and Bridge selection are all choices that will be made by the technical backend service providers by essentially the Mev Bots are making that choice am I reading that correctly and all users have to do is Hop on the ship and enjoy the ride so this makes this multi-chain ecosystem a lot easier for for users to navigate this really shifts the role of like what I thought what we thought collectively under the old um you know Paradigm Bridges were for right because then like you don't need bridges for as many things do you as long as you have kind of the trustless bridge between mainnet and a roll up that's kind of the bridge you need to preserve a lot of the you know moving of assets from one chain to the other can happen in this Mev bot World often these off-chain orders with these intent based orders is that right yeah 100 so it really puts the synchronicity back into ethereum where every single layer two is an asynchronous network but the Mev Bots work to make them all synchronous networks uh once again they synchronize the state the state of liquidity across all these player twos and people experts are are you know work for margins in order to get that done and so these are like this this off-chain meta of off-train Mev Bots is like this other part of ethereum that's not actually the ethereum protocol it's not the estate of ethereum but it's the Swarm the swarm of Mev that makes sure that all of ethereum's liquidity and state is synchronous across chains even if there's like a if you block block time delays between into any individual chain okay so what does this paradigm shift I guess in closing really really mean moving forward I think there's more to unpack in this rabbit hole and we we certainly haven't unpacked everything today I think a lot of the the you know the bankless episodes in the future will be sort of going deeper down this Rabbit Hole obviously um order based exchange like exchanges are going to trade are going to change right so less on-chain sorts of orders and transactions more off chain we've already talked about um Bridges it seems like these off-chain orders aren't subject to the constraints of transactions per second on ethereum mainnet or a roll-up either so we have like do we have like Infinity transactions per second out there there's also a conversation about like centralization it you know is this kind of a centralizing force is this sort of um are we losing the transparency of our on-chain markets what do you think uh we have to unpack still in this intense based conversation yeah the convergence of this uh these players these off-chain players um is like the convergence between Mev experts and market makers so like Tech and capital how those how these Landscapes converge is going to be interesting um how much we can actually squeeze into one of these things so like I said you could put like 10 000 intents together and then compress them down with efficiency and computation off-chain computation AKA your CPU and some Market maker Mev Bots House Office wherever like so like yeah you can you can get a lot of scale out of this one of the cool ways that um Tech scales to use another metaphor um the original if you look at the original Xbox games the the graphics sucked and then if you looked at the late stage Xbox games the graphics were like orders of magnitude better but it was the same Hardware how did that happen it's because the software got better and so this is the software of ethereum layer improving what we can do with the hardware layer of ethereum and so we're scaling transactions per second like in a pseudo way in a roundabout way that way through intense by allowing like a thousand intents to come together and represent the same size of like what would have ultimately been just like five or six normal swap transactions um so that that's a whole other rabbit hole it's like what kind of scale do we get out of this thing um the la how layer twos uh relate to this and how fast can the Mev swarm sync up a layer two to a layer one um there's another vertical to explore uh and I bet you there's so much more it's a very large field it totally is and I think there's a lot of investable opportunities that that you could find here around sort of how the Mev supply chain the block builder supply chain is going to completely change how all of these orders are going to be aggregated what this means for the future of exchanges if you actually want to go use intents today I don't think uniswap X is live but it's not live by default you can go and set it to live and you can make some trades on your 12x okay and there's there's of course uh Cal swap as well that's at swap.co.fi and it's basically when you put a transaction when you put an intent in that's actually the Mev Bots that are fulfilling that are filling that transaction so you can see how it works that way so a lot more on this in the future uh David is there anything else you would end with or did we did we cover it here uh there's I'm sure there's going to be more articles that are continuations of this uh and so stay tuned for that hope you liked the episode bankless Nation we've got some action items for you including David's article A Hitchhiker's Guide to writing the Mev bot there's also some episodes that we've done previously on uniswap X one with Dan Robinson that you absolutely have to go check out we'll include those in the show notes as always gotta let you know crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign [Music]
