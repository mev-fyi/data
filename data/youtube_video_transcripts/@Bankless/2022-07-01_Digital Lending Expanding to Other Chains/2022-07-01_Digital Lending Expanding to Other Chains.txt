i think i've heard you in previous interviews talk about just expanding the pool of assets that folks can get loans off of even insofar as maybe expanding out of the ecosystem so i'd love to understand when that might come in what are you looking for to start integrating those assets and when do you think that might be yeah i think we base demand based off lender appetite so whatever lenders are willing to lend against will support it doesn't make sense to support every collection because deals are not going to get done so we're only focusing on really the high value sort of long tail assets for right now you have chains like solana that are starting to really pick up it could be a scenario where we acquire uh maybe a team that has solana experience because it's a completely different chain also looking at l2s like arbitrom and polygon when we're talking about game fi and gaming assets i think a lot of those will be issued on l2s so being able to support those chains means lower value assets means more transactions
