power and joshua lepidus of opolis opolis is working to what john calls unbundle the employment experience and to me i'm i'm hearing bells of self-sovereignty and empowering the individual and so we're going to get into the topic of what opolis is and uh john is also one of the leads behind organization organizing east denver which is like my favorite time of year so before we even get started talking about opolis john thank you for just making east denver happen because it's like it's like my favorite thing uh and i'm kind of i'm super bummed that covet is throwing a wrench in those plans this year but i'm looking forward to coming back to eat denver in the future well you're not going to miss too much though we are recreating all of it in vr this year so 2021 will be uh we're gamifying the whole thing in almost a video game environment so it's it's actually quite fun we've we've demoed the environment for several of our you know the sponsor groups and the reviews have been very positive i mean considering what i've experienced for the average event this year which has been pretty much zoom calls uh with maybe a background or two um we're planning something pretty special so and then also there might be a few in-person things depending on how much covenant cooperates but we'll see but you're welcome we enjoy doing it we enjoy it probably just as much as you do so it's it's uh it's ethereum christmas i guess you could say no that's exactly right and as i've also definitely attended some like vr conferences just very quick like one-off like one-hour presentations there's definitely something like magical about doing something in vr like the immersion is really important and it's not really something that you find on zoom so i'm looking forward to that yeah cool well we look forward to having you cheers all right so let's get into opolis john what is opolis well opolis is really the most in my opinion when you talk about the importance of web3 projects and user adoption opolis is the killer app as it relates to the average person getting involved in web3 technology and cryptocurrencies so what it really is is applying many many web3 tools around the notion of what we call self-sovereign employment so as you said in your introduction unbundling the typical relationship of a quote employee and a quote employer in the form of the person and the corporation and actually building a framework a legal framework that allows people to off to operate as self-sovereign workers but do so completely compliantly um essentially at the end of it what ends up happening is we're handing people control over their commercial lives see right now whether you realize it or not the minute you become beholden to a corporation you no longer really control your decisions when it comes to your health care benefits retirement plans like even where you put your time and attention during the day like you are completely captive to that corporation that that excuse the expression but they own you i mean it in some ways it's um and and i hope your audience doesn't mind me being a little bit um off and guard here about what i'm about to say but this is you know we live we live in a we live in an age of modern day wage slavery and then it happens because you know everybody goes to college you get all the debt then you got to get a job so you can get out of debt but then you never seem to get out of debt so then you continue to have to have a job because the pay the bills pile up and there's no there's no real freedom when it comes to that and we work so that we can have a two days on the weekend and basically maybe go on a vacation once in a while and in days of covert no one's even doing that so stepping back from the insanity it's like well what are we really what are we really doing with our lives now that by itself isn't bad if it were that everybody was allocating their time and attention in a way that was expressing their best creativity like the best of themselves i would say who cares right like because it's like well if if they're fulfilled and feeling great about their lives and that's what they want to do then so be it that's the libertarian in me but the problem is is 70 percent of people are sitting in jobs they hate so we're sitting in these employee employee relationships 88 of the workforce is doing that and we don't like what we do right so it and how all this translates to like human experience human joy and then just you know economically speaking productivity because if you think about gross domestic product and what drives gdp it's in employee engagement right so it's pr and worker productivity do the math in your head the back of the napkin like what's worker productivity look like if seventy percent of people are disengaged from their work right uninspired yeah it's it's it's not their best certainly and then when you look at mental health in the united states just as an example like people are not that happy i mean you know when you really get them candid and talking about their lives and what motivates them they're not doing a lot of that they're spending so much time just trying to survive so what opolis is is aiming to do is really creating a new platform of self sovereign employment and we're doing so through an employment cooperative framework so it's a legal framework combined with web3 technology that allows for this new dynamic of work so we're very much squarely in the the future of work but using legal and technological components to to make that happen so let's let's hang on the uh the conversation of how of how like big big employer if we can make like a a big employer scapegoat uh why are we as a as a industry as a society why are we locked in to big employer like what what what monopoly do they have that we can't seem to like break out of well right now most of it's actually conditioning i think a lot of it is if you look at our educational system i mean i can speak for myself when i say that you know i went to high school in college expecting and being told and trained and conditioned to get a job right it wasn't about expressing my best creativity or becoming an entrepreneur and learning emotional you know tools or things to like weather the storm and you know how to overcome adversity like nobody taught me any of that stuff like it was it was very academic it was very sort of cog in the wheel now where did that come from that comes from manufacturing techniques that basically it emerged in the the industrial revolution so if you look at the individual in 1908 88 of people were self-employed they were trades people but in in most business was done in communities not in huge industrial centers well that changed with the emergence of steel and auto workers and oil so when you look at what happened individuals started arbitraging their time with larger corporations like standard oil or you know u.s steel because they could get paid more to do it so it was no longer advantageous to stay on you know to stay on your own because you could you could make like multiples going and working for these large industrial complexes now henry ford really is the father of the modern work you know the work week you know we talk about the standardized work week that came from henry ford and creating quote humane working conditions at his manufacturing plants in detroit because if you look at the mortality rate in the steel industry for example at the turn of the century you're talking about 10 percent mortality you had one in 10 chance of dying at work if you worked in a steel mill well it seemed like a pretty dang good deal to go work in a henry ford plant in the 20s and 30s compared to that and then they started adding on things like health care insurance and retirement plans and pensions and time off paid none of this was anything that anybody had ever thought of before it started as perks but then through the i would call it the nba era in the 60s and even post world war ii it became table stakes people were it no longer was it just the the elite companies offering this stuff pretty much everybody had to offer it in order to compete but then when you wake up everything's legislated around what is the norm so like healthcare insurance and fair labor standards acts and like all these different things around you know the these worker employee dynamic employer dynamics are now baked into to statutes and laws right and it just you know when you talk about legislators and how they think they don't think about innovation they just think about solving a problem and then so they just add more to it like if you look at ab5 in california which requires um companies to classify their workers as w-2 employees you know that's the wrong solution to the right problem i mean we've got inequity in our labor markets but it's not because we're not treating them as employees that's that that's not the way to solve for people who want freedom and flexibility the way to solve that isn't to make them beholden to these companies like right as the the sort of you know wage slaves of of them because they have to have now w2 them which w-2 equals risk which risk equals cost and cost equals control so and also unemployment right so like the the politicians are layering on laying on like more and more responsibility to employers and yeah and they can't afford it so what are they so they hire less and they hire less it's the same argument around you know minimum wage being raised to fifteen dollars it's like you know these people obviously have never run a small business before because if you do you know look for for a job that i can get done for ten dollars but i now have to pay 15 when i look at the overall cost you know of my operations i look at my op-ex i gotta come up with 50 cost now on my on my head count so what am i going to do i'm either going to cut hours or i'm going to cut people because i can't afford to do it i mean it's just it it's a it's a very simplistic way of looking at it and it's again it's it's the wrong solutions to the right problems but what we haven't done is really create a framework that really empowers in what i refer to as an egalitarian sense the actual worker the person so how do we build better systems to actually allow them to work more fluidly and dynamically globally not just constraining them to you know their state or city where they work but why not open up like real labor markets globally we just there's just too many roadblocks and legislative hurdles and corporations don't want that so they're never going to do it so our theory is like well aren't they just really intermediaries anyway you know why not create a new dynamic so what we've really done is shifted employment from a b to b game to a b2c game okay so let's go into that what do what does that mean so when you talk about b2b in looking at employment outsourcing as an example so what we're participating we're actually participating in is is the cooperative which is owned by its members not dissimilar from a dao right so this is really an employment dao if you want to talk web 3 language it just has a legal standing is an lca which is a limited cooperative association in the state of colorado but people from all over the world can be members to this okay so it's not just that you can only be in colorado it's that it works right now we're just domestic in the u.s but in any case um when you go when a payroll company approaches a corporation and says hey we want to provide services to you it's a very procurement cfo ceo decision kind of thing they live in hr they look at what benefits they're going to offer they look at the cost they look at and it's a six month life cycle and they compare against six places and you know there's lots of dinners and beers and wine and all this and and who are they really making these decisions for right these are the people impacting the employers or the employees the employees are the ones who actually have to eat this this sandwich once it's made right so you know the employees don't get a choice okay so there's no voice of the employees in these decisions it's really just a b2b game right it's a procurement game in in our world what we're doing is we're actually shifting it to more of a consumer thing like think about when you go shop for a mortgage or you shop for car insurance like yeah you don't love doing it but once you get it it set it and forget it right but you know that you're covered you've got that peace of mind so the safety and security that you're looking for is an individual you you do what you need to do to get there and then if the rest is kind of taken care of for you that's the same thing that we're we're moving employment to that game so then when you elect your health care even if you shift around from job to job to job your health care never moves right okay because it stays with you you the individual is connected to health care not you not not connected to the company not to the company or the job or the gig or whatever it is that you happen to be doing we call it the revenue stream so it's not attached to the revenue stream anymore or the income stream it's now attached to you so it's portable and we're saving people 30 to 50 percent on what you can get on the open exchanges so we just had a first is that because you are like uh aggregating just many many people together group health care plan right so if you look at if you look at the way the state exchanges are organized they're actually underwriting one person so you're paying a premium actually to get that insurance um insurance companies don't like doing this but they've been legislated into doing it so they do it but you're just paying a premium for it plus there's subsidies for certain people on the exchanges so who do you think pays for the subsidies right other people in the network right so what we're doing is we're providing fortune 100 benefits so if a fortune 100 group has a thousand employees or 10 000 employees think about the purchasing power well what if our cooperative has 10 000 employees right exactly so the the cooperative can now negotiate and procure services and insurances and benefits on behalf of its membership much more powerfully just like rei can go buy sleeping bags in bulk because they got so many people and they can offer really great prices on really great gear the same is true so benefits payroll shared services and healthcare insurance all can be procured very inexpensively and provided to the membership whereas if you did this on your own it's not only cobbling together a really clunky system but it's very expensive and time consuming and you have to be a freaking expert in everything you know you have to like learn how to shop for health insurance you have to learn how to show up for liability insurance and you have to learn how to shop for payroll and you have to learn who knows how to do that if you're a real estate broker or you're for a software developer who wants to know how to do that mm-hmm so what is that why does the the idea of a union come to mind here like this this feels like a union well sort of unions are typically geographic in nature and trade specific so trade associations and unions are not a new concept but they're very narrow in scope and they also have very lacking benevolence capabilities so typically you have centralized leadership components the unions that become very corrupted um and you know if you look at how they behave it's often like politicians where they just look out to protect their own bacon instead of actually looking out for the constituents that they serve there's also these forced requirements a lot of times where if you want to paint in downtown chicago you have to be a part of a certain union or else you can't do it so there there's a little bit of a antiquated feel to it like an old school union um now there the the notion of collective bargaining is not a new deal or even collective procurement it's not a new deal but if you if you take a step back what we've really built is part union part guild part cooperative and we put it up in the in and we added a bunch of technology to maintain benevolence and we wrote the bylaws in a way that would maintain benevolence and then we're using web3 technology to really empower the the user or excuse me the member i should say the member is really the primary focus so when the member wins the cooperative wins right so it's just instead of you know looking at the you know the platform economy that we have right now where you know uber can be worth billions and billions and billions of dollars but the average uber driver makes less than minimum wage per hour like there's a little bit of a misalignment there in value distribution so the cooperative framework allows to solve that so let's also give the details about how like if i sign up to be a member of opolis what what benefits do i get i get access to healthcare it sounds like healthcare retirement plans workman's compensation unemployment insurance so like typically as an independent you can't get unemployment insurance if you end up out of gigs and whatever you can't apply for that you can absolutely do that um now that you're you're w-2 employing yourself uh you'll what do you think we're just w-2 employ myself okay so legally speaking it is um it is a legal relationship between an uh an ein number or a corporation that holds an ein member who holds what's called employer of record now as a w-2 employee there's certain requirements that the quote employer must follow per legislation that give me protections as an employee when you're let's say you have an s-corporation so in order to employ yourself you have to be incorporated either s corporate c corp now you can elect s corp status at the federal level and still have an llc and still have a bona fide employment relationship between your entity and yourself so for example if i have an ass corp and let's say it's called power inc and it's and i am the only employee and i pay myself 60 000 a year i am a bona fide employee legally of that entity so when i w2 employ myself i'm going to get a w-2 at the end of the year and opus generates all of that right so when you talk about the shared services the administration the accounting the tax remittance the tax withholdings all the things that need to get done that would normally be done by the corporation i'm working for is being done for me through the cooperative in addition to accessing all the employer benefits healthcare insurance 401k i can even do a match if i want it's my own funds right it's just coming from my company but i can still utilize i'm basically cr recreating a mirror image of employment but i'm simplifying it through a shared services stack and a technology stack that allows for all this to be vertically integrated very cool so instead yeah it's very it's very cool so like working for another company i just said it and forget it and here's my salary and here's what my withholdings are and here's what my you know all these different things are and that's it so but uh if i wanted to become a member of opolis this is something i have to pay into or how to find it it's 20 bucks buys your share so it and there's no um for right now there's no fees for the first year and so what do what does that membership get me because it obviously doesn't get me revenue from my company because that's just not baked in right like i have right that's yeah you got yeah you have yeah at this point i mean well let's let's put it this way in the future if we had say 50 000 people in the con and the commons which is what we call it it's very likely that there's markets that pop up out of that right so employers will start coming to the commons looking for talent so in the future it's totally possible that you'll get work from your membership at the commons right now we're not big enough for that futuristically i want at scale if you think about like job boards and other third-party markets for finding work again intermediaries trade so i actually come from the town acquisition space in the employment space i've been in it for 20 years and these all these business models are flawed like the third party paywalls to try to find work and all that the vision for opolis at scale is it be actually becomes its own market so in inside of opolis the commons will be guilds sort of like unions but loosely affiliated and affiliated for a purpose so guilds will be able to have their own advertising pages and charge for access so instead of a third party getting all the advertising revenue or the access revenue or whatever the guild would be able to get that so again at scale that's where we're going to go now i think you asked something about um you would ask something about other benefits right yeah so so what are what are just all the incentives to become a member of obelisk or the cost yeah so um all right so the major the major long-term incentive that we're actually launching in q1 next year is a token rewards program so typically let's use uber as an example because everybody understands it um if i were to be getting rewards for every ride that i took or every ride that i gave and that represented a piece of value of the ecosystem right so like tokens were minted say every time i did a ride or let's say every time a certain threshold of rides was hit you know those that participated in creating that value for the ecosystem would be rewarded with these tokens okay that would have created a completely different mentality in writers and drivers but see we have this thing that i refer to as the tragedy of the boardroom and our current epoch of capitalism only the people that that benefit are the the stockholders right so at the time you know most of it was just vc held and then once they went public you know get ready for the roller coaster i mean you know it's it's it's not a good thing and then when you can put 10 million dollars into lift and get 1.3 billion dollars in in a night and ipo when the when the average driver doesn't make minimum wage it seems pretty skewed to me in where where the value is going i mean it's it's pretty obvious that that we've got a long-term misalignment where benevolence is not present and economic sustainability is not present so the thing that we're doing is we're actually tokenizing the ecosystem such that when you are consuming payroll services from the commons as part of the group once certain thresholds of growth are met then a block of tokens is being minted and distributed to those that contributed to the value creation of that achievement and it in every time a growth threshold is is is hit in the the annualized payroll volume of the commons which if it's you know just in simple terms would be your payroll my payroll josh's payroll everybody he added all up and the total payroll volume of the commons then is what triggers these uh payroll mining blocks so at scale because we're all paying one percent of our payroll as a fee at some point there's future profits so the rights to future profits are represented by these patronage tokens so as i hold these tokens and i can stake them and earn more as well so i can sort of you know stake and secure the network and really kind of you know put my marker down instead of trying to sell them or hold them off network or something i can put them back into the ecosystem in a staking contract and earn more so it's kind of like what most people would think of like a savings account but i can earn more tokens which earned me more rights to more of the future profits so how does the token actually have a relationship with opolis is it is it like an equity token in or or a claim on uh like is it shares of the collective like how was that relationship it's it's a utility token only it's a patronage token so all we're doing is using it for um like a chit that basically says this token represents some fraction of future profits so my membership is the security so i buy one share for 20 bucks that's the one and technically it's the securities exempt transaction anyway because it's a cooperative so it's it's a share of stock and you buy one share of stock but then i can hold a million tokens and you could have ten right because let's say you don't utilize this yeah the ecosystem as much but i referred like a thousand people and i did all so i created more value for the ecosystem and my tokens represent my rights to those future profits whereas your contribution was just smaller in nature right right now we hold equal standing in terms of voting which is the one share one vote except that my tokens if i'm a member and i'm staking them i also can earn enhanced voting privileges so that's it's like the proof of work token whereas like if work was done it's expressed in the ownership of the token that's right and the there are there there will be profits to the ecosystem and cooperatives are designed for shared profits right ah ah that's that's where my i just connected those dots there you go so the shared profits then come back to the consumers right so really in in net effect well if you think about the way enterprise value is created enterprise value is typically created by a multiplication of revenue or some you know p e ratio or something that comes into play a lot of times you'll look at just net revenue and it's like 20 x or 30 x and there's your market cap well every time somebody runs a payroll let's say it's five thousand dollars you could argue that there's a multiplication of that revenue that that turns into value in the ecosystem so the the people holding the tokens are going to see this is like well gosh you know the value of the network is going to continue to multiply the more and more people that come in the more revenue there's going to be and there's actual value to holding these tokens right like it's not just some you know airware vaporware you know cutesy food meme thing i mean it's actually a real business model that you know people are really consuming and it's sticky too because like where am i gonna go right if i'm getting my health care and i'm getting rewarded for this and ultimately i could even use these tokens to pay for my services which makes my the you know the cost of the services ultimately free then where am i going to go why would i go anywhere right i'm saving 400 a month on my health care my administrative life is much simpler i'm in compliance now so i don't have to worry about any alphabet soup agencies coming after me for not paying my taxes on the dye that i collected from my from my dows that i'm a part of and it's just easy and and and i'm sharing the value of it long term right so and i have total optionality on how i want to organize it maybe maybe talk about how somebody who because git coin is trying to get uh the quadratic freelancer to be a thing right and like dows you mentioned dows or daos are trying to uh permissionlessly compensate people for their labor uh and that's all great like great we can we're finding new innovative innovative ways to like compensate people for their work um but that doesn't solve like their health care and employment services end of end of the spectrum right so like maybe maybe talk about how opposed kind of fits into like the decentralized world that we're trying to see coming to fruition yeah so you heard me mention earlier on that it's the bridge between web 2 and web 3. so web 3 is great in concept but the problem is in a lot of respects like how on earth are you going to survive is a dow that permissionlessly pays people value for their labor and no one's reporting that to any sort of tax agency like how's that going to go down well i'll tell you how it's going to go down it's not going to go down now it's not going to go down very well let's put it that way the main thing about state governments and federal governments or any country's government is they want their part of the tax the reason why they have problem with cryptocurrencies generally isn't because cryptocurrencies are bad by nature it's that crypto can be used to skirt paying taxes that's what they care about so what opolis is doing is really professionalizing and normalizing cryptocurrency into a mainstream context so we're just bridging to these quadratic employees and bridging to the dows we're providing the the framework that these folks need in order to survive and be compliant so when for example uh kevin and i at bitcoin are actually we're announcing a partnership between opolis and bitcoin here shortly very cool um and you know what they really traffic in is the actual commercial activity right the connections the people doing work the the grants the fundings the the the movement of money well when people are doing that if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stable coin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well movement of money well when people are doing that you still have to report this stuff right like i mean you should and at some point someone's going to come around asking whether or not you did and they'll be able to find whether or not you participated like bitcoin is is not going to be able to hide any information from that like they're going to be able to show that that happened well if somebody has an opolis membership and all of their you know sources of revenue are flowing to that one id and it just you know it could be 50 different thousand i'm a part of but it flows to one paycheck and it's being done compliantly i'm paying my taxes even though i'm taking crypto i'm doing the reporting and i'm doing my basis statements i'm doing everything that i need to do what are they going to say to you nothing and i get my health care and i get my complaint you know all my administrative stuff so we're we're professionalizing cryptocurrency and building that bridge between some of these very ambitious things but providing the legal standing and compliance standing and the simplicity for the the individual members to make it actually a reality so as we wrap up here what else should we know about opolis well we're open for business so if you're looking for if anybody watching this is looking for healthcare insurance i'll say this again the average member saves between 20 and 50 percent on their health care insurance and the coverage is better so our most expensive plan is typically 20 to 50 cheaper than what people are getting on the open markets and this is pretty much this is pretty much nationally um california's one of the worst but like we just talked to a person the other day that's literally gonna save half so i mean they're actually getting paid you could say in some ways to come to opolis and become a member and it's free for a year so there's no community fees for one year which they're only one percent after that so it's not expensive to be a part of it it's not difficult to do if you don't have an llc or s corp set up will help you do all that like there's there's really nothing you have to do except bring yourself in a smile so we are where people are you guys ensure we expect um about a hundred in the commons by the end of the year and then by the end of q1 we're expecting about 500 so we're meeting with several people a day um on their individual needs and right now we're doing individual sessions as we learn about you know what people's challenges are and as we automate and sort of try to get to a place where it's entirely self-serve um people can join right now if they want they can just go to commons.opolis.com if they want to start the wizard they can do that but alternatively just you know go to opolis.com and set up a call and talk with us about you know it's about 30 minutes just give you a quick orientation answer some questions give you some best practices on how to get started and then from there it's completely self-serve it's up to you on you know how when and what you want to do awesome well john uh i totally believe in like this whole bigger tent big tent mentality that ethereum is bringing to the world and i see opolis as one of these like new institutions that are arriving out of this web three world that um are really a place where we can deposit our trust into right and that's a kind of a theme on the bankless show is like new institutions are arising in the moment that we need them the most and so that's the niche that i see apple is filling absolutely and just the time just to comment on that really quickly the thing about employment that that is i think outside of us that are already in the web 3 space and already you know trying to be compliant and trying to you know maybe we're not maybe we are you know maybe we want need insurance or whatever i think the most important thing for this is it's estimated by 2028 that 90 million u.s workers will be classified as self-employed so the transit's going here already huh the trends already going there now if you talk about this you know really block chains and cryptocurrencies are really just tools they're just tools of self-sovereignty by themselves they're not really that special it's what they represent in terms of liberty and giving the individual uh their own empowerment okay the thing about employment that i think is the most powerful case for why obelisk matters is because this is the this is the path into this world for the average person right now we don't have good user experience we private key management and all sorts of you know challenging deals when it comes to getting the average next door neighbor to use web3 and blockchain-based technologies or even infrastructures institutions as you call them right but sovereignizing and creating this framework of self-sovereign employment our members don't even know they're using crypto and they don't have to elect crypto as part of their payroll they can do everything in usd or fiat currency if they want right it's not a problem and they can you know look at what's that ethereum thing i heard about that you know and they and they can start electing it later down the road they have all sorts of optionality to start utilizing certain tool sets that they otherwise might not have thought of have thought to use so when you talk about killer apps of adoption like how do we get the next wave of adoption my prediction is because the trends are already going there as you mentioned it's going to be through payroll and employment getting people to use payroll systems that are benevolent and really built on web3 architectures and then giving them optionality to choose things like cryptocurrency as part of their paycheck that's the way it happens it's not going to be social media it's not going to be defy it's going to be the thing that we all do which might to some people seem really boring but it's really the path in right and then you can layer everything else on top of this we can integrate d5 protocols we can lending mechanisms we can put in decentralized identities and decentralize data storage and all sorts of other things that they don't even know that they don't even need to know it's under the hood awesome with that that's really exciting i'm really i'm really optimistic about about opolis playing out and growing into success if people want to learn more about opolis where should they go apolog.co [Music] no m on the end of course which is common in the crypto space we don't have the dot com but uh opolis.co is where you can go you can also check out uh our youtube channels and twitter feeds like we're on socials we're at opolis on twitter and uh yeah that's probably the best place to get us
