in my opinion this is a great time to start something if you can't people are running scared and people are medically medically following them to the hills and for those that stay you have an opportunity to build some really cool stuff welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with luke burgess who is the author of the book wanting a story about mimetic desire and there is nothing more related to the concept of layer zero than the topic of mimetic desire we had luke burgess on the show uh the monday podcast with me and ryan about a year ago uh and memetic desire just broke our brains because it's so foundational to how society operates basically in a sentence memetic desire is if somebody else wants something you want that thing because they want it and this is just so deeply rooted into our dna how we develop as children how we develop as babies uh that it is just part of everything it's part of the market cycle it's part of the business cycle it's a part of monetary policy it's about like investments and and where people try to choose to put their energies and so luke and i kind of have like a second a second episode to the first episode we did with him a year ago but this one a little bit more free-flowing a little bit more out there and a little bit more layer zero so i hope you guys enjoyed this fantastic episode all about memetic desire with luke burgess right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here

existence what's up luke how's it going what's up david good man good good good yeah uh we were just swapping stories about how we're both in empty places that we are new to yeah yeah i mean a huge empty basement with a couple of bunk beds that we got at our lake house for when kids visit and uh yeah it's it's if you saw the whole room it's pretty pathetic so anybody watching i i don't actually live like this we're just in a crazy move-in process right now yeah i'm in the same boat there's a reason why my camera is facing a wall instead of the empty empty room behind me um with a little more echo than usual yeah certainly uh for breakfast listeners that uh didn't listen to your episode that we did with you about a year ago can you kind of just like speed run listeners with like who luke burgess is and and why people pay attention to you well i don't know why they pay attention to me but i can definitely tell you what um i worked on wall street for a little while uh left when i was 23 and started eventually four companies in my 20s um some successful some not so successful and walked away when i was 29 to kind of delve into the humanities more i walked away for five years i lived in italy for a few years studied philosophy and theology trying to kind of figure out what i wanted to do the rest of my life this led me into understanding a thinker named renee girard who rocked my world um helped me understand everything from kind of the the crazy life journey that i was on why i'd made certain choices in my life to even understanding financial markets and the startup world which i was a part of and his fundamental insight is something called memetic desire meaning that human desire is fundamentally imitative that's what mimetic means and that this is something that usually happens unconsciously or subconsciously and drives me most of our decision making in fact while we imagine ourselves usually to be these very independent agents and actors but we're constantly being influenced through a social process it says that desire is fundamentally a social uh process so i wrote a book about it called wanting i am the entrepreneur in residence at the ciocca center for principled entrepreneurship in washington dc i teach a bit i have my hands on a lot of things i have a stealth startup project on the side i dabble a little bit in crypto i've had my eye on it for sure but nothing probably like most of your listeners yeah and for the listeners that uh did listen to the podcast it was it was really well timed because it was right before nfts got really crazy and they were definitely heating up but the the peak of the nft mania was like perhaps one to three months after we did our podcast and i remember like reading your book and then doing the podcast with you and post learning about memetic desire and the ways that you taught us it felt like going through and seeing like the being able to see the matrix right like seeing the ones and zeros fly by the world rather than being uh oblivious to them and especially as nfts got really really big and watching the meta of the nft uh phenomenon like shift because people hopped from nfts to nfts to nfts and everybody was everyone that listened to the podcast with you felt very uh tuned in to why human behavior was doing all this thing like oh first we like the anime pfp nfcs oh no now now we're doing the doodles like oh no wait now we've moved on to like goblins or whatever uh and like everyone that listened to your podcast was able to like explain the movement of the nft market cycles via this concept of memetic desire so after after we did our podcast with you like did you uh what did you pay attention to in the crypto world and and just like can you speed run us through uh what what you like observed post uh doing that podcast yeah you know it's there's something almost dangerous about knowing too much about a force like memetic desire um so i was paying attention to this weird like meta thing that happened where everybody started to talk about memetic desire in the crypto and nft world um it was it's the irony is that the book in our podcast thanks to you guys um led to all of this mimesis and memetic desire to talk about medic desire and this weird meta thing happening kind of like david foster wallace uh sort of talks about how irony crept into advertising you know he talks about this very famous pepsi commercial in 1987 where it made fun of how mimetic everybody in the commercial was and you know it had like a guy um have a loud speaker and pop open a can of pepsi and a truck on the beach and all these people run like sheep towards him and ah and you can hear them drinking pepsi and stuff and he said that was like some pivotal moment where the viewer became like aware of how like ridiculously mimetic we all can be sometimes but the danger in that is like you laugh at the commercial and you're like well look at them right and then you are almost more susceptible to all of the subconscious stuff that's going on right and i mentioned that because it's kind of i feel like what happened with nfts like we were all aware of one of these social mechanisms and forces that was driving some of this behavior even made fun of it made fun of ourselves uh and other people mostly um yet it just keeps going and when we were fueling it and you know it's almost it made me think like well there's something like unescapably enticing here because you always think that you know the next thing there's something special there's something unique about it and sure there's objective differences right from a technical standpoint from an aesthetic standpoint but you know gerard says that's precisely the romantic lie and that we constantly want to downplay the the role of mimesis and our our own decision making right even though we see it in other people's then i think you know there's been sort of a phase transition like in the beginning of any bubble and i'll just call it a bubble um there's the the actors um are often making decisions for less memetic reasons than people that come a little bit later in the game you know because they i don't know they think that more on the line um you know it seems a little riskier there's nobody else involved and i think at a certain point you have more and more people entering a market for i would say stronger memetic reasons who may have not done a whole lot of homework um who may not you know really know what they're doing and it changes the entire dynamic and i think can lead to some amount of rivalry i'd love your perspective on this some amount of rivalry between the people that you know have been in it longer and and tend to understand a bit more of a technology or a movement and the people that sort of rush in at the end who some of them actually may have done really well some of the people that came in later and that can lead to all kinds of like weird things from envy and stuff like that from other people so i think looking at the the kind of social emotional dynamic in any market is fascinating to me and i use the word like rivalry because this is a core part of gerard's theory right he says like memetic desire very naturally leads to conflict in human relationships so i just wonder if some of the memetic desire led to you know whatever founders splitting up you know people losing friends relationships whatever i mean i i suspect that that happened even though i didn't hear about most of it sure i do want to at some point um take the time to actually define memetic desire but we'll we'll skip that for now and come back to it um i'm so part of the listeners just gonna have to uh assume that we're assuming some knowledge here but we'll define it at some point in time we recently did a podcast with this guy van spencer who uh talked about we were recapping the 2020 to 2021 bull market in the crypto industry and he he uh contrasted the two two phases of the markets the first half of the market was the high conviction rally and the second half of the market was the low conviction rally and he separated these things in that the first part of the market was uh driven by this brand new use case with very strong fundamentals that everyone could get behind that and we could all get behind it we all had consensus that there was something real here and this is uh talking about d5 yield farming in late 2020 and that was a high conviction rally because investors individuals hobbyists like builders everyone was shared it in their belief that this thing was real and that drove this high conviction rally and then the second half of the bull market was the low conviction rally and that was things like the metaverse nfts game fi things that were very very new to the crypto industry that everyone had identified had a lot of potential but there was still not strong fundamentals there and the way that i see this being a manifestation of the whole concept of mimetic desire is that the loop on the on the bull market got faster and faster and faster and we saw this in the 2017 ico era where the ico like meta uh era was like people would spin up an ico people would put money into it uh the token would release the token would go up in price people would sell and they'd be on to the next ico to do that over and over and over again and the loops got faster and faster and faster because people were understanding the meta quicker and quicker and quicker they were seeing where people were going and like okay this is the game that we're playing you put your money in you get the tokens out and when the tokens pump and then you buy into the next ico and like we saw the same thing with nfts where some nfcs did very very well at the start of this low conviction rally uh and that created the meta it's like oh okay we're like the humans of the crypto industry are they're throwing money they're depositing money into nfts and then the nfts are going up and then they're making a bunch of money and then they're trying to find the next nfts and so builders like like bull market builders were optimizing their products for this sort of behavior and so rather than building in the bull in the bear market which created the high conviction rally because it was real fundamental projects builders in the bull market uh started to build for the meta and so people they were saying okay i'm going to make this nft project because that's what everyone's doing right now everyone's hot on nfts so i'm going to make this uh do the thing that is the easiest way to me to generate a bunch of deposits on these like on my nft platform right and so i'm going to sell these nfcs as fast as i can and then because that was the game the nft speculators would come in and then they'd buy the nfcs uh and then the use nfts would go up and then that would grabbed a bunch of attention and then the meta would shift and like the way that i the reason why i call it the loop is going faster and faster is because the meta got faster and faster and faster the memetics got faster and faster and faster stronger and stronger and at some point it got too fast uh it got too unsustainable and it reached a peak and that was the peak of the of the low conviction bull market which conclude which was like the fireworks right like the the loop was going super super fast and all the energy was just could not keep up with the space and that was the peak of the market um so how does that land with you and your interpretation of mimetic desire i mean it lands well it's i think is exactly right and i think the role of leverage is something that's really important when we're talking about memetic desire and markets in general because there's a kind of like when is enough enough and i feel like a lot of people never ask themselves like what were they in it for right what what's their end game what's their time horizon and there's kind of a keeping up i hate to use the phrase keeping up with the joneses but it there is kind of a a keeping up aspect to the cycles to the loops and feeling like you might get left behind there's an element of fomo to it for sure but leverage is important because i don't think a lot of people understand how leveraged the markets are especially the crypto markets and i think that's what's precipitating part of the decline as we're speaking right now it's pretty bad um even on this particular day uh with bitcoin um so you know if somebody else buys a stock i'll just use an equity just because it's simple and it appreciates by 20 um well there's one way that i can actually keep up with that person and actually do better than that person it's not by buying the stock because they're already ahead of me by 20 but what i can do is use more leverage than they did and that's a way for me to catch up and actually get ahead and that's part of the i think psychology that comes into play in any market i think it came into play with nfts and with crypto a bit it's you know the basic concept of sort of a gambler like double or nothing and you know trying to win the money back um and i know people personally that were leveraging up to try to keep up with some abstract like ideal of what kinds of returns they were supposed to have because they were hearing about you know what was happening with other people um and it there was not a lot grounding it in in reality so i think the and you know leverage has the function of revealing um huge differences when the [ __ ] hits the fan right um you know sort of amplifies differences and and that's also part of part of what's happening now so i would say that that's absolutely right the cycles have to get faster and faster the more they're driven by mimesis and it's the same thing in the startup world with like financing young companies i'll never forget like some of the wisest advice that an investor ever gave to me when i was looking for funding for one of my first companies was luke don't try to create a flash valuation that's not what we want it's not ultimately what you want and by flash evaluation he meant you know just there are ways to structure the story that you're telling and the amount of money that you raise to pump up the value in your next round as high as possible but should you be optimizing for that no right i decided the answer was no and i was going to try to build something more long-term and you made the excellent point that when the incentives are are kind of wrong like that the product itself actually changes and it's it's optimized for all of the wrong things and i'll tell you it's a huge temptation like even when building a company to optimize for the highest valuation but like who who cares about that in the in the long run um if we're just playing you know games with abstract valuations and i think that's part of what happened yeah there's a quote that i heard recently is that uh any venture capitalist that um their their uh exit plan was a market bubble like that is not a good exit plan that's not a sustainable one at all and i think the the other variable that goes into how these markets get like wrapped up in this uh accelerating loop of of mimetics is that like the the winners uh you know peacock their winnings and then they hide their their losses right and so traders in the crypto space they only talk about their hundred x's and they don't talk about their down ninety percents right and so it creates this illusion of if you're not getting 100x you're falling behind and so at this social layer it really is attractive because and you and you think it makes it appear that like getting 100x is easier than it actually is it's actually except accessible to you uh and getting in 100x is actually normal and so you just have to participate in the market and wait your turn and one day you will get your 100x and then on those assumptions it generates poor incentives right it generates a desire to pull leverage i don't know how i'm going to get 100x without like going leverage to the tits uh which then also self perpetuates that at a market structure level too percent i i did a um a zoom uh event for my sub stack with bern hobart who's a brilliant financial analyst and he wrote a paper called manias and mimesis where he looks at the history of financial bubbles and he makes a pretty strong cake in using rene gerard who my book's about and he makes a pretty strong case that some of what's going on now sure there's some different elements but you know there are basic characteristics of bubbles and you know he says one of the characteristics of a late bubble is you have a bunch of people that are imitating a model that they don't fully understand and the models to your point are obscuring or hiding the true nature of their gains for instance right um everything's curated it's like instagram everything's curated right people only see what you want them to see so it's a dangerous game psychological game to play when people are are imitating other people on a surface level but not understanding that the real substantial decisions and ways that they probably arrived at where they're at so yeah i mean it just creates a really really vicious cycle and there's i you know sometimes i struggle to to know whether transparency in um in markets is it in terms of like how individuals are doing is like a good thing or a bad thing right like what's like prudent discretionary disclosure and you know there's certainly like a culture now that's been built up around being very transparent about that and i think that probably is part of what's fueled some of the mises over the last couple years go into that a little bit more the transparency on disclosures on what are we talking about like uh like vc firms being just disclosing what they're uh invested in or no no i mean i mean you're i i like transparency in markets i'm talking about personal performance right like it's like it's like something that everybody talks about all the time now right like how how well you've done how your portfolio is doing we just have a way to sort of share that information unlike ever before like it used to be something that you know people people just spoke about in a different way right we've got like sort of the humble brag culture now and i that i think is the thing that is fueling a bit of what's going on i'm also transparency in the market that's not what i'm talking about ah okay yes yes yes yes right uh i remember there was this um this uh tick tock video tick tock investor video that went around was like this zoomer kid was talking about how he bought this mansion using like a not a lot amount of capital and he put that like forty thousand dollars into ust to get twenty percent and the twenty percent was gonna like finance his mansion uh and so like i don't think he actually did it i think he just made the content because that was his brand right like he was that was like i don't think he actually it was like a 24 year old kid that bought this like seven million dollar mansion and he was paying for his down payments via this 20 yield from tara uh and but like whether or not he did or not is pretty beside the story he was like broadcasting it on tick tock out to the masses right and so this one guy with this one bit of content was like you know showing like hey zoomers if you just have forty thousand dollars you can turn into you can turn that into a mansion if you just know this one cool new trick also follow me on tik tok and here's like an ad that i'm going to deliver to you and so like the the web 2 like uh one-to-many broadcasting uh paradigm is probably just like adding jet fuel to like memetic desire totally totally yep yeah i see it myself and you know there i have a whole section in my book that talks about shielding ourselves from you know exposure to some of that stuff right it's just not healthy right we we take it in and it affects us more than we think and the more that we think we're inoculated to it the less we probably are and i talk a lot about that but um yeah i know i completely agree and you know tara ust it's i don't know i we could probably talk with part of memetic theory is a theory of scapegoating so we probably speculate on whether do quan is going to become a a great scapegoat for a lot of people yeah yeah i do want to get to scapegoating let's take a moment and i think listeners have definitely gotten a grasp for what magic desire is but let's take a moment and actually define it in like in in with an actual definition but i want to start with uh the emojis that you use because if you can distill uh concept down to emojis that's how you know you've like reached the base layer of how to explain something and so the emojis that i've seen you use uh to explain memetic desire are the eyeballs emojis and the balloon except there's two sets of eyeballs emojis so it goes one set of eyeball emojis looking at the next set of eyeball emojis and that second set of eyeball emojis is looking at the balloon can you explain that yeah can you well can you explain like how that explains magic desire and also what mimetics desire actually is yeah it's a great lead way so that i actually minted that baby so the memetic desire is choosing an object not because of any inherent qualities in the object itself but due to some third person who's interested in it or who desires it and who endows it with a special kind of value and that's memetic desire so we're in essence imitating the desires of another person or another group we sort of adopt them or catch them by contagion and the eyes are i think the best symbol of this you know like from the minute a baby leaves the womb studies have shown this they're paying attention to what the mother is looking at and if the mother's eyes are transfixed with some object the baby is instantly interested in that object after a certain number of days at least so we're all we're all still like that that's what we don't realize right we're all still very much like that and sometimes you know the the desire for something isn't mediated by physical eyeballs but now we have technology that mediates desires for us the reason that i chose the balloon with the two pairs of eyes one looking at the other is because the balloon this red balloon represents a relatively insignificant thing it's just a red balloon it doesn't really have much value at all but the right person looking at and also the balloon can like float away and be gone in a second right and this is kind of the nature of mimetic desire so you have one set of eyeballs looking at the balloon and then the second set of eyeballs looking at the first set of eyeballs which are looking at the balloon and that second person the second set of eyes uh desires the balloon because of the first person who desires the balloon and that immediately leads those two people into a kind of rivalry because that second person now has somebody who's saw it first and who's in front of them and creates this weird sort of mimetic situation but the balloon can just disappear in a second and the first person can start paying attention to another thing or another person and we can swap the balloon out with an infinite array of objects an infinite array of ideas and the second person second set of eyes because their their desire is not for the balloon their desire is for whatever the mediator wants um that's what they're looking at they're a layer removed from the balloon so as the gerard calls these models of desire mediators of desire so as that person begins to take an interest in something else so does the so does the second person and there are some people that i think go through much of their lives with very powerful mediators of desire in their life could be an older brother it could be a friend it could be somebody that that we admire who are constantly mediating the desires for for other things could be silly things they could be big things like where to go to college they could be like what dow to join whatever right the point is that there's this sort of triangular relationship between two people and something and uh people that are on crypto twitter if probably is not lost on them that this is more or less how crypto twitter works uh where there are certain influencers out there that are known to have to be alpha and then they have a bunch of followers because the followers are the second set of eyeballs they're the eyeballs that are paying attention to the individual who is branded as being somebody who has the alpha right and so this is why like d-gen spartan has a bunch of followers on crypto twitter and why he gets a bunch of engagement because everyone thinks that he uh that whatever he's looking at is the thing that's going to go up in price which actually sometimes turns it into self a self-fulfilling prophecy um and so this this uh it's so salient and behavior and crypto and that it's it's it's so easy to like once you understand medic desire to like explain almost everything in the world of crypto uh yeah jeffy do you have a thought on that yeah and it's to go so far beyond crypto because i mean i think all the time about the sort of cult of experts that we have and i just had this conversation last week it was i'm about i won't name any names but it was like oh this this person uh on twitter is so smart like you got to follow this person and it's like well how do we know he's smart well i just heard that he's really smart so it's like you know it's like like the the way that reputations are built like also happen in this very memetic way and it's like was anybody actually met this person well um was he getting his tweets from and you know what whatever so i think like people can build reputations in a highly memetic way in other words they can manufacture clout um expertise um alpha whatever um if the first handful of people are modeling the right people are modeling that desire uh in in the right way i've always had this dream of writing a like a a movie a script or a book about somebody that does that like like really well right he just says i'm gonna i'm gonna like manufacture this image of myself and make the world believe that i'm a saint and it i just need i just need the first five people to believe that i'm working miracles and then pretty soon everybody will have forgot who i am in the first place yeah the uh the parable of the emperor wearing no clothes definitely comes to mind certainly uh the other the other thing that you said while you were defining um memetic desire is the baby paying attention to their mom and if their mom is looking at something well the baby knows where to look uh and i can't remember where i learned this fact but most animals don't have whites of their eyes like most animal eyes especially predators and also and prey they don't have white eyes they have black eyes and the the whites of human eyeballs was actually developed as like a communication protocol between humans because if it's the whites of the eyeballs that actually communicate data communicate where your attention actually is and so as humans were going from small tribes of like five to fifty uh there and then as they scaled out beyond 50 or in tribes trying to coordinate uh people the humans that had white eyeballs were able to communicate without words they were able to like see others in tension seeing and see and because we were becoming a collaborative society that information that was being passed while it was disclosing private information about the internal thoughts of that human because we were becoming a more collaborative society that was on average good information to pass and so like you actually lose a little bit of your privacy by the whites of your eyes because people can see what you're paying attention to people can see what you're looking at they can interpret what's going on in your brain but uh be it developed and stuck around as a gene because on net on because on net it was a good thing for the tribe as a whole to be collaborative and to illustrate uh and allow for that data to pass around the tribe so whenever you talk about like the literally the eyeballs i'm thinking like literally the first ever communication protocol that humans ever developed wow well maybe that's actually a good reason to wear sunglasses at night you know right never heard this one before the best reason i've ever heard yeah you know it's just like we're freaky good at noticing those signals of communication with the eyes i mean just think about being in a crowded bar and a man or woman just needs to cast a half-second glance in the right direction and people notice right um you know maybe she's looking at me and whatever so yeah it's absolutely insane i i could tell a lot of stories about you know gerard has this whole story about how there was basically a scapegoating mob that you know through through the looks of their eyes were instigating each other on and they they began the person they were scapegoating his eyes ended up taking like changing color and turning into the eyes of a demon because they were literally transfigured because of the so the eyes play a huge role in gerard's own own work and we we reinforce the desires of other people based on what we're paying attention to so the eyes are just a proxy for what somebody is interested in or what they're paying attention to so i guess as we um disincarnate a little bit as a world um you know what'll take the place of the eyes i don't know if there's anything that will you know quite quite do it as well as the eyeballs did right yeah i don't know where the quote is from but there's a quote that the eyes are the window into the soul all right like it's the thing that you cannot uh hide uh unless you're wearing sunglasses of course um right proust actually talks about eyes a lot so marcel proust um if you read his works they're not easy to read um you know very very often uh he talks about what characters in the novel are looking at and how that inflames passions or desires and other characters and rene gerard said that you know proust was like a master of desire because he understood that that this mimetic nature of desire and not a lot of other authors do rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes writing a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started

switch to the brave wallet download brave at brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started i want to pick your brain on how you think the history of memetic desire in the human species is what the trajectory looks like because uh i alluded to it earlier with web 2 we have this memetic desire like on steroids right like one influencer with a million followers can tell a million people with with one single post what they are paying attention to uh whereas like if we go back to 1500s or pre-internet you know a thousand years ago whenever the like loop of memetic desire would be extremely slow i'm going to go ahead and guess that like fashion trends 500 plus years ago were slower than they are now uh and as as soon as we like inject web 2 like social media protocols platforms like the speed of momentum desire can go faster and faster and faster and so as i was alluding to like the bear the culmination of a bull market as like this loop that's going faster and faster and faster does this like do you see this like acceleration of a magic desire and are you concerned about what happens when that loop is just too unsustainable and are we there yet or like where are we on that whole trajectory do you have any thoughts on this it's almost as if we have yeah our desire our desires need outlets and we seem to be getting better at better at manufacturing desires you know marketers product managers are really good at at generating desires but they have to those desires have to have some place to go and that's so in an expanding economy for instance right i mean the economy is not a fixed pie it's not a zero-sum game ideally we're growing the economy creating new value creating new opportunities when that's happening the beauty of it is that there's there's almost like always like another another thing right another place for desires to go uh peter thiel i think his number one concern has been like so we're now in the situation where we have to keep growing the economy well what happens if it stops growing and memetic desires have to sort of think about it this way turn inward and then we begin competing for the same for the same things so a free market has this natural mechanism of like directing mimetic desire to creative endeavors in projects and entrepreneurship and people starting things it just has this natural way of defusing memetic desire would be one way to think about it so what's going to happen if we don't have an economy that that lends itself well to people trying new things and and having you know the freedom to fail and having some cushion like what happens then so i am concerned is the short answer to your question um i think we we need healthy outlets for memetic desire but on the flip side like we can on a personal level we can do things so that we don't we don't need that um so i see sort of two sides to the coin um i don't have any real you know i don't have policy answers or anything like that i sort of just try to think think to myself like well what what can i do um with me and my family but i think on a on a general level you know we've we've pumped it for so long that it's kind of like the general sort of inflation money printing thing that we're seeing in our economy like that's basically what we've been doing we've been printing memetic desires and eventually something's got to break something's going to give right right so as the economic pie grows there are more destinations for there are more objects for us to pay attention to and even though the loop of memphis desire is going faster at least there's an outlet for people to deposit their energy into and that can turn into fundamentals but then as the economic pie contracts more people stop paying attention to like the margins and and more people start paying attention towards the center right like the and there's less innovation and so we have to probably look more towards fundamentals at like what is real and all of a sudden the things the fundamentals of the world have a lot more eyeballs on them therefore becomes highly competitive is it my tracking here you're totally tracking right there's like there's a convergence of attention on certain things and i would say that that's already happening on like a political level because like we sort of have like really boring politics not a lot of new ideas so politics is ahead of the economy in a sense right like it stopped generating any new interesting ideas a long time ago and what has happened well there's been a convergence on like three issues like moral issues and that's like all we talk about right and like that's there's something that seems not healthy about that and i think something similar to that is going to play out in in the economy we're just going to you're going to see an increase of conflict as people become concerned fighting over whatever the same space is the same jobs there's going to be less entrepreneurship there's going to be less people um i mean there's simple economics too right there's not going to be as much money to go around to go start new things um but also we're going to end up losing sight of the opportunity to create and i think that's already happening right i see people running for the hills in my opinion this is a great time to start something if you can um people are running scared and people are medically medically following them to the hills and for those that stay you have an opportunity to build some really cool stuff right uh this it seems to map on to just general market cycles really really well as in we have times of growth and we have times of contraction and memetic desire plays like a leading role in that as in like if everyone's looking outwards then we have innovation we have development we have entrepreneurs building stuff and then once once medical desire turns inwards then we create a recession and so but it also seems that like memetic desire is the leading indicator of this as in because it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy it might actually determine what is i mean i guess like you can't get away from stuff like the fed raising interest rates um but also the fed will raise interest rates as a response to too much investment on the periphery right if the moment desire is in like weird monkey jpegs and that's not going to put food on the table the fed is like okay well like people are paying attention to crazy stuff too much so let's raise interest rates to get them to pay attention to like the more fundamentals of the world any thoughts on that yeah i mean i i think that that's that's a great way to explain it you know people have money um because we've been printing money and they ha where are they going to put it right i mean people don't want it sitting in a bank account it's got to go somewhere um that it at least has the possibility of some kind of a return so yes people begin to deploy it in more peripheral peripheral places and there's sort of a natural process that has to play out some of that deployment of capital results and really cool things that get built and a lot of it just simply gets washed out and that's just part of the way that the market works but i think part of what a contraction is and what the fed does when it raises interest rates it almost is like a refocusing on fundamental things um you know you see like a16z is like talking a lot about infrastructure and let's build and all this stuff right now and like that there's probably something good and healthy about that and a reason why it why it needs to happen but in the meantime there's there obviously there are wonderful things about well there's not wonderful things about both phases because the second one is very painful but there are a lot of positive things that come out of that experimentation that we're able to do um when we have extra cash to play with extra capital to play with yeah right right right um there's the there's the quote that some p some people don't like this quote but i'm gonna say it anyways there's like uh good times may or like bad times make good men good men make good times good times make weak men and then weak man make bad times and again it seems to like a map on to uh people build and so then people look outwards at to the frontier and they build stuff on the frontier uh but too much of that uh put like there's too far of a supply chain between the fundamentals and the frontier and if people are building too far out into the frontier that supply chain gets stretched and so then people get called back to towards the center and then when people go back towards the center that's hard times because we have to split the foundation amongst a wider part of society because the frontier got contracted and then this like cycle goes forward and forward and forward uh i'm wondering uh the whole like memetic desire thing very much feels like breaking the fourth wall like you're not supposed to break the fourth wall like you're we're all supposed to be just like part of this memetic thing and just let it like wash over us but like have you thought about like what happens when people enough people understand medic desire and start acting on that assumption on and on that understanding of medic desire and like if too many people understand that there's this fourth wall that we're all seeing how does that shift like how does that shift people's attention have you thought about this well i i have and you know gerard has thought about it too and it was very apocalyptic in some of the things that he said and we know it's kind of like well you know there's not as much the name of his magnum opus is things hidden since the foundation of the world okay and what are some of the things hidden well the memetic nature of desire and the violence that it often leads to so i i don't know how to answer this question without transitioning a little bit to the conflict and violence and scapegoating stuff because it's a huge part of the answer right um so we would say one of the consequences of memetic desire that humanity has been mostly unconscious of for the majority of its history is when memetic desire leads to memetic violence so that is when people get together and through a kind of memetic contagion blame somebody else for a problem and scapegoat that person they'd expel them from the community in times past they would kill them they would lynch them whatever just horrible horrible things that have been done to scapegoats throughout humanity and gerard says that that the process that leads to somebody becoming a scapegoat is a memetic process like how else can you explain how it's um all minus one against one like like every everybody except one person begins to turn on on one like he says that people don't arrive at the conviction that that person is guilty on their own they arrive at that conviction through a memetic process and they arrive at the desire to punish also through a medic process so the root of scapegoating violence is mimesis it's a memetic desire few things are more memetic than uh anger then aggression right um like you see in a baseball game uh you know as soon as one person rushes rushes the pitcher and the second guy it comes out of the dugout the third fourth and fifth come out and then the rest stream out and you don't want to be the only guy left on the bench that didn't go out there because then you're going to be the one with the problem so right you didn't you didn't help your team you're the new scapegoat right so that's to me is a very simple illustration of how this sometimes works and gerard says that it's it's usually we've done this without really knowing what we're doing but now we tend to know that we do this and the gerard said that that's actually kind of dangerous that we know that we do it and this is a kind of little tricky to understand but the scapegoat mechanism as horrible as it was he says was like humanity's it was a social innovation that kept violence from spreading because you know we they people could identify a person expel the person and they would create this little temporary piece in a form of catharsis and then you know people could go go back on doing whatever they were doing so it actually had like a it was a release valve so it had a utilitarian function and you know he says this is kind of the root of a lot of ancient religions i mean there's a they sacrificed in order to bring peace um so that they didn't just all turn on each other they had to sacrifice somebody and it gave them the solution of peace now we sort of know that we do that right like like with cancer culture like we sort of know there's not the unanimity that there was before like it's not like unanimous like we we all agree on this we're very divided about it and we also can see that it's happening and we can call it out so we're we're this is a weird way to say it but we're deprived of the of the usefulness of the scapegoat mechanism doesn't work anymore the way that it used to so just as you described how the cycles of memetic desire are speeding up faster and faster so too are the cycles of scapegoating violence because they they don't last very long cancel somebody online and the catharsis or whatever that that produced doesn't really work the way that it would have i don't know you know 50 years ago or something doesn't so we we're constantly we're in this accelerating train and gerard says we we either have to renounce our our memetic tendency to do this or it's just going to lead to bigger and bigger scapegoats which is a pretty scary thought right there and there's always so many parallels to money and finance uh which i guess it makes sense because ultimately money and finance are properties that exhibit out of the brain uh and so like the when you say like the uh the process of catharsis just gets weaker and weaker the more we do it and the faster we do it like my mind goes to the federal reserve printing a bunch of money and then it prints more money and then prints more money but then the newer money doesn't have the same impact as the older money and so they have to keep on printing more money and that creates hyperinflation which is like a it's like a great like having a hyperinflationary invent is terrible like everything like capital gets destroyed like people go hungry everything gets like completely the the slate gets wiped clean and also i'm glad you brought up how this is part of religion like also a part of religion or is the concept of like jubilees where like we just like wipe the state clean we just like start over things break like some some more and um uh societies uh had like regular jubilees like every 10 to 20 years because they knew that they needed to like wipe the slate clean every now and then there's too much pent up underbrush uh and so we needed to like burn the underbrush to make sure that we didn't like burn down the whole forest uh and if we're if we're we're saying that like we're in this phase where like fiat currencies are getting hyperinflationary um uh i mean we're seeing this right now in the markets today uh and then also like other fiat currencies of the world are have already been hyperinflationary argentine peso venezuelan bolivar uh the japanese yen is like at the precipice of becoming hyperinflationary at the same time we're getting like this uh the this um fight over like like canceled culture is rearing its head the democrats and republicans are fighting over like two or three things like it all seems to be very much tied together and so it seems to be like this general society societal uh like crescendo up until like a big crash uh and that then there's this concept of like the fourth turning which i don't know if you're if you're familiar with but it's like in in the crypto space where like no one really knows how or why or what event is going to trigger it but everyone feels like there's like a jubilee coming where it's going to be painful and then we're going to wipe this plate clean and then we're going to pick up again from a new and then the cycle will continue um yeah it does feel that way doesn't it it feels that way in in more than just crypto in general um i think people have this really foreboding sense which there's an element of reflexivity to all this too right it's like when we begin to feel that way like we sort of bring it into reality like with a market crash for instance um yeah and you know the jubilee is a great example we need those they're really important and uh i think the as the the role of formal organized religion in society is really going away it's or certainly it's very diminished i actually think that we need rituals that we need those like what's going to substitute for that jubilee where you know deaths were cleared you know slaves were freed all all kinds of stuff we really need to do that because that was a release valve so what's what are we going to substitute i am a religious person still so but my my question to the culture is you know what what are we going to do with without those sort of forms of of ritual of remembrance it's actually one of the most important things that religion does is it helps people remember things right it's like you know every single uh if you're a christian for instance like every single week you know you're forced to remember the scapegoating violence right and like what happened and the fact that you're a part of it so when we don't remember as a as a culture or in our individual lives we we just tend to accelerate the same cycles that we're part of if we forget so the the you know plato calls that anamnesis that read that that remembering is important and you know how are we going to do that so i i just think that that's that's the big question for me so how does since you have shattered the fourth wall for yourself and for everyone that has read your book and listened to your podcast how have you changed your behavior as a result of your mimetic desire fourth while being shattered like what what do you do differently now uh to help i don't know like stave away the negative effects of mises from from your own person um i take my personal jubilee um festival retreat every year which means you know me basically locking myself away in a in a monastery in italy for five days um now you know not everybody's going to do that or can do that but for me it's a reset it's a total reset and it feels like a lot of my entangled desires and entangled relationships this all seemed to come to light to me and i i always leave that retreat week that i have um knowing what i need to do you know for for the next year i mean bill gates has a think week that he does every year this is like my desire week it's it's a week for i actually try not to think at all i just i'm just i'm totally silent no device is nothing it's total silence i mean sometimes i go crazy after the third day but by the fourth and fifth day um things bubble up to the surface for me like desires i had that i didn't even realize that i had and then i see some of my silly um what i call thin desires like highly memetic desires um just become like apparent to me they reveal themselves for what they are and they look kind of [ __ ] stupid sometimes and i yeah and i just i just i see them as as ridiculous as they are like um you know i i have open conversations like with you know i'm able to call myself and you have to like be able to call it out when you see it especially in yourself you know so you know there are times with my in my relationships whether it's business partners my wife my family whatever it is where i i'm just aware that i'm behaving in a memetic way or like my my instinct is to like you know i don't know send the snarky email right back to somebody or something like that and i'm like i'm not going to do that so adopting these sort of anti-mimetic behaviors which starts with recognizing when you're being memetic and it's the same thing with like some of my market behavior i wouldn't have made a very good trader uh when i worked on wall street i was on the investment banking side but i'm uh like i just have like strong memetic instincts and i wouldn't have probably made a very good trader because i would have been i would have reacted um really strongly to what's going on and what other people around me were doing and saying and you know i know that about myself so much this just comes down to self-awareness right and i am able to take like build in little anti-mimetic trip wires and into my into my life right that prevent me from from doing that it's interesting that you know it's built into the stock market right the stock market falls like seven percent on a day it's almost like we have built-in trip wires for memetic designers spiraling out of control you know so like what how do we how do we do that in our in our own lives like how do we put the sort of the the stop cells on stuff and um you know it's going to be very different for everybody certainly yeah and it feels very much like mindfulness meditation uh where are you alone when you go out to your retreats is it just you totally yeah yeah no cell phone no no cell phone no computer nope nothing nothing connected to their outside world which probably makes no sense i used to i used to do it with with with a group of guys right a bunch of other guys that were with me but we didn't talk at all right if we wanted to go on a hike together it was silent and we'd have to slip a piece of paper under the door to be like hey you know like meet me on this hike and it would be a silent hike we wouldn't talk and we would eat together but you know we wouldn't all as you would hear it's a super weird experience or like the clanking of spoons against the soup bowl and stuff so yeah total totally alone i mean and for me that's part of that's part of it and yeah i mean i i do think that spending and i try to do it every day too right like you know when i wake up take a half hour half hour before i go to bed i don't think there's any substitute for that space right making that space um the temptation is to try to like i don't know to try to build things or to sort of like mimetic desire but i've i've never found that that stuff really really works very well um because all of those things just give me like another outlet to to exercise it if that makes sense um the uh i was thinking well you were talking about that um uh like uh buddhaism being a buddhist buddhism is that what that is yeah buddhism thank you uh it's like trying to be the they get the absence of desire right and so i think they were probably tapping into the pitfalls of mimetic desire without actually being able to name it right like if you can remove yourself from desire you can remove yourself from the tricks of desire uh and so like there's something like religion doesn't really have a much of a science behind it but they get the gist of things really really well uh and so like you don't need to like write into code e equals mc square to like start to behave to to codify the desires of just humans and in consciousness uh religion kind of gets it uh even without putting it into into scientific terms yeah i mean buddhism does that and i think that stoicism which is a pretty popular movement right now has a similar spirit right um in terms of you know desire being a source of suffering or most desire being something that we need to sort of you know neutralize um that's not my position at all because i i've found like i i want to desire more actually like like i want to desire like the things i want to desire certain things more and i want to desire other things less that's the way that i think about it right um like i want to you know desire to be with my dad more right so it's it's a strange thing to to want to sort of like do away with it or to view desire as a negative thing because memetic desire can also be tremendously positive so like one of the tactics to go back to your last question is surrounding myself with people who want things that i want to want like we normally think of our friends and you know people and our spouse or whatever as you know we often don't think a lot about what they want but if memetic desire is real then what they want is going to dramatically influence what we want so just being really intentional about you know the kinds of people that i'm around like i told myself for years that i didn't want to work so much on the weekends and you know no matter what i did i couldn't stop doing it and it wasn't until i met a couple of people including my wife who don't have that problem um that i was you know i was able to my desire changed right but it was almost like i couldn't change my desire on my own just by thinking about it or telling myself what i wanted i actually needed to be affected in some real way by other people right yeah i think maybe let me know if you agree with this or not but it's you what you just said to me is uh you are trying to harness and get control over the inputs to your own memetic desire so rather than having it be like some random instagram post or somebody that you saw on the street you want to control your own inputs as to the what influences your own medical desire so you want your wife to influence your memetic desire so you want your kids to influence your memetic desires and absence of those things you just want to desire the things that you truly want to desire which is in my mind like the absence of momentum desire and so i think that the trick is be in control of your inputs of mental desire and then also make sure that you also understand what you uh what you truly want yourself um in isolation rather than from like the rest of this massive amounts of noise from society as input totally yeah controlling inputs is really important you know it's funny we're talking because just just a couple of days ago i had my team call all of the people that i follow on twitter down from like 20 000 to 30 you know and that was part of like is it possible for me to use twitter in a less mimetic way right to make it more anti-mimetic and to be very intentional and i literally started tweeting out every single person i'm re-following why i'm re-following them because i was like if i don't know why then i probably should be following them um and so that's that's a way that's my way of being super intentional about the inputs and then also that i'm creating a gap between stimulus and response so brene brown talks about this a little bit like like the three second like she says earlier in her life you know there was no gap between stimulus and response right it's like something happens i immediately respond with you know drinking or whatever right so like as we go through the course of a typical day like i think one one skill that i have learned or at least gotten a lot better at than i was in my in my 20s is i just have a gap between the stimulus and the response like even when the inputs i can't always control the inputs right i mean i go out to some like crazy conference or something like that i can't control all the inputs but i i do have sort of a gap of between the stimulus and the response where i can choose i can be intentional um you know i can put my my sort of mark of my self-possession on on whatever the choice is and own it rather than just complaining that you know i'm i have to do all the stuff that i don't want to do there's an element of taking ownership for for your own desires um a lot of people don't think of desires that way right we think that we just we want what we want and we don't realize that well some things that we want we have more authorship and ownership over than other things right some things we didn't choose we just want that classic example would be like a kid who follows this path to go to school and become something some career path that they hate and they realize that at no step along the way did they ever consciously choose that it was just a desire that they just never questioned it was given to them whatever their friend's family they just dis-indoctrinated and they never stopped and questioned it so the basic process is just examining your desires and then taking steps to actually own them yeah i think probably a way to test whether something is because there's the meme of uh of highly materialistic society a highly consumer society is just like buy that thing instagram ad buy that thing instagram ad buy that thing buy that thing on amazon it can get to you literally in the next eight hours so just buy that thing and i think if it was if you bought that thing under the influence under the influence of medic desire you would receive that box you would have that dopamine from the box you would open that thing you would use it one time and then you would put it down and never use it again and it would never bring joy to your life ever again that you were under the influence of medical desire if it was actually something that was you you would receive that item and then every single day you would engage with that item and it would spark joy for you every single day on a reoccurring basis over and over and over again that i think is the symptoms of you being in control of your desires and actually being attuned to your own desires uh in a in a good fashion how do you like that yeah and it's the origin the origin of that could still be a nomadic desire i just bought i wish i wish i had it here with me so i could hold it up i just bought a real piece of artwork um and the the reason that i took an interest in it was because the desire for it was modeled to me by somebody that i think has a really good eye for art and brought it to my attention and i ended up buying right and it was but it was me like recognizing not an impulse i went back like three days later um it was me recognizing that oh like i definitely you know want it because of this reason um but i i eventually sort of like made it made it my own and i find a great deal of satisfaction so it's not it's not either or is the is the only point that i'm trying to make right it's not like there are certain desires that are anti-mimetic and other desires that are memetic things can start out as memetic we live in a mimetic world we're social creatures were influenced by all kinds of people but i can make things my own to a greater lesser degree luke mimetic desire good for society bad for society or neutral good good for society you know gerard would say that memetic desire is what makes us human that animals don't don't really have memetic desire they engage in memetic behavior like with play for instance they don't have memetic desire and memetic desire represents like the human longing to know other people to like to understand what other people want to transcend ourselves and without mimetic desire we wouldn't be human and i've always found that really powerful i i think some people misunderstand what i'm saying and you know we're talking about medic desire and it can come across as a negative thing i spent the whole second half of the book really talking about how it can be a positive thing um maybe some people just didn't get there but i so i think i think it's a positive i think it's a i think it's a tremendously positive thing it just needs to be it needs to be harnessed in an intentional way and the the analogy that i like to use is like we didn't have a medic desire we wouldn't do anything you know we would just wouldn't we wouldn't be very interesting um but it's like gravity right like gravity is a force that works on us works on our bodies and if we don't exercise it eventually wreaks havoc on our bodies right we'll start when we're older we'll have knee problems we'll have spine problems because there's a force that's constantly being exerted on us and mimei systematic desire is the same way we can learn to develop certain muscles in response to it and that can actually help us um and and help help us you know lead the kind of lives that we want to lead i mean there's no escaping there's not so you know the decision is what are we going to what are we going to do in this mimetic world that we live in right luke thank you so much for coming on
