[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today particularly bullish on nfts today i don't know why but i just feel that way yeah me too this was definitely a bullish episode we kind of cover nfts from soup to nuts like starting with what they are and why they're valuable and like getting into the psyche of collectibles and why humanity has valued those for thousands of years so what were what were some of your takeaways yeah i think my biggest takeaway is like when we talk about ethereum we talk about d5 we talk about all these crazy new things that we are building it's easy to forget that we are often rebuilding things that have come before us right like we are not recreating finance we are just we we are just taking the old paradigms the old primitives and redeploying them on ethereum and nfts the conversation around nfts is very salient around this like humans have been collecting nfts for as old as time right we just didn't call them nfts we called them other things so if you collected pokemon cards when you were a kid if you played yugioh uh baseball cards beanie babies coins stamping stamps yeah all this good stuff like the concept of scarce goods is written into our human dna right like we understand scarce goods and i really really liked the line from andrew where he said like he thinks that the worlds of nft as a val as a market cap is going to be orders of magnitude larger than d phi and the same sense that like property and items are way bigger than finance like the the the total addressable market for just property is is massive and so that's why andrew's particularly bullish on this industry yeah those guys are super bullish and something about this feels a lot like d5 and i don't know 2018 2019 where like stuff is getting built it's bubbling it's below the surface so it's still kind of a niche within a niche within a niche yet you see the the organic material here for something really incredible to be built and you're not yet sure when this is going to bubble over and become massive you know for for d5 in 2019 it took a year for things to start bubbling up and getting some mainstream attention uh and i wonder if the same thing is going to happen with nfds whether we're a year away whether we're two years away whether we're longer but certainly the gentlemen the guests that we had on our show today are ultra bullish in this world and they eat breathe and live in it every single day also what was cool i think is um they really left the listener with with some action steps some things that you can do next to get a taste of the nft world um and it's it's far bigger than i thought like there are a lot of things that you can do today it's primitive it's kind of nascent it's a little clunky in places but you can see the potential there as i'm looking towards the the d5 world and yield farming i'm expecting that energy to kind of die off at some point right like be it like two months from now or two years from now like that energy isn't going to dissipate so when i'm thinking of like a long-term bull market i'm thinking about things that kind of pick up the slack things that add energy when energy is needed right like when when the yield farming runs out of gas what adds gas back into the fuel tank of the bull market and the nft phenomenon thinks i think that is like the next step right and we need to do ryan another episode on nfts because there's it's such a rich world and we really only scratch the surface one thing that i'm really particularly fascinated by is just the massive amounts of intermediaries that get cut out between an artist or a value producer and a value consumer right like in the in the legacy world with uh with music artists there's like seven different intermediaries between the listener and the artist right and that ends up making the the listener experience the listener can't express their value to their artists their artists can't receive the value being expressed by the listener because of all these intermediaries and i think the nft industry is something that can really just streamline the connection between value producer and value consumer without having a bunch of middlemen we definitely talked about that at a high level in this episode but i think it's definitely worth going into in in future episodes so here's the takeaway guys this is the frontier chris breninski in our episode with him called the land of ethereum infinite white space and i think there is an infinite white space for the growth of nfts here and you know with that david why don't we just get right into it but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic bankless sponsors that make the bankless nation possible one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up blockfolio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do with zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zappa reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswop forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed banklessnation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to adai which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith car tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store alright guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with andrew and jacob all right bankless nation we are super excited to have our first two guest episode on the podcast we're gonna be talking about nfts today are they the next big thing is this the thing that's going to happen after d5 hopefully we will find out with our next two guests the first is jake burkman who is the founder of co coin fund he's also an engineer he's a long time crypto investor we've gotten him to write bankless articles as well so he's he you know three things at the same time and also andrew steinwald who is the founder of the fermion fund he invests in the metaverse which we'll be talking about today what that is he also writes one of the best newsletters i've found that covers the nft space it's called zima red welcome to the show jake and andrea how are you guys doing yeah doing great so happy to be here doing great thank you so much for uh for having me guys are nfts about to blow up they're kind of blowing up already right so so you you you know we were talking a little bit before the recording about how defy is killing it and recently zapper published some of their uh some of their like website statistics right about how many daily active users there are and how many monthly active users there are and everyone kind of thought like oh you know there's probably a few tens of thousands of people in d5 uh but the month maus at zappa were 300 000 which is surprisingly high and the daus are something like 20 000. i think that's august numbers i i'm here to say that the numbers for nfts are not far behind so i wrote a blog post a while back that looked at the total number of unique addresses that used openc and it was april 2020 the stats were roughly 20 000 totally unique wallets on openc and openc is the number one nfc exchange in the ecosystem right now there are others but um so i looked at that and i think that that's you know people that you trade nfts they have usually more than one wallet just like how people in d5 have more than one wallet so you know at the maximum i'd say we're around let's say 10 000 to 30 000 active participants in the nft space right now so you know there's a lot more space to grow especially if we're looking at d5 numbers which jake just mentioned is 300 000 and we're if we're looking at total active crypto wallets which i checked up just because i was curious about that number in 2019 i forget which month but it said i think it was 42 million total active crypto wallets so the the total you know market growth potential here is absolutely massive yeah dave and i were talking the reason we wanted to host this episode is honestly nfts feel somewhat like d5 felt back in a year ago right so back in 2019 you know around this time d5 d5 was kind of on the cusp you could see a lot brewing nfts feel like that right now i'm not sure whether they will burst in the same way that defy has lately but those two things are certainly uh super interrelated um but before we get too deep i feel like we should just spend a minute to define nfts we're using this like you know um this acronym uh nfts of course stand for non-fungible tokens but what what are nfts maybe jake we could start with you well nfts are non-functional tokens what that means is there's um there's some assets mostly we we see this in kind of currencies and stocks right where each unit of the asset is exchangeable with any other unit of the asset so if i have one ether you have one ether i say you know so if i send you one ether and you send me one back will you is that a fair trade absolutely um we're willing to do it in non-fungible tokens you have a plurality and diversity of different assets and they're not all valued the same so for example cryptokitties right some cryptokitties are more rare others are less rare more common um and so the rare ones are going to be worth more non-fungible tokens captures that idea and i think as we'll discuss it extends um it extends it to not just art not just collectibles not just crypto kitties but to a broad spectrum of uh of different assets that could be understood that way yeah i think jake hit it perfectly well i i like to describe non-fungible tokens as unique digital assets so unlike bitcoin and us dollars that are totally interchangeable my use dollar is the same as yours and my bitcoin's the same as yours it's worth the same uh nfts they can be basically let's use an example from a video game if i have an nft sword that i won from defeating some boss and maybe it's called you know flaming sword number one then you come along you also defeat the same boss and you get that sword but you have flaming sword number two so even though they might have the same stats they're totally unique from each other and in theory the market should probably value mine slightly more because i was the first one to defeat the boss and i you know have the number one sword and that's just the example from video games but most nfts that we see today are just completely uh unique assets from virtual worlds to collectibles to game assets and etc so i think the average listener even if they don't know like what an nft is in the way that we're talking about it they are still familiar with the concept of an nft and nft is just kind of like in the d5 world we like to put in confusing lingo and nft is definitely one of those things but people should really know what these things are like andrew you gave this great explanation of like a it's a sword that you found in a game it's some some loot that you found in your favorite video game but in the real life there's more to it than that like art i think and you know renaissance paintings and marble sculptures things that you know there are only one of and that one thing has value uh this this is something that has been as is this is something that is as old as time uh can you guys go into kind of the the the relationship that humanity has with what we now are calling nft yeah so i guess um yeah so you know throughout forever people are always trying to verify the authenticity of certain goods right and that's just been the case since probably the down of man and what what we're seeing with nfts that are attached to real world items today is usually they're they're sold as certificates of authenticity so i can buy a physical piece of art and then attach that maybe they'll they'll attach some sort of nft or you know send me the token so it's kind of a certificate and i think that there's a ton of use cases that will spawn and there are already some today that basically sell these nfts and then on the background they're redeemable for the actual physical good so what we see on openc there's a company called i think it's like wiv like with or something and they're selling cases of of wine from france i believe and you're able to actually purchase these cases as nfts and i believe you're able to redeem uh the actual nft for the actual wine of course you have to pay shipping and whatnot so it's you know it kind of you run into the same issues but with the traditional uh traditional inefficiencies of physical goods but right now the use cases that are really exciting in my mind are kind of these completely digitally native things but we're definitely seeing a huge use case and what will be a huge use case is um the more traditional physical goods with nft certificate certificates of authenticity and that can be anywhere from like rare watches to wine as mentioned or rare cars and all sorts like the entire collectibles market is becoming digitized which will unlock just so much value and be able to make people feel a lot safer transacting with these items it's kind of weird that the humans have always collected things like this so i had a i had a neighbor growing up who used to collect um cars like classic cars and when you think of the value of a classic car it's it's not valuable for its utility function it's not valuable because you know my neighbor could use it to go from point a to point b on his commute to work in fact he like left his cars in his garage and never drove the things but they had some collectible type of value like what is that is that just something inherent in uh inhumanity that we um we treat scarce things that are unique uh that have some kind of nostalgic value as as valuable like we do this all the time in the physical world and we're just kind of porting that same thing into the digitally scarce world that's what nfts are right jake do you have any thoughts on that i do um i i think if you kind of dig down into the human psyche it kind of you know i think it kind of boils down to two things it's like value and ownership there's this great talk that that has influenced me over the years so much from andreas antonopoulos i think it's called the future of bitcoin and i think it's from 2015 and somewhere in that in that talk he mentions you know like if you perform an experiment where you put some some children on a deserted island they'll naturally develop ways of transferring value to each other they'll start collecting shells they'll start start collecting pretty rocks and flowers and they'll basically start using those things as a currency so in you know i totally agree i think like there's some aspect of you know embedded in in people that want to encapsulate the idea of value um in in an asset form and then the idea of ownership i think extends that right there's something also innate in us that you know that likes property that likes the idea of being the sole owner of a thing um and on the internet like this is a view that i kind of have come around to lately um i heard adam b levine talk about it on on one of these calls that that i was on recently but but he was basically saying like if you think about um digital content on the internet um you know one view is that is that we don't really own too much of it right like we we maybe own the content that we create but we we certainly don't own the content that we consume right so if you're um borrowing an ebook from from amazon or you're watching a movie on netflix you don't actually like own the thing you kind of own the license to to view the thing for a little bit of time and what nfts allow you to do is just like all you know blockchains enable this like strong personal ownership of assets nfts allow you to create strong personal ownership of of digital content and i think that's like a really really interesting view and the reason why i think that is because as an investor i'm looking for markets that are high growth and what i'm observing about this market of ownership is that it's like very liquid right it's not it's not out there there's not a lot of secondary markets for for digital content and that's because primarily the ownership of these things is not owned uh in actuality kind of by the people by most people and so what happens is when you when you take nfts which are digital assets that enjoy the benefit of all the advances we've made in blockchain like dexis and liquidity and trading and you sort of start to unlock this asset class of digital assets you create a bunch of value and unlock a bunch of value that before was completely internalized right and so it spills out onto the markets i sort of share that take right so if uh this is sort of what i've kind of concluded after being in this space that the thing that humanity unlocked with the birth of crypto in 2009 with with bitcoin first is digital scarcity like if i if i could kind of sum it up right so the internet gave us digital communication but what crypto gives us is the ability to have scarcity on the internet to to create inject scarcity into our digital goods and that's closely as he said associated with uh ownership and and property rights and they're all kind of interrelated but before 2009 we didn't even have the ability to have a digitally scarce good every good could be copy and pasted but through this mix of cryptography and economic incentives humanity has essentially unlocked digital scarcity and everything's kind of falling out from that like there's this game uh civilization i don't know if i used to play it as a kid right so you kind of level up your civilization and know that the civilization has discovered writing the civilization has discovered mathematics and now physics and you know now the nuclear weapons oh gandhi's going to war with your civilization right like that's how the game's played i really feel like humanity has just unlocked digital scarcity and all of these things like nfts are just falling out of that what do you think of that take jake is that the big discovery for crypto when i started thinking about nfts i actually started at the um you know the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy because i was trying to understand how digital art sort of meshes with uh with this idea of digital scarcity and what i noticed was that you know if you talk about physical art like if you talk about the mona lisa it's a very uh it's a very solid problem to answer the question like where this art is i know exactly where the moon is where the mona lisa lives right it lives in the louvre um on the other hand when you start to think about digital art this is a you start to fall down this like philosophic rabbit hole where you kind of don't know where it is like is it in the creator's like photoshop like is it in the email where he sent it to the gallery is it in the box of the gallery what you realize is that digital art is it doesn't have like a place where it lives it's just sort of like a concept it kind of like lives in our minds and then it has like different um you know actualizations of that concept which might be like a copy of it on my computer or phone or something and what actually blockchain technology and digital scarcity do for for art philosophically for digital art and ephemeral art is they find a place for it and that place is on the blockchain you you know like exactly where where it is like and who owns it and so that's kind of like where i started um in thinking about it and then as we develop the idea of digital scarcity you kind of realize that that strong ownership of it also enables you to you know be entitled to the rights that owners are entitled to and these rights might be the right to hold the right to sell the right to lend the right to collect the royalty stream uh on this on this work uh the movie rights to this work and so on and so forth and that's where the view of uh what we call liquid ip or liquid intellectual property kind of comes from one of the favorite ways that i've had bitcoin described to me is that bitcoin is this uh ledger of property rights for these 21 million units right and you know people can perceive these units to be whatever they want them to be but the property rights ledger of bitcoin itself is so incredibly valuable that these 21 million slots right these 21 million like parking spaces or just like units are so incredibly valuable because of the value of the property right system that is bitcoin that that it turns into like btc as money right and what ethereum has done is it has generalized this concept of like digital scarcity and it's it's actually a funny little statement that i that i like to to say in my head is that you know ethereum has made uh scarcity abundant right and so while bitcoin is this this one like monolithic property right system ethereum is this property rights platform right a platform for property rights and what nfts are is this uh you know this very specific instantiations of one very specific form of property right and ever since you know ever since we human humans moved out of like 100 gallery societies and into like settled lands where capital and property therefore was established we have been like property owning beings right like our the one of the ways that we perceive and and share and grow wealth is through property right and so i'm just particularly bullish on like ethereum just as a generalized property rights management platform yeah no i i absolutely love that ethereum as a property rights platform and you know my whole thesis is that non-fungible tokens enable a true metaverse to form because they give us property rights right whereas before as you mentioned like on in the digital world we had zero property rights and you could copy and paste and you know print unlimited things and you know property rights are the basis of all basically successful economic systems that we've that we've kind of seen today and um i and also going back if you kind of think about you mentioned the hunter gathering days like even back then people were collecting shells and kind of collecting stuff and um taking ownership of these kind of goods and it's really interesting to see that maybe we have some like innate human you know piece of us that likes to collect and likes to have property rights over over certain like items and so i think that ethereum as a property rights platform is just enabling the entire virtual world to have property rights and uh that is going to open up the door to our it's you know people call it a mirror world or a metaverse where whereas before we could you know we could build whatever you want in in the virtual but you couldn't actually own anything now we can transfer our entire society that we've built in the physical realm and port that into a digital and that is going to create an entire you know society that's completely uh virtual you know it's called the metaverse but yeah that's that's why i'm so excited about this and i think you hit a spot on with ethereum being the the platform to do all that what do you mean i've heard you say this before andrew the metaverse right so is the metaverse basically a virtual world um like with property rights or is it describing crypto how do what is the metaverse in your mind what what do you mean when you say that yeah so i like to to say that the metaverse is just a virtual environment that people live work and play in so you know it can be any sort of uh it can be on a computer it can be in a vr headset it can be you know i guess zoom is some very very simple form of the metaverse you know obviously for a true metaverse you want to be way more immersive and also you want to have property rights in there but this is like ready player one basically exactly yeah and i think that there is no there is no one singular platform that's going to be the metaverse it's going to be kind of like the internet where you don't say like oh google is the internet or facebook is the internet it's just kind of all these things together create the internet and it's kind of my opinion that you can't have a metaverse without something like ethereum for property rights because uh you know if let's say facebook made a really great virtual environment where people could actually earn money and stuff like that well at any time facebook could delete your account and delete all your items or even epic games who are very you know kind of pro user and kind of pro you know they want people to you know have more freedom even if they created a metaverse and enabled a lot of this it still wouldn't be real unless the users actually had true property rights where epic games no matter what could not delete your stuff because if they can then it's not it's kind of like living in i don't know like the soviet union back in the day where you know you couldn't really uh i i don't think you could have too much too many actual property and um your your options for business and whatever were very very limited so that's why people want to move to america or or some other country with stronger property rights so they can you know build a business and thrive and i kind of see that with any any virtual world or platform that utilizes ethereum or other you know other technologies that enable digital property rights that's when you start to get the first inklings of a metaverse all right so when you watch something like ready player one and you're seeing like um you know the avatars run around they're collecting coins and they're grabbing items and they're you know getting things that have value and they have an inventory yeah they have an inventory you're saying all of that is basically registered on some sort of crypto economic blockchain system like ethereum yeah and i would say i'm actually pretty blockchain agnostic which is funny to say i mean right now ethereum clearly gives the the biggest advantage in terms of property rights and real property rights i don't really think you know platforms like um you know i don't want to cause controversy but you know there's other chains out there that don't provide the same guarantees that ethereum does i mean obviously there's there's issues with ethereum scalability and whatnot but i'm confident those will be solved but you really have to have some system some blockchain-based system or distributed ledger system that enables these rights so it doesn't matter what the chain is that you're using what matters is that these these property rights are guaranteed by the network and that they enable this kind of metaverse to form well we're okay with a little bit of controversy right david so um like something like tron right with like so or something like uh eos with maybe you know 21 block producers who can censor your transaction what you're kind of saying is that's a less valuable property rights system because it's it's much more centralized much more subject to some third party control than something like the ideal state of ethereum is is is that kind of the case so like we we have to have a credibly neutral property right system whether that's ethereum or something else that's what you're more bullish on is that what you're saying yeah so you know um for me it doesn't i'm totally blockchain gnostic as long as you have true property rights because my goal is the metaverse right so how will we get there doesn't matter i just want to be certain that we have true property rights and right now ethereum is by far the the leader in that and yeah i think that there are some issues with you know things like eos just personally i think that there's some uh issues with having only 21 because in theory there could be some group of people that kind of take control of that and then your your property rights are have get you know those get diminished and uh so that would hurt kind of the metaverse thesis so yeah in my opinion ethereum is by far the best uh option today so there seems to be a lot of excitement around nfts right now like in the last few weeks or months or so what is generating all of that hype like what are the platforms that people are excited about that people are paying attention to right now i'm super excited about wearable wearable has done some really interesting work in the space lately and last couple of months this is a team that that i've been working with all year and this is a project that has has just demonstrated that having crypto native uh models for ownership and property rights if you will guys um you know and also a token model can be an incredibly powerful way um you know of of bootstrapping a marketplace and and basically what happened is that at the at the beginning of july uh wearable um announced that they would be launching rarity token and this token would be airdropped uh to users of nft so if you have a ethereum wallet that has bought or sold in nft in the past you can go on wearable.com um and there's a little section in the top bar where you can see if you're actually eligible for ferrari they also implemented a volume mining program marketplace liquidity mining program which means that if you are a verified creator on wearable or if you're a buyer of assets unrearable you'll actually be rewarded raritycoin um on a weekly basis and and this is shown to be very powerful i like to say that you can buy people's attention but it's very hard to buy people's loyalty but the way that you do the latter is you you give them equity right you you you make them a partial owner um of the platform that they're using and this is the core value proposition i think of wearable as they head down their decentralization roadmap and what we've seen is the success of rari has been um has been extreme just in the last week or so um you know they really captured a lot of the imagination of crypto artists and a lot of them just moved to rare wearable and started minting there um on-chain volume is up dramatically and it really feels like uh governance tokens for nft marketplaces is now sort of par for the course um in that space it's it's really so something like rare bull is really building on this concept that we've been talking about a lot on bagless and the d5 space of of like yield farming right so is it uh what i guess money legos from d5 is wearable really leveraging to uh to create the success you mentioned well i'd say the liquidity mining program um gets transferred from from the defy context into the marketplace context um and and it's a little bit of a it's a challenging problem right because um you know in sort of in d5 what you do is you you kind of contribute capital and in return for your capital you're able to earn an apy so you're taking some smart contract risk you're taking some market risk um you know you're taking some risk of the volatility of the asset that you're earning and when you go into the marketplace context it's a it's a similar idea and and the the abstract idea is you know if you if you're an active participant on the network you earn rewards but even more than that you earn ownership of the network um but the activity that you do in order to to earn that uh reward and ownership is a little bit different and that activity is basically transacting uh on the platform so i would say what wearable has done so far is they've sort of repurposed a little bit um kind of the liquidity mining programs of defy into these marketplace binding programs and there's actually a few projects not just wearable but a few marketplace projects and out there today they're they're doing it one other example is what what zapper is building but what we have seen is that these programs make a profound impact on these marketplaces who are bootstrapping we've seen it in d5 as balancer investors and now we're seeing it in nfts uh as the wearable marketplace bootstraps so something like wearable would that have been possible so you mentioned yield farming right and that's kind of a just that's just like three months old ish in d5 although you could argue synthetics kind of in you know pioneered it in d5 um but that's kind of a newer trend but would something like wearable be possible without other d5 components like say a decentralized exchange protocol like uniswap or is it really um building on top of some of those other pieces in d5 it's absolutely building on top um so what we've seen is you know if you rewind like six 12 months ago you know the the profile of your average uh token project that was coming to market was something like this oh i have to wait to get listed on an exchange um it might take me six months to do that it might take me a year to do that i might have to pay a million dollars you know in china to get listed right um and then after i get listed there's no guarantee that i will have great liquidity um there's no gear i might have to hire market makers i might have to wait for my market to form for another six months another year and really the onus of getting a liquid token out there historically in blockchain has been really high even though the quote-unquote time to liquidity enabled by blockchain has been really low now what we've seen this year is just the explosion of the centralized exchange and that you know i've said this on a few programs recently but if you look at the daily volume of kind of crypto broadly it's right now it's something like 100 to 130 billion dollars a day and and if you look at the kind of the major dexes and the volume that they're doing they're doing something like 500 million to a billion dollars a day and so really we're just just under like one percent of utilization of of the addressable volume in blockchain but even with that the time to major liquidity has basically gone to zero if you have great incentives in your project if you have um you know if you have a popular brand then we have seen this in the last months that that just tokens come out and they have um you know very very interesting and high levels of liquidity almost straight away in wearable's case was immediately after the airdrop they got to something like 300 000 to 500 000 of daily liquidity and this was just on balancer and just on uniswap and as um as the airdrop kind of proliferated to more people as more people were uh marketplace mining you know the asset um and as the audience of rarity token increased they got up to like six million dollars of daily liquidity uh and i haven't checked recently but we can we can pull it up it looks like yeah just about two million two million dollars of liquidity in the last 24 hours but we also have some pretty high fees on chain these days andrew where are you seeing energy in the nft space yeah i i think uh jake hit it perfectly right there when he was talking about wearable releasing their governance token and you know everything all this really started with compound launching their comp token and then d5 just went absolutely crazy and you know myself looking from the entity space i was like damn you know i wish i could get you know learn more and be a part of it and you know thankfully i i do listen to you guys and so i i understood like the basics but i wasn't really getting deeply involved but now what we're seeing is all these teams from the nft space that you know especially wearable being the first one they're all now kind of looking at these different token models and what they can do to kind of bootstrap liquidity and bootstrap activity and and whatnot what i think is really cool about governance tokens particularly in in kind of games and virtual worlds is that i remember growing up people would always say like oh man i wish i could uh i wish i could add this feature to this video game or i wish i could like you know implement this thing in this game or whatnot and what we're seeing or what i think is going to come out soon is that people will be launching these governance tokens for virtual worlds or games and the users themselves will as jake mentioned before have skin in the game so they'll feel really really entrenched with that project plus they'll also have input on the direction of the platform which that's that's never really been a thing before i think that's that's incredible because you have this fun experience you know you're you're maybe building something in this virtual world and you're really enjoying it and but there's this one feature you really want to be implemented well you can go get you know all your buddies together and talk to them about it and go vote on chain and then kind of kind of push that forward so i really think we're going to see a massive explosion of different nft projects taking what the kind of the best aspects of defy and then launching that within the nft ecosystem you guys pay attention to the nft world perhaps more more than anyone and there are some really exciting really uh very real platforms like wearable that that are out right now but what is on the horizon that also excites you guys like what what is coming what that we know is in the pipeline that uh you guys are really particularly excited about absolutely yeah um so so if you if you kind of check out our thesis that we published on nfts it's called all digital content is going on chain and what we're really trying to make the point there is um that it's not just art it's not just collectibles but you know we can extend to a really broad spectrum of things and so the question becomes like well what's the next thing and we're starting to get hints that um you know that on nft platforms today there's at least one i believe it's mint based where you can actually create a music nft and there are some artists who uh like connie digital who who i love um he's he's been doing kind of nft digital art but recently he's also been publishing music in the form of nfts so you get the sense that um you know we started kind of at collectibles then we went to art now we're going to music um and there might be other forms of creative expression that you know that can be tokenized this way so um foundation comes to mind right where uh where artists are able to uh tokenize some of their physical goods and in the form of digital assets and sell it that way can you talk more about foundation because i think that's super super interesting right and um you know another related uh project we've talked about on bank list is zora we've had some artists like releasing nfts on top of those things but many times these are redeemable for physical goods in some cases but but just talk about what foundation what zora actually is for us if you will jake i you know i'm i'm not an investor in in any of those companies that you mentioned i just kind of been following them from a distance but it does seem like um you know if what foundation is trying to do you know they're on their front page they say this is culture stock exchange and it's really like going back to that fundamental idea that um you know the digital assets um should be out there in the world as liquid freely transferable freely tradable assets and what kind of assets are we talking about um creators have uploaded uh some of their graphic design uh they there was a there was actually a recording artist who who i think he dropped either track or an album um you know in this way and again like my my broader thesis is that all digital content that you kind of come in in contact with on the internet it you know will eventually be tokenized in this way and there's some like really obvious kinds of content right there's there's the art there's music but there's also the the not so obvious kinds that we probably didn't even think about tokenizing yet and and i think of things like tweets right you know it doesn't it doesn't quite make sense to tokenize tweets yet because twit twitter is a centralized platform but you can imagine that in the future um social media is gonna decentralize quite a bit right and in that case the users will own their content they'll own their posts they'll all know their insta stories they'll own their tweets and there are certain tweets that are culturally relevant right like you remember the elon musk's tweet about taking tesla private funding secured um it would be a curious exercise to try to see how much a collector would maybe pay to own that kind of cultural content so so jake here's right i got to ask a question because some people are skeptical of this sort of thing when it turns into digital right because like the question i i can i can tell is in a lot of listeners mind when they hear you describe something like that like owning elon musk's uh famous uh tweet is what would an owner actually own right so like anybody who has access to twitter can take a screenshot of that tweet or if it's something like digital art anybody can take a screenshot of that digital art transfer it anywhere print it out if they want right there might be some copyright infringement involved in that but like i i guess what the heart of what i'm asking is if you were to own something like a tweet or a digital art what do you actually own you only uh if you ask me you own the the intellectual property rights to that content but does it doesn't the tweeter own that tweet in that same way i believe so and so he he is the tweeter is free to sell it that's how that's the genesis of it like if i'm a there's no there's no um abstract difference between writing a tweet or writing a 40-page essay if i write a 40-page essay and it's my own work and it's my research and somebody wants to reprint it they must pay me money right like i own the intellectual property to that essay um a tweet is sort of edging toward the kind of silly side of the spectrum a little bit because a tweet is only 280 characters long but there's no difference between me writing an essay or me writing original content in a tweet do you agree yeah so i agree but so one thing that we've done is something i think that's subtle but i hope bankless listeners paid attention to because uh when we start to use words like intellectual property we're talking about settlement that happens at in a different place right so the great thing about uh crypto and blockchain is a settlement of a transfer something like bitcoin or a transfer of eth happens purely on chain so it doesn't really like you actually own the eath that i send you jake if i send you some eath right um you don't require the legal system of a nation state in order to verify that i have sent you eth or appeal to a nation state you you actually own it your private keys have access to that eth what's different about the intellectual property case that you just made is that kind of appeals to the legal letter uh the legal layer outside of the um the blockchain so it's not purely settlement like you just transfer some representation of a legal right and the legal right still settles in meat space is that is that a difference here though like because that's kind of what i'm getting at like are we just actually talking about iou type tokens for legal obligations if so that's interesting but maybe not quite as interesting as actually owning you know the thing the bearer asset the the answer to that is complicated so um i would say that you we could get so the high levels we could get to a place where we can enforce or potentially get to a place where we can enforce those kinds of rights on chain and so you will have like the strength of guarantee that you will have in this context of intellectual property will be quite similar to the strength of guarantee that you will have in you know bearer asset level ownership of something so let me just say that i don't think we're there yet um as we get there i think that we will sort of naturally engage uh meet space legal systems like it's happening already if you guys know the lao right those guys have done a great job of marrying a delaware corporation together with a decentralized autonomous organization for the purposes of starting a venture fund um and there's also like a really interesting opportunity here to take a look at what aragon's been doing and maybe integrating some sort of off-chain agreements but in a way that is enforceable on chain so aragon is a project that you know if anyone doesn't know it's it's sort of um getting at the fact that we do a lot of global commerce but we do not have a global jurisdiction on the internet to settle disputes and using autonomous organizations and and blockchain technologies what we can actually do is we can have companies interact on chain and when there is a dispute it can actually go to an on-chain court that exists today it's called aragon court and so i would say like in the shortest term right i think people in the nft space will be engaging meet space um kind of property rights and intellectual property law in various jurisdictions and there's a lot of precedent for that now um you know in blockchain and sort of beyond we will then go to uh or at least try to go to a sort of more broad kind of global jurisdiction that is on chain and you know that's very speculative i don't know if it will happen i hope it does i think it would be like a completely fascinating experiment i think it would make global commerce so much more efficient and we could talk a lot about that but but but eventually i do think you get to an enforcement of guarantees that is uh just as on chain as you have with with ethereum ownership yeah i i'm sorry i'd love to take a crack at trying to kind of talk about how you know just screenshotting something and you know because a lot of my buddies say oh well i'll just screenshot that thing and therefore you know it should be worth so much so you know so and so because just this uh just last night one piece of crypto art just set the record it was sold for a hundred and one thousand dollars and i was telling my buddy who's not really that into crypto and he was like oh well dude i'm gonna screenshot that and then you know i'm gonna sell it andrew what is it what was that pizza it was matt kane's piece it's called um something about time i forget the actual title but uh matt kane was the artist he's incredible crypto artist and he sold it on the platform async art and he sold it to the collector token android who i'm also very good friends with so i'm really really happy about that for all parties involved but um and yeah so what can that person do with it at that point they can display it they they own it i guess it's uh certified in the blockchain maybe you're getting to that yeah so tell tell me about your friend's skepticism because you know i'm curious too yeah so so you know everyone always says okay you can screenshot it therefore you know how is it worth anything if i can just screenshot it therefore i you know i own it right and it's kind of like you know this is not the best kind of argument but i i kind of look at okay the mona lisa as jake mentioned earlier like you know that is the one mona lisa someone owned you know i don't know actually who owns that but that is the one i could have a mona lisa exact copy hanging in my in my uh family room but no one's gonna really it's not that important it's not that cool right because people are like well that's not the real one right and you know if you look at southern bees because i was doing research on this i was like okay why is crypto art so exciting why is not just screenshotting it actually you know do anything but sotheby's they have 10 kind of factors that go through what gives our value and three of the things that really stuck out to me were authenticity so you know determining whether or not this this piece of art is fake uh rarity which is you know that's self-explanatory and provenance which is the historical ownership record of that item so if when you look at those three factors authenticity rarity provenance and you you you look at something like a blockchain this is like the absolute best thing ever for for uh items being being kind of traded on that it's like a whole network that that has built in authenticity you can tell exactly whether or not you know if it's fake if it comes from the correct contract the rarity you can look on chain and see exactly how many copies there are maybe it's one of one maybe there's a couple of them maybe there's prints and then prominence i can see oh my gosh you know vitalik he used to own this nft and now i own it and you know it's worth so much more because of italko and blah blah so i think what gives stuff value is very different from uh the factors in that are different from okay i can just screenshot it and hold it you know save it as a file on my computer sure you can do that but it doesn't mean it's valuable and so i think there's a very direct correlation between that and i think blockchain solves those key aspects of what drives value so perfectly one thing that kind of strikes me as you're saying that andrew is like it could be the case that like older generations just never get this right so i i don't think my grandmother for instance or maybe even my parents will ever understand why that piece of art you just mentioned sold for under over a hundred thousand dollars right digital art i don't think they'll ever understand that but like they understand why the mona lisa has value because they they grew up with you know that being sort of the the cultural expression of of value do you think it's the case that it's going to take younger generations possibly growing up with this and kind of a sweeping societal movement for us to start to see authenticity and providence and rarity in digital goods that are registered in the blockchain like it i i just something about it it doesn't feel like it's going to happen necessarily for older generations but maybe like a a gen z is just going to grow up and it's going to feel supernatural what's your take there no you have a great point right there i when i speak to my mother about you know bitcoin and ft's and stuff like that she's you know she's like oh very cute like i don't know what you're talking about yeah a little brother little sister i think they're you know what 16 and 20 or you know around those ages i should probably know more but um yeah i talked to them about this nfts and crypto and stuff and for them it's totally natural they're like oh of course you know that thing exists like you know why would it not so i there definitely is a generational gap but if you look at just the progress that we've made with bitcoin in the past you know what what is it 11 years now um that is that is incredible because back in 2009 2010 no one really or very very very few people thought okay you can have a totally native uh digitally native asset that exists you know within the internet somehow uh how can that have value and and now fast forward you know 10 years whatever um people across the whole world think think that you know this thing is highly valuable right being bitcoin and so i think it is going to take a lot a lot of time it's going to take longer than you know i would prefer but that things just kind of happen like that there's a lot of mental barriers that people have to get over but once they do once they see the activity and once they hear things like a hundred thousand dollars for this digital art people get really interested and that interest drives more people into the ecosystem so it's just kind of like it's going to take time for sure but i think that the activity that we're going to see is going to really you know make the space much more approachable in the future so one of the big value propositions of of meat spate nft which we can call art right and and there's a big dividing line between like uh legacy nfts which like it's like you know paintings uh statues uh you know some some sort of art some like rare kind of clothing uh you know the supreme bla the the supreme brand has really leveraged this and so they're the as i said in the beginning of this podcast the concept of nfts is as as old as time it's just we call them different things but digital nfts um i i'm still going to like rehash this skepticism because i want to just double down on this a little bit when you purchase art right like i have a painting in my room right and it's in my room and no one else can can see it right i'm the only one who can look at that painting and enjoy it right that's and it is it's mine because i own it and that same sort of art doesn't have that same sort of like exclusivity as something online right and so that's why i think people are going and taking this screenshot or if in the case of like some of the gifts that are available on wearable some really cool gifts that artists have put like a ton of time and labor and work into the owner doesn't really able isn't really able to have more like exclusive enjoyment over these things than anyone who's just visiting the website right and so while we can say that the value proposition comes from the intellectual property that seems more to maybe closer to kind of something of like a a cop-out uh cop-out um uh rationale at least in comparison to what we are used to with legacy arts okay thanks um so just uh i would say like move the mental model to recording artists right so if you take if you think about um taylor swift and if you think about how popular she is and if you think about how she's been one of the recording artists who has really stood up for artists intellectual property rights what does that actually mean financially well it means that taylor swift owns the royalty streams to her music and what she would be able to do in the future with blockchain technology and nfts is essentially take an album i think her recent one is folklore i know my girl my girlfriend's a huge fan and basically tokenize each song and also therefore tokenize the royalty stream to each song so you can imagine like whenever a song of taylor swift plays on the radio somewhere um your nft position in that song accrues uh kind of a instant revenue right and so once you frame the nft in this financial way then it becomes just a financial asset it becomes something that you can value it becomes something that has a measurable revenue stream it becomes something that is susceptible to traditional uh financial modeling and um and then price discovery becomes like relatively easily and so this goes to the point a little bit that there are actually there's a gamut and a spectrum of different kinds of assets in nft world and when you're talking about something like a cryptokitty i think like the value of that is very subjective or if you talk about art right like different people might be willing to pay very different amounts of money for the same piece it's a very subjectively valued um you know kind of item and then when you go to things that have cash flows like like royalties on music and movies or even the rights to kind of classical artworks but whose business it is to be lent out to galleries in exchange for money right like when you can frame those values um as future cash flows then i think the situation kind of dramatically changes and then the value of the of those assets yeah you kind of touch upon if you own a piece of art and it's hanging your house you know you kind of you can enjoy that and no one can kind of i mean something could i guess but people won't come in your house take a picture of that and like hang it up in there in their house i mean that'd be weird but they could so it's kind of like touch upon exclusivity and i think there are a lot of people that are working on trying to figure out how we can make nfts kind of more exclusive and kind of uh not so people can't just go go and see it in your wallet and go into you know this area and see it and whatnot and for example there's people that are building um it within virtual world so like there's a virtual world called cryptovoxels there's on a plot of land you can have uh you can put up your art there or put up any nft that you own on your on your walls to kind of you know design your house and whatnot and so i think that people are building these access tokens and only people with the access tokens can get access to that to that parcel can walk inside that piece of land so i think uh in that sense you can have this space that's only for you or whoever has this access token and then you can put your art up there and yeah people can see still see it in your wallet but people are also working on solutions from what it from my understanding work on solutions to kind of hide the assets in your wallet um so in that sense it would be totally you know no one can see it it's only you and it's very exclusive because a lot of this too is about uh social social signaling right it's it's almost about like the trophy case we create and i think that's what we're getting at andrea is like you know we're creating these uh ways to display nfts they're not here yet but like so part of the value david you were saying you you got was actually looking at the art piece right for a lot of collectibles it's it's that personal enjoyment but it's also like i'm wearing a rolex right that means something that says something about me or i've like i'm in a in a music video and i've got the gold chain and i want you to see this collectible like on display uh because it it says something about how important i am or like you know how much money i have or something like that is that kind of what you're saying andrew that these like these cultural trophy cases almost for nfts have to be built first before we start to see those sorts of social signal displays yeah you know it's it's tough to say so basically i i'm a kind of a big believer that like the whole world runs off of social signaling like everyone just kind of uh throughout their lives just try to kind of social signal to each other and kind of do that for this reason and that i think it could be because of some tribal you know monkey stuff that we have from way back in the day but i'm not quite sure but i think um if you read so there's a guy named eugene way and he wrote this blog post called status as a service which basically talks about humans how this nate's desire to signal status and right now social media is the best method for people to signal status because they can post on instagram they can post on facebook et cetera blah blah and people are kind of seeing someone's personality and how wealthy they are and how cool they are based off these pictures and so nfts in my mind take this to an extreme level because you can see exactly what someone owns and that's like a whole imagine if i could go into your house and kind of look at all your objects like it's a little creepy but um it's a whole other way to signal status and and i i if you could if you could see exactly when you bought something so if you were early into some project or early into something then you could show oh i'm so cool because i'm so early or you could kind of show hey i'm rich because i spent exactly you know 100 000 on this on this asset on this date right so you could show to everyone that how rich you are so i think that nfts are going to kind of evolve into this um social network type of deal because they're the most efficient means of signaling status and at the end of the day i think human nature is mostly derived off of status signaling i know it's kind of kind of deep kind of weird but that's kind of how i feel no no i absolutely love it there's a there's a thesis that i i just love to to talk about uh that's outside of crypto and it's called the costly signaling theory and it's it's a it's a theory as to like how uh mate selection and sexual reproduction in humans and all animals like kind of what it's based off of and uh people the theory is that people will go to very far ends to signal that they have done something costly right and so like artwork in your home that doesn't you don't need artwork to live right like that's not helping you get food on the table and so what you are doing when you have a bunch of artwork in your home is you're signaling that you have excess resources and you can afford such things right you know this is why peacocks have such gorgeous feathers right like it's a massive signal that this peacock has the excess resources to be able to produce these things uh for me my personal costly signaling theory uh hobby that i get into is plants right like i have a ton of plants around my house and that's perhaps that's my way of signaling that i have resources to be able to maintain like a garden right like a bunch of plants and so i i do totally agree with you that humans love to find ways to signal that they have resources available to them and i think nft and perhaps an nft art is like the new digital medium for achieving this goal guys tinder is about to get really weird if everything is true oh my god wow so what we're talking about but i love that stuff all right we were talking about like so the metaverse of the future is going to have these influencers with like trophy cases of nfts that they've purchased that previous influencers have owned and that sort of thing right that's what we're talking about yeah i mean we're already seeing kind of the the nft whales and the ecosystem they're um they're extremely popular and you know there's a lot of creators uh and that's something i would love to talk about is how nfcs are really helping creators but um you know these nft wheels they come in they purchase tons of nfts and everyone can see that and it's very very apparent and uh and people people kind of love that and they hold these empty wheels in very high esteem and i i've noticed like a psychological difference between nft whales and maybe this is personal but nft whales and kind of crypto whales so no one really knows who crypto wills are um you know because obviously with traditional crypto you're you're dealing with an order book and not people and nfts you're you're just dealing with people all day right because you need to buy assets from an individual it's not just sold on some order book and so one thing i've seen is that these nft wheels are are kind of becoming the influencers of the of the ecosystem because they're the ones spreading the money out spreading the wealth out people love them because they're buying their stuff and um it just gets everyone really excited and and yeah i i think uh i i yeah we're kind of seeing the dawn of of crypto influencers now within the ecosystem and i think that the the people that are putting large amounts of capital down into the space are going to be um kind of these weird new social media info i don't think they use that term but yeah you're kind of right jake earlier you talked about the possibility of of tokenizing a a song right and then turning that into cash flowing royal royalties which is uh you know evaluating that is something as old as finance itself right and so the the bold case for that makes sense to me can we talk about the bowl case for nfts as it relates to creators like what what can this do for the average artist right like the the record the labeling industry uh the the media industry the entertainment entry industry is just full of middlemen and rent seeking and and perhaps even extortion what can an nft industry do for in my opinion it is a hugely democratizing technology um for both buyers and creators um for buyers i think um let me cover that quickly so so you know historically like art has been you know like like traditional art has been used by sort of rich people as a tax haven right um to store their their wealth and stuff um and what i think nfts do is they open up a global marketplace for for art starting with digital art but i think it does kind of um come out from there into other forms of art including physical art and it lowers the price point of art and so if if someone who is a um you know someone who is a retail buyer uh who maybe didn't have an entry point into like quality uh art in the past you know they might be able to do so in the space but i think like more more interestingly it's on the creator side that the democratization is is um is really apparent and really dramatic and um i think on the creator side first and foremost um i think what we do is we open up this middle market of of artists who really have never even imagined that they can use um the internet as a as a marketplace for their art in this way so there's certainly people who are artists who put their uh their art online to showcase their talents but most of the transactions that occur in art are not online they're not they're not transacted on in that way and so what happens is the when we create these marketplaces like wearable and others and we create like a lot of we create them in a global way what it does is creates a lot of liquidity for artists to actually go take their talent and convert it into money and what that does is is it creates sustainable opportunities for people who want to be artists who who who have a desire to have this be like the primary activity or the primary work of their lives to actually go and do that and like one of my favorite examples is there's a there's a crypto artist named um yali rodriguez she uh to my understanding is someone i've never met her in real life i just know her from twitter but but she comes from new jersey i grew up in new jersey as well um you know and she basically was one of the first crypto artists to join an investment that um that coin fund made in an app called additional additional is essentially you know a social media feed kind of like an instagram but where you could take and upload um kind of visual content or photographs or artworks and then it would help you turn those into nfts and and elitsa just tweeted the other day she said um oh i remember kind of the first artwork that i sold uh on additional and i was actually the the buyer of that work now since then uh eliza's uh you know she's made a ton of work ton ton of crypto art um she's been on a bunch of the platforms that are out there um she sold a bunch of work and my understanding is that she's now uh essentially a full-time crypto artist and just like giving people the opportunity to do that is amazing and i think she said the other day that she's actually applying to like a digital art program at this point and making that official so so i think that creates incredible impact and there's a totally untapped market like like if you guys are like me i like to use instagram as a basically as a as a tool to browse art and i often you know i'm browsing i find really cool stuff and i'm like i would just pay this person like i would just tip them like 10 or 20 or something just for creating a piece of art um you know that that i really that i really like but i don't even have the opportunity to do that on instagram you absolutely have the opportunity to do that on platforms um that are that are blockchain based well it's kind of a way to invest in artists too right so basically like um you know what what was picasso's early art sold for like you didn't have uh any any fame or he wasn't well known so probably very little but what were his later pieces sold for right so like if you invested in picasso art in the early stages of his career wow what a return that's really cool yeah absolutely and and we see this in the kind of crypto art world which is probably about i would estimate it and andrew maybe you maybe you know or more statistics on this but i would estimate about like five thousand to ten thousand people who are um identifying as um you know as as crypto art kind of creators um and what you see is that they get like really encouraged when they when they find out that they can actually make money from their work um one of the you know i run first edition.xyz which is a digital art gallery and one of the first artists um that we featured in the gallery is called oh savage this is a gentleman who's a um an immigrant from africa he lived he lives in dallas um his job is to is to drive you know um jesus he's like a ambulance driver right but his passion is to make art on his phone and he uses all of these different apps and ios um photoshop and and different like glitch apps to like put together a different piece of art we put a we put together a virtual art opening for him in crypto voxels and he sold a piece for i think it was about 350 he absolutely couldn't believe it it was you know an amount of money that was um significant to him and he was encouraged and continued making art in the space so how much room is there for these artists right like is is this kind of like a a professional sports uh type of environment where just the top one percent are going to be able to actually turn this into a job or is this something closer to the the rise of streaming where everyone wants to be a streamer and everyone can like a decent number of people can generate a living off of of streaming like what what is the like total addressable market that you guys think about when you think about this type of of uh revenue generating uh platform i i think it i think it gets democratized like like my mental model and this is not just nfts i think this is um kind of media broadly right we used to be in a world where we had these like very few uh but very famous people like if you think about michael jackson's fame um you know michael jackson was someone that at the height of his career was known in like every continent of the planet you could you could literally go anywhere and show anyone a picture of michael jackson and they know exactly who he is um so they were like fewer influencers and their influencer influence was very very high and where what happened was that with the invention of the internet we've sort of sped up um information right we we've sped up distribution and i think the net effect of that has been that we now have many many more influencers but those influencers are smaller in the sense that they serve kind of smaller audiences or more niche audiences or more specialized audiences and of course like the example of that is you know youtube the example of that is podcasting and i think in the same way we can apply that principle to uh to these to these marketplaces for for digital content i think we will have you know this curve kind of flattened out a bit and there will still be you know extremely famous like crypt artists we have that today but there will be this like much broader opportunity for someone to come in and find a niche and a set of people that they serve and who are interested in in their creative process and their work um and have still the opportunity to make a sustainable income so i think that's very interesting yeah if if i can kind of go off that a little bit so i i think that the total addressable market here within the nft space is just absolutely massive because what i'm what i'm saying is that you know we're essentially going to make a mere world of our physical world and so so many jobs that exist are going to kind of be ported to the metaverse so to speak and so many metaverse native jobs will be completely created that we don't even know what you know they didn't even exist before like crypto artists was not really a job before this and i i think they were really entering the kind of the age of the creator because before we had you know the analogy that i like to use is that before the traditional crypto uh sorry traditional art galleries they kind of controlled the media rails and the financial rails of an artist's kind of life right they had all the connections to the magazines they they had you know they took 50 of the commission from the sales and they knew all the collectors so with the internet the the creators of this stuff could suddenly now um control their own media so if i'm an artist i can have an instagram i could have facebook and i could build my own audience to gather my own media and get my own kind of fans but it still usually would have to be sold through a gallery so there's still that 50 commission and still you know they had all the contacts now with nfts the creator has the media side because the internet and they also have the financial rails in their power because of because of the blockchain right and so now you have access to a uh the the the distribution of the internet which is you know 24 7 world worldwide billions of people plus the the financial power of ethereum which is a 24 7 global uncensorable financial system right so so that's just absolutely incredible and i think that the yeah we're really kind of in yeah as i said before the age of the creator and what was also interesting is that you know the early web i guess actually the webinar now i suppose it was really about as jake mentioned communication you know like blogging podcast video yeah really really communication skills but now with nfts that we're actually able to create digital things it's all about the builder so it's like if you're if you're an artist if you're like a 3d cad designer if you're um you know i don't know artisans of all types right and so we're seeing that this next wave of creators are going to you know inhabit virtual worlds or create beautiful pieces of crypto art or whatever and uh you'll have people building you know there's people today in like worlds of crypto voxels that are being paid thousands and thousands of dollars per each build that they create and so we're seeing all these jobs uh be created that didn't exist and so i think the total adjustable market for this is just just ridiculous what's what's super cool about this of course is when we digitize things like digitizing money with uh ether and die and bitcoin then it also becomes uh programmable right so that's something that that can't happen in the physical world the meat space world of you know physical collectibles and when we make stuff programmable particularly assets it allows us to do some really cool things almost like weird things jake can you talk about some of the weird things that people are able to do with nfts particularly when you combine things like fractionalization and and other d5 primitives with nfts what sort of weird combinations are we going to see yeah so fractionalization has been an interesting um trend that's kind of already in the market in various ways there's a project out today it's called ark.gallery i don't know if folks have seen it but basically um the idea is um you want to buy a crypto punk but the crypto punk is too expensive and so what you do is you find a bunch of friends and you crowdfund it and then as soon as you have enough money uh you can go go ahead and click the buy button and purchase it right as a result uh people will own sort of fractions or shards of that of that work in proportion to the capital that they contributed and so that's kind of an application of i guess you would say you know decentralized crowdfunding to the idea of joint ownership in nfts i think it's so jake this is the idea like back to david's uh painting or his you know his bedroom and i'm really curious what that is by the way david so maybe uh you got to send some some screenshots of it after but like i could own a piece of that right we could take that nft item that painting and share the ownership he could give some to me he could give some to you jake you could give some to andrew and we could all own a share of that that's what you're talking about with fractionalization right that's right and and what in practice the way that it looks like today is basically you're taking an erc721 non-fungible token on ethereum and you're fractionalizing it into an er c20 fungible token ethereum so you will own like shares and you know and whatever the nft represents but because it's an erc20 it's able to use all of the existing you know trading and liquidity and d5 infrastructure um that already exists on ethereum and is able to deal with a fungible token so you could put it on uniswap and start trading it get a market price you can put it on unit and so this kind of there's a few things to talk about here like maybe let's go to kind of the liquidity right so one you know one thing about non-fungible tokens is the complexity of pricing them right because every single non-fungible has its own sort of unique character unique value unique set of people who who appreciate and value it and so unlike fungible tokens the class of non-fungible tokens has always been a more illiquid asset class now in blockchain we have this amazing set of tools that allows us to try to solve problems like that and say you know how do we uh make these things more liquid and fractionalization has been exactly one of those um methodologies right it's like if you have something that's uh non-fungible and a liquid you take it you fractionalize it you put it on unit swap and then maybe you can develop a market there over time and actually create liquidity in this thing there's also for me there's kind of a philosophical question here because you know there is uh nuanced differences between owning a crypto kitty like by yourself and then owning a cryptokitty in conjunction with i don't know 200 other people right and you know when you have direct sort of bearer asset kind of ownership as we talked about before um you can very quickly make decisions like i can transfer this cryptokitty i could sell it i could lend it i could do something with it i could i can um you know throw it away whatever it is but when you are a shareholder in a cryptokitty things get a little bit more complicated because now it's not just that you can make that decision unilaterally you need to make that decision in conjunction with the other owners and so fractionalization of nfts actually motivates decentralized governance and governance systems which is a totally different area of blockchain but but you know in my mind some of the questions there are like and andrew maybe you have you have thoughts on this as well um you know is fractionalizing something actually making it a little bit less valuable because those fundamental transactions the ability to move to sell to to lend are now subject to this kind of onerous governance process yeah i mean we're at a stage right now that is so early that in my mind i'm all about hey let's just experiment let's let's give it a try let's see what happens and so um you know me personally i kind of believe that i would like to own my full nft but i i definitely have some shards of different nfts i've definitely experimented and i think it's very cool i can see it being a huge use case um but but you know personally i like to own but and going off this kind of fractionalization concept there's a platform called async art which makes uh you know they meant nft art from these incredible artists and what's cool about it is that each piece of art is can be made up of multiple nfts so for example if i there's a picture of like a sailboat and it's sailing in the sea and it's sunny out um i can own the masterpiece which has the the main pieces of of this art piece you know the imagery of it and then someone could own what's called a layer so it's a secondary piece and let's say the layer is is titled you know background background piece or whatever and so i and i have two options for this layer because the artist has created two options artists can make whatever they want it's fully customizable but so i can change it from sunny or i can change it to stormy right and whenever i want because i'm the owner of that layer right so so even though the person has the masterpiece then the actual piece will will be changed online so whoever's viewing it we'll see that change reflected and so that's really really interesting where we're seeing um these nft pieces be kind of built on top of each other like little lego blocks and that different people could own different aspects and actually change the piece in real time i think that's really really exciting it seems like what you guys are also saying is that like as the d5 space grows all of the things will be that d5 builds will be composable with this whole nft asset space and they're going to kind of grow together uh which is which is super cool on the same rails but i i want to ask the question of uh about mainstream appeal so um some people thought nfts were going to take off uh quicker than they have right in a lot of ways there's been tremendous progress andrew you mentioned um you wrote a blog post in bank list how he hit a hundred million in nft sales uh back in july so it's a hundred million that's you know not too shabby i would say but uh like it also at the same time hasn't caught on as quickly as some might have hoped so for example when are we going to see a game studio like epic incorporate nfts into a major game like fortnite i mean that hasn't happened what has to happen for something like that to happen when are we gonna see a celebrity like kanye west release some exclusive yeezy type product on crypto rails why hasn't that happened yet andrew maybe we'll start with you on why some of these things haven't happened and why nfts haven't gone mainstream yet what we're missing yeah on my podcast i ask everyone what is the biggest barrier to adoption in the nft space and the answer that comes up every single time is just the kind of the ui and usability and having to deal with metamask and all the kind of traditional crypto you know barriers right and i think someone said metamask is like the fox keeping out any kind of normal you know metamask being the fox keeping out any normal people from entering the nft ecosystem it's kind of like that barrier and i think once we can get over that initial hurdle of people being able to um just buy nfts with like a credit card and there are a lot of people working on that but you know buy a credit card or just with a simple bank transaction stuff like that um or you know being able to easily acquire a theorem and acquire a die and purchase with that once we get over that big barrier then i i feel like then the whole space will be totally opened up because just by virtue of being games or game-like things nfts are way more um they're way more appealing in my mind than traditional crypto because you know again it goes back to when i'm talking to my mother about bitcoin she's like i don't understand and i'm saying like down with the banks you know the fed and she's like i don't know what you're talking about but i can tell i can say hey you know i play this video game and i can actually earn money from these in-game items that i have she's like oh i get that right and so i don't need to tell her about all the aspects of why you know bitcoin's great blockchain's great i'm just like hey i can play a video game and i can earn money and so that has absolutely massive appeal and that's people that play video games are generally younger and so you already have this like great portion of the population that's like primed to adopt nfts we just need to make it easier to get in but once they do i feel like it's going to be it's going to be just an absurd absurd situation it's sort of absurd in a good way and we've already seen like the first project to try and leverage this right like god's unchained i i love that game and i used to play hearthstone i never really got into magic the gathering but gauze unchained is a fantastic game that really doesn't require too much uh crypto ethereum defy experiment experience to really be able to have fun with and they are leveraging nfts in exactly the way that you would expect them to to their fullest yeah no exactly guys in chain is a great example because i've never played a trading card game in my life i didn't even really understand the concept and i started playing gods in chain and i loved it and i wasn't exposed to crypto and you know the crypto on the back end i thought that was an amazing user experience and i thought it was great but what you know what we saw was that the actual trading of the assets was kind of hurt by the gas price and that's kind of why it's you know kind of diminished in use of you know recently because you know if you're changing uh or trading a card that costs a dollar and it costs you a couple bucks to send it you know that's going to hurt but again it goes back to fixing these these kind of traditional issues that we have in traditional crypto and once we get that that's done then i think we'll see much more more players into the space and and going off of the you mentioned the triple a studio when we're going to see that i think from what i've heard um there are a number of really big time you know traditional studios that are working on uh games that utilize nfts but their number one hesitancy and this is what i've experienced speaking to a lot of these people is is ethereum and the gas price and so they're trying to figure out okay you know there layer two solutions can we go to a different chain or you know kind of what's what's the issue here and um if for me you know it again just comes back to property right so so as long as the game studios are by choosing you know a chain that's that's strong and usable then i'm happy i mean can you imagine like gen z playing fortnite buying skins buying items all of these things and then being able to trade them on like the open finance permissionless layer of defy like to me that that's kind of an explosive combination like it's going to happen at some point it totally seems inevitable once we start to unleash this this tech stack but what about you jake what do you think so andrew says uh ux is the bottleneck here uh do you share that view i actually have a really interesting data point on that and so if you there's a very interesting experiment going on on the part of dapper labs and nba top shot and for anyone who hasn't heard about what that is it's basically um you know dapper labs made a partnership with the nba and they took a bunch of highlights and um and great like nba basketball moments and essentially tokenize them as nfts these are videos and what you do is you buy kind of collector packs they it's sort of like baseball cards right they come with a random assortment but it's totally digital uh the website's called nbatopshot.com if you want to take a look at it but essentially the experiment that they performed is to say look you know we really want to go out to basketball fans the intersection of basketball fans and blockchain fans uh are is pretty low and so we really want to make this one of the best like consumer mainstream experiences that we possibly can and a lot of people were nervous right because you know we're sort of going to try to hide the value propositions of blockchain here we're going to hide kind of the the complexity but we're also we also might not get through that that these things have the value propositions that that these liquid you know tradable transferable assets have and the early uh you know the early results are actually really encouraging like people who are basketball fans they absolutely love uh top shot and the user experience that that nba top topshop has created for them has has enabled them to to come into the system to use it to collect the stuff and to do it like through a credit card now at some point if those users want to get a little bit more sophisticated and actually learn a little bit of the benefits of the blockchain underneath and maybe own some digital assets on chain maybe trade these things on chain they're gonna have an opportunity to do that but the fact that we you know we were able to close um you know a bunch of these like mainstreamers is extremely encouraging so let's uh wrap up this episode with some predictions uh what is going to be the thing that breaks the news cycle next like what's the big thing that everyone gets hyped up about in like the next three months and then what's going to be the next big thing in like 9 12 15 months i think like nft space has been um maturing and it's been around for a couple of years now i mean if you think about the first nfts that came out those were really um maybe like rare pepes on on counterparty back in 2015. so so to be honest we're about five years in but only i would say this year have companies in the space started to actually get proper attention from investors and investors are coming around and actually starting to position in the nft space and and make investments um you know prior to this year i would say open c was probably the you know the company that kind of received the most serious attention from venture capital and crypto funds um but this year uh you see collaborative fund publishing uh their thesis on digital art and and super rare uh you see coin funds thesis on uh on nfts and wearable you know you guys mentioned async a few times i'm actually an angel investor there and really really love what they're doing um and what i think is going to happen in next three months is that you'll start to see more and more funding rounds around these companies and you see a lot more competition in the areas of you know issuance platforms for nfts um marketplaces and then this exciting area of like nft times d5 like how do we treat nfcs as a as an asset class on a on a longer time frame um what whatever you said 18 months um i'm going to make a bold prediction and i might be wrong but i think at some point the nft space will actually outstrip d5 in terms of volume wow wow bold bold prediction how do we calculate that because the nft world is so much more nebulous like uniswap is this one central place where a bunch of you know assets can get exchanged and we can see that volume how how are you thinking that we'll actually be able to measure the growth of the nft ecosystem we're measuring it on chain today if you guys go to dune analytics um there are a bunch of dashboards um we we probably should should consolidate a little bit more as as new platforms come in but but from my perspective i think that looks like uh we we sum up the the main marketplaces those would be you know open c super rare wearable maker's place known origin mint base all these guys and that will give us a really nice picture of um the gmv the gross marketplace volume of nft sales um and you know we can compare that to two activities in in defy and and i agree it's not it's not going to be like apples to apples exactly but it will give us a sense of like how many people are operating in um you know in in in the nft world versus the defy world how many wallets are operating you know how much sales are going on or how much capital is flowing through the system so there are ways of you know comparing those things um productively but you think the metric is going to be total volume right so like andrew put out the post on bank list about 100 million nfts have been sold you think more nfts are going to be sold in terms of total value in terms of total volume than you know defy type of assets is that right so like broadly i think it's about attention right i think that um d5 is amazing i'm a technologist i'm a i'm an investor like i love quantitative finance i love yield farming right but it's it's not as this is not a set of topics that is broadly accessible to people i think that's also changing i think young people are are much more financially so we're all we're all finance geeks who are into that a little bit right but what i'm saying is the nft broad spectrum is so broad and so much more understandable to mainstream users that i think once like early mainstream adoption starts getting going in earnest you'll just see like a lot of affinity there in that space yeah i would have to say for myself short term the headlines will probably be more high crypto sales you know we normally see sales of twenty thousand dollars and you know a few months back we had the record of 55 000 and now yesterday we had 101 thousand dollar one so i think the next few months we'll just continue to see great sales on the crypto art side and then six to 12 months out i guess i would say the headlines will be more focused on these different nft virtual worlds or games or platforms that are launching their own native tokens kind of d5 style and those will be really really interesting because they're not going to be the kind of incentive mechanics used to farm those tokens i guess will be very interesting because you know maybe a virtual world will will require that you build and then each each place that you build you get you know 100 tokens or uh maybe this game will require that you battle your axes together or whatnot so um that's gonna be really exciting to watch and uh yeah i mean to go with with what jake said i i'm a strong believer that nfts will become larger than than crypto like not even defunct larger than crypto and and the reason being is that um you know my thesis is that nft is enabled metaverse and when we're talking about a metaverse i really mean that i do believe the majority of the world's population will be living inside or spending most of their time inside virtual environments so crypto is you know going to radically transform finance and value and money itself and but that'll be that'll be the money that is used in the metaverse nfts will make up every single thing that is inside the metaverse your your virtual home your virtual couch your virtual pet whatever and so it's really the money versus the actual stuff that inhabits this place and that's kind of my kind of my thoughts  ryan are we focusing in on a wrong thing about yeah definitely so bankless has just uh pivoted to nft only podcast guys know that i mean it's super bullish um so how soon to a trillion andrew so you know we just hit 100 million like how many years is this process going to take to to transition into the metaverse how soon until a trillion involvement of nft sold yeah i would say you know i'm just purely guesstimating here but i gotta say probably eight to ten years you know i it's going to take you know back back in 2017 i thought okay everyone's going to be using bitcoin by 2018 right that was kind of my thought process and then and you go through and you're like wait a second oh what's going on here why does no one agree with me um but yeah in all honesty it's gotta be around eight to ten years and kind of the metaverse vision that i'm talking about is you know 50 years out so um it's a much longer timeframe but yeah i'd say one trill in 10 years 1 trillion in total nft sales right not 20 not one trillion dollars in like 24 hour volume right total sales i mean you're much more into the weeds than i am but i feel like that could happen a lot sooner than that i i hope so i just don't i've just been disappointed so many times about um why the world is not more involved in bitcoin why the world is not more involved in ethereum like you know because i see it so clearly and because i'm obviously i'm super bullish on it so i'm like if if i and myself and so many other people see see the promise of this stuff why has it not been adopted sooner and i think it just takes a lot it takes a lot of people to uh it's a huge mental leap for them to kind of get involved and so um to be on the conservative side i would say you know 10 years but obviously i hope it's you know tomorrow but we're gonna well you know it's like the past 40 years of humanity has been largely the transition the um slow gradual transition in some ways of like humanity from the analog into the digital and that's what this is it's but but now it's with uh scarce goods it's with scarce assets uh transitioning into the into the metaverse so yeah it it could happen in waves it could definitely take um you know decades to play out as well fully it's certainly going to be interesting to watch guys this has been a super thorough guide to nfts it's exactly what we were hoping for and i think the bankless community is going to get a lot out of this are there any specific projects lastly that that you guys could name that we we should be you know looking out for so avagachi has just released something kind of interesting um meme is another sort of nft meme based coin that's doing some interesting things david mentioned god's unchained um but like who should we have on the show who should we be talking to what projects are most interesting if you could just quickly rattle some of them off jake absolutely if you guys are interested in that niche of like nft times d5 if that's attractive to to bankless listeners um check out ineftify.com nftfi.com this is a place where you can go and you can deposit an nft and get a loan against this is one of the earliest sort of d5 projects that uses nfts as a first-class citizen also there's a company called niftex what they're basically doing is they're creating the ability to fractionalize ownership and different nfts and then to pool shares of those nfts together you know into an index that investors can easily invest uh into without having to sit and like maybe evaluate every nft artist one by one i mentioned arc gallery if you are you know if if you like the idea of like co-owning art check that out um if you are a creator yourself mint some nfts on wearable or maybe try a dynamic nft on async.art um and if you're just kind of getting started in blockchain and you're a basketball fan you know check out nba topshop andrea what would you add yeah i think jake did a great job there but i would say i'm very very excited about blockchain-based virtual worlds and i i see them as kind of this these user-owned future social networks and i would say uh cryptovoxels insomnium space are the ones to check out kryptovoxels and soundiumspace have not heard of sounding space sounds interesting guys thank you so much for spending time on this topic um we're definitely gonna be doing more on bankless about it but it's been a pleasure to have you both thanks jake thanks andrew thanks ryan and david thanks so much guys cheers all right guys action items today this has been quite a lot to digest but fortunately we do have a lot written on the subject on the bankless substack newsletter so we will include links to how to make money on digital art how to make bank flipping crypto how to make money in crypto gaming including the article that i mentioned that andrew had written about passing the 100 million mark so you can start looking at nfts that way as well we'll also include all um links to all of the projects that jake and andrew just mentioned so you'll have that in the show notes too risks and disclaimers guys nfts defy assets in general it's all risky eth is risky crypto is risky in general you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot you
