if you were creating twitch today you would focus on making the community an open and programmable economy the twitch company itself would probably be holding a treasury of these tokens and then they would distribute them to their the people who make the content maybe power users or viewers or moderators who are doing something and so there there would be kind of like an economic engine probably similar to what people pay for today which is like to pay the streamers to reward them or for their attention you know the only thing is like there would be potentially this upside of like it could be a deflationary mechanism or some sort of value accrual to the to the token would that have been like financially better for you and the team creating twitch or would have been an act of goodwill for the the that's a good question well one thing is we probably couldn't have sold twitch which turned out to be much more successful than just the buy the the cool billion but i think more importantly what would have been better is that more people would be able to participate in the upside of this project like the people who are creating content and people consuming it you know would be rewarded for that and i think that's kind of how the internet should work you know
