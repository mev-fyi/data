coinbase is suing the SEC or as David would say we are suing this we're suing the SEC less Nation it is the last Friday of April 2023 what time is it David uh it's the bank this Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always just an ambitious Endeavor we got some lawsuits to talk about this time in our favor we're the ones doing the suing feels good man uh but uh in order to prepare for all of that content make sure that you have your morning coffee you got your coffee Ryan uh you're gonna need it yup uh also we should clarify it's not you and I assuming anybody at least oh yeah we we is the crypto industry are doing we the people are suing the powers that be this is coinbase doing the SEC I guess I guess I should just say that we'll talk about that also uh John Oliver he's got some fighting words for crypto well I think I you know it's mostly Fair coverage we're going to talk about this I think it was the mainstream take though we'll talk about what that means David what else are we covering uh authorities are looking into sbf's parents so SBF the bankman freed name back in the menu today but then of course we're going to get back into our Roots talk about chappella two weeks forward uh some more rocket pool stats uh and something on Solana I think is cool so we'll talk about that as well yeah go figure is it a phone David it's not the phone it's not it's a backpack it might be a big backpack I don't know what my backpack is to be continued uh guys and of course if you like bankless and if you like crypto make sure you like And subscribe rate in review that's how we pop to the top of the charts want to get the top of the charts in Spotify and YouTube and any other charts that exist we want to get the crypto message out there uh David AI Ryan is like if that's a chart I want to be there it's a chart let's let's optimize speaking of this speaking of optimization the safe wallet wants you to know about account abstraction which is an optimization that they are working on so safe of course used to be called gnosis safe it's now called safe it's the multisig that everybody in ethereum uses including Bank lists um you've heard us talking about account abstraction before as well account abstraction is kind of the new smart contract wallet that is going to put fintech user experience to shame and now safe has something they are rolling out a way for you to tap into their account abstraction David tell them about this SDK so if you are a developer and like we all know have been chanting on Bank lists we are in the Paradigm of externally owned accounts it's a terrible name uh they're probably called private keys 99 of us are private key externally owned account wallets eventually in the future 99.9 of wallets will be account abstraction all also a bad name uh smart contract Wallace and gnosis safe also called safe is helping us get there with this SDK for developers to build more smart contract wallets so that we can fix all of cryptos goddamn terrible ux problems and so safe and they're safe core account abstraction software development kit devs name stuff so weird but they've got they've got a Dev package for all the devs out there uh so it helps you build on-ramps and helps you build your protocol it helps you build uh relays for gasless transactions and meta transactions it is got a little plug-in for your Fiat on-ramp because you're gonna need to get money into your wallet and so if you are building in the world of account abstraction if you're building a smart contract wallet or you need something like this for your web 3 game or what not uh the core SDK which which is available in the link in the show notes is for you and also there's a hackathon going on on Monday this is Monday May 1st so if the dev stuff didn't appeal to you this is a hackathon for everybody they call it uh an anything goes anything it's really hard to explain the word anything but with two A's and they're both capitalized because it's an abstraction hackathon but anything goes so anything goes if you're a non-tech if you're non-developer you can do stuff just like um explain a project you can do the marketing the presentation you can make memes anything goes hackathon so it's literally like everything else is non-technical also a great way to start and get on a team and to get some practice and sharpen your sticks in the web 3 world yeah more inclusive hackathons that's uh that's cool I hope this trend continues uh David let's get to the market speaking of Trends and whether they're continuing or not gotta start with the Bitcoin price today are we continuing the trend up down or flat dude uh crypto prices were super weird this week net flat net flat on the week uh so Bitcoin is down point three three percent so it's flat uh we are currently at twenty nine thousand dollars almost touch thirty thousand dollars almost broke below twenty seven thousand dollars uh but here we are at the end of the week flat but I will remind bankless sister you should probably just pull open your phone and check the price right now because I don't know what it's gonna be like in 24 hours well speaking of which uh before you do pull out the phone let's talk about the eth price at the time of recording did that do similar things to bitcoin flat on the week uh slightly down but it's it's flat it either went down two percent this week um do you see these red candles you see them both on the Bitcoin chart yeah and the ethereum chart yeah okay so uh yeah the red candle happened while we were recording with Ledger ether pumped from 1800 almost up to 2000 and we were like we're back baby uh same thing with Bitcoin Bitcoin almost it like hit 30 000 and it bounced off of it and then like five hours later everything dumps back down ether goes from almost 2 000 down to 1800 Bitcoin goes from 30 000 down to 27 uh hundred twenty seven thousand and now we're back right in the middle of those two things so Ryan what the hell happened well this was happening by the way during we don't usually do shows on just prices in just charts but we did a show on just prices and just charts and this is the candle we experienced during that show right do you see the like talk on Twitter people were blaming the thumbnail of that show as a problem it's like a big Goofy a picture of like Ledger with his like without the only words yeah that one might have been our fault but that that wasn't the case so uh I don't I don't think we can be blamed for this at least David there was I don't think you should be breaking during the show Mount gox and the US government while it's making transactions the infamous original Mount gox wallets that were supposed to be sort of locked up maybe doing things maybe causing a sell-off this news sort of propagated it turns out the amount so here the tldr of Mount Cox is that there has been a decent amount of Bitcoin something like 10 to 20 of the supply of the mount hacks hack Bitcoins that has been locked up in the court proceedings because some of them ever got forever because some people keep on delaying and delaying delaying I don't know why the strategy is behind that anyways the the mountain gox Bitcoin unlock fud has been with us since I've been in crypto like oh yeah it's like the that Meme of like the truck running into the wall but the camera Cuts every single time it's been like for like four four years and so the news broke that a mount gox wallets actually started sending transactions implying that the fight has finally arrived the the truck is finally getting to crash into the wall uh and so uh an alert like a bot alert alert about like hey this wallet's making transactions win out which is what triggered this tweet from DB who does all of these breaking tweets saying mount gox mount wallets are moving they're going to sell they're going to sell the implication is that like the 10 to 20 of the mount gox exploited uh Bitcoins are basically going to be sold because they were market right because they were 1 000 to they were like 300 to 1 000 at the time of purchase and now it's whatever the president is now thirty thousand dollars so you're gonna assume that these people are finally going to liquidate that that like almost decade-long Force hold so that's the story and then these things actually start moving on chain to set off this alert this Arkham alert which triggers this tweet which forces the market to sell off that was all that backstory turns out it was an errant bug so once again the truck did not crash into the wall so it turns out we just totally wasted your time by telling you this just like that it's wasted our time yeah producing this errant signal I I feel like this is a bigger picture of the markets right now David which is like no one really knows what to do and so there's all of this noise right this is just more noise yeah people asking like why the price up and down well it's a false alert but now it's kind of stayed down at least from the highs but like a little bit there's so much noise in this kind of market and I just kind of filter it out I'm just done with it I'm over it I'll put the ratio you down on the ratio each Bitcoin ratio okay because it's going down yeah it's it's at .065 so like downer-ish but it's still within the last little range it's been last two years nothing is significant below until we get start to get below like .055 or above 0.8 0.08 Ledger had good commentary on the radio I think yeah he did um there's a really good episode people should go watch that did it change your mind at all are you still holding the ratio for uh well yeah because like because he was like Dave like David would if like you know Bitcoin goes Bitcoin Hulk mode and uh Bitcoins at a hundred thousand dollars and ether's only at five thousand dollars that is a ratio of like point I'm Gonna Catch You the math it was something like 0.05 or something and I'm like well that's I held that my my ratio trade built down to the three hours Capital liquidation when it got down to 0.04 or something so like not scared come at me bro like I'm not scared yeah no eth is a different Ethan the last bear market and that was the main rest of literature argument last bear Market it was weak it was so so weak comparison to bitcoin we've got a much stronger eat this time around uh Global crypto market cap I'm going to say it this time David because it's so much you're taken from me two weeks in a row we're above a trillion 1.243 that's that's what you need to know tell us about this story though he would have eat the positive Beacon chain invalidator should we shook the snow globe what's happening with all the the eat that was staked is it being unstaked is it staking elsewhere what's going on uh so I've become a connoisseur of chappella metrics dashboards Etc this Dash this particular dashboard from the book I think is is the best one to illustrate the chappella snow globe so this is The Ether Supply deposited into the beacon chain since the launch of the beacon chain in December of 2020 and of course the chart is up only the entire time up until the chappella uh withdrawal Fork that happened uh two weeks ago and so the line is literally cannot go down up until two weeks ago and then the withdrawals happened and this was like though the withdrawals are coming the withdrawals are coming everyone's gonna withdraw and you can see you can see the first moment that this line goes down at the teeny little top right there and it goes from a whopping 18 point something million uh ether uh Stakes down to like 17.7 17.5 million ether staked and we have continued on the same uptrend that we've been on since December of 2020. withdrawals seem to have uh slowed down and deposits I have continued uh and so the withdrawal seemed to be over two weeks David I I want to take you back down uh Memory Lane cryptogram but do you remember when it was we were worried if ethereum communities worried about getting 500k even staked because we needed 500k to kick start the beacon train and like we weren't necessarily getting there we get it look look at that that's way back here yeah 500k and now we're talking about like Justin yeah yeah 18 million 500k youth got withdrawn and that is a blip yeah it's just a blip uh what about this another dashboard for for the fine connoisseur of dashboarding that you are how do you rate this hill Dobby dashboard what can we take away from each staking here this hill Dobby dashboard is a top tier very fine very fine dashboard it's very nice um uh we are net inflows since the Shanghai chappella hard Fork a negative 440 000 ether in the deposit in the beacon chain so that is the number of ether that has been net withdrawn that used to be lower I think it was as low as something like 0.7 million now we're at 0.44 million um the total supply of ether on the beacon chain 18.7 million uh and uh the actually the cool Parts about this thing if you go to uh scroll down a little bit further so stakers the Delta up stakers in the last month uh so you can filter that Ryan by uh market share and so you can see who's won and who's lost in the last like month or so by clicking on the market shareboard uh that's in the last week but go over to the one go over to the month because it's been more of uh more than one week uh so Kraken obviously the big loser because of uh lost all their steak teeth because the Gary gunzler forced them to um but even coinbase uh who was unforced also is a net loss of ether net net outflows of ether uh huobi um Gemini to centralize exchanges uh now if you click that one again we will see who the winners are so that the market share increase if you or order by who has won the most of the snow globe so where has all that snow landed that good old ether uh unidentified is the winner here at 1.5 growth in market share which is Big by the way who's identified unidentified who is that Ryan it's probably a lot of solo stickers right they're identified because they're solo stickers those are the many people at 1.5 coming in second is staked.us I think that is um staked wise coming in second at uh they gained 0.6 market share steak fish uh P2P okx followed by rocket pool at point two percent uh and so that is the winners and the losers pretty cool so the snow globe is happening uh to some to some extent and uh yeah what's really interesting is this is just a blip off of the height do you think we've bottomed already David on the okay yep I'm famous for calling button for column bottoms uh calling the bottom you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna agree with you it's both David and Ryan calling the Bible that doesn't happen Two Two bankless Hosts calling the bottom right now the other thing that's worth noting actually is that Lido has not yet enabled withdrawals they had like two they have had like two or three more weeks I think it's at the end of May when they uh so like they still have their snow globe moment and honestly like when you're in the lead of the staking derivatives and you're like taking your time to like enable withdrawals like yeah I bet you guys would take your time to open straws well maybe I shouldn't have called the bottom just now because who knows what could happen with the lighter that's pretty like well I wouldn't be too worried about that because uh you can always exit as a lighter person with steak teeth um and so there is an exit route um but yeah there will be some pent-up demand Lido has definitely got a lot of net inflows uh but that's because they are it's kind of unfair because they literally don't allow outflows so that it's still in only for Lido you know it's a market piece I really enjoyed this week was uh a piece by pallenia who is a an L2 researcher in general uh pseudo-anonymous had them on the bankless podcast before and they do a quick tour of the top five chains by economic activity this is a post I think it's worth reading we'll include a link to it in the show notes but I'll go through the kind of the breakdown number one top Chain by economic activities of course you know it ethereum at number one by a lot okay you're insecure I was 120 billion across eth erc20s and nfts plenty goes through different dimensions to kind of Judge both passive and active economic activity and uh ethereum is the lead on both both passive and active of course it's far in the lead over over the number two which is Bitcoin on active and and number two indeed is Bitcoin after that plinia mentions this very large gap this very large Delta yeah there's like it's a two-horse race basically um with ethereum leading um by a lot on the active side on economic activity but then after that you get into arbitrum it's number three on plenya's list followed by Tron and binance smart chain what's interesting is if you have been mostly absorbing bankless content right we don't talk much about the Tron story do we we don't talk about much about the binance smart chain story The reason we don't is because [Music] and I totally will admit that like I I am a biased decentralization Maxi like I ca like both of us are and so uh but Tron is doing a lot of activity and somewhere in the spectrum of like is it sort of a bank is it fintech or is it crypto is it an open banking system I think the answer to that is yes um and uh it's doing a lot with uh tether right now binance smart chain as well so if you talk to people in Argentina right now and what crypto are they actually using it's like stable coins on Tron and binance smart chain that's what's happening and that usage has great adoption in a financially underserved parts of the world I think it's great not mad about this it's more private keys in the hands of more people um hopefully it doesn't rug everyone at some point but it's got some rug resistance in it not a lot a little bit more than decent amount of Lindsay I'd say yeah that's kind of cool anyway he does he does follow-up excuse me they they also follow up saying that the once dominant number two player binance marching and also Tron has been dethroned by arbitrim1 this last bear Market if the YouTube viewers views about the tweet that was on screen that didn't go by the list that Ryan and I just said that's because Napoleon polanya elaborates further on about his reasoning their reasons oh yeah yeah I've shown a faulty tweet all right David what do we got coming up next coming up next coinbase suing the SEC that's us I claim uh and a public response an interesting strategy they're posting their response to the SEC both has a written letter because that's what you do and a YouTube video taking a leaf out of influencer Gary's book so we're gonna watch a clip out of that uh that YouTube video uh and we'll also take a peek Ryan uh so a case study of some character development if you will of a pre-sec Gary Gensler at MIT giving some takes so we're gonna watch some clips uh been we've been clip heavy on the weekly roll up in the last couple weeks and that continues speaking of Clips John Oliver got some John Oliver Clips as well uh and he's got some uh takes for crypto as well for the mainstream so we're gonna play all those groups and talk about them and all that stuff as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors especially Kraken our strategic sponsor for 2023 the one that we always look at when we look at prices earlier in the

while you're there sign up for the web app wall experience as well so thank you ambeyer for pushing the frontier of smart contract Wallets on ethereum coinbase is suing the SEC or as David would say we are suing this we're suing the SEC this is a tweet from Paul the chief legal officer at coinbase he says today we filed a narrow action in the U.S Circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond yes or no to a rulemaking petition we filed with the last July asking them to provide regulatory guidance for the crypto industry all they want is a simple yes or no David what is happening here so I've never heard of this narrow action um phrase before I'm assuming it's a legal term to uh Sue they're suing them to do this one thing which is reply yes or no to this petition which you've got pulled up uh that they filed with them last July so they filed a petition um if you want to skip over to that one right they filed this petition forever go and coinbase or as suing the SEC to get them to just say yes or no to this petition follows up his tweet saying the SEC is required by law to respond to petitions quote within a reasonable time but they have not yet responded to our petition from last July which we are coming up to almost a year on um being in May almost uh and so that they are suing them for not doing that their job in a reasonable amount of time you're cool I mean it's not that big of a deal like it's just a yes or no lawsuit but I mean it the implications of that are large have they not gone in for office hours with Gary David they have not gone in for office hours well come on coinbase all you have to do is go to office hours so we found this uh Twitter thread from meta Lawman who is a lawyer who comments on this uh and so here's what they here's everything you need to know about this real quick real quick um this case will move fast he claims unlike the Ripple case uh this will uh begins in the Appellate Court not the trial court I don't know what an appellate court is uh there will be no Discovery just a briefing and a hearing uh he follows and says coinbase has an All-Star legal team led by Eugene Scalia former Secretary of Labor and Son of Supreme Court Justice Anton an Anton Scalia coinbase is Seeking a writ of mandamus which is God the legal system which is a court order compelling the SEC to do its job and announce a decision on coinbase's request for rulemaking this action does not necessarily affect the sec's timing for suing coinbase as it has threatened to do again it's a separate issue which we will talk about and then he follows up and says I expect major industry players to Pile in with amicus briefs supporting coinbase's position we might also see the house Financial Services committee or individual members come in with briefs in support of coinbase which we recently saw from last week's hearing that yes there is a lot of support for this uh the SEC Commissioners will have to approve any response to coinbase's action there's a tiny chance that the SEC will blink and agree in exchange in rulemaking if just one commissioner withdraws their support for Gary genser's regulation by enforcement strategy he's done wow while coinbase has action does not directly affect pending SEC cases against Ripple bittrex and others it does a great job in shining a spotlight on the seds sec's contradict contradictory positions about its authority to regulate digital assets other judges will take note I remember I think a month ago I can't remember when but one theme of the roll up was like Gary Gensler is icarusing he's flying too close to the Sun he's gone too far it was probably the weekly roll-up where they the SEC announced the notice against coinbase and what we said is like oh they just there this coinbase is too big they're going to fight them tooth and nail and also they're going to lose because they're standing on shaky footing and so all of that is seemingly shaping up and this is where we are yeah by the way um in that thread that you read if just one commissioner withdraws their support for Gary Gensler what meta law man means is one additional commissioner we already have some SEC Commissioners Hester purse of course has famously dissented with just about everything Gary has tried to do with his crypto policy if she can get one more commissioner to dissent and uh defect from Gary's side of things then Gary is done what does that mean he's done this he's like that's a great question what does this mean by by done like I don't think it means he's fired I just think it means he has to like capitulate right into this one particular issue um there's some other things going on from coinbase as well including this video which was just released as of this morning David what are we about to watch okay so this is the coinbase response to the SEC in video format is a longer video it's 13 minutes this is a four minute clip um they are releasing their response this is they're also filing like a normal document that looks like a legal document but they're also doing the 2023 thing which is apparently to also Gotta Wear Suits You Gotta Wear suits and you also have to fight on social media and so we're taking the we're taking the fights to uh the the algorithms and so they are posting this video on the coinbase YouTube uh and here is Brian and Paul uh with their uh response to the SEC Wells notice uh the the the icarusing of of the SEC this is a response so let's watch this actually Ryan and I have not watched this so we are watching this for the first time right now let's go to the chair other Commissioners and staff of the Securities Exchange Commission I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak directly to you my name is Paul Grewal I'm coinbase's Chief legal officer and with me is Brian Armstrong the chief executive officer and chairman hi Brian official I'd like to start by turning things over to Brian to say a few words Brian yeah thanks Paul so again thank you for the opportunity to respond to this Wells notice and I thought I'd share a few words just about the founding story of coinbase and why I decided to base it here in the US and how we've practically sought out compliance over the last 11 years so back in 2012 I had just read the Bitcoin white paper and you know something clicked in my head when I first read this that this might be a very important technology breakthrough that could help update the financial system globally you know I had a firsthand experience seeing how difficult and challenging certain aspects of the financial system were I had been a software engineer at Airbnb and I had seen how difficult it was to send and receive payments globally to 190 countries it was slow and expensive and difficult I had lived in Argentina actually for a year studying abroad and working abroad and I had seen what a country looked like that had gone through hyperinflation where people had lost trust in the currency and they didn't have access to Good Financial Services they couldn't get loans for instance to buy a car or a home and so when I read the Bitcoin white paper I thought this might be an important breakthrough something on the order of what we saw with the internet a new Global and decentralized system that could make it easier for people to transmit value and update Financial Services globally the next decision I had was where do I want to start this company once once I realized I wanted to start a company and you know I went to some early Bitcoin meetups in San Francisco and people were telling me you know you shouldn't base it in the US it's going to be too challenging there's 50 state regulators and multiple Federal regulators and you should start in Hong Kong or Singapore and there was other firms that were starting at that time that did that but I made the choice at that moment to start the company in the US because I knew that even if it was more difficult the US was a major Market there was respect for rule of law the US was a financial Hub a technology Hub it was a place where I felt entrepreneurs could work in good faith with Regulators to help Define clear rules for new Industries as they emerged and so I was lucky enough to raise some Venture Capital money you know the Prototype on my laptop nights and weekends turned into a small company and we went off to the races you know 11 years later fast forward this strategy of proactively working with Regulators in in cases where it really wasn't clear what we should do because it was a new engine history we tried to do the right thing in the absence of clarity and should demonstrate good faith effort that would allow us to bring this technology in a safe and thoughtful way to hopefully a billion people someday so here we are as a public company I think we've made enormous strides and I think the message I'd really like to leave with the Commissioners and the SEC is that we're committed to working in within the regulatory perimeter we want to see a clear Market structure for trading crypto Securities not all crypto assets are securities there's also crypto Commodities there's stable coins there's crypto that's artwork we're going to work with multiple Regulators to make this industry safe and trusted and a Wells notice at this stage when there is not a clear rule book is not constructive and it's not good for America we are prepared to defend that position in court but it doesn't have to come to that we welcome a true dialogue about a workable path forward for our industry now I'll hand it back over to Paul coindes has been talking to the SEC about our business for many years now including sharing our legal views on our asset listing and staking Services we've repeatedly asked the SEC for its own views on how Securities laws might apply to coinbase and our industry and to be candid we've mostly gotten silence in response coinbase will defend itself vigorously in litigation if it comes to that but it does not have to come to that we will show up at your offices any day anytime to discuss a workable path forward for our industry but we won't find that path without true dialogue [Music] bringing in the lawyer that's interesting I think it's a great format actually rather than just a press release or a letter it's just like a four minute YouTube video and you would say that as a podcaster well of course I would I'm you know I'm a video member doing this podcast Maximus but also I think that um it's interesting the way Brian started with telling his personal story and it's like the story that kind of like I chose to base this company in America and I'm a patriot I did the American dream thing where you start with an idea and then you develop that in America and then you like turn it into a publicly traded company right I did all the things that I thought you wanted me to do right and now we're getting penalized with with um Regulators who are just unworkable and you sent Wells notices that there's going to be enforcement and like just stop it right like you're not even willing to talk to us what's going on I think it's effective I hope it lands what do you think you think this video is going to land well I think when you compare and contrast this video versus the Gary influencer video like they didn't need to make this video they just needed to submit a document a legal document which they did which so few people are going to watch so many more people are totally going to watch this video and like if you compare this video to Gary's stupid stock footage influencer video this is going to resonate way more well do you know it's the reason everyone's doing these videos is because I think they all recognize that this is a battle for hearts and Minds 100 right it's not just it's not just I'll see you in court even though that was kind of The Not So veiled uh threat there which is thank God we have another check and balance but it's like Brian's showing up to tell a story and then his lawyer next to him the bad cop being like and we're going to sue you anyway I think it's effective uh David you want to do some throwback clips of Gary Gensler uh the way he used to be before accepting the job here yeah this is a this is pre-sec Gary Gensler this is before he turned into a paid chill for the banking sector uh when he was a free man if you will uh giving his free unadulterated takes as a professor of knowledge at MIT so here's what Gary has to say about how you start a decentralized crypto Network let's hear from Care Bear and it it could be something that has no Central Authority right now no Central intermediary and it's just had a jump start something I think in that circumstance it's more likely you need a native token hmm so you want to start a decentralized network you need something to jump start it and so Gary says that's why you use a native token interesting interesting okay but Ryan do you think that those native tokens are securities less at let's ask 2018 Care Bear here we go so we already know in the U.S and in many other jurisdictions that three-quarters of the market are not icos or not what we could be called Securities even in the U.S Canada and Taiwan the three jurisdictions that we've talked about three quarters of the market is non-securities it's just a commodity a cash three quarters according to different coin offerings and what's a security what's not a security relevant relevant and important debate but for three quarters of the market it's not particularly relevant as a legal matter it's a regulatory matter team Gary sounding like he's making a lot of sense I would get a beer with that guy if that guy sounds uh I like that I would take that class that's incredible uh this is uh Brian Armstrong actually responding to this to this tweet he's retweeting it the clip and he just goes wow wow okay so that could be interpreted like how do you think he actually intended that to sound was that like a wow or was that like a wow or do you think that was like a whoa how do you think he meant that I you know I think it's up to interpretation and all of the above are fantastic interpretation so you know do that in your head but like I I gotta say the same thing wow this is all completely different person in 2018 where he said 75 of the market the you know security versus commodity thing is not even Up For Debate right um 70 at least 75 of the 2018 Market by the way that market was less clear than today's market yeah yeah the 2018 Market was there they were awesome [Music] so what has changed I can't wait to see Gary Gensler be presented with this in the court just like hey curious Gary um what made you change your mind on state like on on trial yeah you're talking about like under under oath when when did you go from everything as a security when did you go from three quarters of these things or not Securities and we need native tokens to bootstrap a network to 99 of Securities where was the change what changed because something happened and I would like to know what caused that I think it's like you get in a position of power and then your incentives totally change so you're not incentivized towards kind of kind of like truth and actual communication of the story you have a different agenda whether that's more power accrual is maybe part of the agenda here whether this is more like political influence as part of the agenda where there's actually some kind of like Lobby group that is drastically influencing you we may never know but um we can only judge him by the 2018 Gary versus the 2023 Gary and these are two completely different people that that's the thing when do you remember at the time when Gary Gensler was actually replaced Jay Clayton right as SEC chair and there was actually an air of maybe hope about this there was cautious optimism about garagance because we saw we knew we knew these 2018 clips and we're like finally a regular that understands this industry and now he's used that understanding and completely like abandoned it in pursuit of some different agenda it's a very fortunate yeah but um let's uh let's talk about what we can do so there is some action that uh that we can take um what is this David can I mint an nft and support a cause here how does this work that's exactly what you can do Ryan so coinbase is starting a stand with crypto campaign where you can mint a commemorative Shield nft it's an ft with a shield it's literally an emoji uh and it's a very very low price mint something like .007 ether I think uh so Ryan's going to go there right now he's going to connect our friends and sponsors at metamask the wallet there so he can go and mint this thing are you making me mince it right now I'm making you mince it right now yeah the mint is free but there is uh donate Azora Zora charges a fee that fee is like .077 ether or something so like a couple dollars which goes to the get coin advocacy round so all of the fees from this Shield mint nft plus 100 000 die for donated I Believe by coinbase is going to the Bitcoin advocacy round uh so Ryan is going to Mint his nft with uh metamask or for instance sponsors at metamask thank you for for doing that uh and then a little bit of oh excuse me point zero zero zero seven seven ether it's real cheap the the gas will cost you a lot more than the actual price of the nft let me tell you this is ten dollars in total right now uh okay so Ryan just minted one uh so thank you for donating to the get coin advocacy round uh and that's going out and thank you for supporting uh supporting crypto Ryan I appreciate that I also burned some Ethan that translation that's awesome so we are fighting back we are pushing back on this uh Dave David we actually have Paul the chief legal officer at coinbase coming on the show a little bit later too uh what's happening there yeah it will be out by the time the bank location is listening to this so Thursday night uh we are live streaming with Paul uh who is coming up going to come on and we're going to talk to him about suing the SEC so that's going to be pretty sweet for that one I can't wait to hear I I prefer to talking to the bad cop in the in this scenario yeah David another fight for crypto though is uh the mainstream narrative that's a fight I think we still need to uh put in some work on John Oliver on his show Last Week Tonight uh covered crypto it's a second major crypto episode in about a 25 minute segment and I think he really expresses what the mainstream thinks about crypto right now of course he covered the events of of 2022 so he talked about FTX he talked about Tara he talked about Celsius uh and his conclusion was pretty much that crypto is mostly a scam almost 100 sent a scam and I don't blame him necessarily for reaching that conclusion given 2022 and yet it falls so short so David I think we should maybe play some clips and give the bankless listeners a flavor of of what the the conversation was but FTX has been just one of the many dominoes that fell in the crypto world over the past two years the market value of all cryptocurrencies fell from around 3 trillion in late 2021 to around 1 trillion last year and there are small investors who got badly hurt by all of this one in five Americans has invested in traded or used cryptocurrency and you can find countless stories of people losing most of their life savings in the recent implosions underscoring that everyone in crypto was never actually going to make it no matter how much Randy Zuckerberg screams sang otherwise so tonight we thought we'd take a look at what has been happening in the world of crypto by looking at three of the biggest collapses over the past year each of these companies was founded on the promise that they would replace some part of our financial system there is Terror a cryptocurrency Celsius a crypto bank and FTX a crypto trading platform in theory they were supposed to be our next dollar our next Bank of America and our next Stock Exchange but in reality they are fiascos so far David I he's not wrong on these days these are the exact takes that that we had in 2022 it's just well we didn't think anything about it not not these specifically but we are replacing the dollar we are replacing the stock exchange it's not FTX it's uniswap it's not Terror it might be something like die um yeah it's not Celsius it's defy right yeah that's the thing and so these are our narratives these are the words he's not wrong is what I'm saying let's play another clip just as a reminder every single crypto coin is just something someone with a laptop made up that is true for all of them like Dogecoin cat coin Panda coin furry coin come rockets Elon sperm and Monkey Juice those are all real by the way we were going to come up with a fake one as a joke but then we saw Monkey Juice and it felt like a hat on a hat to the extent any of these coins have value it's based on whether people believe they do which often comes down to their confidence in the person or group who made the coin and that basic fact makes the crypto business very attractive to a certain type of person one columnist who's covered this intensively sums it up like this if you are running a scam you will be drawn to crypto you are running a confidence game and crypto offers the most efficient market for turning confidence into money David I mean this is also right about that right I also right about that money is a confidence game that's what we've been saying on Bank list this entire time he's just applying it in this more Narrows like yeah the largest most chest pounder dude or developer is the new winner in this world well um the idea that scammers are attracted to crypto is also right we've also talked about this yeah he's right about everything so far okay okay so that was that was just about 3.3 million views yeah this is mainstream this is what mainstream actually thinks and they're not wrong about FTX and Celsius and Tara I mean they're exactly right but let's finish with the conclusion here which is where I think uh John Oliver goes off track and the thing is there are still companies out there making all the same claims that you've seen tonight and I'm not saying that they are all scams maybe these three are the exceptions although they would be joining all the other exceptions that we haven't had time to talk about tonight from bitconnect to quadriga to so so many more but the truth is in a financial system where the only real currency is confidence scammers are going to thrive and I know that we usually like to point to a solution at the end of our stories now often means calling for more regulation but I'm not sure that's a good idea here the danger is regulation might give this sector more all legitimacy it'll make a risky investment look safe when it is clearly not and that in turn might entice Banks to start getting more involved in crypto giving the sector even more legitimacy and also exposing all of us to its volatility it really says a lot that one of the leading advocates for the government to strongly regulate crypto was Sam bankman freed and look I'm absolutely not saying that we should get rid of crypto entirely it could eventually be useful maybe the third time that we talk about it we'll all be using a digital coin to buy everything I doubt it but I can't predict the future after all I'm no Jim Cramer but we should recognize that right now the main thing you can really do with crypto is gamble with more crypto this is all still a casino so if you do want to invest do your own due diligence never put in more than you can afford to lose and if you ever see someone doing this this is Alex machinski doing like the arch repulse um yeah that was that was a rough conclusion that was a rough conclusion what not entirely wrong but what parts are rough to you oh how uh we shouldn't regulate it to give it legitimacy because then if you give it legitimacy it might integrate and oh well the regular Financial system will absorb the scams and the volatility of crypto it's like no you regulate it so you get rid of the scams and volatility see I I mean I think I'm not saying we should do that either but this is this though David is the narrative that crypto is up against in 2023 and it's both kind of a a headwind this is what 2021 costs us 2022 cost us yeah it's both a headwind and 2021 like you're talking about the bull market run up in 2022 is when this camera is yeah that whole period the last the last bull market cost us this that's exactly yeah um here's I think the interesting part about this and why I think there's an opportunity um for me the scam slamming he just did was was actually cathartic I mean we did a lot of that ourselves and the ridicule for SBF and Doug Quan and machinski is totally deserved but the conclusion that all kryptos a scam that's where I think there's some hubris right and I think the the problem with the mainstream narrative here is you can finish John Oliver's Show and I watched the whole thing and you could feel like you completely understand crypto right like that is the I guess the hidden um the hidden problem with the show like this is you're like oh that crypto thing all you know all the everything that was going on the big price run up oh it's just a bunch of scams ha I thought so and then you're gonna dismiss it and you're going to miss out on the alternative to Celsius which is defy and the alternative to FTX which are uniswap and uh coinbase type regulated exchanges and Kraken and you can miss all the alternative to uh you know a stable coin for instance like like Tara and you'll miss something like die and everything all the Innovation that's going on so the reason it's an opportunity David is because I think right now just like in 2019 when crypto was dead and the Cycles before that we're getting the same sentiment and I am happy to have the counter trade to that because I think this is what the mainstream narrative thinks right now and so to me this is a massive buying opportunity if you believe the opposite if you believe that crypto isn't a scam if you believe there is real Innovation here if you believe that stable coins will be absolutely massive if you believe that D5 will actually um change the world and be the way we Bank in the future this is a massive counter trade opportunity no that's that's exactly right yeah this is a great signal of how when you are uh being a contrarian investor about something that you know have high confidence in being right about um but it gives me 2018 to 2025s when we felt that about ethereum dare we call this a bottom signal oh certainly I mean it's one of the bottom signals right in the same way Zuckerberg video was the top signal we're all going to make sure I mean and like also this uh John Oliver's audience is the exact kind of people I'm gonna um blanket statement here is like all of the people who were bitter about the crypto people making a bunch of money in 2021 2022 this show is for them they want to watch the show and be like Oh I'm sorry I I believe in myself yeah all the all the crypto haters that got bitter that their crypto friend made a bunch of money I'll call them smart fart smellers uh are watching this show and being like hmm oh yeah that's great that's totally what happened right and so that is his audience right and that's why the conclusion he has of like don't even give it any legitimacy don't even regulate it the conclusion of that show doesn't matter it doesn't have to be a good take for him to conclude to get the views to get the people to you know smell their farts yeah that's exactly how he was gonna end the show on exactly that note because that's what the audience wanted right and you know that he would never produce a counter show in the peak of a market talking about like how the crypto is doing the crypto thing you know you would never see that you would only ever see the show in the bear Market yeah so I I don't act I mean crypto gave him all of the ammo to produce that show that he needs we just served that to him on a plane do not do not blame him at all for that day I'm just pointing out that it's an incredibly shallow take that's what the overall mainstream narrative thinks is that right now and so if you counter trade that I I think it could be a good move right now if you believe the opposite David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got some updates on the binance Voyager deal sad for Voyager we're also going to talk about SBS mom of all people spf's mom uh won't sing the song uh lens launching in layer three and Solana who's got a thing that's making me feel things and we're going to talk about that but first we're going to talk to all of these sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask who if we're using all these weird crypto words crypto dragon metamask has a product for you called metamask learn let's go hear about it learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon-free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menemask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web 3. arbitrim 1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming

web3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free voyager tweets out today we received a letter from binance terminating the asset purchase agreement well development is disappointing our chapter 11 plan allows us for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers via the Voyager platform so binance us is backing out of the crypto deal they cite regulatory challenges for that termination of that deal and so binance says well Our Hope throughout this process was to help voyagers customers access their crypto and kind the Hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American Business community oof thanks Gary uh so uh poor one now they're blaming Regulators for not doing this so so Voyager of course was like another Celsius in that a bunch of deposits were left holding the bag retail Voyager three hours Capital 600 million dollars unsecured so that was pretty dumb of them um they did a ton of dumb things but this was also an opportunity for all of the creditors to actually do a little bit better than kind of a pure asset sale bankruptcy and uh binance is blaming that on Regulators for not going through but imagine if you're a voyager creditor right this is basically what happened to you right first you thought FDX was going to save you and then FDX imploded then you thought binance was going to save you and then the US blocked the sale now the court allows the sale to go through then binance pulls out that's the full story if you're a voyager creditor and he had funds tied up in Voyager um very sad just getting dunked in the tank again and again and again um feels bad to put money in any kind of quote-unquote crypto Bank these days yeah and it's because of of Gary it's because of Gary 100 right right Gary when everything that represents he's become the main character for operation choke points so yes I agree it's operation checkpoint it's Gary Gensler and Friends uh speaking of friends does SPF have any friends left David I guess his parents are still friendly because he's living back at home with Mom and Dad and now there's some scrutiny on sbf's parents what's going on yeah so a judge has approved restrictions for sbf's parents so uh spf's mom and dad are now getting strict cell phone monitoring while he is under house arrest because they are fearful that SPF will just say hey Mom can I use your phone so a consultant just one tweet mom yeah just one post a consultant will review keystroke logs and screenshots of Joseph bankman and Barbara frankman's uh free Barbara Freed's cell phones at least three times per week monitoring software are on the bankman Freed's parents phones and they photograph the user every five minutes to make sure it's not Sam so the phone takes a picture every five minutes and if Sam bakeman freeze faces there and they get in trouble dude that's hilarious can you like how mad would you be at your son if this was like the situation here the weird thing about this though is we don't know if they're innocent part that they're innocent parties at all like there seems to be a lot of evidence that they may have actually been tied up in this whole criminal Enterprise like I think like Nick Carter and Friends call it the crime family or something yeah yeah crime syndicate and so you don't know how deeply they're involved but it's um it's hilarious to think SPF back at home can't use Mom and Dad's cell phone even uh he's completely locked out of that that's so funny I have so many jokes I can make and we just need to move on or else I'll make them let's protocol what are they doing uh optimistic layer 3 solution uh so lens deploying a layer three to process transactions at hyperscale they say and decide to support the next generation of web 3 social users this is called it a roll app an app chain as I roll up as a matter of three yeah yeah you've heard that before right no that's the first time I've heard that that term well I sadly can't take credit for that one um but uh to you I will uh so yeah lens uh layer three roll app I'm assuming this is deployed on polygon um because that's where lens is um so cool Bonsai is what they're calling it because of the whole plant metaphor that's very cool um devconnect Istanbul Ryan uh this is not necessarily for the bank location although they're welcome to listen to this announcement about devconnect Istanbul 2023 this is actually from me to you to tell you that I'm going to be an Istanbul in the 13th to the 19th of November for Dev connected listeners wants to come I'll be there too devconnect is different than Devcon right David yeah so think of it like a binary star system and one's bigger than the other and this is the Little Star but they rotate and so it goes Devcon Dev connect Devcon Dev connect every like nine months or so oh man you're traveling all over the world David are you ever at home anymore God it has been a while it has been a while yeah uh but tell us about this so you are excited about a yeah it's an nft project so I you know maybe people would have suspected that's the way they they get you they hook you into the Solana Community mad labs mad Lads what is it uh I mean I don't know it's an nft project they look really cool their volume was the number one most traded volume at least in the last seven days so they are just eating above board Apes in mutant Apes uh and so uh this is why this is news that's because they are dominating the seven day volume at least on nft sales the the uh mint went live they had some like mint drama um but uh they're past that I think they look pretty cool I like the art I like the art I do not own one because I don't I don't know how to use Solana I own some soul tokens and I bought it like nine dollars or something um but yeah just grab a phantom wallet just connect I've done stuff on uh Solana I have a podcast nft on Solana yeah yeah yeah okay I'll probably go I'll go buy one of these on salon and I'll be the first to be used you heard it Solana come here you heard it here tweet it out when you do I mean look at these they're they're pretty cool looking so like the 20s 20s mobster themed like um uh like it's like a comic book uh Noir theme I think I I I'd say like a Noir movie type um yeah I think they're pretty cool I think they're pretty cool I get this yeah I Vibe with this yeah you like to nominate in Seoul if you buy it though yeah I don't know about that one okay anyways uh moving on you want to take this one well David we can't just talk about U.S regulatory system we've got to talk about what's going on in Europe Mika we did an entire episode on this legislation uh looks like it is going through after more than two and a half years of consultation heated debates last minute amendments and very close votes in the committee the eu's parliament today passed the new EU crypto framework with an impressive majority 517 MEPS 4 and 38 votes against this is the most comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that's ever been passed by any major government body uh we did an entire episode on this and the conclusion from our crypto EU Mika experts was this was about a B minus in terms of its its quality and its goodness for crypto so it could have been a lot worse we could have had a failing grade an F or or a d or something like that average would have been C they rated it as B minus and I think I mostly agree with that it leaves much to be desired but it provides some clarity like for instance Europe David doesn't have the problem of is ether a security or a commodity or not there's no Gary Gensler of Europe um blocking all of these things it's quite clearly detailed as to what the nature of ether the asset is it's a commodity an EU legislation a few comments from from the panel that we talked to the US is getting its pants beat by global regulation as a comment we're getting our pants beat by a B minus nice yeah it's a B minus a head but there's still room for the EU to fail here there's some other regulation that that might be upcoming amlr the data Act is is one of them there's some more so before anyone in the U.S says we're moving to Europe and throws that party I think we've got to get through this heavier regulation and see where we come out in the other side so there's still room to fail the semester uh this was just one test but B minus on the first test it's better than the United States that's for sure okay all right I don't know if I should be optimistic or pessimistic B minus my first reaction is like B minus cool we can start from there and get better uh but then I guess you could start from there get worse anyways you can whatever so some of the most Boomer news that we'll ever put into a weekly roll up Trans Union the credit scoring company is uh allow working with some Partners to deliver credit scoring to blockchain hey so tldr they are allowing um they're basically being an oracle for credit scores on a blockchain so you have your credit score FICO score your FICO score yeah you can put that on a blockchain so that something like Ave could like review that credit score and be like okay I'll give this person a line of credit it's not going to work exactly like that but that's kind of the deal there's awesome it's not a terrible use case um there's like you can get it's private as well so you can get some privacy it's one of the earliest most primitive building blocks for building like uncollateralized lending um it's a thing cool we do need credit in defense it's all collateral backed loans at this point um speaking of releases fee has released something here Phi that's fee what are they doing VLAN uh so this is like a super cute project that I just think is awesome uh feland we've talked about it before it's like this 3D landscape for building a little metaverse for yourself that you put objects on based off of what you've done in your ethereum wallet so if you've traded on uniswap you get a little uniswap building if you bought on open C you get a little open sea ship Bank list has got some stuff so if you're a Freeland user you got some bankless things that you can claim so if you're a bank holder you get a little wagon if you are a podcast nft holder you get a little cute little version of me and Ryan a little icon to claim if you are a PO app holder you get a wallpaper so if you are a user of a VLAN if you're not a user freelance you should definitely check it out it's like the most fun identity web 3 non-financial app so this checks all those boxes and it's just pretty fun it's also a great way to like do you go on quests to claim these things right and so some of these are what we're looking at these four quests that we've got um and so if you are a VLAN user yeah and you are a bank close Nation member you have some objects that you can go play claim and go put in your little VLAN so this is uh go do that and then take a screenshot and tweet it and tag Bank lists so we can see and we'll retweet it this is like your on-chain resume or maybe like your on-chain uh trophy case or something like this it's a lot of fun to build the artist behind this by the way is the same artist for the noun style this is why it's pixelated and it looks like that very cool uh another release this week's swell Network what are they up to uh so on the network we've talked about them before uh live mainnet is now in public beta so this is a staking as a service like rocket pool like Lido like all the other ones uh brand new Dao uh with uh plans to integrate distributed validator technology which is more technology that that I get super hot on uh and so they are launching their arena is launched uh so uh they would like you to join their Community is their deal and also steak also steak Yeah should also mention both fee and swell uh Dave and I are Angel Investors and these projects really excited about them um jobs of the week David speaking of excitements here we got some jobs at coinbase a staff blockchain engineer a staff smart contract engineer uh I think working with Jesse Powell and team Jesse's a nice guy we like what I've heard Phantom software engineer mobile Phantoms hiring software engineer front end they just released their wallet by the way it's a polygon in ethereum awesome project lots of jobs here today premium someone wants a web 3 product management and architect uh dinera wants a Smart contract engineer uniswap Labs needs a senior back-end engineer a senior product designers for uniswap as well there's a ton of jobs dude scroll down there's so many jobs there are so many jobs look how many jobs there are it keeps on growing it's one of those things that you keep on scrolling and it keeps on loading there's so many crypto this is a bear Market in crypto and it's still hiring like like crazy which is uh impressive coming up next we got the questions from the nation we're going to talk about Ai and blockchain and what that intersection looks like so that's the question for the nation uh it's also similar a take from the week tremath polyhapatia from uh the all-in podcast gives a take that crypto is dead do we disagree with that take or do we not disagree with that take we'll talk about that uh and then we're going to talk about what we are bulletron so all of that and more but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and on but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete

waitlist to get access in late February bankless is launching the bankless token Hub at bankless we've been studying the crypto markets ever since 2017 and all of our research has led us to this the token Hub you're a One-Stop shop for Alpha to help you navigate through the crypto markets have you ever wished for a trusted resource that would share their thoughts ratings and their opinions about tokens boy do we have the product for you the bank list token hub is where we provide bankless citizens with the Alpha and the hottest tokens in crypto we do the research so you don't have to the bank

your fellow citizens to rate these tokens yourselves the bank list token Hub is launching right now and has already been beta tested by your fellow bankless citizens so stay tuned in the bankless Discord for updates and if you are not a bankless citizen well you better sign up if you want access because this corner of Bank list is available for Citizens only I'll see you in the Discord we have a question from rocket pollster this week David you ready for this yeah hit me rocket pollster goes given a future of AI deep fakes disinformation and blockchains what companies and projects are at the Forefront of ensuring provenance and how is in Brackets Hardware question mark so we acknowledge all of these problems with AI becoming like we don't know who the robots are online uh you know whether the robots created this piece of content or a human did and robots are like infinitely scalable okay very very cheap to spin up um we've always had sort of uh when it was just the humans on the internet there was a cost to kind of producing information and uh now there's this ability to mass spread all sorts of information like like information that's not credible all sorts of things so is there a blockchain solution to this or is there any solution to this that you've seen yeah so um really pressing question I'd say uh I think there is and dare I say rocket Pulsar is looking for Alpha uh about like okay what are the companies here because they're probably I'm assuming that they are bullish on the intersection of AI and crypto and specifically provenance right um this is one of the really early use cases of uh crypto that we've seen before uh once upon a time there was fake news shared about vitalik's death and uh assassination and The Ether Price art deployment and so vitalik took a selfie with a piece of paper of the current block height of ethereum and just to prove that it was recent enough and then tweeted like proof of life right proof of life right uh and and then and then the professor covered and we moved on so like you could use the same sort of format with with like AI right and this is just called time stamping you just like submit a hash and a block about the origination of some content before you release to the public so that when everyone's like what's the real source of this you can prove that you have the most original piece of content so you could sign that with a private key as well right now with the private key right yeah and like that's actually not really revolution in cryptography that is or cryptocurrency that is a revolution in database design as a blockchain that's a database um solution and cryptography cryptography obviously yes that's actually not exclusion that's absent of the currency other than we need a system to secure the database and that's what we use need the currency for anyways I digress I kind of see two um venues here there is the venue of just like identity so like World coin is implicitly going after this any sort of identity on a blockchain the identity play is a part of this like provenance in the world of AI we need human AI um you can trust me because you're listening to be on Bank lists and I'm a human and you've been listening to me for a while and I'm going to tell you that I own David hoffman.e so you can go to David hoffman.eth and you can assume that that's a human there's another human like me is going to socially verify that you own David hoffman.eath right and that's kind of enough to prove that you're a human yeah but you're an AI so that does get precarious so there's there could be more perfect um ways of doing that but there's like the the the what I'm saying is like there are companies that will go directly after this problem and then there are other ways that are adjacent to this that provide solutions to this problem adjacently and that's the identity World um and then there perhaps there are companies that are going directly after that after this which is just like a Time stamping company I remember in 2017 there was like an Ico that was like a Time stamping company on bitcoin and for some reason the bitcoiners said it was bullish um but I don't know of any I can't name any specific ones but it is a very that's a good that is a worthwhile place of uh research to explore I would say I think it's huge I think it's so important uh yeah this tidal wave of manipulative content is about to hit the internet so we got to find out who the humans are and who the robots are it's uh it's also a national security threat like this is kind of nation state like when nation states can attack other nation states with Robo propaganda right like how do you actually can like this is just an a massive tidal wave that's going to hit everybody and what I've seen David is like we have the building blocks in crypto it's going to be something crypto or crypto adjacent like we have the the ability to store uncensorable approval data on computers that are always running cannot be taken down cannot be censored we've got that we got the private key cryptography um and kind of the management we have some of the early stages of identity type systems World coin kind of takes it to the we can actually prove a human using like Iris scan type data and by the way I think we want to get worldcoin on the podcast at some point to discuss this oh it's wonderful we have that scheduled Tim Altman I'm the co-founder coming on I haven't seen anybody who's put this together in a way that's like scalable and gonna work there's like a lot of slides and a lot of companies promising and decentralized identity has been a theme verifiable credentials have been a thing that people have talked about but who is actually putting it all together a lot of talk right but like who's actually putting it together and making it scalable making it ready for the world so the solution is completely clear I know it's going to I like I feel very strongly it's going to be crypto or crypto adjacent what can I invest in like where's the alpha I'm I mean that's what I want I'm I'm kind of back with rocket pollster and the truth is I haven't quite seen the project that really excites me on this yet but it's got to come right we gotta solve this somebody's gonna solve it yeah yeah I think the big question is like does this get solved emergently by a collection of adjacent Technologies like I was saying or is there one particular startup that's going to tackle this problem head on like that's an interesting question yeah I agree all right we'll we'll keep our eyes great questions let's get to some takes this week David the first take is one we teased earlier from uh chamoth from the all in podcast he says David crypto is dead in America I saw this tweet from CNBC he said in the in the US it's dead but I think we should go straight to the source and actually hear what he said in context so let's play that I was just curious to get uh your thoughts SEC obviously sent to Wells notice we talked about this before to Brian Armstrong of coinbase he said he's thinking about uh or considering relocating out of the U.S if the regulatory Clarity does not improve crypto's dead in America it is that in America crypto is that in America I mean now you have Kansas you against her even blaming the banking crisis on crypto so they've the the United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto um scapegoat or was it a around find out moment for crypto in your mind or a little bit of both I I don't know I just think that they were probably the ones that were the most threatening to The Establishment okay and they were the ones that In fairness to The Regulators did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy and yeah so now they're paying the price for the the bill has come due for them what do you think about that I love how they talk about this they talk about us as like all of them them the crypto industry I'm like we do we do the same we do the same things of course everyone does this this but it's like interesting industry with yeah yeah the crypto people their check has come due right it's like that is not my check I didn't catch that one well what do you think of this overall take then so yeah yeah that was our take for last week on the weekly roll I was like yeah crypto is dead in America that's a hyperbolic statement the chamoth is a little bit of a diva all of these guys are a little bit of Divas so are we content producers are kind of Divas uh he's being a little bit of a diva uh he's not rock everything he says right by saying his statement so emphatically and hyperbolically that's what you're saying yeah and you agree with the the the tone and the thrust of of that statement but I bet you'd have some like quibbles with it's not actually dead in America yeah I mean we haven't like outlawed crypto we just we're in front of Congress last week and Gary Gensler was thoroughly grilled for his anti-innovation anti-crypto posturing I think it's um for me it's a step too far to say crypto is dead in America 100 it's 100 and I think if you if we were having a conversation with him and we were nitpicking he would become much more moderate about it yeah just like as the high level headlines yeah yeah and it's like it's a little bit of like a quote-unquote bottom signal right like he is he is presenting a specific snapshot in time and what he's saying a way to interpret this is like this is the worst moment in crypto's American relationship ever yes that's accurate and coinbase is going to sue the F out of Gary Gensler in the SEC and we're going to come back and so it's up only from here in terms of the health of our relationship with America I think so if he's also making the broader Point like one purpose of the sound bite that headline on CNBC is like you could phrase this another way The Regulators or the government is killing crypto in America right that's also hyperbolic but that also kind of like what are you guys doing you're screwing this up you're leaving America behind and I hope that's kind of the the takeaway here too uh get some more takes here David here is from ethereum on arm this is uh what are we looking at we're looking at some Hardware here yeah so I put this one in here this is an ethereum staking node you can tell like how close up we are to this tiny little box because of the blur effect on the on the camera this has got to be what three inches by three inches by one inch of a of a computer full full computer that's an ethereum staking node this is this is I had to phrase it this way because but it's so awesome this is the smallest most powerful dissident technology form factor that exists this is a nation state this is a Netflix Freedom technology there's no like you can't this is ethereum you cannot shut this down one one of these things in every person's home in like one in 100 people's homes it doesn't matter it's like so powerful there's capital on this thing it's verifying a network it is an online Network State uh it is it is cryptography it is cryptocurrency it is just the instantiation of everything that is so cool about the frontier of Technology the industry that we are building and it's it's uh like I hate to be an anti-statist I am an anti-sadist but it's a big few to nation states because like I don't look I don't think look what we can do on top of our in our little computer box I actually don't think you're as anti-status as as you just uh maybe expressed if somebody took that um and you know that that sound clip out is I think this another way to put this and guys we're coming out with an episode on liberalism the protocol of liberalism on Monday is not necessarily anti-status it is anti-authoritarian yes and this is yeah this is liberalism protocol preserving so property rights censorship resistance freedom of speech you know those things and the amendments in the Constitution that we set up our Democratic Republic protocols with it's that kind of Technology a new institutional form factor it's so awesome I know it's awesome I like that you pulled that out I didn't know what you're gonna say on that image but um that's you know way cooler this is the part two of this Tech of this take actually so it continues you'll be happy to hear so here's a take from tycoon.eath when your ethalidator it's chosen to build a block you've got to step back and appreciate one of the greatest miracles of Open Source coordination and collaboration for 12 seconds your tiny machine in your bedroom is responsible for carrying on a network at work worth billions of billions of dollars it's so awesome it's so awesome it is uh wow that's why that's why I'm in this community David that's why I'm in this industry this is I really believe in this technology as a Force for good uh yeah all right cool you gotta take two let me read David Hoffman's take bankless is an AI alignment podcast until further notice track record so far Eliezer utkowski 99 chance of Doom Paul Cristiano 50 chance of Doom I just recorded with somebody their name is his name uh Miri he says there's a 95 chance of doing oh that's bad news David 95 chance yeah this is the guy that worked director of the machine intelligence Research Institute he's at 95 he works with um so I expected he'd be in like the 80s to 90s but 95 isn't awesome yeah um and then you finish it with this want Eve to hit 10K we gotta solve AI alignment I don't know I think we can hit 10K before that but you know what's the good of your 10K eat if the robots come and destroy it anyway right yeah I think that's the take here so what did you want to say about this um yeah that's it um yeah our hands are what's the word our hands are forced like what's the point of doing anything else if we can't solve AI why are we giving this one more uh special tension there's all sorts of existential threats right there's nuclear it's the information there's biotech why do you think it's it's one or it's one level one dimension higher than all other Accenture it's the meta existential threat because it can cause all the other existential threats to happen or not happening I kind of agree with this and the other thing is if we get it right on the good side it starts to solve all of the other extensions threats okay potentially not just potentially so that was actually uh so I'm here in Montenegro doing this whole like Network stake thing with a bunch of um different experts from different corners of the uh of the world and so Nate I was talking to Nate just add the longest interview I usually do 20 to 40 minutes I mean interviews while I'm out here I did over an hour with him the last question and the last point that we the point of things that we talked about is like all of the Doom that these people feel because I I started to get into the person I was like okay dude like how do you wake up in the morning how do you keep going when you when you are at 95 I'm glad you did that I'm glad you got into that by the way so that was the end of it and he and he just talked about like I I had my same thing with eleazer dude I had my cry and then picked it up and I kept on going because what else am I going to do I'm going to solve this problem and then I did the whole like bankless internal Optimus thing because you know we're Optimus and I'm like okay well understanding that there's a 99 chance of Doom that we can't solve AI problems it's it's Terminator it's but it's the worst it's hell it's all about we all we all get our atoms repurposed all the bad stuff that is the Apparently likely most likely outcome for the AI alignment problem under the conditions that we do solve AI alignment and I'm not saying that we know how to do that but under the assumption that we do get there we do through it thread that very small needle it's not just like oh phew we solved ai ai alignment we're not dying it's actually all of the evils that we are trying to avoid invert and they go from evils to positive because we fix AI alignment and so it not just goes like Oh no phew we're still we still get to operate Society Society starts to become literally perfect it becomes a Utopia it becomes Heaven because we solved AI alignment and because we are working with them and they are producing the heaven that we want and so like maybe the 99 is bad but the one percent chance that we solve a alignment is so good they're telling me there's a chance there's no I'm not telling you that there's a chance I'm telling you that if once we if we do get through that chance the other side of that chance is so cool and awesome because AIS are doing cool stuff for us alongside us shoulder to shoulder with us that that is should be motivating and it it cancels out how how bad the 99 is and so I don't think that's what it's about for me but I think it's it's definitely the stakes are like we don't often talk about the other side of this if we do get it right I mean right all of our episodes have been Doomer but like I think it can solve a whole bunch of the existential problems that are outside of the category of AI not just a whole bunch all of them it sell it that's the whole that's a cool thing it solves every problem is that what you're bullish on this week David I think I saw that is this what your bullish on AI crypto tell me about what you're bullish on yeah so uh actually that goes back to a rocket pollster's question uh yeah in that that topic I am bullish on all of a sudden this AI alignment problem is going to like sweep the world slowly but surely we're front running the opportunity here at Bankers with this eventually everyone's going to be talking about this because we're going to be faced with the problem crypto is going to provide some tools and some like like time stamping like proof of humanity like all of this stuff is going to provide parts of the solution we need to live in an AI world and it starts to go it's going to start to legitimize crypto because we've been thinking about these problems for the last decade and web 2 has not and nation states have not we are creating future Technologies in crypto that we need to live in an AI world and we've been building them for a decade now and so we as an industry are the most prepared to help humans live in a post AI world and that is going to be extremely legitimizing and so AI is going to come in and then people be like okay that crypto thing we kind of need those guys um thanks for building the identity stuff uh and that's that's what I'm bullish on oh I'm also bullish on uh a prescient Bank list listeners will notice that it's a different time in the day from the last pre-sponsor break that's because we had to pause the uh pause the episode go do like three meetings and come back because Ryan and I are super busy in that amount of time I bought one of the nfts from earlier the mad last yeah you did Solana you did this for the first time I bought uh uh so here's here's my little dude I try to get one that looks like me is it did I get good enough yeah that's pretty good yeah so this is a mad lab there's a mad lab yeah yeah that's good there you go it's also I'm I'm now bullish mad Lads and I own one so David is now a Solana Bowl I'm now a salon a maxi eat that eat the Maximus sorry he's turned this is honest it's gonna be so mad at me okay Ryan what are you Boss run um I am bullish that we won't go the way that the US won't go the way of China in terms of banning crypto we're already seeing like Europe do something that was much more measured with with Mika that's great but like actually reflecting on the hearing the grilling of Gary Gensler last week crypto has a lot of friends in Congress pretty surprised right Patrick McHenry Tom emmer um these people maybe they CA hopefully they care about Western liberal values they care about things like Free Speech but even if they don't maybe they're just doing this for the money or whatever crypto also has some of that too like votes and dollars and um so I'm bullish that we won't go their way of China and I'm also bullish that we have a court system that can check nation state regulators and Powers I don't know if this works in all the countries around the world but the fact that a company an entrepreneur can effectively sue the SEC and Gary Gensler and that there is another Power a higher power in the court system and checking and balance on a regulator that wants to completely quash this industry that's another bullish signal um I also think that we can win the court of opinion right so you heard the Brian Armstrong's like hey I started the company entrepreneur I decided to locate It in America what what genzler is doing he's driving this out of the US how is it fair how is it fair how how can you be called a credible uh regulator of Securities when after seven years you don't even know you can't even tell us you won't give us the clarity on whether ether is a security or not it's not that freaking hard in fact we saw those clips earlier Gensler knew it was a commodity in 2018 like it was obvious and now he can't tell us it's a commodity I think we win that battle in the court of public opinion and I do think like in a democracy hopefully that's what the US still is it has has that that semblance it calls itself a democracy that will matter as well and so I think we win there too so we're winning in winning in Congress or early stages of like turning the ties in Congress court system check and balance I think we can win the court of opinion as well so all of this to say you know this has almost been the year we've been talking so much about Regulators in 2023 and it's all because of the backlash of SBF and dokwan and machinski in 2022 and I get it but I feel like I feel like we've seen the worst I don't want to say it's the bottom like there could still be some things an operation choke point that are happening but I'm starting to see um blue skies ahead and the tide turning a little bit and I don't think that this ends with kind of a you know us ban on crypto or some disaster scenario yeah I think that's right and when we were doing our Ledger show uh the state of the nation we did yesterday the chart show uh we for a brief moment we were talking about how like you and I got very bullish on ether in the 2018 to 2020 bear market and it was it was perhaps one of the most contrarian things that you and I will ever do with our lives was be bullish ether in that time frame and like one thing I mentioned in that show and I've been reflecting on it in the last like day or so was that I haven't been able to feel that level of contrarian uh since because like well if it was easy to be considering at 100 ether it's not it's 20 times less hard to do it at two thousand dollar ether but like reflecting on the current state of the world right now Gary genser in the SEC John Oliver just like public opinion about crypto and nfts everyone like crypto crypto is dead and if teaser scams uh we don't need crypto uh upon reflection it actually is once again very contrarian right now and makes it feel very safe because we know crypto is not going anywhere we need they they don't even understand how AI is going to come force their hand and make them use crypto they don't even know that we know that that's why we're here that's what we're doing I I agree it doesn't feel quite as contrary but it's still like uh the angel Trope but we're still early can I say that without saying he's cliche and dumb right it's still actually true we're still early super uh guys to prove that we have a a meme of the week combination Moment of Zen for you the normies won't understand this David uh Balenciaga if Balenciaga met crypto that's what you're about to see it's super weird but I hope you stick around super weird let's see what I'll do that you won't get it risk of disclaimers of course crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot there's only crypto and fashion and fashion is Balenciaga [Music] if you're not wearing Balenciaga you will get liquidated [Music] thank you crypto is risky but we're headed west dressed in Balenciaga [Music]
