[Music] hey guys happy friday morning it is roll up time third week of june david you ready to get into the roll-ups absolutely my favorite piece of content out of the bankless ecosystem is of course the friday weekly rollups where we roll up the entire week of news in the crypto industry in as fast as possible uh and so we go through the markets what's happened in the market releases news ecosystem takes and then we finish off with what ryan and david are excited about and of course the cherry on top the meme of the week this episode is a little bit different in that we are actually sprinkling some memes throughout the episode and so if you want all the memes you're gonna have to say to the very end because there are little easter eggs of memes throughout this entire entire episode it's gonna be a good one absolutely you guys can check that out to get the the most memes into your brain via youtube that's the way to get this visually it also comes out on the podcast david before we get in we got to talk about our friends at ledger because they're doing some amazing things with ledger live so if you have a ledger as i think many listening to the bankless program do not just one but many ledgers there are new ways you can start there are many there are new ways you can start using it in d5 all sorts of new ways through ledger live do you want to talk about this for a second david yeah totally i think we're going to get into this but i think we're in this big consolidation period in crypto and this is the time for you as a listener to refine your your crypto environment right like if you just like needed into crypto in the last few months and you haven't really figured things out and you don't have a hardware wallet yet you need to get a hardware wallet ledger is like the first stop into the world of banklessness and the combination of a ledger hardware wallet plus the ledger live software it really unlocks a lot of the powers of defy as like a really easy stepping stone to get into the world so if you're new to d5 if you have friends that are new to d5 the ledger hardware wall is something you absolutely need and it pairs very well with the ledger live app absolutely guys so uh now's the time get your equipment prepared we've got kind of a lull in the market so make sure you've got the right equipment for the bankless journey uh and you can see a link in the show notes to help you with that that's bankless dot cc slash ledger yt all right david you ready to talk about markets market time all right what is happening in the markets and i mean what is happening in the markets uh bitcoin let's start there where are we at we are at three thousand thirty eight thousand three hundred dollars still struggling to keep its head above that 40 000 mark which is where bitcoiners have said that they kind of feel safe bitcoiners feel safe above 40 000 below it yeah we're still kind of in no man's territory don't really know what we're doing we had the el salvador news this week and that pumped up bitcoin up to forty three thousand dollars but uh it quickly retraced all the way back down to forty thousand dollars kept its head above forty thousand dollars for forty thousand dollars for most of the week but now we are dipping once again below that forty thousand dollar mark yeah are people disappointed in that did they think the el salvador news would be more persistent um it seemed like there were some good things that came out of that but also maybe some regulatory fund that came out of that so it's a double-edged sword or maybe just just doesn't excite the market as much at at this point in the cycle what are your thoughts on that yeah it is a classic indicator of a bear market that good news does not show up in the charts and we i have to say that that's what i'm seeing right now like the el salvador news did not really revitalize bitcoin in the way a lot of people hoped for that being said at the same time uh there is generally a lull between good news with bitcoin and where it actually does show up in the markets for example microstrategy for example which we know that literally the bitcoin price is higher because of microstrategy how could it not be they have over a hundred and thousand bitcoins on the balance sheet uh but the the micro strategy news didn't really get to start being reflected in the bitcoin chart for multiple weeks afterwards i think it was like six to eight weeks afterwards and so that's kind of the narrative that i'm hearing from ck my my favorite bitcoiner uh and they just people bitcoiners think that like oh yeah we're in this like the world's gonna have to like come to terms with this and they're gonna figure it out and so they'll start buying when they slowly figure it out like six to eight weeks later wait david we just said uh nick carter was our favorite bitcoiner do you have two or were you where are you going ck is my family my in real life homie okay irl friend bitcoiner yeah okay there we go all right well what about eth is that showing a better picture here nope it's not thank you the same thing it jumped above 2 600 i think it peaked out at right below two thousand two thousand seven hundred dollars and we are now down at two thousand three hundred and fifty dollars at the time of recording continuing exactly what ledger said on our state of the nation with him which i continue to find extremely insightful and helpful definitely go watch that if you have not yet but uh it looks like crypto is just range bound between uh for ether between like 2 000 and 3 000 and big for bitcoin between like you know 35 000 and 40 000. that's kind of gonna be where we're going to hang out that's kind of the gist that people are saying i i still feel like ethereans kind of feel safe around above 2000 so still feeling safe but like if it dips below 2000 not feeling so great about you the price um yeah like ledger the the tl dr of that episode in addition is showing us how to trade which was was much needed help for me he basically said that he thought there's a decent chance that ethan bitcoin are kind of flat from here on out for the year for the remainder of the year the next six months we're talking about that we'll have to see how all of this plays out but of course and also no one knows like no one knows new news can happen it was a guess right it's like and but that the interesting thing about that guess is kind of it's kind of a contrarian guess because it's not how the pattern has played out in previous cycles right in previous cycles this is either a lull and then we snap right back up or like the market's over we hit the top and it's all down down down from here for a while um all right if bitcoin chart the ratio how's the ratio holding up it's down a bit same kind of like ranging pattern it's on the lower end of the range the range that i think is being established is between 0.06 and 0.08 and we are at that low side of that range at point zero six one two um and so we are if we'll see if we can you know really like kind of bounce between these two ranges um but you know so overall still pretty high in terms and overall like you know historically 0.06 yeah ether btc is is high historically um back to where we are in early march uh sorry early may excuse me yeah so much slower than you see really establishing a floor perhaps hopefully it doesn't break down um because we like that number to be high at least i do okay i'm speaking of breakdowns i want to talk about that other ratio that we talk about every week but not yet because i think that has break broken down david don't don't hang on your hats okay we'll see um anthony sessano this chart is absolutely incredible he says this is the amount of eth locked in smart contracts it's at 23 of all eth's supply in smart contracts um this is a similar level to what it was he points out which i thought was interesting at the dao event the dao of course like original 20 2016 when everyone in ethereum basically thought the dow was this killer app was like a decentralized investment vehicle they just shoveled they just yeah it was the only app and they just like everyone is so excited they just all eat holders there this is a v much smaller amount of them just shoveled all of their ether into the doubt of course there was a hack a very famous incident and we've talked about a lot but now we're back to where we were except that at the time of the dow ether was worth 230 million beef locked in the dow and everyone thought that was amazing now eth locked in smart contracts is worth 63 billion dollars 63 billion dollars five years pretty crazy yeah there's two stories here at the at the dow the event of the dao the reason why i was able to capture so much eath is because eth was extremely undistributed right and so while there was 22.5 of all ethan there it was really only a relatively small handful of players because ether hadn't been distributed ethereum was one year old and so it's really just a bunch of og whales who had like ether between one and ten dollars um the fact that we have an equivalent amount of ether and smart contracts nowadays is a story of how many more smart contracts there are to deposit ether into and those smart contracts are really uh now like compelling places to deposit ether into and the other story of course is that ether this time around is very much treated as a monetary asset and the applications attracting all of those ether deposits are treating ether as a monetary asset and that's why they are receiving deposits and so the really the the story of this is like in 2016 with the dow ether wasn't a money and there was only one contract to deposit the ether into and in in 2021 ether is money and there's a ton of smart contracts trying to compete for those deposits and that's why ether is reaching like 22.5 percent of all ether deposit in smart contracts and i don't think it's going down at all i think it's i think it's marching right up to 50 it's so much healthier right so like about 10 is is distributed in d5 contracts so all the ave compound protocols we know and love close to four or five percent or so of of that supply is deposited deposited into the beaking chain staking contract so as you're saying david not all in one place if you look at this chart in 2016 it's just like nothing and then straight up does not look healthy um getting to where we are now has been a series of sort of apps that have really earned the eth that they have in them so it's just a cool story gonna be cool to see that let's talk about total locked value in d5 because we always talk about it every week um we're kind of range bound again i guess that's the story about 60 billion or so locked beneath it locked in d5 right now yep nothing too much there except for the fact that ave continues to hold the number one spot at 14.5 percent of all tvl is in ave which is pretty cool by a healthy margin but you look at this curve is number two um interesting interesting unseating maker now has the bronze medal curve is number two ave number one d5 pulse index are we flat on the week here too let me zoom out to the weak yep a little bit flat a little bit flat wow what a boring market it's flat and everyone's sad about it hey flat market i have no complaints um it just gives us more time to build cool stuff all right look at these numbers these are great okay we are now looking at the dpi versus eth and the i called the bottom at point one three said that that was the bottom uh on uniswap dpi versus eth is at point one two nine nine on sushi swap ethe dpi is at point one three zero one i call it a watch at exactly 0.1 the the .13 bottom call still intact still intact i'm not not admitting defeat yet you are hanging by a string though like this is just like there's no way this is gonna stay intact for another week oh come on have some faith possibly and by the way it it did drop look at this yeah but if it drops and come back it's backed up i'm still claiming victory it needs to meaningfully it has to be on our on our weekly rollup like at the time of recording our weekly roll up if it's below 0.13 if it's below 4.13 for two weekly roll ups in a row then i will admit to feet okay okay and it's gonna be below 0.13 by like not just a sliver like a decent amount i is it there's some goal posts moving here no no shush no we'll see i don't think it'll hold no matter how you move those goal posts david um let's talk about this mind-blowing revenue numbers from index co-op really cool dow to highlight really cool d5 product as well um they made close to a million dollars in top lane revenue over the past eight months this is like an etf killer it's like d5's answer to blackrock um black yeah blackrock vanguard group like like etf um products index products and uh they're crushing it this is a tweet by peter pan i think this is the index co-ops orchestra it's like the org chart right mm-hmm but even even brighter than that it's like orgs plus partnerships yeah we've we've gone to some index co-op calls like i'm not into like i haven't done much in the index co-op dao but um we've attended some calls and that is just like it's floating it's fluid it is run well um everybody contributes everyone knows what they're doing i really feel like the index co-op dao is kind of a model for other dows to learn from like encourage people if they're listening if you're part of a dow index index call if you're not the index co opt out but like bankless tower any other dow that's forming go check out what index co-op is doing how they're managing their processes because i feel like they're they're just nailing it and they're laser focused on meaningful metrics that will um deliver great products and deliver aum into their products super cool yeah and the reason why we are talking about literally the org chart of index co-op in the market section is because of the tweet that ryan was just sharing a second ago like is it a coincidence that index co-op perhaps the most organized dow in the entire space is also generating an insane amount of revenue like no i don't think so and so this is a story of a dao with on-chain smart contracts that puts money into the index co-op bank and off-chain people organ organization organ organizing other people right you know capital coordination people coordination like there's a story here index co-op really killing it nice job guys yeah you're starting to see that even like the comment about avi ave has managed their dow and their operations very well you're starting to see d5 protocols separate themselves not just on the idea but also on the execution and organization around that idea and i think we'll continue to see that um all right let's go to what's happening next bitcoin in the lightning network all right so bitcoin in the lightning network has accelerated to over 1500 bitcoin in the lightning network the the through line here is that um bitcoin in the lightning network the supply has really been flat for a very long amount of time and it's finally setting new highs it's been it's it peaked out in july of 2019 uh and then it dipped through all out all of 2020 and we are finally breaking into new new highs of btc supply in the lightning network there's very much a renewed interest in the lightning network ever since the um the bitcoin 21 2021 conference in miami uh and that's being shown by more and more people depositing bitcoin into the lightning network guess who else is excited david jack dorsey big shocker twitter jack dorsey ceo says uh excuse me twitter ceo jack dorsey says it's only a matter of time before twitter integrates bitcoin lightning network only amount of time is kind of the same thing as saying soon tm uh we've heard jack make comments like this before uh i'm waiting to see it uh i don't really know what twitter would do with bitcoin integration that's like meaningfully different than just like why don't you also just like pass around dollars i think more more crypto twitter or more twitter people would want to pass dollars around each other but interesting to see what jack has in store for a lightning network twitter integration david i have kind of a hot take on lightning here let's hear it okay so i think that bitcoiners should take a step back and ask themselves why lightning has the tiny almost minuscule level of adoption that it has right like i i get that it's increased a little bit there's 500 i guess additional bitcoin in lightning over the past few months but this is still a very small number like it almost is insignificant like it almost there right and like it we've been talking about the year of crypto has been talking about about the year of lightning since like 2018. 2019 will be the year of lightning 2020 will be the year of lightning 2021. um i remember there were like memes in ethereum about payment networks coming like raiden for instance and state channels and like plasma these technologies these things didn't work out but you know what um like i feel like the ethereum community realized they didn't work out and then they moved on and i also feel like the bitcoin community is just stuck on the lightning meme and they're not taking a step back and looking at adoption like these numbers are small david we're talking about um point zero zero eight three percent that's two zeros in front of the eight three percent of bitcoin supply in lightning we just talked about total locked value in d5 right 10 of all eth 23 inside smart contracts 23 versus zero zero eight three percent of bitcoin in lightning and i'm not being a hater here because i support non-custodial bankless peer-to-peer transmission i think lightning as a technology is trustless and it's great but we should also step back and ask ourselves like why it's not working is it because people don't want to spend their bitcoin to your point like stable coins maybe the use case like bitcoin digital gold hey that worked well i don't want to spend my digital gold i'll spend my crappy fiat dollars maybe that's the reason maybe it's also the capital inefficiency these payment networks maybe it's user experience maybe it's people don't care as much about decentralization when they can use a a custody bitcoin bank for these things anyway i'm i'm just kind of over and kind of exhausted by the meaning of lightning without the real world adoption that was okay in 2017 2018 to get excited about these kind of like a 500 bitcoin gain here or there but like it's 20 21. we have d5 right like we don't need to settle for this so if that feels like a rant against lightning i'm sorry i appreciate the technologists working on this um but at the same time let's be real about our progress here and the technology certainly hasn't panned out the way i think the advocates hoped for it maybe we should think about alternatives yeah i 100 agree with basically everything you just said i think the reason why i wanted to bring this up in today's weekly rollups is is kind of to give and maybe this is what you're critiquing is but but giving the bitcoiners the benefit of the doubt like there was lightning network hype at bitcoinmiami and bitcoiners that i pay attention to are once again stoked by lightning network maybe that is just straight up stockholm syndrome or some version of it where like they don't really have a choice like what else are they going to be excited about like taproot is also here but also is that really all that cool of an innovation that's up for debate as well maybe they're just beating the drum about like the one innovation that they have um at the end of the day uh they're they're bitcoiners are excited about it they're talking about it so we're talking about it in the news um but yeah ryan everything you said i'm kind of on board with well we'll see look i'd be super excited if um maybe we're missing something we are not deep in the weeds we are not like network at all i don't run a lightning network note guys if there's something we are missing here reach out to david and i and tell us what we are missing um oh boy let's talk about don't have that no okay i'm sure the banquo's audience is friendly and it's certainly open-minded all right um let's talk about this bearish uni feet accrual this is super interesting david so the top uniswap um pool right now so if you recall in uniswap v2 there was only one fee pool percentage like structure yes the structure was set at point three percent every single pool in uniswap v3 you have three different tiers of pools i believe it's three um there's a very low uh tier of pool where it's it's 0.05 there's still the standard point three percent and i think there's like a point five percent right one percent uh one percent okay so point three there's one whole percent it's not point one percent so there's really expensive there's the weight used to be sort of normal and there's low fee what's really interesting is the usdc eth pair the lowest fee tier the .05 just surpassed the point three percent and what's interesting about that is it means surpassing volume in trading volume exactly yes uh that that's important not total over the last 24 hours not over the last seven days correct so we can't extrapolate this trend until we see a trend too much but what would be interesting i think is if low fee liquidity pools um like one out and like why wouldn't they win out right um but the the analysis here the second order analysis here is probably that what could happen then is some of these pools commoditize and then fees are lower so possible fees back to unit swap holders in the form of revenue are also lower so does this start to chip away at the armor of any kind of amm um value accrual token value accrual uh hope right so like the idea that hey these these pools will just commoditize and fees will kind of collapse to near zero and um there won't be much revenue generated over the long term by automated market makers i mean it's good for users but for holders of the uni token what do you think this means yeah i think this is an extension off of very early ethereum conversation in 2015 to 17 where people were talking about the power and possibilities of smart contracts and people are saying you know this is all going to be open source software because if somebody makes a smart contract on ethereum that implements a fee people will just fork it and do it without the fee turns out that that never really happened and really what's happening instead is instead of forking out fees defy apps are competing to get lower and lower fees right there d5 is a crucible of capital efficiency and fee competition and we are now like converging upon lower and lower fees as this competition gets more and more intense and so the 100 percent the lowest fee tier structure of unit swap generating the more the most volume on ether to dollar pairs is really really interesting usually that the the thought was that lowest fee tier the point zero five percent fee tier was really kind of meant for stable coin swaps or like to like asset swaps just because why am i paying a whole point three percent on like trading crypto dollars right why am i doing that um less it makes more sense when you know things that are like priced stay inside of the same bound to have a lower fee for that but now we're seeing ether trading in that lower fee tier uh but the other half of this argument the the the to continue on with what you were saying um it's the unit swap has less margin that is available for them to capture fees on in theory right if if everyone is trading in this lowest fee tier there's less of a you know total collected fees for the uni token to really capture if it ever wanted to turn that on but if we go back to our conversation with joel monegro it's more about le it's less about the specific revenue captured by the fees and more about the power to direct money right so if a lot of money and just values circulating through uniswap regardless of the fee tiers then the and the uni token holders govern over the the flow of funds that's valuable for the uni token holders and the way that he described this is that if all these users who are using uniswap to trade and they're all using the 0.05 percent you know trading pool they are incentivized to to keep that 0.05 percent like trading like the same right they want they want to control that fee they want to keep that fee low and that incentive to have power and governance over the fee tiers and how fees are directed is goes into buying demand for the uni token so it's less about is the uni token actually going to receive cash flows and more about how much is the uni token in demand because of the incentive to direct the cash flows of the unit swap governance and so joe's joel's theory was that you don't actually need to capture cash flows in order to have a valuable uni token and so this is a domain that we're going to have to explore in this base like sure there's a there's tokens that will that don't capture actual cash flows but they have power and that's going to be an incentive to buy and hold the tokens and so maybe we actually have to reconstruct how we even think about these tokens it could be yeah it could be and i see the other side of the argument and by the way this this uh doesn't necessarily mark a trend i mean uta swap is generating massive amount of free fees in general the total revenue is up yeah it does make me less um comfortable i would say with uh my understanding of d5 token assets we'll say it that way because there's definitely if you treat defy tokens as capital assets just like stocks and you can model them based on net present value future cash flows that's a very beautiful thing if now we're saying the model has kind of shifted a little bit where you can't just look at the cache that it generates and it's this other thing it's like this power governance dynamic power tokens power we don't know how to we don't know how to model that right then that's not capital assets they're power tokens i love that i love that meme well there you go so we'll have to see how this plays out anyway um i thought that was super interesting this week let's talk about something else that's interesting nearly 90 of cryptocurrency investors surveyed said they weren't scared by may's brutal sell-off what are they doing instead they're planning to buy more see this is why this whole like range bound thing is actually a a period of very high pain because no one's no one's selling because people are still bullish we still think well who is selling somebody's selling right yeah no very few people are selling people are trying to accumulate because they want to buy more but now we're accumulating at like 23 to 2 600 ether that's a really tough price to accumulate at like it's kind of expensive yeah everyone is still expecting it to go more right and so like that's that's where the max payne is is you know only the the most convicted people are really like ready to just yeet their funds into ether and so the people who are trying to stack as much ether as possible they want to stack it below two thousand dollars um but a lot of people want to stack it below two thousand dollars and so it seems to be there's a lot of people with demand to buy either but it's also demand to buy ether at this you know historically this expensive price this is crypto holders right now first meme of the show basically what crypto holders are are the the wolf of wall street i'm not effing selling meme right now uh even though we all got smacked by that 60 drawdown plus a little bit of a rebound everyone is like no i'm not selling no way guys we will be back in just a moment with some releases because the builders are still building but before we get to releases we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in devi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing gas costs with battle rewards meaning that your gas feeds are reimbursed up to the cost of the transaction with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchangetoday ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right guys we are back with releases the first is metamask is going institutional welcome to the layer of the blue fox they said i guess metamask is releasing an institutional version of their popular browser extension david what's happening here yeah i'm actually not too sure i would like to get a peek under the hood of what this new version of metamask is which apparently is focused for institutions uh to me it's a if it's you know kind of similar to its current instantiation of a d5 web you know a web browser that has your ethereum wallet or connects to your ledger and allows you to connect to defy apps how does it change if it's for institutions is it still a web browser is it something else um can i use it i i kind of want to find out what metamask institution is maybe i'm an institution um i think some clarity around this would would uh be interesting but i i'd like to see like what what about metamask is different and now it is for institutions interesting that metamask is going after the institutional client and i think that kind of started with their um their dex order routing feature which you know and starts to just bring a lot of the power of defy into the actual metamask interface so maybe they're kind of just like you know being a white glove service a white glove app yeah i think this is going to be trend for d5 like the ave institutional liquidity pools is another like defy opening its doors to institutions might be something that a lot of protocols and infrastructure in the space start to do all right david let's talk about alchemix because they released something cool this week and then there were some issues what is alchemix what did they release yeah so alchemix is the defy app where you can deposit dollars and then you can get a dollar a loan against your dollars so interesting primitive the what you do is you deposit dollars and then those dollars get deposited into yearn and then you can borrow up to 50 of your deposited dollars in more dollars and then the loan pays itself back from the yield generated by yearn uh and so you actually don't have to pay back your own loan it just pays back your cell itself over time they just alchemics just releases a long-awaited al eth which is the same thing i just described but now instead of dollars it's now eth so you deposit your eth into alchemics alchemix goes and deposits that into urine into other places and then it gets yield on that eath and to pay back your ether alone uh and so then you can deposit you know 10 eth into alchemics you can immediately borrow five eth against that 10 each and then that five each that you're borrowing will slowly pay itself back over time so it's really just this magic tool to deposit into ether into and then you wait and then you have more ether after you're done waiting uh and so you get to bring your your east interest forward in time basically and spend it now yes exactly right uh and and so really for the for the eath bulls out there who are long-term oriented long-term focus and our bullish eath no matter what this is a great product for them because you already have eath you put the eat in the alcoholics and then you wait and then you have more eat later and so if you're if you're if you have if you're bullish either you have a long time horizon this is the product for you it's been a very anticipated release and now that's finally here everyone's super stoked had a little bit of a hiccup out the gate there's a little bit of a a bug in the in the code nothing terribly critical um but basically the initial depositors were able to borrow al eth and then also withdraw their collateral and so that's bad so they paused the contract uh funds are safe no one really lost any funds um uh but there's a they paused the contract they they fixed it i i don't know if they've redeployed it or not um but basically they are here's the section that uh i think is worth reading is how are we going to put this right um first off we know that we have the most amazing community in d5 this is an indisputable facts we are asking if you would like to support the protocol the dow and the devs please consider distributing any excess eth gain during this time to the new transmuter right and so some people were able to withdraw their collateral before their debt was repaid and so there's light a slight like incorrect order of operations with how alchemics worked uh and so um that's what they're asking to do if you benefited from this please go put your eth back um if you want to be a white hat accidental white hat hacker i don't know um but uh at the end of the day uh the this is uh just i think going to be a small hiccup in the rollout of al eth it doesn't really affect the protocol in the long term nothing about uh urine was impacted either uh and so uh so congratulations to alchemix for getting al ethe out the door sorry about the hiccup uh i believe in you guys in the long term yeah i agree that's a that's a good take let's let's talk about this too we talked about index co-op time to get in bed what is bed so um you know we we've made no secret that we're bullish on kind of three different two different asset classes and three sort of sets of assets entirely the two asset classes are crypto money and the banking infrastructure on top so defy protocols primarily right so crypto monies in the bank list thesis are bitcoin and eth and d5 protocols of course are the d5 tokens and you can buy them all at once without having to guess by doing something like purchasing the dpi index which is super cool now the bankless dow and index co-op are combining forces to give you one asset that puts that smushes that portfolio together in a third bitcoin a third each a third dpi so you could buy one token and kind of forget it this is something that you and i have been excited about for a while um we actually proposed this on the index co-op governance form like hey you should make something called a bed index what does bed stand for bitcoin ether defy uh and um now the the bankless dow and index co-op are actually bringing that to market so vote passed through index co-op to go work on that bring that to market i think it should be just a couple of weeks away but it's super cool to see two dows working together to come up with a new um index a new financial primitive and i'm excited to uh to talk about this in bankless material because i think it's a great way for people to get started on their crypto journey with some investment exposure that doesn't involve a whole bunch of garbage that um they might end up buying if they're just looking for short-term pumps there's so many things to talk about here you you hit on one which is dow to dow collaboration just two doubts making products uh and so dows don't necessarily have to go to the outside world they could just talk to other dows to make really awesome products the meme is absolutely fantastic sleep comfy we're gonna have fun ahead right absolutely bitcoin and ether the two crypto monies and then also dp deep pi the the set of tokens that are capital assets cash flowing assets really gives you the full spectrum of what ryan and i consider to be the most quality crypto assets in the entire space you know there there's really only two ecosystems with full blocks that's bitcoin and ethereum uh and then there's really only other the tokens that are out there are that are cash flowing tokens are the tokens that are inside the dpi and so you can sleep comfy in bed and i'm really excited for the bankless endowed to get these streaming fees coming out of this index and so the streaming fees is being split between index co-op and bank list dow so you know the market cap of the bed index in the same way the market cap of dpi uh takes streaming fees and it gets split between d5 pulse and index co-op same thing the the more people that own the beta index as small small streaming fee gets redirected towards the bank list out and the index co-op uh and i'm really excited for the bank list out to put on its like marketing hat and and sales people hat right and because did the bank list out also super organized i don't know if you've been in the in the listeners been in the discord or not but it's one of the most organized and like exciting and vibrant discord channels there are uh and and what happens when like we the bankless dow has this product to really like market uh i expect to see a lot of bed memory on crypto twitter coming soon on chain cash flows that's the story very cool um let's talk about lira david so lira is d5's first complete options automated market maker so this is another options protocol coming to d5 but this one's a little bit different because it uses some different compute it's using like a black shoals pricing model and apparently this sort of thing was super expensive impossibly expensive to deploy on something like the ethereum main net so they're deploying it in layer two a product a primitive that didn't make sense um an options primitive that didn't make sense on mainnet being deployed directly in optimism on a rollup that's pretty exciting that's pretty cool this is just being announced it hasn't rolled out yet i think it's also waiting for optimism but um i've seen the ui i'm super excited about what they're what they're bringing to market just like the possibilities that layer 2 unlocks for d5 i really think options is a new frontier of d5 that i expect to be built out in the next six months i remember it was right around our first ethereum bulls podcast episode in november or december uh and right when ether was really making new highs its first new highs since like 2018 i was like damn i should buy some options uh where can i go get options on ether and the answer was centralized exchanges that don't doesn't take us customers and so i could uh dx uh uh dydx i mean without a yes that's margin though that's not options right true true right yeah and so i went on to darebit and i was like oh let me get in a derebit account like oh like can't do u.s citizens damn uh and so i was like well what dfi app can i do get my options on like what's up uh and turns out options are actually kind of hard to do on the main chain so it's definitely a good product market fit to put on a layer two kind of wish that this was available when ether was six hundred dollars because i remember talking about roommates like hunter uh hunter's my roommate uh i think that ether is going to be four thousand dollars by may if i had got those options it would have been perfect i did i said 4k by may and i will get him to corroborate this uh he was teasing me he was like dude i bet you wish you bought those options now huh i was like damn right you are um wow yeah no options are going to be hot and especially defy options think about composability with this as well like what what happens if you can tokenize an options position that's kind of cool yeah it's a big space and once again enabled by layer 2 which is super cool um speaking of layer two sidechain world paul brody so this is ernest and young he leads their blockchain uh area um super pumped to share that ernest and young eny is now delivering tokens on polygon really cool they're getting into the layer 2 sidechain scene a big for a counting firm is deploying tokens on-site on top of polygon at layer 2. like let that sit in your brain for a second that's pretty cool yeah it is definitely uh volomex finance version one is now live on ethereum david i haven't checked this out looks like they got a cool video but what's what's volumex volumex it looks like it's a tokenized project to tokenize volatility so it reminds me of the vix index in you know the traditional finance world now we have tokens that track the volatility of other assets right so you know ether volatility you know maybe you know ave volatility unit we can we can we can bet on the volatility now yeah you can bet hedge against it you're right exactly uh you know really important d5 primitive and just an another money lego that probably has a lot of surface area to latch on to other money legos so that's gonna be pretty cool live on mainnet um yeah here's here's an article where you can read all of the details behind that too um get coin grants around 10. let's fund public goods together for the tenth time super cool that launched actually on let's see wednesday of this week and is live 650k in matching for this grant round uh anything you want to say about that david yeah this is actually the first gram round that bankless will not have a grant we are now get coin alumni yay and so thank you to all previous uh bankless donators to get going uh we now consider ourselves not really needing donations anymore uh and to some degree that was a large a large part of the confidence that we had in bankless at large and i know with me and my writing i used to have my own git coin as well um people can prove out that they have market like product market fit on git coin right and so it is it not only is it an initial seater of capital from donations but it also like lets people be confident that the product they that they have is actually desired by the the community i i know that i left my previous job to do bank list sooner as a result of the signal that i got from from uh get coin so thanks yeah i would say i would say look bankless probably wouldn't exist without bitcoin i mean there's some dark times in like uh 2019 where i was like uh is anyone really reading this whole bank list thing this is before we even started the podcast and it was just kind of a slog and uh gitcoin really gave me the confidence to kind of continue writing that the community was supportive of this whole thing and uh with without getting coin i don't think bankless would would be here certainly not in its current form um yeah i don't know what you used to write every single ep edition of the newsletter at the very yeah and yes exactly and like there was a lot to it and um growth was kind of slow during the early days everyone thought d5 was dead ethereum is dead all the stuff we were talking about didn't matter and uh yeah the community's support really made a big difference so shout out to git coin thanks guys public goods now we have a self-sustaining media company uh on top of like bankless goals and on top of ethereum so um speaking of media companies david someone else is launching a podcast what's this podcast yeah this is alexandra botez she is a chess streamer a pretty big chess streamer on twitch and she famously had vitalik buterin on to play chess with him one time uh she's really good at chess so she absolutely spanked vitalik um but it was it was a fun piece of content and it turns out she's also in the background been learning about ethereum and so now she is making a more content specifically about ethereum and so she has a an ethereum developer friend torpher benson and every other week she's going to be streaming about ethereum stuff so more ethereum content in the ether verse a big fan of that i consume basically every single piece of ethereum content that's out there uh and so i'm ready to expand into new territory so alexandra thank you for contributing to the world of ethereum content absolutely maybe maybe come on bankless soon maybe we'll have some content opportunities too all right david some drive-bys on the releases front dydx perpetuals uh they are now listing matic on dydx so super exciting of course dydx is now fully deployed on layer two as well so gasless transactions what's the next one here david usdc live on arbitrom it's got its own a contract address on arbitram um and uscc on polygon is already above 2.3 billion dollars in a market cap uh and so pete kim who i believe works at circle is that true i don't know or maybe maybe arbitrary um coinbase coinbase coin works at coinbase and he says with all these scaling solutions going live the summer of d fight season two is already here i'm feeling bullish at af somebody is subscribing to the d5 summer thesis cream finance is subscribing to you it looks like they are launching their money markets on arbor trump as well so everyone pouring into layer twos everyone pouring into roll-ups just like we thought it would play out can't wait for these things to to fully open up those coming soon parcel introducing parcel treasure treasury management for dows uh it looks like this is a new service to help dallas work with their own capital and and also reward people that work for the dalles uh and i i think really just that the message here is that there's more and more infrastructure coming for daos every single week yeah and uh wiren is one such dow they're actually pioneering they're developing their own infrastructure we just number their tools but they are giving a facelift to wire uh entire user interface facelift and honestly i love wired but i think it needs a facelift it needs this yeah it needs this the most out of all of the the largest d5 protocols i would say and this is starting to look good so look for that coming soon david that is releases let's get to the news shall we let's do it all right bit wise 70 million from wall street investors including stan druckenmiller pretty impressive what is bitwise i know we've had them on on bankless podcast before but for those that don't know what is bitwise yeah bitwise has one foot in the financial advisor camp and one foot in the cryptocamp and is now doing a very good job expanding into d5 as well uh so bitwise has a bunch of index products they have the bitwise you know big market cap the top 10 crypto asset market caps we reported on that not too long ago when polygon broke into that bitwise top 10 crypto assets they also have the bitwise defy index and a number of other indices as well and so they are really bridging the gap between you know home like family offices and personal uh financial advisors trying to educate them and onboard them as to the merits of crypto assets and also defy and so bitwise just raised 70 million dollars not a small number at all to continue this fight and so that matt hogan episode that we did with the state of the nation was one of my favorite episodes and that's kind of where we started chanting the chant that like financial advisors they understand defy they really like d5 it really lands well with them simply because it kind of fits into their mental models that they already have about how finance works uh and so really really excited to see bitwise like expanding the fold here definitely they're definitely going to be a bridge to traditional finance for uh for ethereum 4d5 let's talk some other ethereum stuff this is the polygon daily gas used chart this is pretty incredible look at this ascent um there's another chart i wanna i wanna pull up which is uh let me see if i can find it network utilization of polygon which is kind of off the charts see if i can find that uh look at this david network utilization yep 98 so polygon has received full blocks for the last two to three days so earlier in this podcast i said that bitcoin and ethereum were the only ecosystems with full blocks uh polygon actually also has full blocks i didn't include that earlier because polygons a layer two to ethereum but this is the first ethereum layer two side chain scaling solution whatever you wanna call it there's there's debates and arguments it's about what the correct label is um basically it's a scaling solution act it looks and feels like an l2 that's why i call it l2 and it's got full blocks uh and so it's with the first ethereum suburb that is now sold out like everyone's living there like it's now the first saturated suburb of ethereum so that's pretty cool and of course people when a suburb gets saturated and there's lots of traffic people complain about the traffic and rightfully so because when you're in a full block blockchain ecosystem things get slower there's congestion you have a harder time getting transactions through gas fees rise so i you know polygon initially when you started using it used to be basically free um gas cosmetic tokens of course but now i think that is no longer the case you have to sort of bid more matic tokens in order to get a transaction through so it's a different user experience but yeah the story here is a suburb is of ethereum is filling up and we're starting to see full blocks already on some of these sidechain networks uh kind of cool kind of interesting to watch there there's a ton of things to talk about like first off already full blocks on an l2 well maybe the listener is like well damn i thought it was a scaling solution it's already saturated like wtf like what's up with this at the end of the day the amount of block space that polygon has versus ethereum is like i can't remember the specific numbers but i think it's like 10 to 30 x right so i think it's closer to the 30x range whereas there's literally 30 times as much capacity than the ethereum main chain and so while while the blocks are full transactions are still really really cheap they're still under a penny for a transaction and they happen in like one to two seconds so it's still scale but now there's now there's we just know that there's demand and that's the other part of the stories it's very obvious that there's a ton of demand for l2s uh and this is in stark contrast to the lightning network which has been really really slow to adopt and grow and ryan kind of why you had that lightning network early in the show like no we know that people want l2s we know that they work the demand for them is reaching 100 of its capacity and the other cool thing about the story is that polygon validators are now receiving a decent amount of rewards in matic tokens uh and so just like ether stakers are going to be receiving ether on the main chain uh polygon and maddux takers are receiving mavic rewards on the polygon network uh and so this is a a cryptoeconomic system that is alive now with full blocks that's where i start to consider these crypto economic networks to be alive systems so congrats to polygon it's going to be interesting when arbitrary launches to see how long it takes for their blocks to fill up completely right um and the interesting thing we learned in the arbitrage conversation we had with them is let's say they're calling arbitrary one the first roll-up they release an arbitrary technology let's say that gets full what do you do you release the second one right you release the third one you can keep doing this right until the ethereum main chain is congested uh with like roll-up transactions essentially so we've got a lot of space here that's the vision that's why we call it roll-up-centric ethereum yeah exactly um let's talk about this so mark cuban has been experimenting pretty heavily with defy he put together this great blog post called the brilliance of yield farming liquidity providing and uh valuing crypto projects a lot of great insights he also talked about there's a small mention of a yield farm that he was doing inside of the polygon network i think it's um a titan was the yield farm um titan in this is some kind of an algorithmic uh stable coin david and he was yield farming that he's talking about it in the post well unfortunately mark cuban got rug pulled david in the polygon network um i i call it rugpull shorthand but it's actually more like a bank run of some sort the algorithmic stablecoin mechanism just broke and even using the term stable coin for these things is is sort of um generous i would say right because this is not a collateral backed stable coin it's sort of a meme energy ponzi backed stable coin we talked about this in the past and there are different mechanisms that work better for these things than others but none of them have worked perfectly none of them have worked long term at all so a very speculative liquidity pool uh he was dabbling in and uh he got rug pulled with the rest of them uh he says this i got hit like everyone else the crazy part is i got out thought they were increasing their total locked value then bam bam meaning like money gone i'm not sure how much just a tiny amount for somebody like mark cuban of course but um also a negative experience in uh in d5 in his uh in his journey what are your thoughts well these are the traps that you find on the frontier and and right just to say the reason why you say rug pull is because it went to zero there was no malicious actor here the crypto economic system fell apart uh the incentives broke down uh and there's there's a critique going out there from hazu which i think we're going to get to where the incentives for these uncollateralized stable coins are the same thing as like a ponzi right and not not a ponzi scheme because a scheme implies that there's an actor that does the rug pull but a ponzi game where at some point the game is up and everyone runs for the doors uh and so here here's what hazu says uh apparently um mark cuban called for that there needs to be some sort of regulation around the label of a crypto dollar or a stable coin because not all stable coins are the same you know there's there's over collateralized stable coins that with like die that has worked very very well and then there's uncollateralized stable coins which literally zero have worked out for the long term and so um hazu is quoting cuban here when he says we need regulation to decide who is allowed to call itself a stable coin and then hazu says the sad thing is he has a point and the defy community only has itself to blame for that the community has entirely failed at self-regulating what a stablecoin is supposed to be and then in a follow-up tweet hazu said um at every opportunity i have warned that under collateralized stablecoins cannot work some of them can survive for a few weeks or months but they all fail eventually leading to large financial loss for participants shame on everyone who still calls them stable coins today mention mentions them in the same articles as usc usdc usd et cetera instead of what they actually are pure ponzi schemes so hazu with a skating critique of uncollateralized table coins and to his point we haven't seen an uncollateralized stablecoin actually work yet and so um that is the story of mark cuban got his first uh again it's tempting to call it a rug pull even though that's not the right word but like congrats smart cube and you got your first like you know uh damage your thing went to zero sorry your thing went to zero yeah absolutely and like so but here's the thing so i i read the kind of the the mark cuban quote and by the way he said this in a passing way i'm not sure if how much he really meant that we need regulation to decide who is allowed to call it's like he he also admitted hey this is a crazy speculative thing i lost money that's how it goes it's like angel investment like you win some you lose some um but like having regulation decide what is allowed to call itself a stablecoin in d5 is an absolutely terrible idea like i get hasu's point right that um yeah these things aren't really stable coins like they should be called something else um you know because they haven't earned the stable coin quality yet um but like people who are in this know that already i mean like people who listen to bank list we know the difference between elgo uncollateralized stable coin and something like die and then something purely centralized like usdc versus something like like rye um but to have regulators step in and put a whole bunch of regulation around the language that the ecosystem uses bad idea really bad idea so anyway maybe next time we have cupid on we'll talk about this a little bit um go into some depth here i just i this is kind of how the industry self-polices to be honest david like people people get hurt right and then they're like oh we won't do this next time it's like icos oh we ouchy humans tend to avoid pain by the way that's something we've adapted to do exactly so this is all part of the market learning in my opinion we do not need regulation to tell us what terms to use hazu says that the community has entirely failed itself regulating what a stable coin is supposed to be i still think that we have that potential to do that um and now is the time i think kazu is perhaps being a little bit hasty with saying that we haven't done it yet he is and i think that like a lot of people in the community have been educating on this it's just like people saw huge apys and they got greedy you know and this is kind of what happens all right david instant app 10 million dollar raise uh new funding what's going on yeah instadap is a middleware protocol that helps bridge different apps and just allows you to more efficiently transfer assets between them raise 10 million dollars and also release the instadap governance token and so if you are a recent user of instant app you may have a governance token to claim some airdrop stuff going on goldman sachs plans to offer ether futures options to its clients as well this is another bank entering into the crypto futures market ether once again being more and more institutionalized and financialized as a commodity money in the traditional finance world which is something that we want to see if we are thinking that ether is actually going to be adopted as a global money we're talking about synthetics and d5 dydx with an absolutely monster raise a 65 million dollar series c raise this is a team that has already expanded into player two and this round was led by paradigm david uh dydx seems like they are in it to win it what are your thoughts here uh congrats to dydx it's been one of the longest standing defy apps around um i'm gonna go ahead and say that there's a token coming yeah i think there's a token coming seems like it uh nft world what's going on with please your doll shout out shout out please are down pleaser dow it keeps on going to bat to buy these ridiculously priced uh you know internet culture nfts they just bought the doge nft for a whopping 1696.98 this little guy this cute thing this this cute thing like this this is worth 1700 eats 1700 the og doge photo right and like the other cool thing about this story is ryan go down to the bids history the first bid came in at um 725.420 6969 69 eth and then that got got bit up by seven thousand sleepers look at this it's it's it's all meme numbers one thousand point six nine six seven six nine got beat by one thousand sixty nine point four twenty four twenty four twenty which got beat by one thousand two hundred and thirty four point five six seven eight nine eighth which got bit man which got beat by one thousand three hundred and thirty seven i think this guy don't you feel bad for a two dollar hot dog doge two two dollar hot doge uh and then to the second to highest bid was one thousand four twenty point one three three seven eight which got beat by the winning bid of one thousand six hundred and ninety six point nine eight so the me the bidding itself is actually a meme which is absolutely awesome who who owns this please please or dal no no i know who owns it now but like who is the creator is this like oh the the owner of the original doge no way and look at this this is what's cool uh resale royalty so anytime like if if pleaser dow sells us in the future the original creator um gets a 10 royalty on that too pleaser dial is just sucking up all of the coolest most expensive beams in this base and they are also yet to lose they are undefeated with buying nfts so congrats to please or dao you know what's funny david though it's like i remember you didn't think there was much behind nfts not too long ago right like so like what's changed for you because is winning all of these nfts a good thing if they're actually like silly pieces like sk jpegs that you can copy and paste i i want to know what the evolution of david's thought process on nfts is because now you're a member of pleaser dow it sounds like you're bullish on this is it like the collective purchasing organization that you're bullish on are you actually bullish that this picture of a dog is worth 1700 eat no it's not the picture of a dog at all it's it's owning a piece of internet history that's what's so awesome uh and i definitely find myself a defy guy not an nft person i don't speculate on nfcs myself but i'm very happy to be part of a dow that is literally buying pieces of internet culture and claiming it for themselves that's what i'm interested in uh and so there's a decent amount of leadership inside of plays or dow that uh oh oh i i'm kind of a relatively passive member i just put my capital into the dow and say hey guys here's some money uh go buy nmcs with it i really didn't even put all that much in i kind of wanted to be in the cool kids club uh but but pleaser dad was straight up owning p like deep cultural pieces of the internet and i'm here for it it's part of the cool kids club but it's also like the way you learn is the only way you learn is by participating in these types of groups and actually doing it yourself so uh it's it's super cool i wonder what they're going to do with all this like open a museum or what um they got plans and those plans are going to come on banquets at some point in time we've got to talk about that hopefully all right um let's get to some bitcoin stuff the world bank reject el salvador's request to help them el salvador i guess went to the imf and said hey could you guys help us implement bitcoin because they needed some assistance in a few ways and uh the world bank came to them and said no no why because bitcoin has environmental shortcomings and transparency shortcomings so we're not going to help you el salvador yeah that's uh nick carter would say that these are two things on the flood dice you know environment and transparency i can't think of a more transparent system than a public blockchain so i don't really know what they mean there um but the the other take here is that the powers that be are not helping bitcoin get adopted yeah i don't think they like el salvador's move here um paltura jones he talked about bitcoin diversification this week or crypto diversification uh particularly in the lens of inflation coming inflation he said that people should have five percent of their portfolio allocated to bitcoin as they face the threat of looming inflation five percent didn't seem too long ago where that number uh hedge fund advisor well first of all they they were talking zero percents no one was recommending this then it was like one percent now it's five percent um pretty interesting from someone like paul twitter jones who is respected figure in institutional investment circles and on wall street any thoughts here yeah the really the interesting thing is that he says that unlike human nature this cryptocurrency bitcoin is 100 certain so high conviction from from paul tudor jones also but you have to kind of understand like if it is a 100 conviction why isn't his portfolio 100 bitcoin hmm oh you you just triggered another meme david you should open up the door so here here's the uh the shifting eyes gnome meme where paul tutor jones says i like five percent of my wealth in bitcoin and then there's me and then the shifty eyes no no meme is implying that like oh i got way more than five percent is my portfolio is bitcoin i think millennials do i think gen z does um i know we've got some takes about that later but uh second meme easter egg there we go microstrategy unveiled another billion dollar stock offering says the proceeds can be used to buy bitcoin another week another micro strategy this time they're getting into more esoteric financing they want to get as much cheap fiat as they can to purchase bitcoin through any means necessary that's what microstrategy is really turning into it's it's pretty interesting that michael saylor is doing this and being so blatant about it yeah it's it's pretty crazy it used to be like i we want bitcoin on the balance sheet to protect our company from inflation and now it's we want to turn microstrategy into a holding company for bitcoin just absolutely completely blatantly um we'll see where microstrategy is about to blast through that 100 000 bitcoin uh supply mark on the balance sheet like let's see where they end up like do you think he makes it all the way to two hundred thousand i have no clue but like he's gunning for it two hundred thousand is a decent portion yes of 21 million absolutely yeah dude i think he just unlocked another meme here we go 2010 this is a meme out of our bitcoin 2010 no one uses it 2012. only computer nerds use it 2013 only drug dealers use it 2014 only money launderers use it 2017 only gamblers use it 2019 only a small percentage of the population uses it 2020 only small companies use it 2021 only small countries use bitcoin what happens in 2022 we will find out wow nice okay on the regulation and crypto bank's front david coinbase listing ship uh this timeline is both amazing and horrifying says anthony cesano so shibb is one of those doggy tokens the leading dog definitely ponzi meme coin uh territory coinbase lifting listing them remember in 2017 2018 coinbase had an entire framework right that it went through before it listed a token has that just fallen by the wayside like coinbase just yep okay um i guess why so like one are you mad about this does this annoy you does this anger you uh so the reason why that framework came about was in 2017 a bunch of icos were actually securities and so they needed to put that framework out there too like as a defense like you know here we're doing our best to like only list legitimate assets and so like that kind of just got relegated to history and now that coinbase doesn't really need to defend itself against anything anymore because the sec is not really coming after them so the ship it's not really a security now it's just kind of this this whatever token to some degree like coinbase needs to serve demand and if there's demand to trade ship then like it's coinbase's drop to allow that to happen at the end of the day it's there's no further analysis to ship token it's not like we can go and do a deep dive as to the fundamental analysis of ship token it's just a doggy token and so as far as like promoting the legitimate sides of this industry this is not doing that but like if there's demands then like effort i guess like do whatever coinbase did they do they have a role in protecting um investors protecting their users or do you think it should just be like you know hey if you demand it we should list it free markets do we get to talk about how awesome uniswap is to be able to provide liquidity to any asset and then knock coinbase for listing any asset like is that i think it's a great point so like i think this is a great point and something that i struggle with but like one thing i do know is um i don't blame uniswap at all when you remove the ability to actually say this is allowed and that's not allowed you just say it's completely open and permissionless anyone can list right that absolves all responsibility to me and that is like a fair mechanism where i have more trouble is when a gatekeeper can arbitrarily say yeah this asset's okay but this asset no that's a no-no and act in a sanctimonious way about why they're saying this asset's okay and that asset's not do you know like sure we're not listing this to protect investors but we're willing to list this other thing right right so i don't have a big problem with with coinbase listing this i guess free and open market but um i i i'll be looking into the future to see if there's kind of double speak about like protecting investors and i do think the the best model for all of these exchanges is not to have the ability to gatekeep and of course you can't do that right on a centralized exchange you have to be a gatekeeper but on unit swap um anything goes and i think that's great coinbase listing in asset is kind of like blessing an asset right like people aren't used to complete crap being available to them people and that's one of the pitfalls that people come into is they they go into a robin hood and they type in any ticker and they assume that there's some sort of quality to that right because it had to get through all the regulations in order to be able to be traded on public markets people come into these crypto markets and kind of come in with that same mental model thinking that the spectrum of crap to quality is roughly the same spectrum that they find in traditional markets when really there's things that are way more quality like ultrasound money and then there's also the complete and absolute crap like people aren't ready to tossle and deal with this massive spectrum of quality and when coinbase comes and lists shib it's giving it's it's it's blessings right like it's saying like this is a good asset like we're it's okay we're going to list it like we like this one but it's a goddamn joggy token like what the hell like i'm privy to both arguments yep so am i i i understand both sides of that one um let's talk about that state street is creating a dedicated cryptocurrency division this is just another big bank i think this is america's second oldest bank that is getting into crypto i think that is really the story here david more and more are um let's talk about this millennial millionaires love crypto did you know that millennial millionaires have at least 50 of their wealth in crypto that just blew my mind when i read that headline that's coming out of a recent um survey that cnbc did a millionaire survey of 750 investors and and noted that um that number surprises me well are they are they millennial millionaires because of crypto or their millennial millionaires and now that they are allocating to crypto because crypto has made it can i answer that question tell me yes [Laughter] i think it's both i think they became millionaires because of crypto but also um they're they're keeping their assets in crypto sure totally uh this reminds me of a of a quote which is gonna be a little bit unsavory but i'm gonna say it anyways um german physicist mask max planck said that science advances one funeral at a time or more precisely a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is more familiar with it and so millennials are slowly going to take over the world because boomers are just going to you know pass on and then the millennials are going to inherit all the boomer money and it's all going into crypto because millennials like crypto this is what happens every single generation and i'm sure um the children the grandchildren of millennials will have their favorite asset class and uh and i think crypto is um is absolutely crazy who knows who knows what could happen um this last one panama to present a crypto related bill in july is this the next domino to follow uh follow el salvador it's coming up all right guys we're going to get to takes in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigramps.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get unit swap to be a sponsor for bank list and you can do the same for your project thank you unisop for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in

article fantastic research article called mev that's minor extractable value or minimum extractable value in eth2 there's a lot to this article don't want to get into it but here's the key point in eth2 mev goes to stakers david and i feel like this is a huge element of this for ultrasound money that we just don't talk about they actually go through some numbers here right so when we talk about ultrasound money and uh ethereum issuance in in eth 2.0 kind of going to validators we don't talk about minor extractable value we talk about transaction fees we talked about issuance but but minor extractable value mev or minimum extractable value actually goes to validators too and if you were to take all of the mev from flashbots today and kind of model that out and give that to validators now the current apr of eth if you start staking at the beacon chain right now is about seven percent but with mev on top of that it increases to almost 13 so 12.86 percent so that's almost a doubling like close to a doubling when you add mev on top which all this to say when you add mev i feel like some of our ultrasound money case was actually a little bearish on the numbers like bearish content what i mean just validators might make a whole lot more money uh and apys could be a whole lot higher if you take into account mev and we don't actually know what that number is but the minimum bound is like a potentially doubling of the issuance that's available to them today so that's pretty crazy mev is a really big problem but one thing that gives me a little bit of relief is that mev is this amount of ether that makes the blockchain unstable because of of uh sinking um because of um there's so much fight to capture that mev go listen to the mev panel that we had not too long ago to get more details on that but at the very least at least those mev rewards go to the people that are protecting the network and the people that are protecting the network are intrinsically the people that are most bullish on ether the asset that's who protects the network so at least there's that yep absolutely um let's go to this next take frank shaparo from the block says i would say about 99 of cryptocurrencies are either under or overvalued which kind of feels like a funny joke at first glance but also there's there's something there's something to say here right like chib token for example i'm going to go ahead and put in the 99 in the part that's overvalued and then ether i will go ahead and put in the side that's undervalued and that's really been the story of this entire industry since genesis there are really big diamonds in a ton of rough and they're the amount like it's a struggle to learn about crypto it's a struggle to understand this industry and that's why coal gets mixed up with diamonds all the time like people start showing eos they start chilling like name coin or bitcoin gold and people like can't really understand it too wow those are some those are some tokens from 2017 2018 you dug up david yeah totally yeah they're gone now i could say some more modern tokens if you really wanted me too but like that's really the story of like bitcoin has been like having this narrative trouble with the rest of the world swinging talking about how incredibly awesome bitcoin is and then people come into the industry and like oh but what about bitcoin cash though it's cheaper right and so this is the story of our industry is that the everything is roughly around this in the playing in the same field and some of these things are absolute coal and some of these things are absolute diamonds and it's up to you to to determine which is which yup you got to figure it out that's what the quest is all about um david let's uh talk about this kevin owaki uh tweet this is in response to a tweet you made you said we are an accumulation phase don't miss it you're talking about uh price accumulating ether yeah ether is yeah and kevin owaki says i've secretly been accumulating friends this whole time that's sweet and honestly that's how you make it in this industry not only not only by doing a good job and dollar cost averaging responsibly into the assets that you believe in but also during times of accumulation which we previously called these bear markets but now i'm guessing we're now going to call these accumulation times because apparently crypto assets just don't go down um at least not too low knock on wood but kevin says during these times of accumulation when you're accumulating crypto assets don't forget to accumulate friends if you want to stay in this industry for the long term it's important to go west with us go get find a buddy find an accountability buddy if you if if you don't make it like find a business partner too find a business partner that's what ryan and i did hey yeah works for us it's like bear market yeah i mean shared interests friends relationships um we're all pushing this industry forward this is a great time to build your network build your crypto network that's what he's talking about in addition to having fun and making friends right crypto can be fun you just need some people to make some jokes with with you as you do it it's not at all like wall street right um okay uh i guess you're responding to someone you're saying um well maybe i should go to the top most of the innovation crypto is eventually just going to be known as finance so we drop the d from d5 we just call it finance somebody says open finance and you say nah just finance traditional finance will be called closed finance and then this guy says the future wall street in quotes will be known as crypto twitter and then he said uh this is going on the on the weekly roll up why'd you say this david why does this uh take speak to you yeah wall street is this uh at least from the outsiders perspective wall street is kind of like this insular group of you know insiders who make trades and bets amongst themselves and shares alpha amongst themselves and it's you know and they all went to elite right like you know and it seems very permissioned right and then crypto twitter is the opposite it's crypto twitter is wall street but on the internet where it's open everyone is shouting all of their alpha as loud as possible trying to get everyone to hear it uh and so it's like wall street but inside out also this is ryan rasmussen who is the new defy analyst over at bitwise bitwise that just raised 70 million dollars also one of my in real life friends uh and so uh congrats to ryan for getting that d5 job he's a good follow he's got a article coming on the bankless newsletter uh sometime next week very cool um all right david let's get to what you're excited about what are you excited about this week yeah i'm excited i'm in san diego if you guys haven't figured out by my brand new empty apartment i'm in san diego now so that's pretty cool and i'm also going to try and start up this ethereum meetup group for san diego so if you live in san diego or the southern california area and you want to talk about ethereum things in real life because crypto's taking over we need to instantiate ourselves in the real world uh part of my one of my reasons why i came to san diego is because the beer is really really good here so i am trying i'm going to go host a an ethereum meetup in san diego and so there's going to be a link in the show notes if you are in san diego and you like beer uh let's go and talk about ethereum over some beers the other thing i'm really excited about is the ether bowl episode that is coming uh not ne this monday but next monday we had anthony cedano we had dc investor the two two guests from the previous ethereum bowl episode uh but eric connor got booted for being too bearish and we could replace him by cyrus yunessi former risk at maker dao and i just really enjoyed that panel we recorded that last night ryan and that's coming out a week from monday really stoked on that one and i got three i got a third one this third thing i'm really excited about there is a new show coming to the bankless program and that is all i'm saying but the other thing i'll say is that ryan won't be there i will not be there at all i might not even watch it david i mean i'll watch the recording i'm just not gonna promise to watch every single one live but i'm super excited about this one it's a it's i think it's going to be tackling a whole new niche in crypto that has been missing for a long time so guys stay tuned on this wait when are people going to get some news is it going to be next tuesday on sunday next tuesday i would say to the nation we will drop the alpha but yeah it's going to be a new paradigm of crypto content new show new podcast you guys can subscribe to um super excited about that uh all right right here what i'm excited about i do tell me all about it look look it's just uh i feel like it doesn't really matter what the markets are doing these days if if if it's going up if it's flat if it's going down really doesn't matter because d5 keeps building i i really feel like at this moment david um defy has reached escape velocity like we didn't always know that d5 was going to work out right or even that smart contracts were going to work out like there was in the early stages all we had was like maker and it was kind of a question of hmm is this d5 thing going to reach any product market fit or is it going to be a niche i feel like look man we just filled up polygon with d5 stuff some of it's crazy right some of it's silly but we filled up the ethereum chain with define activity now we're filling up entire neighborhoods and side chains like polygon we have product market fit all of these d5 protocols have massive treasuries too david like there's a lot of money sloshing around the space why because a lot of value has been created in this space so that's self-sustaining too and now with layer two we have all of this new land this new real estate to um stake a flag in so all of all of these reasons um i think like culminate in this sense that d5 is just going to keep growing it doesn't matter whether it's it's making mainstream news people are talking about d5 or the markets up or down like we're just going to keep building and that's a really fulfilling feeling the flywheel is in full effect there's like really nothing we need to do the machines are just going to keep building and we're going to have a better financial system on the other side so that's what i'm excited about historically betting against ethereum and now also defy it's been a bad bet it's been absolutely yeah it'll continue to be um all right i mean ryan i think it's time for the meme of the week as if this would be like the fourth or fifth meme of the show so far but like like the episode is meme themed we actually have like seven memes so here we go yeah what is this one what are we looking at we're not looking oh i should share it here you go here it is meme of the week what are we looking at david we are looking at that star trek meme and it's the uh it's the the lady asking two friends are you guys friends and the the lady is crypto newbies she's asking two star trek people are you guys friends one star trek person is bitcoin and bitcoin answers no yeah the second star trek person is ethereum and ethereum answer is yes at the exact same time i love it so true all right next memes here we go zazzle shaved his beard and he says in an effort to try and end this crab season perhaps he's in his sideways season uh crab season market action i have made the ultimate sacrifice to the beer gods eath may resume up only now anthony anthony cesano knows how to market himself he basically is just giving crypto twitter a free meme format uh his face and crypto yeah his face yeah it's the me format and crypto twitter acts absolutely took the bait and made some pretty awesome memes so let's go through them ryan yeah this is just a template he's providing the template oh god here here's the star wars meme where uh princess leia is smiling at anthony with a beard and then he shaves the beard and that's padme oh yeah padme not a star wars fan and then padme looks it looks at susana without the beard and the smile kind of disappears love it next one here is crypto wife a great memer uh i i you're gonna have to do you know this reference ryan what this is i don't know this reference this this is a tv show yeah anthony is like sitcom dad with headphones now kids just because coinbase listed ship doesn't mean
