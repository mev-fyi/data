what do you think's over the event horizon i hope it's a more democratic internet again i think like there's some pretty big questions about what the rise of populism means in the context of all this stuff but i hope that it is an internet that feels more like our voices are being heard over the last couple of decades we've seen a decline in like job mobility you know it used to be that you could go to new york and that's where all your dreams would come true a lot of the reason for that is actually that we're online all the time unless you are really wanting to be immersed in the culture of a city and you want to be physically there like you do have most of the opportunities that you might want at your fingertips if you have access to a computer and twitter and all that stuff and so i think we're increasingly going to see that these digital spaces feel a lot more like cities and actually start to take on a lot of the characteristics that cities once provided people which hopefully makes that opportunity a lot more accessible to a lot more people
