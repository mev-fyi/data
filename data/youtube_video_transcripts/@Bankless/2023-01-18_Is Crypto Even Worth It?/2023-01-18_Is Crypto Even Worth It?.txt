is crypto worth it when you have greater surface area for the frauds and the scammers and anyone can launch their own coin and send it to the moon what do you think about this argument well I don't think you can send your own coin to the Moon anymore it was a bad State of Affairs when you could on the issue of scammers I view it this way because of the internet plus AI the supply of scams is now infinitely elastic now crypto is a kind of intermediate step in the amazing proliferation of scams and ability to reach people with mobile devices so you can blame crypto for that but with or without crypto it was headed toward infinitely elastic Supply anyway crypto scams obviously are bad in the final analysis whether those are there or not the final scamming equilibrium will be what it is
