[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we've got an og on the podcast og from a founder perspective also an og protocol this is rune christensen from makerdale what did we cover what were some of the highlights for you yeah this is actually i think two podcasts in one uh so the first half of this show is all about a tweet thread that arun put out that captured both your and mine attention and it was a technical argument about why things will likely collapse down to one single ecosystem and so where previously like maximalist arguments have generally been one of mostly emotion and people speaking their bags roon does a fantastic job of actually articulating a technical rationale for why there will likely only just be one layer one blockchain that will succeed uh at least with regards to smart contract platforms that have defy on them so he goes through the game theory about why defy apps might actually align themselves with one specific chain in lieu of i'm going to say i'm going to say it dave because he said it it's like an eth maximalist take right sure yeah i mean we also go through the uh go through a section with room about like well we can strip away the names of these things and just talk about the concept of layer 1a layer 1b layer 1c one has greater levels of adoption one has minority levels of adoption but yeah if you want to add like names onto these things like roon is saying well for maker dao putting maker dow first and putting being a maker down maximalist it actually game theoretically makes sense to commit to one chain and one chain only and so roon takes us through that argument which i find personally i find very compelling um and that's the first half of the show second half of the show we go through roone's recent proposal on the maker dow governance forums about uh making die quote-unquote clean money and pointing maker dao's abilities of being a capital generation facility a credit facility towards things that combat climate change and having make or dao being climate aligned and branding die as this clean money that when you use die you are actually helping combat climate change down the line and the mechanisms for that are simply allowing uh capital to be directed and make your doubt to fund things like solar farms or sustainable energy farms or things that help out actually help us fight climate change and this has been one of the big bold cases for crypto at large you know back in 2009 10 11 12. the we had no idea how this would actually get done but we did understand that crypto can help coordinate against problems that are larger than nation states and to this day nation states continually to illustrate their lack of competency with being able to tackle problems that are bigger than themselves and so it's very very cool that we're seeing and a defy app on ethereum take up the mantle of being the thing the coordinating body that can actually go after climate change because like roon says so many people are just in denial about it or they've given up hope it's like he said in the show it's gone from uh climate change denialism as in just being blind about it to climate change dumerism saying well we know it's going to it's we know it's real but like it's too late to do anything about it and so it's optimistic it's awesome to see something in the crypto world take the climate change problem head-on or at least that's what roone has proposed and so we go through his proposal and all the details around that yeah absolutely so bankless listeners this is like a two-part meal for you i think the first meal is where we talk about why uh why uh crypto will have a layer one power law winner and why roone actually thinks that might be ethereum is probably going to be ethereum which is an interesting take in the second course i think counteracts a lot of fud that we've heard uh just in general in the mainstream let's call it you know maybe senators politicians regulators and just like mainstream institutional news that crypto is bad for the environment well brune is proposing that maker become good for the environment every time you you buy die or own die that is actually a plus one for environmental like reducing environmental externalities and helping climate change so super fascinating conversations again if you want to take this in two parts that's probably a recommended way to digest it these are all tied together though david in one way which is the future of maker what is the future of this og d5 protocol that's been with us since inception and you know one the answer seems to be ethereum and layer twos and the second seems to be this clean money narrative at least that is what roon is proposing but what does he get to control he's just another governor on the governance forums now that the maker foundation is decentralized that's a fascinating conversation in and of itself you are definitely going to enjoy this one with roone christensen before we get to the conversation we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lido's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access vacant yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started thankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest this is roone christensen's he is the founder of maker dow he's he was building crypto before ethereum was even a thing and he started maker dow before d5 was even a thing maker dow has pioneered some of the most fundamental components of this industry really the foundations of d5 when you think about a decentralized stablecoin when you think about decentralized governance when you think about daos all of this started with maker dao back in 2016. it was actually my first love and my first fall down the d5 rabbit hole as well um so we're going to unpack a lot of these topics with uh roon we're going to talk about some of his threads about layer one we're also going to talk about the future of maker dow how he sees it evolve into a green money type platform a clean money type platform there's so much to discuss on this episode first i just want to say roon welcome to bankless you are an og sir it's fantastic to have you really glad to be here yeah i think it's going to be exciting okay so i want to start with this question because you know you've been in crypto for a long time i've been crypto for a little bit um some years in crypto feel exhausting right some feel exhilarating there are times in crypto i feel like super optimistic about the future in the direction we're headed there's other times where i just feel like jaded like i'm done with it like this short-term thinking and you know chasing after scams is too much for me um i want to ask you is that how you feel as well like do you do ebb and flow between these things and how are you feeling about crypto and d5 right now i think rather than sort of ebb and flow between it i more like have both feelings simultaneously at all times i guess it's the best way to describe it you know it's like i mean it's like that bell curve meme right you really got all the extremes you got so much of the the most sort of inspiring and amazing stuff you'll you'll ever see in your entire life right you'll you'll just re scroll through that on twitter coming from some weird uh avatars and then at the same time yeah there's like the dark side of crypto as well right it's like the good all the good comes with also an incredible amount of of bad and and frustration and scams and you know what you can call it incentivize stupidity and all of these things that really you know it's frustrating that that's how it is but but you know i've over my many years in crypto and you know my my origin as a bitcoin maximalist back in the really early days i've just come to accept that that's just what it's like basically that's what this space is like and you just have to sort of accept and live with that and then i guess try to focus on the positives so you you've come uh to peace with things then it sounds like you've you've kind of reached this this state of zen where you can live with both of these realities simultaneously and you you don't let one get you down or the other gets you like too excited you're just like you know focused on the future yeah absolutely and i think you absolutely need to be able to do that too i mean work in a space and i guess especially to to um you know build a project and and try to really make something new right i mean that's something that it's sort of the uh i mean yeah i remember just uh some advice some some wisdom on that topic right it's from i think it's from kane from synthetics that had this quote of something like if you haven't been called a scam yet in crypto you know keep working hard one day you'll make it right because that's a part of it right that there's a you know that that's the thing about where the negativity the sort of the the bad side of crypto follows the the good side of crypto and they're both fundamental and interconnected and uh you have to be able to to deal with it or you'll just it's just not for you right you shouldn't be shouldn't uh give away your life force to to something uh if you can't really handle it we we absolutely close every single bankless episode with this line it's not for everyone right but thanks for joining us on the bankless journey and i totally echo that crypto is not for everyone it's a it's an emotional rollercoaster out there and uh and things get uh absolutely crazy but but let's talk about something crazy that happened in a good way for maker recently uh you guys have been up to a lot of things this year but um something that more recently hit the headlines was a society general sg we'll call them which is a massive frank a bank based in france in france they just posted on maker dow's governance form and apparently they want to uh inject 20 million dollars in collateral and their bonds as you know as part of the the maker um you know collateral platform and this is so interesting to me i want to hear the details from you about kind of the specifics of what they're trying to do and why but what's super interesting to me is we've actually reached the point where the banks are coming to defy how crazy is that uh but but tell us about this what are they doing here why is this meaningful what is what is kind of the bond that they're proposing injecting as collateral to back die yeah i fully agree that the most the most sort of uh shocking part of it is this like what now the banks are coming to d5 it just seems like it seems a little too early almost a little surreal um but actually for me the thing that really was crazy about this is i had just no idea it was in the works at all you know so that's really the sort of showcasing um you know decentralized organization right so i was like just super surprised to see it and just like what i'd have to like google it and be like we're talk is it a real bank this thing it's the third largest bank of france that was like you know that was uh that was pretty mind-blowing um and but yeah so so what's going on is that it's ceceta generales hard to pronounce but it's their um the blockchain subsidiary sort of experimental subsidiary that's doing this kind of d5 blockchain fintech you know cutting-edge innovation and experiments and trials with that kind of stuff and so apparently last year they created a tokenized bond so there's been this bond living in ethereum for quite a long time already that's basically yeah like a some kind of a real bond in a token format that's been done i guess under french law um as an experiment ultimately and so now they've reached a point where they've i guess they're starting to look at okay we've created this thing you know can we actually go and use it in d5 um and so so so i guess then they uh they've been in and they've been working together with some of the the contributors the decentralized contributors and maker that are being paid by the protocol to to support it they've basically been working together with this uh society generalist blockchain subsidiary to um yeah like prepare this proposal to make um and and yeah and one of the things that's also sort of another mind-blowing thing that also just really showcases the you know the incredible potential of d5 and really this fundamental power of money legos right is that so this token they made a year ago as an experiment it's it's an erc20 token and it just out of the box it fits right into the standard maker collateral um you know like like um interface essentially right so like there's not even any technical work in all of this there's like the work the the sort of the barriers that were necessary to overcome for this were i guess basically the legal work on on the bank's side in order to to figure out whether they could do this legally and then the work of like writing the proposal and that's actually that's it basically which is kind of crazy i think um and then of course when it comes to the actual like the actual sort of the uh the qualities of the collateral and and and how it's useful to make her i mean then i think one thing a lot of people immediately noticed is that this bond they have so it's a euro denominated bond with a 0 interest rate basically so it's basically like a like a bond that's not that's not um it's like a five-year bond right so it's not super liquid but it doesn't actually pay an interest rate and that's of course because in europe we've got some pretty serious negative interest rates going right now so people will actually like they're very happy to just get euro at zero percent but of course that means that it's it's going to be hard to charge a high stability fee um from you know buy maker on on this use when this bond is using collateral and i really think the role that that this kind of asset can play and also just generally this kind of collaboration between maker and these very very large institutions that are sort of sitting in in um you know squarely in traditional finance with all of the scale and and sort of interconnectedness that entails is really that they can provide liquidity to maker right so so it's a way to basically have some of the maker and some of the dye collateral um in in a form that is is somewhat similar to the role that usdc is playing right now and and packs a stable car as well where i see is like liquidity reserves that are sitting there ready to to protect the pig and basically make dye very liquid and very useful um but then this would be a way to sort of take some of that exposure and move it over to you know just like a completely different type of exposure right instead of being to a stable home provider it's with a huge bank and it's a different jurisdiction right it's it's french french law and i think that's quite desirable because i mean that's one of the biggest topics in maker governance for well very long time at this point is like how do we diversify out of all of the usdc that's sitting there right so i think that's that's great and and there i mean there's a very clear sort of way that this is spent at a beneficial relationship that that can be developed further and but i think the final thing that you know that's really the what really matters of all this is the president that it sets right i mean one thing is the fact that you now have one of the world's largest banks and the third largest bank in france they've gone through sort of the legal work of figuring out whether they can use their tokenized assets as collateral and maker and basically they're saying it can be done right i mean that's why they've gone so far and so to stake their reputation on making this proposal right and that's really a huge deal i mean that's it actually sets not you know obviously it's not a strong sort of legal precedent or anything like that it says right it's not anything like there's been courts or you know law firms making legal opinions and publicly stating that this is legal or anything like that but what the thing is is i mean the way that the the world works is when you have something like a huge institution like a bank they're you know they're part of the system right like they're and and it really matters when a part of the system starts to sort of reorient itself it's gonna it's you know that's gonna impact how easy it is for other parts of the system to do the same thing and uh yeah this is i mean i think this is this is really it really changes the landscape of um which jurisdictions are friendly to d5 i mean in particular it it makes france a lot more like a a much safer place basically but i actually also think it impacts the entire eu um so yeah so i think that's a huge deal and it means that it could be a lot easier for future interactions like this to happen and maybe also not only would it have to be these kind of liquidity type of of uh collateral assets but you could also have financial institutions offering other other kind of stuff for maker to to use as collateral maybe stuff that actually provides um you know has the potential to provide real stability fees as well rooney may this isn't just some like lucky happenstance outcome because some bank chose to do some defy stuff the maker dao as an organization has had its sights on real world collateral for a long time now and can you perhaps um elaborate on the point as to why sg bank chose maker dow instead of something like compound or ave or any of the other credit facilities in defy what about maker dao the organization there may was such a um compelling place to submit a governance proposal for something like sg bank why why maker so i mean i don't know because i wasn't a part of the process really so i can only guess but i would i mean i think the obviously the one thing to really notice just like the sort of the um the age the brand the sort of the the history of makers being this sort of old conservative um d5 project right and and then there's the fact that we've had this focus we've had this sort of um you know we've had a lot of communications and and spend a lot of effort trying to educate and talk about um you know the potential of defy interacting with the real world um so i guess on the on that sort of front sort of the when it comes to like who would you know who would a huge conservative bank choose as their partner when taking their first steps into d5 i think it makes sense that that they would go for maker because that's kind of that's exactly the kind of role that we've been setting ourselves up for for many many years at this point um but i think an even more sort of practical reason is because maker is a really the only place where you can go with something at pace uh you know zero percent interest and still get the you know people that are perfectly happy to accept that right because we're sitting with so much usdc where we're makers sort of the one place where risk really matters so much more than than the return essentially right so so that's where a bank can really provide something that's that's useful right like if they went to compound and up it just it wouldn't fit into the systems because you just there's just no place where people will park money to get zero percent in return right that that doesn't really work with their systems um and uh yeah i think that you know it's also that that in because of dye's interconnectedness and sort of existence across d5 it's also just a way for them ultimately to tap into sort of the whole ecosystem right because by tapping into die they kind of actually end up tapping into to activity across the whole the whole space i think this is a massive step for d5 it may be one of the biggest markers of uh i guess institutional adoption of a d5 protocol that i've seen like i mean it's a uh it's a real world bank one of the largest in the world posting on maker governance forms and submitting their collateral like how crazy is that how bizarre is that hard to imagine back in 2016 2017 when you guys were first firing this whole thing up so super cool step and really excited about it um roon want to hit on this this next topic which is uh super interesting to me i came across a thread that you published i guess a couple weeks ago i felt like this thread hit really hard this was a twitter thread and i'm just going to maybe summarize a few points and we'll get into them one by one but um it was kind of a criticism of the multi-chain future and also criticism of the multi-sig future that a multi-chain future inevitably brings with its bridges we're going to explain that a little bit more but just some colorful languages you called multi-sigs a dumpster fire right they're used as bridges at least not in general but they're used as bridges from chain to chain you also said and this was very provocative on a very long time scale only one layer one can survive only one layer one can survive on a very long time scale you just didn't you didn't just tweet that you had actually a justification like backing up why you think that might be the case and then you also said game theoretically um d5 protocols that are on ethereum they probably won't support other chains it's almost like this version of let's call it ethe maximalism light i know we're not talking about toxic maximalism but d5 protocols on ethereum will want to have their home chain be the winner so i want to dig into these topics and maybe let's start with the first let's talk about multi-sex dumpster fire duct tape what what is a multi-sig bridge can you define that for our listeners and then why do you hate them so much yeah i mean it certainly is a complicated topic but actually i think the most important thing to really define first and and that wasn't actually completely clear in in you know because of how these terms are used right but there's there's a multi-chain and then i guess there's what i'm what i'm really talking about which is multi-l1 um and uh because because the distinction between like a chain and an l1 that's very significant right because and that's kind of the what i'm really talking about is l1s and and what happens when you have multiple other ones and the base it comes from this the fundamental um perspective that an l1 is essentially a blockchain that sort of goes out of its way to be independent and be and actually sort of not interconnect elsewhere right so so um if you look at all the different l1's that you know in practice they're called eath killers right and that's basically because they're positioning themselves you know as alternatives to ethereum rather than as something that's fundamentally built to to synergize and to tap into ethereum's network because i mean and and i really would argue that in practice like if you're just trying to make if you just think coming from the perspective of you know i'm making i'm going to make a blockchain i'm going to make enable dfi i'm going to make sort of a you know block you know blockchain business blockchain economic ecosystem and all these things right like the number one thing you're always thinking about is like if you're trying to optimize for a good blockchain a good environment for people to build the main thing people care about which is why they're using d5 and why they're using blockchain is is um you know interconnectedness essentially right like this this um interoperability right the synergy uh permissionless innovation monitor goes this is kind of the entire value proposition right so the the um you know so there has to be like a really compelling reason to sort of deliberately exclude that which is then which then becomes this sort of this l1 narrative essentially right which is this idea that you can be a self-sovereign you know dominant blockchain essentially that can have its own ecosystem so it's already like basically you already from the beginning you're sort of defining these things as being separate and being distinct and being in some form of competition um and it's then from that perspective that you can then draw this you know draw this um conclusion of like the multi-six and the the multisig bridges because i mean the basic idea is that um when like the reason why someone uses blockchain well it's because they want interoperability but it's also because they want security right i mean that's why they're not just going on some you know centralized whatever right like some centralized service right they're actually going and and finding you know using a blockchain so they have control over their funds and they have you know um they have sort of an an understanding of of what kind of risks they're exposed to and even if a user isn't doing that explicitly then instead what's happening is they're using a platform which is actually even more sort of obsessed about what what kind of risks is this platform this you know this may be this custodial solution what kind of risks is it exposing its users to right so security always like it it plays this fundamental role um and in particular this like this sort of the task of like figuring out you know what kind of security are you expecting and what are the risks that you're willing to take and and all of this stuff right and and that's kind of where the problem comes in because every single l1 they sort of offers their own perspective on this right so ethereum it's like you know you want you have this this uh you know you want the the users to run the nodes and you have all these like sort of this more against more pure approach uh towards decentralization where instead on the other hand you have something like solana which is like actually you don't need all that you can have an l1 that just does x y and c and it's to some extent it's like users that use either that that's adopt either of those perspectives they have they have very different expectations of what security means like what is security basically and what is decentralization um and so that's why basically all bridges in my opinion ends up being multi-six actually no matter how you construct them you can pretty much think of them as multi-six no matter what because you're not gonna handle real quick when you're talking about a bridge you're talking about like if i want to get my tokens my dye let's say from ethereum to solana or from um ethereum to avalanche or from you know polygon back to ethereum that's the that's the bridge that you're talking about it's it's trans transmitting from one l1 to another l1 through some sort of bridge right yeah and actually it's a little confusing because the terminology back in the day used to be that this is called a gateway and then a bridge is when you do the kind of the swap so you do an atomic swap cross gene but i guess now it's sort of yeah like a lot of other terms it's become a lot more sort of abstract and you just kind of yeah what i'm talking about is are these transporting assets from one so go so go into that some more why why do these bridges suck so much and why do why do they become multi-sigs and why do multi-sigs like create kind of a a centralization vector that's duct tape as you said yeah so i mean so it's basically that i mean i guess the best example is ethereum and solana i think because that's kind of like that's really the every term of this whole sort of tension right we have ethereum sort of the incumbent and then you have solana as this very um you know very promising competitor that that is providing its its own complete ecosystem right and so the fundamental problem is that if you're transporting assets from i mean you can and it's very it's very concrete today how it works with ethereum and solana right where basically the dye that you move from ethereum onto solana becomes centralized effectively because it the di you know the dye doesn't actually leave ethereum right because it's it dye ultimately is tracked on ethereum right so the dye actually is sitting on ethereum but in a multi-sig and that multi-sig then issues is essentially an iou on the solana blockchain and so what's happening is now you have you know you go from thinking of you know go from a security model of die just being this is you know die has the security of ethereum basically uh and now so one one thing you're doing is you're moving it over to a new security model which is the security of solana first of all right so you have to consider that and then on top of that and this is basically the problem in my opinion right you also have to deal with security issues of the bridge and the security issues of the bridge are like pretty they're just a lot more severe than the blockchains themselves so for instance like on solana maybe you could some would argue that solana is less secure than ethereum but you still can't like you know you can't like lose your assets so you can't like have a you know like um like a 51 attack on solana just straight up like steals your assets right um i mean that they're like the blockchain is built to prevent that and it provides some guarantees that that means the worst thing that can happen is something like a censorship or double spending or something like something that's a bit less severe than straight up like losing your tokens but unfortunately with a bridge that's not the case like a bridge can like entirely it can it can just go and take all your tokens the moment it's compromised right and that's because it has to really it has to actually control the tokens as they sit on ethereum when it's trying to when it's sort of providing them across a cross chain on the encelada and that's and that's sort of the i mean it really is because you have these two l ones they don't have like they're deliberately built to not be compatible and then you have to create some kind of system in between that makes them compatible and that system in between it's i mean it's actually kind of like its own block you know you can always think of it as its own blockchain in one way but but in practice it makes even more sense to think of them as multi-slicks and it doesn't matter what form they take so actually even if like like even when i actually are blockchains that you can pretty much just think of them as like complicated multi-sticks basically because in practice as a user you're not gonna you know you know you're not gonna sort of spend the effort on like actually figuring out the the sort of the game theory and the crypto economic guarantees of some particular bridge in reality you have to basically you know think about who who's actually holding these funds and are they gonna steal them or not right and that's sort of the the um the the calculation you have to make before using a bridge and so what we're talking about with these when you say multisigs for bankless users that are not familiar right right these are like um these are kind of like you know accounts where it takes a a certain number of individuals and their private keys to like to sign whether a transaction goes through or whether they can take your funds or not so common multisig is like five of seven individuals all agree to a particular transaction and you know that that's it right so imagine taking your die moving it through a multi-sig tight bridge putting it on some other chain say salon or something like that and it's a five of seven multi-sig bridge that means it only takes five people we're probably friends know each other in real life like to collude and take all of that die from you that's where yeah exactly uh that's what you're saying and you're saying rune that like that that makes the weakest link like in your security chain that multisig every single time and that's what happens when we get a multi-layer one universe right yeah i mean i think in practice of course uh so actually actually i'm actually a big fan of uh multi-six sort of solution actually and that's kind of the thing that i i mean that's why i think it becomes so much about multi-six because when you have this sort of situation where you have some unknown risk you're bridging between sort of two different paradigms of security it's too complicated for people to actually like you know figure out how to measure the security and the risks and the best option really is to have like a bunch of trusted actors basically and then just being like yeah i mean i just have to basically trust these people not to steal the money and then of i mean and i i'm not sure about the specifics with um the bridge between ethereum and solana for instance but i would imagine that we're talking about like some of the top companies in the space right and there's this like there is a sort of intelligent design to it right like there's diversification there might be jurisdictional diversification so there i mean there's a bunch there are a whole bunch of optimizations that are made on this kind of construct um but the problem is just that in the end it's never gonna be as you know it's never gonna be as safe as sort of native security and um and yeah just it creates this this weird dynamic right where something like usdc like centralized stable coins for instance they're completely unaffected by this right they actually don't even need to use these centralized bridges they just straight up sort of create their own centralized um alternatives essentially right and that's because they're just fundamentally centralized so they completely sidestep all these issues but basically um for something like diet like it really sort of um undermines the value proposition in the first place because you just the point of it is that it's a you know it's a system that actually runs based on the the security of ethereum not based on sort of the the trust you place in the individuals that are active day-to-day or anything like that right um but then now you're you're sort of reimposing that kind of of um of downside to it right by by using it through a multi and ultimately that just means that you can't really you know you can't really compete with someone who's who's like you can't be an outsider on an l1 essentially and then compete with someone who's a local because like as decentralized projects right because you're you're sort of you're you're you're decent wise project that has become centralized essentially and then you're trying to compete with with a local that is just decentralized and that follows exactly the you know only the security model of the this this home chain that you're trying to compete for users on and ultimately that that creates sort of this this um i'll call this sort of game this game theoretic outcome where a project like maker is just better off not even trying to compete on on solana at least it's like it's a it's a difficult decision to make because you're ultimately going to be at a disadvantage and going there and trying to actually uh sort of boost activity there by by growing your own market share it you know you're always going to have that inherent sort of disadvantage but then what you're actually doing is you're sort of growing you're growing the the home chain of your own competitor in a sense and that ultimately can lead to a situation where um like solana as a whole could like become a threat to ethereum essentially and then i even you know talked about this in the tweet thread as well right in the worst case scenario if if solana for instance just became too big right if it became the real sort of east killer and really just like supplanted ethereum as the as the main blockchain and so the hub for all of d5 then you would you know it would not be viable anymore to be an outsider of this ecosystem right you'd have to be natively there because that's where the marketplace is that's where the users are and they you know they they're going to demand decentralization sooner or later right whether it's directly as end users or whether it's the big platforms that decide what they're going to integrate under the hood um and theoretically like you know maker would would have to undergo some kind of migration which is not even really i mean maybe that's not even really realistic but then the alternative is something like you know wither out and basically uh you know get out competed as ethereum gets out competed by solana right and so that's ultimately what creates this incentive for maker to instead of trying to you know instead of of trying to to um benefit each killers that are basically undermining the thing that maker needs to survive basically which is a strong ethereum ecosystem strong's of home home field advantage right maker is way better off um you know supporting l2 right and trying to build out the the ethereum ecosystem because that's where maker has this sort of home field advantage right and then um it's gonna be the you know it's gonna be the other projects they're gonna have to eventually go through this kind of you know painful uh um l1 migration potentially right if it turns out that that in the long run it will only you know it will be ethereum that ends up uh winning sort of the winning out in the in the what do you call it the power law distribution of of which ill ones are going to see activity i want to summarize the the thought process so far just to make sure that that i've got this right and hopefully for the listeners as well um uh at the beginning of this show we talked about uh why sg bank might have chosen maker and it was because of maker's risk aversion right and one thing that maker has done very very well is optimize for risk and and controlled risk uh and then same thing with the ethereum blockchain itself right ethereum is supposed to be maximally decentralized we encourage people to run nodes uh we try and do our best to make running a node as easy as possible uh and for the ethereum l1 developers for the last like you know client developers for the last like three four years of their lives have just like ground out client optimizations client optimizations client optimizations in the name of decentralization and so when you say like okay cool we have maker which is this very risk controlled application on top of this very secure decentralized blockchain if we want to export our dye which is maker's product to the rest of the crypto ecosystem all the l1s we can do that but then it's instead of all of this effort that maker and ethereum have put into into controlling risk all that just goes out the window once you put dye into a multi-sig to port that over to solana because all of that all that security like ryan said it's the weakest link and as soon as you have a five of seven multi-sig that's like well ethereum might as well have just had seven nodes uh and all of this like client optimizations for the ethereum blockchain have just gone out the window as did all the risk control that maker dow does uh and and so what you said you suggested then next is like well we can just build a native clone of maker dao on solana and not have to do any of the bridges we can just have two makers and they'll be the same entity just one will be on solana and one will be on ethereum but the problem you said with that is that well then that actually uh uh increases the adoption of this non the non-home field advantage chain right this alternative l1 and then there might be the the the time that because of the actual deployment of maker dow onto these other chains you actually bootstrap that chain into its success and then we have a whole messy outcome where the actual home field where maker started with is now the minority chain and now there's this whole mess where you have to migrate from minority chain to this new l1 chain and that's true for not just maker but for all of d5 and so what you're saying is that it's actually game theoretically rational for maker to just pick one place and optimize for that one place and make sure that that the home base the home field advantage for maker stays as strong as possible so maker doesn't have to deal with this whole which l1 do we call home how do we uh optimize for like making sure we pick all the same other the same l1 as everyone else um is is all that correct yeah i mean one thing i want to add yeah and again it's it is uh it's very complex um set of of interactions but one i mean one thing to do to mention is you're talking about this like deploying an alternative to maker and solana for instance right and actually this concept of like the copy um already there actually we you can't even really do that because the problem is that you just cannot you just cannot sort of um bridge decentralized governance right or rather if you bridge decentralized governance or any kind of bridge any kind of decentralization the level of security you end up with is the security of the bridge so you can't have like two separate maker instances that are not beholden to the bridge essentially unless they actually truly are separate meaning they have completely different sets of governance tokens and then then they've actually they actually just become competitors i believe i'm i mean i don't think anyone's around those kind of experiments but i think in practice i mean they're just not you know they're just gonna it's basically gonna be equivalent to um to sort of just creating a a competition in that sense right and because they no longer have economic alignment right yeah right like you you sort of lose they can you you get misaligned economic incentives yeah exactly right you spin up an identical twin but it's your evil identical twin it turns on you later yeah yeah i mean and that's also the thing about all of this is that we're we're talking about like looking really far into the future right so in the short run none of this stuff really applies it doesn't really have sort of short-term consequences but you know that's the thing about maker and and me i guess is we're kind of obsessed about the very long term and that's really mostly what we care about and it's from that perspective basically that i mean my argument is essentially that you just you're just gonna be better off trying to yeah like you know pick the pick the you know try to pick the l1 that wins and uh and stick to that i believe because if you pick sort of the wrong one you're not you're not going to have a good time you know changing your mind later if another one ends up being the winner and uh and there is absolutely this possibility that i mean there is this vision of like the multi-chain future that's so that's what it's called right the multi-chain future that's sort of the the phrase that describes this like what right now i think is actually the main belief of most people right that you will have all these various l ones and they'll just and defy and sort of the ecosystem will just interoperate across all of this and that's kind of what i what i call the multisig dumpster fire because then basically what that world would actually look like is you would just have this endless sort of complexity of of like where you know what's actually what's actually the trust assumptions of all these things and and yeah i mean yeah it's actually like if you sort of start to really dive into it it's actually really hard to even figure out what what does it actually converge to um and i and and so my conclusion is in the end you just always end up with everything converging to sort of the one place where everybody agrees okay this is this is what we trust like this is kind of this is the common ground um this is where we sort of in you know when we interoperate with something we interoperated under these conditions because we don't want to do it with you know interoperate other conditions that we do you know with security um sort of a security setup that we don't understand because yeah i mean you need to in the long run you have you know in the short run in d5 nobody really cares much about security right it's it's more the djinn spirit the sort of rules everything but in the long run it's the opposite you know the the djinn spirit can only take you so far right and then you have to actually really start to worry about risks and that's when i think it'll just you know it'll set in this sort of requirement that yeah probably my guess is it'll be ethereum but of course i'm completely biased that's kind of the thing right that i'm already locked in at this point because i'm i'm exposed to to to maker and right i'm you know financially and emotionally basically i'm fully invested in maker and that just means that my own interests requires ethereum to win so it's impossible for me to really you know it's very hard for me to to you know not sort of double down on that that belief right and but but that's kind of the point right that the place where when people will be mostly invested and where people have the most exposures or the most uh desire to sort of see succeed that's where that's what's going to be the standard in the long run of like how apps interoperate what's so interesting about this up from my perspective roon is like number one uh i've never pegged you previously as any kind of maximalist in particular in ethereum maximalist and what was interesting about your thread is it was it was more sort of a game theoretic case on like playing out on the long time horizon what's going to happen and you're basically saying that all d5 protocols that are ethereum based will protect their home world right we'll protect ethereum and will want to work to make ethereum succeed because if they move to any other chain then um you know essentially they compromise security and they will lose like uh to local competitors that's what you're saying so that's one implication another implication is on the long time scale as you said only one l1 can survive and i think what you meant is like not that there won't be other l1s but that there will be a clear power law winner say somebody with like 70 80 of the value capture in the market share and the mind share uh behind this and this this is interesting as well number three because i think this doesn't just apply to maker of course this applies to all ethereum d5 protocols whether they state it or not and what i really appreciated about this thread is like you actually came out and said it right it's like what everyone in the room is kind of maybe thinking or theorizing you actually said it where i feel like some other d5 protocols are kind of taking a a wait and see perspective and maybe they have plans behind the scenes but but you know they're not really executing them that's another i guess takeaway for me number four i guess the last takeaway is of course none of this applies when we're talking about ethereum layer two right so when we talk about a multi-chain future i think a lot of people mean what you what you said they mean which is like all of these different layer ones kind of interacting in some way right another definition of a multi-chain future is we have essentially it's all in kind of the ethereum ecosystem but it's a whole bunch of different layer twos that aren't in any conflict with um with ethereum and they have a different bridge right their bridge is not a 507 multi-sig bridge their bridge is based on the underlying security of ethereum so zk rollups and optimistic rollups take this approach they have very sturdy bridges that don't compromise on security so those are some of the takeaways uh in my mind from this thread and why i found it so insightful anything to add to that yeah so i think one um i mean then another sort of factor that i haven't really mentioned but that also plays a huge part in all of this is the role of the native token as collateral and d5 um and actually so i would actually disagree that this applies to to all or most dfi apps like this concept of sort of what you can call it like incentivized maximalism or something like that right so i think that's in fact most of the apps kind of because many of them don't really you know like must much of what people are using today and what's coming out today it's not so focused on like security or decentralization necessarily right a lot of it is kind of a i mean it's sort of closer to you know it's more about building these sort of high-risk high-reward things and that situation you may really make perfect sense to sort of be all over the place right be super fast cutting edge not worry too much about bridges or anything like that right um but i think in particular you know like it's really when you get to sort of the type of of a role and sort of the type of product that maker is providing right where we're talking about this like maximum stability maximum security maximum conservatism um and that's also where we then get into the concept of the the native token because the native token just plays such a huge role in this in in sort of the ability to create decentralized stability basically um are you talking about the native token of the layer one are you talking about like the native token of maker or some other d5 protocol yeah sorry so delivery i'm talking about i'm talking about eth right so the native token of of the layer one like so and because i mean that's why everybody wants to be in l1 right it's because a native l1 token is just so much more it's the single most valuable thing that's ever been invented in blockchain right um i mean and you even have the like it's so valuable that even you even have bitcoin that has sort of what's called a terrible business model right it's like a system that's just losing money basically yet just the sort of the native token characteristics of bitcoin makes it insanely valuable right and then you have ethereum which is like you know not only do you have this potential for for very powerful um um you know unit economics almost right like a very powerful sort of um just basic economic framework where there's profits there's there's surplus and it actually goes to the holders of the token you have that and you combine that with sort of this native you know self-sovereignty of of um of also powering and running the network itself you really get something that is just incredibly incredibly valuable first of all and liquid secondly right and and and well and then finally secure and decentralized which is the whole point of it and that's the thing that is actually also so incredibly sort of um interconnected with all this stuff right i mean one thing is that maker is sort of on the ethereum blockchain and it's on the home chain and so on right and some of it this is what the kind of security that our users expect and all that stuff but the other thing is like in practice maker just cannot really actually migrate away from ethereum because it has so much eath sort of backing all the dye that you can't you know the act of sort of d5 migrating away from ethereum is gonna have implications for the price of ethereum of the east token basically and and so the act of like maker migrating away from from ethereum um could sort of like that could just itself you know impact the the stability of die basically and and that and and this might actually be the biggest factor of all basically and because it's sort of the hidden sort of the invisible hand that that runs crypto communities and and really runs out of all of crypto right is that the fact that you know ethereum is a huge deal there's so much innovation because first of all it's super open to people to come and build stuff and then everyone's actually got sort of a you know they're actually vested they have a sort of vested stake right everyone's holding eth so they got they're not only like benefiting from what they do directly they're so they're also benefiting from being a part of the whole that where everyone's contributing towards this with these enlightened incentives right and it's kind of this the same factors as well that there's a play here and i mean and so you know and this and that's it it bridges once again our problem here because you just like solana is an amazing uh blockchain i think right it's like super advanced technology and it's like a very clever trade-off i think so i'm actually like i you know and that's why i'm a weird let's call it a very weird eve maximalist right because i really think that solana is a very strong sort of contender and a very yeah like a a strong block chain and so on right and uh and and like if you look at the soul token it's a it's an amazing token i think to to use as collateral for the exact same reason why theorem is an amazing token to use as collateral um but try to move it across a bridge and suddenly it's it's really not that appealing anymore that's basically the problem right so it's a it's not so easy for maker to to um like i mean it's just not that attractive for maker to like stock up on let's say uh saw tokens as collateral banking die like you could have some sure but like you wouldn't have you're not gonna you're not gonna feel good having like a huge portion of of the collateral portfolio of of a decentralized stablecoin be basically a blockchain token that's held in some kind of either it's a multisig or it's some kind of very complicated technological uh machinery right that where ultimately there's all sorts of risks that you can't really like you can't directly analyze them game theoretically you have to just basically put your faith in it right and that's and so in the end you can just think of it as basically like a multi-stake of a bunch of factors that you hope all um are gonna work out but basically if they go wrong and you can't really can you never know exactly how and and why that would happen then uh you could lose you could just lose the assets entirely right so importantly that's just not true about ether when maker is on the ethereum chain right ether the properties of ether as collateral inside of maker dow hold a lot more monetary premium due to their due to its nativity and its nativity to all the other defy apps that are on ethereum unlike this old maybe there is a monetary premium behind the soul token but the value of that monetary premium is just um thrown out the window when you establish a bridge yeah so i mean i think that uh like a maker clone i'm not sure if there's yeah there is there is a maker clone of selena but it works a little bit differently works based on derivatives but i think just like a system that just generates a stable coin by accumulating huge amount of salt tokens natively on solana that's a very that's a strong model i think but you know but i don't exactly see a you know stable coin on solana you know sort of carrying across huge amounts of eth through the the bridge onto solana to then have a bunch of centralized irus sitting in a decentralized stable point over there right so roon does this mean all these chains fight to the death is that how it's going to play out um i like i think in well i would say that ethereum you know i mean i i said this you know what is in 2015 or something i made this like original uh reddit comment about uh synergy of you know synergy in in blockchains and and later you know ended up becoming you know it was called defy and money legos and all of that right but basically i think that ethereum just has this completely unstoppable momentum already so like in practice it's just already that like it already is the standard essentially um and and uh you know it's just it's growing so fast so like i don't think necessarily that other blockchains will will sort of fizzle out necessarily i think we've seen it happen with something like eos for instance um whether it will happen to like whether it's a it's a possible outcome for solana i don't know if that's uh the case like solana might have hit critical mass where it's just it can only could it's gonna grow from its where it but the question is is it like i mean is it ever going to actually be something that can sort of surpass ethereum and and be the new standard with that ethereum usually um and um yeah i guess it it actually comes down to the l2s right so that what means and really sort of the optimistic rollups and like you know stocknet and ck sync and these things that are coming like if they if they get adopted i think it's game over in the sense that you know you'll never it's just you know the window of opportunity for solana to surpass ethereum is sort of right now basically right we would have to see sort of migrations of applications from ethereum over to solana we would have to see sort of the cutting edge of innovation happening on solana rather than ethereum um and sort of a kind of an irreversible trend towards that you know needs to occur before the the roll-ups sort of you know start to develop a critical mass of of uh being able to properly tap into the liquidity on the theory of maintenance and then having that you know user experience and all these things um and yeah like i think i mean yeah so it's not it's not about fighting to the death it's more like fighting to see who gets to sort of really uh you know bank the unbanked or that's a weird analogy like who gets to really sort of block blockchain the whole world right like what's you know so and i mean maybe associate general that's sort of the it's a good example of that right i mean the question is so now they did it and and there'll be another you know 100 banks doing the same thing soon enough and the question is are they are they all going to go to ethereum or is it or is it actually going to happen that that you know that over time the gravity the center of gravity will be on solana for instance and you would actually see this sort of large-scale global adoption happen with solana instead previously and also generally the um arguments uh the maximalism arguments have kind of been like emotional ones or subjective ones but roon my take on this is that this is actually more of a technical argument as to for maximalism right uh and we don't we can actually even just ignore the names of these systems right we can ignore the fact that one of these things it's called ethereum we can ignore the fact that one of these things is called solana and we can have the same exact conversation just saying like l1a l12 because bridges are agnostic constructions blockchains are agnostic constructions but the patterns being described here as when you um compromise security going from blockchain a to blockchain b is the same uh and so like do you agree that this is actually just like a more technical argument as to why 1l1 will quote unquote rule them all regardless of what that l1 actually is yeah i think i mean i think so and the thing is where i'm coming from i mean you you sort of mentioned this literally right that i'm not i'm just not someone who's so has traditionally been an eth maximist um in fact i've sort of been the opposite so i've always been sort of advocating for the multi-chain future and and but i always had this i mean and the reason why i've arrived at these conclusions which by the way are my personal opinions and it actually it really doesn't reflect what other people in in you know contributing in the maker ecosystem thinks it's uh it's very diverse i guess um but it's it's it happened because i was spending so much time trying to figure out how do we really you know how do we get our arms around this multitained future right how do we become the stable coin that's you know sitting on ethereum but it's actually available everywhere right you don't have to worry about which l1 will still be available you know with native security and then the problem was basically turns out you just can't the native security thing you just can't really do that um i mean you can do some and and you know there's a there's this whole side argument where um people some people come in and then they will start talking about like cosmos for instance or some other like basically these like very advanced bridges right but and the argument goes something like um what's gonna happen in the future is that everything will be sort of multi-chain and um you know like like users will be completely fine bridging across one blockchain to another because when they bridge they're using cosmos so they know you know the bridge has this sort of native security they're very comfortable using cosmos because they they trust that and they're used to it but actually what they're basically doing is they're kind of engaging in the same they're engaging in the same kind of l1 warfare in a sense right because they're just trying to to to argue that cosmos should be the l1 that's basically how i see a lot of this stuff happening i mean and then you actually see this stuff all over the place and this is i also wrote that in the in the twitter right this is what i call a multichain propaganda right because you really want to kind of um adopt this like you know we working i mean yeah right just this is this s curve of platforms right like in the beginning a platform wants to collaborate uh you know with with some of the things that build on top of it right so first yeah write an l1 will will want to not present itself as like an l1 but rather as a whatever l whatever anything else than an l one basically but in the end i mean i'm you know if cosmos is running all these bridges all over the place um they're gonna have you know they're gonna have some some they're gonna provide their high level security by paying people right like there's going to be costs related to providing that security and that's actually what it all comes down to is like who gets paid for like providing the ultimate security like the thing that's sort of like when i get this stamp of approval i know i trust it and i know everyone else also trusts it so that we can interoperate um and and who gets sort of that premium of like being that final step of approval right and today that's ethereum right so that's and that's the eth token that's what's making the youth token so valuable and that's what's making it so great collateral and so on right and the future it could be that it's actually not you know it could be that it's like cosmos or something like that rather solana whatever it is but the point is that i don't believe that there's going to be more than one of these ultimate stamp of approval um uh sort of systems basically because it just i mean it's just not going to be as efficient to have multiple pieces of them and they it may work in this form of like it's all bridges and so on but they're actually all cosmos and everyone trusts cosmos and everyone's paying cosmos but yeah like that brings us back to l2 and ethereum right because that's exactly what ethereum is basically doing with um with rollups in the first place right that you can you can you can actually have a multitasking future that is decentralized as long as everyone's sort of making sure that they're getting the the stamp of approval of the ethereum chain which is right now the de facto sort of you know truth machine roon let me ask you this might be sort of a in the armor of your argument i'm wondering what your reaction is to this so i read a tweet recently that said basically um people keep who keep harping that whatever is not decentralized enough are just blinded by ideology right and the tweet goes on to say what people really want is open money plus monetary incentive plus community you don't need decentralization for that is what this person said you said earlier in our conversation that um for assets like usdc really doesn't matter whether it's ethereum or avalanche or solana or name your other l1 chain why because ultimately it settles back in a uh coinbase and circle bank account right it's it's outside it's a foreign citizen to the uh defy community right so it really doesn't matter for those assets what would you say to that reaction that hey basically decentralization doesn't matter as much as you think it does roon and you know people are just here for kind of the the open money the the permissionlessness and this kind of whole incentive compatible uh community layer that we have yeah i mean i agree with it that uh most people don't care about decentralization and most cases it's not actually needed um the thing is just that ultimately decentralization that's what a blockchain provides so the you know you don't actually if you want to provide a future of open money and open all this stuff um and you don't care about decentralization you don't need a blockchain to provide that right i mean let's i mean like a perfect sample is something like ftx right that's a really cool example of like this is where you have a a regular company just doing all sorts of crazy financial innovation right and and that's what actually really hooks people right like that's they've got a huge user base they're incredibly successful right um and i and i think that's exactly because they're sort of tapping into that that concept of right of like people just want cool financial uh tools to access um you know so much i mean we were talking about the good and the bad of blockchain right i mean the reality is that almost everything that's happening in blockchain right now like there's this massive sort of it's a it's a hurricane of of like you know basically projects and and and um like tokenomics that ultimately aren't sustainable right like so much of the activity happening in blockchain they are like people getting yields from like yield farming or something like that right ultimately that uh it just fundamentally the reason why it's happening is because it's like the wild west and we're on the frontier and all these things are happening today that they're possible because i mean they're they were enabled by by decentralization but they don't really sort of they don't really need it they just need they just need something enough of it and enough of a headstock to not get like shut down for instance right and over time that's not gonna i don't think that that's gonna it's gonna not gonna last forever basically like a probably a good analogy is something like we before the the dot-com bubble still right we're still in this sort of era where where things just haven't really converged um and i think in the you know in the longer term they'll there's just i mean there's gonna be this kind of of pressure where on one hand you have basically um you know the decentralized networks and the sort of the legitimate activity that's happening in fully and fully decentralized systems that are you know like defy stuff like you know where maker is trying to you know like improve finance through uh through better um you know through smart contracts that just create better financial primitives and and these sort of really solid use cases um and then sort of all the way on the other end you just have like straight up like ponzi schemes and and basically the ponzi schemes what they're really going to be running out from in the long run is is like regulation right and and people suing them or whatever is going to happen to them right and the way they protect themselves is ultimately with like anonymity and decentralization and you can kind of compromise on decentralization as well when it comes to to creating schemes or policies or whatever but there's a i mean there over time there's gonna be i think there's gonna be a limit to that and you're really gonna see that that um a lot of the kind of this middle ground activity we see today is gonna kind of bifurcate into sort of just regulated stuff that's centralized and then you know decentralized stuff that is either not regulated at all because it's completely cut off from the physical world or that is regulated in a way where it's sort of the pieces that interact with the real world that get regulated ruin one part of your tweet thread which you hinted at a second ago which i want to touch on before we close out this section and move on to clean money is uh the whole um trojan horse multi-chain propaganda uh parts of part of your tweet thread and the my interpretation of this is that if you are if you are a new chain with like lesser adoption you're like a minority chain and there's a chain out there that's bigger than you you are game theoretically incentivized to say oh it's a multi-chain world there's many chains and we're one of them uh come come do your things on our chain because we're part of this multi-chain world and that's rational for a chain with lesser adoption to promote that that sort of narrative towards you know the greater conversation but then if you're a chain with a with a greater level of adoption you have an incentive to say it's a winner take all environment it's a power law distribution we are in the lead we are going to stay in the lead we're going to consume everything and i think what you're implying is that like if you are a lesser chain you want to promote this multi-chain narrative until you have sufficient adoption that you actually become the dominant chain and then you swap and then you say well no it's actually a winner take all environment and then you rug pull the narrative and say now that we've gotten all the adoption that we have like turns out it's actually a power law distribution uh and so um and you were also saying that like things ultimately collapse down towards that final stamp of approval right the strongest stamp of settlement assurances that a blockchain can provide and those assurances get stronger and stronger and stronger with greater and greater network effects and so going back to like the last uh comment i brought up is like this is is this kind of a logical conclusion of l ones right like l ones all collapse down towards a maximalist tendency or network effects or to whichever one can create that the strongest settlement guarantees the song the strongest stamp of approval ultimately the the game theory of all these competing chains collapsed down to who has the best stamp of approval is that like the simplest way you can uh the simplest way we can like uh collapse all of the things we've been saying is like well it's ultimately the game is who has the strongest stamp i think i think you can argue that to some extent um but i mean but there's like there's just so many factors involved in all this right um and and uh i think you know what one example i wanted to make is that you can also think of it as like when you have this sort of you have this this lesser chain right like a new chain with sort of less security essentially right that's not considered the it's not considered yeah like the fight it doesn't have that sort of final industry standard stamp of approval characteristic yet um as a result you don't really care so much about what's coming through the bridge like maybe that i mean i guess maybe today's a little bit different right but i think early on with solana especially you know you could be like well solana itself pretty much looks like a multisig right there's a bunch of big nodes and all that you know so what's the difference between going through the sort of this their the actual multisig bridge and then just like being on the native security solana there maybe isn't that much of a compromise um in the beginning and but and that's basically the thing you could really say right that when you're when you're sort of the underdog and you're transporting from uh you know stuff from other chains you just don't really mind the you know you're because you're basically you're trying to cultivate you're trying to bootstrap a different kind of community that's just more have higher risk tolerance anyway essentially right and then yeah once you're in the incumbent it becomes the exact opposite you kind of want to you're the incumbent so you really want to to emphasize that being you know being the the i mean that's exactly what's the case with the theorem today right we all hold eth everyone's in ethereum whole youth right it's so freaking important to be ultra secure right like security is the most important thing in the world and and and you know like this sort of diamond level security it just it really makes sense that that is just so freaking important right but i think if you're if you're a holder if you hold that if you all your your exposure is to some new l1 then it's just not you know you're not going to have the same mindset until um you know your own interests align with that basically and and yeah it all comes down to the bridges right because the bridges are kind of they just fundamentally they will always have a different like they always mean adopting an an inferior security model basically and once you're used to an environment of very high levels of security that suddenly becomes a bad thing right and and yeah i i just really think that you would you know over time you would absolutely expect to see that on solana for instance useless will will prefer when they're looking for something decentralized they will prefer stuff that's native because they will just not consider the bridge to be as decentralized as as the stuff that's like truly native following the real rules of of solana and being exposed to only solana and exactly that a super fascinating discussion i you know i've not heard someone articulate it in quite that way so you know thank you for that and i think to distill this down because this is partially a podcast about the future of maker right and what you're saying is basically you think the future of maker is ethereum and should remain ethereum for the game theoretic reasons that you outlined hey guys hope you're enjoying the conversation with roon christensen thus far like we said in the beginning in the second half of the show we turn the conversation towards maker dao as a green machine and die becoming clean money and both the the rationale as to why maker dao needs to become a purpose-driven dao as roon said in his blog post and why that purpose should be climate change so stay tuned for that part of the uh stay tuned for the second half of the show coming up next but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible gemiini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their urn program where you can earn up to 7.4 percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent

borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com let's talk about the the next subject in the future of maker and this is a couple of days ago you published a post maker governance because now that maker is decentralized i guess you're just another guy in the maker governance forums right just another guy posting um but you do have some clarity of vision and some uh great ways of articulating yourself and you wrote this post called the case for clean money and this is basically the um the thesis or the idea that dye should become clean money that it should become greener over time more environmentally friendly in an esg type of asset if you will or backed by esg type assets um this was a statement i'll just pull out to kick start this conversation because we want to dig into this post some more you said at somewhere near the beginning to truly reach its potential maker needs to become a purpose-driven dow a purpose-driven dow let's start with that like fundamental foundational thesis there why do you think that's true why does maker need to become a purpose driven dow why can't it just go seek profits and make that kind of the the short-term pursuit what is what is it with the purpose-driven thing that is uh so important yeah so it's it's kind of uh you know it's it's it's actually really exciting you know the the world we're now with dao's evolving and human or you know sort of new forms of human organization and um with maker like this this uh proposal that i've made ultimately as sort of you know basically as my opinion as an mkr holder basically on how i can how i can and sort of contribute and and support the project as much as possible um which i do obviously hope and i'm glad to see already it's getting some traction but um yeah so there's a whole range of things that i've been thinking about basically the whole time i've i've been in the foundation right that a bit distilled out and ultimately i came up with this this concept of sort of yeah centering everything around this this clean money vision and this the the question of like the dao's like how a dao should organize and this concept of a purpose driven dow versus i guess yeah you could say like a prophet driven dial or something like that that's actually that's that's like a really age old um kind of issue and dilemma that we've been dealing with in maker since actually the very beginning and it's it just comes it's you know the very simplest way to think about it is just the the really the fundamental game theoretic problems with with daos are basically things like governance attacks right and and and so the tragedy of the commons where um you have this you know you have this sort of shared public infrastructure like project that you're using and then you're you're counting on all all sorts of individuals to coordinate around how to grow the thing as a whole kind of in a way that benefits everyone um and you're worried about individuals instead of doing stuff that benefits everyone you're worried about them doing things that just benefits themselves disproportionately right and the i guess the most basic um sort of example of this of all is like the you know the the governance attack where you could have in most d5 protocols if someone actually control the majority of the the voting shares they can just straight up like steal all the assets in that protocol um maker actually has protections against that so it's more like you can end up into this kind of this uh basically uh yeah a cryptoeconomic death spiral kind of where what ends up happening is the protocol uh shuts down and everyone is re everyone is settled out and and has their funds returned so people don't actually lose money but you can have the whole protocol actually shut down as a result of a governance attack um but you know so that was like it was already clear from the beginning that there is this problem of like people have to participate honestly and they have to kind of like you know there has to be this element of like the basically the whole right that you're part of a dao and you're contributing a part you know for the as a group and you have i mean and in the very you know the real the predecessor to to to dao's uh which was bitshares that really invented these like very first um yeah like dials basically called decks but back then um you really all you really had this like this this concept like you know the community spirit of a of a doll right out of like you know people holding held together by the token and you even have that like i mean even in bitcoin right bitcoin itself is driven by the same thing of like the the um yeah the maximalist medicines right like the toxic maximalism is actually a kind of like a way for for you know for bitcoins to sort of you know uh work together towards a greater good right a great as a whole and um and and um yeah like for it was clear to me that this is actually fundamental for dials to function because the okay so the basic problem with um everyone just being driven by money is just that you're just you know what if it's about making money the problem is that's just never that's not a shared thing ultimately right it's all like making money is something that happens individual to you so you're you're gonna cooperate with the group you're gonna you're gonna work together as long as everybody that's how everyone makes the most money but if you're ultimately there for the money and you're given an option to make more money for yourself at the cost of others then if that's the only thing that drives you that's actually the you know that's that what you what you're gonna choose to do and yeah so in maker now we have this like very very complex very advanced governance process and even a governance bureaucracy that sits around this process with people that are actually being paid by the protocol and you know that are the full-time employees right like getting getting money straight out of the protocols uh revenue and i think that that's like getting like for instance like being able to organize such a bureaucracy it really starts looking like the kind of challenge that you have when you're just trying to create a you know like a startup for instance or a company right where you really need you need some you need sort of a north star you need some way to really align people and and in a normal company you can do that through well you can just have a you know centralized organization right you can have like a leader um in a dow that's not it's not that simple right like even if you have a leader over time that leader is gonna disappear right the dow is supposed to still function even without the leader um and that's why i think that really the the best option then is basically to to create a you know like a a vision and a and a purpose that just actually makes sense to people so that when individuals they contribute to a dow and and in doing so sort of contribute to the greater the greater good right like the thing that inspires them to do that is they know everyone else is doing the same thing and it's like i'm not only like when i'm sort of honestly participating in governance and actually voting and considering what's best for everyone else even though i'm ultimately that's a that is sort of an act of altruism it helps myself but it also helps everyone else and and to a large extent it's everyone else that gets the the most of the benefit um you know like if if you're doing that in an environment where you're helping everyone else make money and you're basically not really making money by doing that and it's just not it's just about the money then like there's a mismatch between there's a mismatch of of the incentives there and sort of the outcome and instead if you have a a situation where there really is an actual sort of vision and purpose that everyone can follow you just haven't you're just gonna have an easier time getting uh getting a critical mass in a community where people actually collaborate uh rather than than the defect in the game i guess you can say one thing at one point we always hammer on at bank list is that this whole crypto revolution thing the thing that it does the most is that it aligns human values with the market value of our assets and that's kind of what i see with uh this proposal of saying like hey let's align make or dao with being green uh so that we can actually align more more people under that shared banner under that shared goal and and we'll we'll come back to the subject towards the end of this conversation because i do want to ask like is this actually maker dao's like uh the the vision for maker doubt that is actually putting maker down first like is this altruism or is this actually just the most optimal strategy for maker dow growth but uh before we get there i do want to we want i want to unpack this whole green money approach first and foremost and in your blog post and again when we started this conversation we talked about society general you said the recent governance proposal by society general one of the world's largest banks proves how maker has the potential to impact the deepest layers of finance as a new financial back end and so my my question is that is are you saying that maker dao can actually choose can actually influence the outcome of the real world by picking and choosing what collateral it accepts into its protocol uh i mean that's the that's the potential if it if it uh scales enough um and i think so and i mean i think you know that's sort of it's hard to sort of um navigate just all the different complexities that exist in all this right but i actually think one one point that that's um that maybe makes the most sense to focus on is this concept of um you know of like altruism versus sort of the greater good versus your own good right and um because you know we're the the thing about climate change is that it's just really really serious and it's like it's reached the point where it's so serious it's so severe that that you're really you know people are go you know it's sort of the story goes that that people have sort of gone from from you know it used to be that that the sort of climate denialism was the big issue right the people like sort of just denying that it's happening and now the big issue is sort of climate sort of uh dumerism basically right that like it just seems impossible to deal with so we just gotta give up and and resign to our fate kind of and and just uh yeah like ignore it in a sense but and yeah like the the problem is it's not you know it's not a good thing and and uh if you're if someone like me that has has the kids you it really you know it's is it's tough to accept but the reality is that we're just in for some very hard times basically um and and that's where it kind of gets back to this you know the you know the concept of the dao as a as this sort of a a bounded group of people that have to work together and and you know you want to you want to do what's best for yourself but then the whole thing sort of falls apart because if everyone just what does what's best for themselves the dow can't even function you have to kind of reach this this um positive nash equilibrium right where everyone works together and contributes their part and then it works and yeah we're we're in the same situation you can think of the whole world basically as a dow in that sense right that's right now failing failing horribly and and um and choosing to collaborate unfortunately um and yeah so i mean so from that perspective the question is basically how can you know how can we as individuals change that um because we i mean it's actually about like our lives it's about like our our homes right and our children and and uh yeah like um the good news is that maker uniquely is in a really interesting spot to be able to actually help with this kind of systemic change right and and um and yeah like i mean good example is that banks actually want to interact with maker right so you have potentially a way to to if the banks want to to access cheap capital for maker maker might be able to turn around and then um you know ask for collateral that is that is uh environment you know that's sustainable that doesn't have uh negative externalities and maker in turn by virtue of being a decentralized currency does have an ability to somewhat capture the value of of preventing negative externalities and creating positive externalities because it's basically the um like the the the viral effect like the viral potential of currency basically right the the the sort of the network effects of liquidity and of of um of sort of trust in currency are so incredibly powerful that like you know promoting a currency on the basis of this currency is is uh you know it's good for the world is actually very viable because it just that's actually what people would expect if they're if you're asking you're asking to adopt some new currency i mean that that's uh you know that first of all they don't care about money you know they really it's the most boring thing they've ever heard so it's like very hard to even get people to to think about something like that but then like if it you know if it's actually gonna happen then you know like the banks right now you know in the end the way it works is who's offering you know zero point whatever percent more in in uh interest rates right and they sort of all just follow the same fundamental paradigm and practice people don't change the banks for instance right and uh i think that that's where you can you know you can come with that that's exactly what d5 has this potential right of like showing and look this is a way for us to realize that the whole world is in this is actually at this big interconnected yeah we always think of it like a big interconnected organization right where everything does ultimately have to work together or we're all going to destroy each other because we'll we'll we'll negative externality each other to death basically um and and and d5 really yeah it can you know it it provides a very powerful tool to try to change this because first of all you can program it into the money right you can provide the banks with cheaper capital if the people are willing to to to access currency that they consider to be clean clean money right that means that that you get more adoption then you can you can turn around and you can use that to actually affect the change in the system which then leads to even more adoption and that's kind of on the i guess the branding and marketing side of this right and that's a way where it's a very unique way that you can use d5 to actually like capture some of the value that um you know some of the positive externality that normally would only go to everyone else and as a result you have you know nobody's got an incentive to do it uh but in this case there's like a you know you can sort of you can basically say look we can use this value to try to bootstrap a world currency basically um and yeah then there's like all these sort of other um like there's there's these sort of knock-on effects on on how it you know how it can actually make a difference right so um there is the like there's there's also the you know there's also the fact that not only can maker sort of try to affect more sustainability through um how it allocates capital but then there's also this concept of climate alpha basically where the current financial system basically has to sort of ignore what's going to happen with climate change it's and it's really really bad it's like you know it's it's literally it's like worst what's happening is like worse than the absolute worst case scenarios that were predicted right so we're like sort of off the scale bad basically um and the problem is why do they have to ignore it why do you think this is a traditional it's because if you start pricing in climate alpha and if you start sort of kept do making the calculations of how much does it cost to sort of pull the co2 out of the air again that the fossil fuel you know the fossil fuel car on these are creating now and like the math of like how the global economy works it basically doesn't check out so like you you know what's happening is people then just not even making the calculation at all right they're just focusing on the short term and uh yeah you you know this this system is sort of finding all these creative ways to to um kick the can down the road and really the i think the number one i mean yeah the number one thing that that's really happening is basically people are assuming that there's gonna be this kind of silver bullet that will emerge basically so the silver bullet is sort of the way that that it's being explained away because yeah and often it's called the technological solution or something like that um and arguably the reason why this is happening and the reason why people accept this and we like the financial markets accept this even when we're talking about like you know it's basically ignoring huge risks and sort of betting your money on the wrong horse basically based because you you know because you basically the implications of accepting that those risks exist just means that you you can sort of the whole thing can sort of come come crashing down right but but i think that um the reason why the concept of the syllable of the technological solution is so appealing is because we're so used to this kind of exponential um i would say sort of exponential innovation that happens in you know when it comes to digital technology right so things like moore's law and and how crazy you know the iphone is now compared to whatever right when the internet and all this sort of virtual stuff that's it's just like you know every year it's just a new my you know blockchain itself maybe the best example ever right of just like how you just have these complete paradigm shifts um but the reason why it's like it's so severe and happening like that is because it's we're talking about in you know technology that relates to information ultimately right so it's not bounded by physics but we've when we really become used to these kind of massive transformations and and yeah climate alpha or some of the the you know the reality of climate change is that that's not possible in the physical world unfortunately you don't get these like complete exponential transformations it's very sort of incremental what's possible to do right because climate change is not digital it is physical and what you're saying is like these paradigm shifts these zero to one moments they've all been in the digital world uh and so you're saying people are used to having these zero to one moments but forgetting that like these zero to one moments that we've all been having have all been happening in like our digi our digital devices our digital lives our digital internet um and so what you're saying room with this climate alpha is that the market is just not pricing in appropriately the future the negative future of that we have uh with climate change and i'm kind of reminded of our episode with kathy wood who talks about like one of the reasons why arkhanves has done so well is because she has priced in components of the future that so many of the legacy institutions of the world have completely forgotten about so what you're saying is like there is a certain amount of alpha that's out there and available and no one's capturing it because if banks or financial institutions actually started to price in risk associated with climate change well they would actually be like at a net loss in profitability they actually wouldn't be able to sustain themselves and therefore the global economy wouldn't be able to sustain our themselves and so everyone is just ignoring the costs of climate change in order to make sure the economy actually works and i think what you're saying is that that leaves an arbitrage opportunity for maker dow to lead with assets and financial opportunities that do answer towards climate change um is is that all right yeah you can really compare it to the the financial crisis right where it just you know nobody wants to look into sort of the mortgage-backed securities and all this stuff that's happening while this they're making money it all works and the problem is if they suddenly look start looking into it i mean that it would be very uncomfortable because they've got so much sort of the system is just so stuck in the way it's running right now and yeah basically what i think is going to happen is that there are certain physical assets in certain locations which are sort of very basically very far north and very far south in areas that will be able to remain um you know have a yeah basically remain very stable even if if the rest of the world starts to really unravel and become very unstable and so it's particular land and sort of very you know physical things like food production there's a very basic stuff in these places it's just you know it's going to be um really the most important thing in the future and and uh and what i think that that the role that that dye can really play in all this is that when you have people you know let's say in near the equator right like that that are probably going to you know they'll become climate refugees sooner or really important later that that maker plays basically so when people from these areas they have to escape and they have to go to places that are you know that are actually um um climate resilient and and that you get that are still livable the problem is all of their own assets if they're all stuck whether you know if they all build their assets and all their money and you know maybe you know they barely have any money in the first place right this there's gonna be people that that the you know because that's kind of the problem with climate change as well it really affects very unequal the way it affects people right but um if like if they already don't have that much and then the few the few assets that they do have sort of lose their value because now they're you know they have land and uh that the place is now desert i mean that's a really big problem they're not because they're just not going to be able to sort of pay their way to to escape that right and what what dye can can really do is it can play this role of identifying the climate alpha before the system you know the rest of the system is able to and actually allow people to to in a way sort of protect themselves against this future right because if you hold your you know if dye is backed by by um assets are very climate resilient then um you know even if you know as long as you hold your money and die then even if if uh you know you lose everything else at least you know you're gonna have money that they'll they'll accept in you know new zealand or something right which may be the place you want to get to um and i think that one of the things this can lead to then is is a way for kind of you know this means that you can you can really equal the playing field a little bit between um sort of regular people and and and the elite right that are that are going to be much less affected by climate change among other reasons because i mean what they do is they they just build bunkers in new zealand right that's sort of one of the big stories of of climate change right and a regular person doesn't have the ability to to um build a bunker in new zealand but they should be able to at least hold money that is backed by agricultural and real estate assets in new zealand or something like that right i think that's gonna make a big difference so rooney let's get into the specifics of how die actually becomes clean you've said a number of different strategies but i just want to actually uh kind of take it and take it through the story of how this actually happens so we have the society general as an example using maker dao as a facility to generate to get access to capital um so how do we use that strategy to actually impact the future outcome of the rest of the financial system it's like do we accept like carbon credits as collateral we have esg collateral like what are the actual prescriptive details as to how maker actually generates clean dye i actually think that sort of the real end game is that and you know and yeah and this is basically the the reality of climate change right is that the whole world needs basically what you know total war approach right so it's it's you know fundamentally the way that economies and businesses function is just that they have to start considering negative externalities when they do business and i guess that means um you know ultimately like governments regulating them or something like that right but but the way we can get in that direction is is actually for you know it could be something as simple as maker um providing different risk like basically different terms different cost of capital different risk parameters based on also uh accounting for for externalities right so not just this sort of the direct risk of um you know of a of an asset but then also kind of the the external risk that this acid produces for everything else um and uh in practice i mean i think the soci the social general relationship for instance it like and i wrote this in the post as well like i think the the place where that actually fits in is not necessary like it's going to be a while before you know maker gets to to bus uh them around right if it ever happens so it's not it's not like like we can we can sort of it's not an effective place to try to really have an impact i think in terms of having you know i mean certainly if maker becomes another voice in the in sort of the growing momentum for climate action that does actually create some tiny indirect um sort of pressure on on society general and all the other banks to also start to really consider esg and like reconsider consider externalities and how they do business so what you're saying is that the the legacy financial world is uh taking advantage of not having to answer towards its own externalities that it costs and that leaves an opportunity to make her for maker to do that and so like maybe something like uh i don't know some scapegoat for carbon production let's say some some car company comes and this is a car company that has not committed to electric vehicles and uh they're doing uh combustion engine only and they're asking for a million dollar loan and then something like tesla comes to maker down they're also asking for a million dollar loan you're saying like maker dow could could charge a stability fee for this carbon emitting company that's 10 times higher than the disability that they would charge for tesla who which produces electric cars and that can and these numbers will be measured by the externalities that maker governance try attempts to measure and calculate and that hopefully just tips the playing field towards capital being allocated towards companies that are doing things that are climate aligned is that the model yeah so yeah so that i guess that's the point that like when it comes to initially when it comes to working with the big institutional partners there's no way to really impact them directly um but yeah like when it comes to sort of allocating a lot of the the basically just a lot of the capital that's sitting in maker and i think in particular right now what's very pressing is all the usdc right then what i'm arguing for is that maker takes a mall instead of of today where the collateral onboarding process is sort of it's very it's just not very it's sort of reactive in a sense right so maker receives all these applications and then somehow tries to prioritize them and and somehow like figure out how to how to price the risk of every single one of them and this i mean first of all it's very psychotic and and and not very efficient to just consider sort of any type of proposal that's coming in but this another really big issue is just that like it's like maker is right now sort of set up to have to try to figure out how to really be an expert on literally any subject right like to sh receive any type of proposal and then actually know how should i price this which um it's not i mean either it's not it's just gonna go really really slowly or even worse maker would could to jump into all sorts of deals that the community just doesn't understand so what i'm you know so so one way to look at is this is just we really just basically need to like narrow down what are the areas where maker wants to kind of specialize and and actually know what it's doing um and that's where i think that that um when it comes to picking that anyway sort of then you you know you really should should pick um basically sustainability projects like uh sustainable energy production and i think primarily that's because um that's kind of it that creates that really helps with the brand right like it's a very you know it's very powerful if you're able to say this you know money back by clean energy you can sort of show it right you can can show people look what d5 can do is it can build this huge windmill right on all these this wind farm with 10 windmills right that they were actually funded through a computer program right that is programmed to basically fund these kind of things right and i think that that's that's um you know that's that's actually something that people understand can you know can impact the the global situation when it comes to climate unlike something like paper straws right which is sort of this corporate scam almost of like making people feel guilty but also being like yeah you this is not you know the world is ending and you're gonna be sitting there sipping on a paper straw right and it's not gonna do anything um and i think but yeah like i think like being able to sort of you know really showcase that ultimately it's just a coordination problem and we simply have we can we need to figure out a way to coordinate and we can do that through uh money right yeah and i was going to ask about that and so so like um you know narratives are so important in just for humanity but also especially maybe in the crypto space right now right so nascent right and so ethan's developed this ultrasound money type narrative a bit more recently right so you're talking about die as ultra clean money and developing out that narrative and my question is do you think that will be a demand catalyst for dye right you know it's certainly good for the crypto industry at large which i want to actually ask next but um do you think just people will want to hold and spend die because it has a positive social impact and reduces you know negative environmental externalities yeah i mean i just want to like first of all i come you're right i really agree that crypto has truly proven that attention and narrative and you know you know like the sort of you know well this is kind of the attention economy right it's like this is what drives everything especially sort of capitalism today right i mean you have examples like you know gamestop or something right showing that it's really that's what really matters and and all over the place in crypto right you just see it again and again and again that really it's the attention it's sort of the the um getting the the focus attention that that generates value uh in financial markets today right and um so already there i think it you know i think it it it's like a it's somewhat like a proven model you can actually think of like i mean arguably i think tesla's success and and the fact they became the the most uh you know valuable company in the world like so much of that was exactly that it was exactly this you know it was the the narrative of the altruism sort of the positive benefit to humanity that they create right more so than than i mean well rather the fact you know and the fact that it it it it combines with the business model itself and that just that's a very compelling thing right i mean that's the kind of that's a story that's the kind of story people want to hear right now right they want to hear some kind of realistic way that we can we can do this without having to sacrifice all sorts of you know sacrifice all sorts of stuff right and we've actually seen this uh play out in our world as well um when nfts took off a lot of people heard about ethereum for the first time and a lot of people started like boycotting nfts because ethereum is under proof of work and so we've actually already seen this impact our industry because people are decently motivated to align with their values and there's a decent amount of people out there that have the values of not destroying this planet due to climate change and in your in your post you actually cited that like uh this the same sort of reaction in 2008 we had a housing crisis due to the nature of the financial system the black box nature and as a result of that there was bitcoin was created and like people talk about this relationship between like well there was this massive problem that this financial system created and then the people of the world as a reaction to that created bitcoin we use that as a solution we're actually also seeing that same thing in defy where the current financial system is so closed so gated so unwelcoming that defy has been a reaction towards that permissioned financial world and one of the reasons why defy has been so successful is because people have been longing for something like d5 for so long as a reaction to how just closing gated the traditional financial system is and so i think there's room where if this is successful the the branding of dye as clean money the narrative of dye is clean money can be successful as a reaction to the rest of the world just completely ignoring this whole climate change thing um is that is that your take as well yeah i think i mean i have high hopes that uh i don't you know that this is a way to really drive people into crypto that you know right now just don't see the point because basically it's about money and money and money and money and not everyone cares about that right and being able to show look you can do more than can be about more than money right it doesn't have to be all yield thumbing and compounding interest and collateralizing something into a vault and then drawing uh you know you know doing going through 300 different smart contracts to get the most crazy yield you've ever seen right a lot of people they just that's just not you know that is doesn't it doesn't appeal to them it's not relevant to them but climate change is increasingly becoming sort of very relevant to to a lot of people around the world and i think i think there's some places where it's still sort of less so and you know i think um america is sort of unique in that i don't think climate change is nearly as much on the agenda there as it is you know in other places i mean i'm from a country that's literally it's just gonna disappear you know like it's actually it's it's gonna go underwater the you know denmark which is kind of you know there's a there's a big difference between uh you know like how much people how close is this to people but i remember seeing this there's this recent study um where basically some scientists went out and asked a bunch of young people what they think of climate change and it was like mall and half said the world is doomed you know so there's a lot of and there's this sort of dumerism that's happening today right that is actually very it's causing a lot of personal stress sort of to a lot of people right and what i'm i'm really hoping is that we can we can basically use d fighters or rally the people that today believe that we have to just give up basically we can't even do anything we should go out there and we should should tell them that look we do have this one thing called defy which allows us to control some you know a little thing called money which is actually like the thing that makes everything work and and act right and is you know in some ways you could say it's the you know it's money it's the way money flows around the economy that's directly what's causing uh the coordination problem in the first place um but you know like what's kind of um like something that's kind of built into the plan i guess you can say is a sort of a hedge as well where we just don't i mean there's a good chance it's just not you know maybe maybe um people just don't care and it's just still too bad you know money and finance is too boring people don't care it doesn't even matter if it's clean whatever it is you know they're just get too focused on on whatever their tick tock or something right and uh and people just don't care and like and if that's the case the thing is like the less sort of climate action that's out there let's let's say the less excitement and sort of the less adoption of manga there is based on on that climate message and there's a rallying cry for for climate solidarity um the greater climate alpha will be right so we make a console get to benefit from from both of the outcomes in a sense like either mega will grow significantly because it's it's uh it sort of manages to to tap into this zeitgeist and bring you know thousands of people into blockchain maybe the whole world becomes powered by blockchain as as the way to to you know overcome the transition away from from fossil fuels or the other option is that the world basically ends and maker was was very early to to buy up all the you know the good assets basically um and and yeah you know it's it's a it's unlikely but you know you could it's possible to imagine a future where no other currency manages to really sort of hedge against the just how bad things will get and you'll end up with like makers like this ultimate currency that just happens to be diversified across the the um you know the the places that remain as very uh stable economies um and that's this is very long-term thinking sir and i and i love that because it sort of fits the the motif of make it from the general direction i mean you know two other things i love one this kind of flips the narrative at least in the u.s we've seen senators like elizabeth warren come out against cryptocurrency and say it's energy intensive it's wasteful right well now we have a flipping of the narrative potentially ethereum transitioning to proof-of-stake right also projects like maker doubt maybe putting a flag in the ground and saying hey we're going to be clean energy right this is going to be like esg friendly environmentally friendly uh currency you also see projects like david talked to a project called klimadow doing a little something on this too and i feel like this totally disarms them and totally flips the narrative right uh in among politicians and their support for this system rather than bitcoin proof of work which they've seen for the last 10 years we've got like an ethereum system that consumes very little energy almost nothing and also we are actively improving you know the climate in all of these various ways so that's super exciting the second thing that i think is kind of maybe unique to ethereum culture right now which i absolutely love is i feel like very much bitcoin culture is a bit more like that new zealand bunker that you were talking about early earlier right it's like where's my bitcoin citadel right i'm just gonna like buy up the citadel with all the bitcoin i've hauled it that's gone to the moon and i'm gonna wait for the world to burn because it's gonna burn whereas the ethereum ethos is like hey we don't want the world to burn we have these coordination tools and this coordination technology we can be an active part of the solution of putting out the fires and make sure the world doesn't go to hell like that to me is um incredibly important and something that i see in ethereum culture particularly the past few years that is like completely a 180 difference than you know previous bitcoin maximalist type culture we don't want citadels we want like solar punks you know solar punk cities that's what we're aiming for and i think that's awesome so plus one on that sir and i hope other d5 projects start to explore this area i think it's fertile ground um anything else you want to say on that i've got one last question around your post and this is in respect to uh new tokenomics for maker that you also kind of propose we don't have time to get into all the details because i know that's a huge thing to unwrap but um you know tie off anything else you want to say about clean money and then tell us give us a sneak peek just some quick bullet points on what some of the new tokenomics behind maker might look like in in the maybe medium to you know future the thing that you're proposing anyway yeah so well i mean i'm a i'm a huge fan of like clean it out and and now there's a whole range of extremely innovative um climate focus focused blockchain projects out there uh that i think is i mean that's it's kind of like it's just happening and now they're really starting to pop up which is probably related to basically the the trajectory of the climate as we now sort of experience it um but you know i think that there's huge synergy between many of these different like climate aligned projects and the the best possible example is klima dow uh and then sort of the the clean money direction of maker because basically maker is is really like what what i'm proposing is that maker really focuses on sort of building out the infrastructure needed uh in a in sort of a decarbonized world right and what climate is really focusing on is basically trying to to sort of incentivize people to do that in a sense so there's actually this really interesting synergy where the kind of of um of assets and the kind of collateral that maker would want to would would um uh put money into what in in in sort of creating clean money would be would be exactly the kind of assets that massively benefit from a higher carbon price in the carbon trading systems which actually claimed i always is uh going to contribute towards so yeah i'm uh i think i mean i'm both i'm really excited about that probably specifically because i just love the idea of putting like crazy tokenomics and then just putting them towards a good purpose i feel like that's the that's really that's the way to do it basically so i love that and then also the fact that they're just i mean it's i think it reveals something about it actually goes all the way back to sort of the coordination coordination problem and this question of like you know focusing on yourself working together and how when people are aligned around this kind of common goal it's just very it's very natural that you would have all these synergies would emerge from doing that right so i i plan to to just research a lot more on the various um initiatives out there and try to figure out how maker can really tap into and sort of collaborate with those projects which is often the case will make it right because one thing we really can do is uh use other other assets as collateral for instance and that's a very sort of obvious way to to synergize and yeah like i mean yeah i basically can't i don't think i can really get too much into the tokenomics basically because that's like its own crazy uh topic and we've been going on for a while like two hours now so but but the basic idea is that i don't you know buy and burn is like pro possibly the oldest ergonomics ever basically and i think it has some like it has some um that just has a bunch of downsides that one really obvious downside that i'm i think is very bad is if the price of mkr is very high it kind of buy and burn will just waste money by sort of buying the top right which is i really dislike the specific characteristic because like there's no it's not even like a you know we're not even talking about something that's rational to do but just looks bad to the market we're talking about something straight up not very rational it's just not a very good idea to be buying and burning uh tokens if the price is high basically um but more importantly it's just d5 has really created this tremendous innovation um and and uh i think you know and i was basically you know i just think that it's time for maker to to try to tap into that and so i came up with a system where the idea is basically to incentivize people to lock up their mkr tokens for a very long time and then get an ability to directly borrow die at preferential terms from the system when they do this which sort of would feel like a like a dividend type of cash flow right where you're just getting getting cash continuously but the difference is it's actually you're borrowing money from the system with your mkr you're not actually getting that money um and yeah just there's a lot of implications of that but i i think i think basically that's based on everything i've studied and learned from the dfi ecosystem this is like the most powerful tokenomics engine that is entirely set up to focus on basically long-term thinking and long-term community participation and and that's what i love about like to economics right is that you can actually code economic interactions and and monitor you know cash flows and have them directly affect human behavior which i think is you know that's the kind of stuff we need to tap into if we're going to try to you know turn the ship around with regards to the global climate change and you know broken financial systems and all of that right so so i'm very excited to dive into that that is super cool i think people forget that you know tokens and d5 projects can actually change their token economics and actually can improve their token economics and if listeners want to find out a bit more about what roon is proposing on the governance forms it's under the title sagittarius i believe and you can check that out for yourself but roone uh it's it's been a pleasure to have you and we've really enjoyed this conversation and we've covered so much uh i know you're very clearly a deep thinker you've got a lot of wisdom for us you're a defy og so i want to kind of close with this question what do you think of everything that's going on in d5 and nfts today do you have any hot takes for us do you have any advice for some of the early projects or the users just anything you would leave our listeners with um i i mean i think that uh i've come around to this idea of the the super cycle right that there is really is this um you know we're seeing this small mainstream type of adoption into crypto um so i think it's like now is the time to really be being crypto basically and and not ignore it and like i mean nfts is something where i mean i just didn't get it and i really you know i also didn't get all the modern defy and all the tokenomics and sort of all these things i was basically like the boomer that just you know didn't get it and sort of thought it was gonna it was gonna fade up fade away but but i think there's really been you know there's some fundamental value and some real sort of powerful potential that's being uncovered here that like i don't think that so the industry really knows exactly what it is yet and and uh once we figure that out that's gonna be kind of the i guess the dot-com bubble moment and so the post dot com bubble uh era will be basically when when we sort of get you know the real understanding of what is it that actually makes nfts valuable for instance and what is it that actually makes the you know tokenomics be beneficial to real projects rather than being sort of party schemes right and uh yeah it's it's um it's it's just so incredibly complex and mind-blowing what is what has occurred now that i you know that that you it's every you know it takes you you really need to sort of study a lot and and pay a lot of attention and uh be very critical i think to to not fall into some sort of trap when inevitably there there's a lot of uh whatever a new bubble or whatever it's going to happen next absolutely well rooney christensen we will end it there it's been a pleasure to have you on bank list thanks for joining us for this conversation
