[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is your weekly recap and i am joined by the one and only zenika for another moment of zenika episode this one's got a little twist to it we are going to be joined by brendan mulligan founder at pre-mint about halfway through this show so we can really break down hacks what's been happening with hacks lately how to avoid them folks probably are familiar with the fact that zenika was hacked recently his personal twitter account was hacked pre-mint was also hacked recently uh from the business itself so we're gonna talk about how those each happened how we can stay safe out there and really just get into both of your experiences with this so it's a little bit of a special episode but we are going to start just talking about the news of the week seneca thank you so much for joining as always thank you so much for having me as always we're going to talk about macro merge verge purge splurge the currency mint window closed we you and i had a bet there so we got to see how that played out dolly is a is a cool technology i think we need to talk about it's relevant to our industry before we get into all that we do need to hear a word from our lovely sponsors immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9 000 transactions per second an instant transaction confirmation no more gas fees no more waiting around for your transaction to clear immutable's zero knowledge roll up finally unlocks the world of crypto gaming immutable x is the only gas free nft minting platform with over 26 million nfts minted all with zero gas fees with the power of immutable gaming developers don't also need to become smart contract developers they just need to plug in to immutable's api and instantly start unlocking the full potential of crypto assets inside of games this is why world class companies and projects have decided to deploy on immutable acts like gamestop ember sword planet quest eluvium tic toc and many more behind the scenes so start building your game on immutable x two day at immutable.com there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets all right let's start where we we usually start which is macro update what's happening in the map the market right now what are you seeing what are you tracking yeah so crypto generally is going boom like today the day we're recording it's i think we just hit 17 1700 yep 17 30 was right before i checked so yeah we've sort of been i mean yeah we're up over double from from the local lows of 8 900 and crypto great but nfts are i think still struggling quite a bit um you know historically people always ask you know if crypt goes up or down is is our correlation to nfts and i think that there's not a super strong correlation because we've seen every scenario multiple times and it kind of seems like what we're seeing now is crypto going up and nfts are going down or at least sideways for the most part nft volume is still really really really low so i think that's a really important indicator and metric well and isn't it really it's not about the the price of eth it's more that when it's volatile and when it and when there's price movement on yes people are more reticent to spend it it feels like right like when the price of eat is going up people don't want to spend their eat eth and so that's when you see nft volume decline because there's just more volatility on the crypto side it's the stability of crypto that helps nfts regardless of where the price price is specifically yeah i generally very much agree with that and so uh and it works both ways as well like when uh not only are people not wanting to spend when ether's pumping people think oh uh is eighth going to go to 5k is it going to 10k i want to like and people like maybe try to stack some eath uh when that's happening so we're seeing a bit of that at the moment market is generally like nft market is generally bearish i would say still um not not too many new projects coming out and performing tremendously well or anything like that uh the blue chips are like more or less holding up i mean i think i would say they're slowly bleeding like apes are down to like the 85 range doodles are like 10-ish uh i think we saw single-digit doodles suzuki clonex even um for a while which we haven't seen in ages um yeah even generative art you know they had their moment art blocks was going crazy a few weeks ago uh it has since calmed down a lot and to a more healthy level it was it was really frothy for a while and uh the last two curators i think we saw a lot of people come in and like mint at a really high price and you know they for lack of a better word gotten wrecked because the the secondary market has not held up and now it's below mint for the last two drops uh just generally like yeah people are holding on to the ethan liquidity is a little low but um who knows today is is an exciting day because crypto is pumping so you never know maybe people's um excitement comes back and you bought an art blocks piece recently i saw you crowing about it on on twitter so you're still you're your position has not changed buying up art blocks like the zenica we all know and love [Laughter] yeah to be fair i i've i've i listed and sold a few over the last uh month or so just not to like necessarily like take profit and and leave out blocks but i just want to like sell certain yeah so like when you sell out blocks the rule is then you buy more art blocks with it so i like i have too many of certain things and i want more of other things i'm like selling to relocate and then yeah i yeah i still love it obviously well unlikely in recognition that we were in a really frothy moment for a couple weeks of our blocks which i i i'm almost positive you and i talked about when we talked about art blocks a couple of weeks ago it was evident right i interviewed um sofro during that time i'm pretty sure he even alluded to that and made it pretty clear things were feeling frothy to him you know remember like elon musk being like tesla's overvalued like a couple years ago and it's like when you have like the ceo of these companies saying that you may want to uh slow your roll on on your buying at that moment um and i i had been waiting for things to cool down for me to really dive in and um yeah i i want to get into art blocks i need to do it it's it's a priority but when it's so crazy like that it's like well there's there's no point in trying to get in right now because everything's uh inevitably going to come down plenty of time i got i got decades right this is where we're looking long time horizons for this stuff um well while we're talking about generative art let's maybe not that's not the smoothest segue for this but let's talk about dolly have you been tracking the dolly situation should i give the the quick context overview for folks and then get your thoughts give the quick context here so for anybody who hasn't been tracking this though i i imagine many listeners of the show are are somewhat familiar um dolly is a project it's dolly two that just came out it's basically the second iteration of this code i guess um is a project by openai which is a non-profit that does a lot of ai research i think reed hoffman is one of the lead like funders of this program and dolly is a text to art ai program so you type in something that you want to see and then it creates the image of it and this runs the gamut from actually some beautiful looking art pieces to like really ridiculous things and of course it's just like been this is demonstrated the creativity of the internet like i was looking at some of the funniest uh dolly images and it's like paddington bear on trial for murder right like that like somebody had like typed that into dolly too and an image was produced i mean it's a weird image but it does you it see it resembles that right you can tell it's paddington bear and he's clearly in a courtroom and so it's pretty incredible uh the the level of specificity you can give this program and come up with something that is at least recognizable most of it's pretty bizarre looking but you can recognize what it is and that's uh that's impressive so uh thoughts on this have you been tracking it much i've been it's been in my periphery i haven't been like actively following it i haven't used it myself but yeah it's impossible not to if you're in the space if you're on the internet like people on social media are posting images like that and and funny things and also beautiful things uh i find it fascinating and and there's been like a more of a discussion i think in the nft space about you know is ai art art can you consider that art can you be an artist creating ai art and it's really interesting to think about um does anyone who types an input in and have the ai spit something out at least are they an artist or are they just using something and i the way i'm sort of approaching it is i think that there are artists who utilize ar technology to create art and claire silver is one such example and the way the way i sort of think about it is it's like similar to cameras and phones and photography everyone has a phone now everyone can go out and take photos doesn't mean everyone's a photographer or an artist who you know specializes in photography i think um the potential is there but it's about a lot more than just you know pointing and clicking it's about more than just typing a phrase in and clicking submit it's about intentionality and um i ideas and and a bunch more stuff uh it does get tricky when you when you break it down but uh it's very fascinating at the very least yeah yeah i also think i generally believe that gosh it's such a it gets so tricky right but like what i was gonna get at is is there craft behind something like is there a skill set to learn and develop and work on and do the like dedicated practicing each day like that that was one of the aha moments for me with generative art or with like with art block style art was really to understand there's a a real craft to getting the code right and then there's obviously cases not necessarily with art blocks but where the code will interact with real art i know tyler hobbs did that prior to art blocks he would have part part kind of art he made and then art he generated through uh code and um in in general i do think there should be the requirement of like craft and practice and honing your skills and day in day out like that discipline for something to to for you to really be an artist you i think posted was it you who posted the quiz on or like the the poll on twitter saying like if you can anyone be an artist if you think of yourself as somebody who's making art are you an artist like what is the barrier to being an artist have you did what were the reactions you got to that post i can't remember [Laughter] um if you tweet too much i remember what the poll results were yeah i um i'm pretty sure it was like overwhelmingly so uh i don't know exactly what i wrote but like the general result was like 85 to 15 um if i'm remembering correctly and basically the the consensus was that no not anyone who uses ai to create something is an artist not everyone who draws is an artist um that there is a distinction and a differentiation and and i think you can personally feel like an artist or have a love for art and like you can use that term loosely in that way but there does need to be a distinction for like a professional artist we need to take that craft seriously and and understand that it is uh it is a real craft and that's part of the monetization stuff like that that's why we should pay for art that's why we should expect artists to get paid because there is a tremendous amount of work that goes into that and so that distinction between like you can loosely use the term you can think of yourself as an artist and enjoy making art and that's all well and good but uh but not devalue the work of really professional artists i just found the tweet and i said uh it was two-part question first was like what's your definition of an artist and a bunch of people replied and then the poll question was can you create art without being an artist and 85 people said yes um which i think i agree with that as well like i can draw some stick figures i can draw something and it's ostensibly it's art like it might not be good art it's very much not good art but it is art and uh but i wouldn't say i'm an artist but then you know some people say well we're all artists we all have that creative gene that creative aspect is just different and it it really is an interesting thing to think about but yeah i yeah really you just get into like nuance i think it'll be interesting to see what programs like dolly do to the field of graphic design for example like artists will always have a place they'll always be this artist has a story this artist is pushing boundaries this artist is xyz that will create value for an artist's work in my opinion but where i think this ai art stuff lands is oh i need a thumbnail graphic for my podcast right now i we have a graphic designer we work with to do that but like easy to imagine in x number of years i'm just typing that into an ai program that spits out at me the image whatever that i need for my podcast and that's actually where i think the opportunity here is um is interesting uh and yeah that's a really good point uh uh you know arguably scary i don't know technology always does this right there are certain jobs it takes away and then as a result there's jobs it creates and but but that's the the where i think this will get really interesting in the down the line uh before we move on from the topic of art and art blocks which we're sort of still on um i sh we should plug your your in peak presentation you you get you did like a mastering art blocks lecture of some sort for in peak which are friends so me it's her platform so want to shout out in peak and so me and i will watch your if i can it's still up i'm imagining i can go watch yeah i think i think it's up i think it's free for everyone uh go watch your mastering art blocks you've tweeted about it we'll include it in the show notes here and uh love it okay news out of ethe cc whatever eath eat ccc right whatever conference every every week there's another eat something overwhelming in paris vitalik was there and he said this is what i found most interesting ethereum is about 40 complete right now after the merge which is expected to happen in september uh eth will be about 55 complete ethereum will be 55 complete after the merge we will have the verge the purge and the splurge and the surge and the oh the surge oh there is the surge not the verge wait yes it's merge surge verge purge splurge honestly there's so many and it's it's why we love vitality this is why we love italian he's literally you know the the brains or what like one of the brains behind this massive worldwide thing it's going to change the world it has and he's just having fun and memeing with names in his pyjamas and funny socks it's like and also one of those remarkably thoughtful people where he's not chiefly motivated by money i think that's clear if you really spend time reading him and understanding him so that like he's genuinely motivated by improving the world and he's very thoughtful about that and he can recognize nuance and grapple with nuance and like he's just such a figure that i trust because nobody's going to bat a thousand and most decisions have negative consequences like if you're out of fork in the road there's no perfect decision to be made so with the leaders in the world i feel this way about political leaders i feel this way across the board like you you really are just shooting for somebody who you genuinely think generally think has good judgment and is going to act on their conscience knowing that yeah they're still going to make decisions that are imperfect because every decision is going to be imperfect that's exactly how i feel about vitalik is like i'm like i i so believe in your intentions and your brain that i i feel so grateful to have him as a leader in in the world a hundred percent it's people always talk about betting on people and and like as the most important thing and i live and die by that as well and like two people i bet the most on and believe the most in vitalik and snowfro so that's why with art blocks on ethereum it's like how can you go wrong with with and there's so many similarities between between the two of them just like they're they're thoughtful conscientious smart and and want to do good in the world and i think that um there's many more other people out there that out there um but yeah just a general good life rulers find people like that and you know um snowfall was incredibly kind like like really incredibly kind yeah i don't know vitalik so i can't speak to it but he literally like my heart swells every time i see him in interviews my heart just swells yeah like he's just the sweetest um i'll break this down real quick not being an expert on this side of things but you're right i missed the surge so we have we have merged which we know is happening in september that's when we moved to proof of stake it's merging ethereum main net to the the beacon chain which is the proof of stake chain uh the surge is when we're gonna get sharding the expectation here is that the combination of um the move to proof of well i guess it moved to proof of stake really shouldn't i guess have so much to do with this but but like with l2s and with sharding we should get to about a hundred thousand transactions per second on ethereum that's what vitalik is saying which is crazy we're currently at 10 to 15 transactions not 10 to 15 000 10 00. 10 to 15 period yeah this he believes will get us to a hundred thousand transactions per second this is honestly why i i'm not an ethmaxy but but maybe i'm an east backseat yeah i had somebody asked me on twitter the other day why i'm negative on flow and and i think that stems from the fact that i've been uh kind of critical of the idea of doodles moving to flow and it's not because i have anything against flow and i actually think they've done huge things for the space and i'm grateful for them um but when i look at how crypto scales i feel like i have a really clear understanding of how that works with ethereum and i think people don't fully understand it yet but i think i see that roadmap and again i trust vitalik in in taking us to that roadmap and i don't have a clear sense of how we get really safe and secure cross-chain bridging not that i think it's an impossible task i just i don't seem to see as much progress there or i don't seem to see a clear road map there the way i see around ethereum scaling to degrees that feel like they could get us where we want when you think of l2s l3s sharding um and the rest of it so i don't know if you have thoughts on that but no i mean i i agree completely and i think uh yeah we trust we love italic as well and i just want to also mention that like it's not just vitalik obviously it's like if something were god forbid to happen and he's unable to continue working on ethereum there are tremendous like the brightest minds and like the the hardest like there's so many people who've been working on this it really truly is decentralized and it will just continue and that's like since day one basically been the goal and and the ethos of like obviously it's not fully decentralized that there's a lot of power and and stuff in the hands of a few that's with every chain it is um as decentralized as you get when it comes to a um smart chain uh sorry a blockchain that has smart contracts and apps and and compared to all the all the alternatives it's uh yeah yeah and that's where the surge which is the sharding component of this also should make it easier for validators for more validators to run nodes it sort of bifurcates the nodes into these shards again not not technical here i won't uh pretend to be but that should help with decentralization the verge gets into vertical trees which i really you're starting to really get above my head here but similarly he says should help with the decentralization piece make it that much easier for that many more validators to come and secure the network that increases the decentralization of the whole thing the purge is getting rid of some historical archival whatever data within the ethereum network which should like lessen the amount of memory if you're uh you know running a node etc you it's purging some of the data that's unnecessary now again whatever i'm conceptually getting this right and then the splurge he said is all the other fun stuff [Laughter] so [Music] i don't know what that means but i i look forward to getting there i'm looking forward to it yeah and again i it all makes me very bullish on ethereum knock on wood do you think the price pumps that we're seeing with ethereum recently have more to do with macro environment stuff like the rate hikes and you know the fed seeming to take inflation seriously and and and uh that making people more optimistic and and people are pricing in future rate hikes or do you think it has more to do with the merge coming up uh definitely both uh it's hard to say which which it has more to do with i will say that i'm hearing a lot more people talk about the merge than even a month ago let alone before that because i think now people are saying really realizing oh it is actually happening now it is like and again no who knows it could be delays and delays um we've been here before but like it's coming up really soon all the signs looking good and so because more people are talking about it i've heard and seen so many people who are like relatively new to this whole ecosystem go oh what is the merge what is this merge what is it and so i think there's still a large percentage of people who have no idea what it is and what it's going to do and i think that is that is really bullish and that's what makes me think it's not it hasn't been priced in for a large part um yeah so a bit of both for sure i've recommended this in the past i'll recommend it again uh there is a bankless episode called why i'm betting the fund on the merge and it's hal i believe is the man's name i don't remember his last name uh who runs a hedge fund or whatever some equivalent style i invest money for a living thing and he was making some really big bets on the future price of ethereum uh based on how he feels like the merge and moving proof of stake changes the dynamics of ethereum in a way that are very bullish for ethereum i won't get into all of it now but if you're looking to understand the merge better take aside like the investment you know decisions he's making and listen to his fundamental breakdown of why this makes him bullish on ethereum i think it was a it's an awesome episode that really helps you understand the merge better uh so we'll link to that as well dave remind me to give you that link if i haven't by the time you start editing this um okay we're gonna have brendan joining here quickly or in short order so maybe just to close on an article you wrote this past week called unrealistic expectations and i think this was really i'm sorry impossible expectations ah dang sorry man that's an impossible actually the concept is the concept is unrealistic expectations okay yeah i was i was capturing the spirit i was capturing the spirit of the piece impossible expectations great article it was in some ways a follow-up to your infinite regret article of like how hard it is to be a traitor in this space and the the impossible expectations article is coming at it more from a founder perspective this gets us into we can kind of talk about this in the context of oddities and uh some of the fluffle that that was happening around oddities this past week do you want to break down that situation a little bit and your your thesis of of impossible expectations yeah so i mean just in a nutshell impossible expectations is just about the idea and concept of how un like it it literally is impossible for projects and founders to live up to the expectations of the community because the community quote unquote is made up with such a diverse group of participants and say like let's use oddities for an example these were airdropped for free two moon bird holders so a lot of moon bird holders have a cost basis of zero but then people were buying them for three eth for eath on the secondary market so then now all of a sudden you have two very different um parties with different interests you know buying in it at 40th versus free and then you have people who have different reasons for wanting to be part like to hold one of these oddities some people were trying to flip it some people were trying to uh thinking of it as an investment vehicle and but like with a one year time horizon other people were buying simply because they wanted the art they loved gremlin the artist other people were buying to be part of the proof ecosystem and so trying to please and cater to all these different it's impossible someone is always going to be unhappy with your decision or the outcome and that's basically what happened with oddities i you know there were so many people who said oh i bought it for eth and and you know the price is tanking this is not what i expected for starters i would say anyone who was disappointed or didn't like the art uh i have nothing like i can't help you because like go and look at gremlins art he's an artist this is very stylistic in his style look at cryptos if this wasn't i don't know what you were expecting and so like that i can't help you the art i think i personally is great but i do understand it's not for everyone um but then people there were just somewhat valid concerns about like better communication that they wanted for understanding the utility um the the trait mapping to moonbirds and how that all worked out uh but but the cusp of it is there's people who have been thrilled with their oddities and are happy and then there's thrilled people who are very unhappy and it's impossible to get it right yeah i'm i'm so with you on when i see people being like 25 eth for a thing and you gave me a fanny pack and it's like you didn't buy the team didn't sell it to you for 25 either we got brendan joining here so we'll wrap this up um but yeah appreciate your articles annika we will uh make sure it's shared out folks can read it and with that let's move on to security hacking pre-mint brendan mulligan welcome to overpriced jpegs thank you for having me i wish it was on better terms yeah it's an important conversation to have i think that you in many ways brendan i think are being a really awesome vocal voice that is actually going to push this space in a better direction this is even pre-dating by a couple of days the pre-med hack i think it's so funny to to you tweeted about the uh what's i always have to forget the exact the set approval for all requests which i want to talk about talk about what that is explain that to folks about how metamask does not have enough precautions for people who end up accidentally signing off on a set approval for all requests and then like two days later it was relevant in the pre-med hack yeah i think it was actually 12 hours later it was remarkably close incredible well what why don't we start here and just explaining to folks what happened in each year cases i thought it was interesting to have the two of you on here to talk about this seneca was coming on today anyway zenika was personally hacked brendan your business was hacked so you know similar situation but but slightly different perspectives on it can we just break down how each of these happened i'll start with zenica because i think it's simpler which is do we yet know how how this hack happened uh no i'm not i haven't 100 gotten to the bottom of it so basically what happened was my my personal twitter account got hacked compromised um someone gained access to it changed the password all that kind of stuff and started posting malicious links i had two-factor authorization on using google to face google authenticator which is it's a lot safer than like the the sim just like a text message yeah right because people there's a you can get sim swapped relatively easily um so i haven't fully gotten to the bottom of it to my mind there's two potential ways that happen i mean there might be other ones one is i was fished somehow and and someone got uh i think there's like an override code or a one-time password code to either google 2fa or twitter or something like that and again like i i don't know like maybe when i set things up a year ago 18 months ago i stored it on my computer or two years ago three years ago i don't know and someone gained access to one of my devices and from there could find this code i've looked for it and i don't know where it is and or in like recent times someone made me click on something and but again nothing is coming to mind i've thought back over my actions and again that is one possibility i would say a small percentage chance and the other is there's some sort of compromise on the twitter level whether it's someone at twitter is doing something they shouldn't be or like one of their internal things is like compromised or there's an exploit that someone can gain access to that um both seem very unlikely though to me so uh i mean that one it's like if that was the case surely bigger accounts would be like even bigger accounts would be getting hit and stuff like that so um at the end of the day i don't know exactly how it happened i'm still looking yeah about 24 hours before you were hacked hugo labs tweeted out that their security team had been tracking efforts to pro they thought a coordinated attack might be coming on people have you talked to anybody on the hugo lab security team it seems like they might have some insight into how these things were going to be done or by who i reached out and uh i haven't heard back i i suspect that they don't want to say much just because you know the more gets out showing what they say yeah right it's like it's a um uh what's the word arms race where it's like you know back and forth between the hackers and then yeah defenders the defenders brendan explain the the pre-mint hack for us it was a little uh simpler because it was in our infrastructure and ultimately it was um you know for better for worse it was just a couple we use a lot of software uses third-party plug-ins to power different things on the site right when you're building software you very rarely does the company write 100 of the code themselves they use open source plugins and so one of the plugins we had had a vulnerability that um that we didn't know about and actually hadn't been reported yet so um so we reported that to the company but someone was able to basically use that to put a file on our server that that they shouldn't have been able to put the reason they were able to do that also was like um a misconfigured amazon setting so like we we just say it's on us but there's so there's a lot of ways but like ultimately like we could have done better which is why we took a little bit more ownership of it we you know yes we used an open source thing but like we should you know ultimately it was on our our thing so they basically were able to put code on our site that referenced code off our site and then the code there as soon as they did that then they were able to basically write whatever they wanted to write on their own server and our our site was calling it um got the list of things that we have changed since two weeks ago to make sure that this like you know it was just you know it's things have obviously freeman's grown a lot over the past four months and we just it was one of those areas that we we a little bit of a blind spot for us so um but that basically let them pop up a metamatch dialogue on our domain name that you know and they masked it by saying like it was a new premium feature for super secure wallet or whatever and that was asking the user to set approval for all and basically then allowed them to drain the wallets and so it started around 1am ish uh pacific time and it only ran for about i think about an hour and a half to two hours i can't remember don't quote me or there there's definite data that we have i just can't remember right now but it was a couple hours and like word spread so quickly through the community uh and like the the accounts that were being they were doing it were flagged on ether scan or not open c that they just stopped um i mean they were able to get a lot but like they they didn't continue uh doing it because no one was really falling for it anymore so and and both of you had that experience with the community which maybe we'll talk a little bit about but brendan would love for you to explain if you can like what does the set approval for all why is that so integral to so many of these hacks why is that necessary and how can you tell if you're signing one of these transactions yeah so it is a valuable setting in some cases and this is the unfortunate thing is like i took like sort of a crass um approach to the whole thing that said like if this setting is being requested the whole metamask should be read and should there should be alarms going off but like it's actually necessary to sell things on openc and on marketplaces so i do think that there are places that this setting is useful um my personal belief is it's a small enough number of places that you should maybe apply to metamask for an exception for the setting to not be scary but whatever um basically what it does is it allows when you accept the transaction which does come with gas so you know that something is weird going on if you're not supposed to be buying anything but you're being asked to spend gas that generally means like um you're probably signing something that you shouldn't but um it essentially is giving the wallet or a contract permission to take assets to basically act on your behalf to move assets around that that are in your wallet and so what happens is they generally will give some a wallet access to you know you it can say like oh you can take my board ape and you can do whatever you want with it and so that's generally it's mechanically sometimes you're doing it giving a contract permission to do it other times for us it was a wallet that you're giving access to basically act on your path and move stuff around but as soon as you give that access that wallet can then just start moving stuff out of your moving stuff out of your wallet as we know so set approval for all really meaning like i'm giving you approval for all of the stuff in this wallet like that's the all that it's referring to essentially well and you're not saying like you can transfer this one particular token you're saying like it's sort of like an open season type thing um which again this is really useful on places like open c and on looks rare and magic eden all the places why because you know you're you're uh if you want to sell something in openc you need to give them permission to take it out of your wallet and give it to the person that bought it like you you put your you know doodle up for 20 eve if someone wants to buy it you might be asleep so openc needs permission to be able to take the doodle out of your wallet and give it to the buyer but couldn't there be a function that says i give you permission for this one particular asset and it would it wouldn't apply to all of the assets in that wallet yes i guess you could do that you would have to pay gas every time you wanted to sell an asset on openc so like an opencv you want to sell a doodle you have to basically say i'm giving openc permission to sell my doodles like you're basically giving access to the for them to move that contract anything out of that contract and so you don't have to do it every single time i guess in theory openc could ask you to to do it on a i'd actually don't know how if this would work but in theory yes um but it for a lot of people who do a lot of trading it'd probably be really inconvenient they probably that they're always being charged gas because you're having to pay gas for not actually a transfer just the permission to do this so just the permission for openc to do it it's not even okay so it does seem like what you were suggesting earlier which is that like clearly there are exceptions you can quickly apply to show the legitimate use case that you have to be an exception and then otherwise there should be a bit of a glaring light here if you're signing a transaction that that says this are there other ways you pointed out okay great if i am paying gas in a scenario that seems like it's an odd scenario for me to be paying gas that's a red flag are there other places can i see there in that metamask transaction somewhere that it says said approval for all or there's there's really no other indication to me that this is what i'm doing there's a tiny little like gray box on the gray background with grey text that's great that's really helpful i think for for for metamask um credit like when i started talking about the the ceo or who i don't know how their company is structured but the person someone in charge was like hey we're making some improvements here i still don't think the improvements are gonna be that helpful for people who don't really get it and most of people who get phished in this way are not like experts who have read the documentation on what all this means which is why i think we need to be a little bit have more of a glaring warning but they are making improvements they know it's a problem have they provided any explanation as to why why they're not making bolder protections against it or boulder i always hear is that like there are legitimate reasons why you would want to do it and and i don't know if it's there like worried that if on openc when you went to do this and you saw a red thing people would stop doing it on openc and that would i mean openc is obviously like a big part of our industry and so i i don't know i i take a different approach to a lot of the stuff i just feel like they should make it like scary as hell and then figure out the list of 100 places where it shouldn't be scary and then on those places not show the red screen it i feel like it's a manageable amount of destinations that that that would be a net positive for the industry as long as you know as long as i thought through it at a time but i also don't know the open the metamask team i don't all you know i don't know how any of it works yeah well it is such a like i don't know pimple on the face of our industry these kinds of scams because it is the single biggest thing you hear reference frankly by critics it's just like it's all a scam it's a scam it's a scam so every time you have these scams it is like delaying the adoption of technology by like x number of months or years or whatever it feels like it needs to be such an all hands on deck thing to solve that i i'm inclined to agree with you brandon of like whatever the cost on the other side is it's funny because um i actually had a presentation i did the week before the hack that that i was going to do the week after and we kind of did some of it yesterday but we've been thinking a lot about security because this isn't the first time that people have used pre-med in like kind of a creepy ways right some someone can put a project up and like run a premium that ends up being a wallet drainer but that happens on their own website and so we've been trying to work on it but when you really look at kind of what you're saying is like when you look at all of the vectors whether it's seneca's twitter account whether it's the me six hack on discord whether it's the preeminent thing it all ends up at the same place which is wallet yes access for all right you know set approval and a wallet connection is like every one of the attack factors has to end there for a scam to happen so the nice thing is if we can fix that then it kind of isn't as big of a deal if you click links and discord right it does but like everyone's doing i mean we've done so much work to protect like we have so many warnings about you're about to click a link when you click this link if this happens wherever you go be careful and like we just bought vulcan and where the whole vulcan acquisition is around like getting rid of people having to leave discord at all like but it's like everyone's trying to protect essentially everyone ending up at the same destination be way easier if the destination just made it harder for scams to happen but is that any thoughts on your end on on that yeah no i agree completely i think that that is the the the bottleneck point that we should be like at the end of it all these hacks and scams occur but it comes down to the individual at that point having to sign a transaction to give someone else or some contract access uh and i think that we need two things to sort of improve and and hand in hand one is education and awareness so people can get a better understanding of what they're signing what they're doing but probably more importantly is infrastructure improvements so like you know metamask warnings or third-party apps we've seen a bunch of these chrome extensions come up which now will if you're going to sign something that's likely to be a wallet trainer they'll warn you and obviously there's there's risk installing a chrome extensions that it's nothing is perfect and metamask natively doing it would be more ideal but people are working on on systems to try and help at that level because again the the average user average participant uh especially going forward is not going to have a level of tech uh technological sophistication like the people who are in the space here and now are probably like in that small percentage of people who are fairly technically sophisticated and have the um desire and inclination to like do some research and set up a wallet when it's all it's already difficult to set up a wallet and and let alone like my 90 year old grandma my seven-year-old niece i keep saying like they're never gonna yeah we need things to protect them and and to have the infrastructure set up so that they can use blockchain technology safely yeah also to piggyback on that i think you know a lot of people say like well metamask is you know not the best solution there's there's a great app called zengo that people have been telling me about that actually does this if you're doing a set of approval for all it's a wallet that actually has warnings i think it's called sengo again it's been a long couple weeks so i might have that wrong but there's chrome extensions um there's a company called sunrise that if you install their uh chrome extension and you're on a site it'll tell you whether or not they have verified the contract or not there's all these great like things but the problem that i have with them is they're all add-ons and i'm just like one of these user experience people where like i can't i don't i think metamask needs to solve this it's what everyone's going to use if it's good you know if it should be or not like i don't want to like people who pitch me on solutions that require the end user to install something else i agree with seneca where it's like the people who are installing that are not the grandmother or the niece it's like people like us and like you can't protect people by have asking in general with user interactions like asking someone to change their behavior to be protected like the only people that will change their behavior are the ones that don't really need the protection yeah yeah we can't add more hurdles to this experience like are you kidding me it's like who all we all need to be focused on is just how can we take away hurdles like the suggestion that we need to add a hurdle to solve what is like one of the biggest fundamental problems to the space is really a losing strategy metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started on your nft journey you need metamask and if you need to fund your metamask account in order to buy that nft that you've been eyeing well now you can do that directly through metamask just click the blue buy button on the home screen personally i'm mad that i've spent extra gas fees transferring money from coinbase to metamask in order to buy nfts i've been using metamask directly and it is so much better you can also buy stable coins and native tokens from ethereum polygon avalanche silo and others and you can do it directly with your debit card your credit card through apple pay or google pay and there is now an improved buying experience on metamask mobile you'll only see tokens that are in your region so it's personalized to you and you'll get real-time quotes so you know you're always getting the best deal if you haven't downloaded metamask yet what are you waiting for go try it out you can learn

makes that easy so sign up at coinshift.xyz bankless let's talk about the the vulkan acquisition so explain what vulcan is and why it felt like important to add to the pre-mint suite um we've been thinking a ton about security we've been thinking a ton about less wallet connections um as an industry norm it is a very typical thing whenever you join a discord that is an nft based discord that there's some sort of verification that you own an nft to get access to channels and roles and that stuff which is awesome it's like one of the most powerful things about nfts the negative is the vast majority of these nft guilds and servers are using a solution that requires you to leave the guild like click a link leave the guild and like connect your wallet somewhere some people have built their own internal version of it some people use like uh large you know companies that have do it for hundreds of thousands of servers but regardless again you're thinking about the niece and the grandmother like people are being asked to leave it if it becomes the norm that you leave discord to do this and connect their wall to some other site then it's harder to know what's right and what's wrong and what's like a safe place collab land right like that's what you're kind of describing is like the most common one i feel like is collab land and we all know we click and then we go to some desktop and like sometimes it's worked properly and sometimes it hasn't and then you come back to discord and you like wait for two seconds or like did i did the approval work like this is not so it's kind of a nutty experience so so you know my opinion like the problem is the experience is click a link which is bad connect a wallet which is bad not it could be good but it could be bad so those two things are pretty dangerous thing to do okay so you enter vulcan which has been around for a while and they're used in you know x copy and proof and doodles and a ton of these you know these servers where what they do is they say all right uh tell us what your wallet is and you type in your wallet or use caffeine based and then i say cool here's a here's a random string of characters go put it in your openc biography so you have to open your browser yourself there's no link you have to type in openc which means no one can like give you a fake open c link that looks like opencv but it doesn't open c so these are all good and then you update your biography and then it checks it and if you're able to update your biography on openc that means you must have access to that wallet and that's how they do verification so it's a little it's a little clunkier because you have to do a little bit more but it's it is a million times safer and so that alone we were like yeah okay we want to help we i met the founder and we're like let's help you scale this to every server that exists because it's so much better but then what we did what was we took the pre-med data that we've we have because people usually join premium connect their twitter connect their discord to be able to join allow lists and we have a substantial amount of people who have done this um what we can do now is in collab or in a instead of like seeing usually you'd see like the verify button and you bounce out on other solutions now you click the verify button it checks vulcan's database and freeman's database which is basically the same database now most of the time it'll find a wallet connect to the discord id check the wallet for the stuff that you need and then just assign you the roles i actually experienced it myself for the first time yesterday and it's like it's unbelievable i know it's a little silly because i probably should have tested it beforehand um but adam hadn't rolled it out so before before you bought the uh well no this is all we've been doing since we did it like i've used vulcan but like this is the first time i had that experience and i went in i think i was in the proof discord and they released oddities and i clicked uh and i hadn't gotten the role so i just clicked verify and it like found all my stuff it was like okay you should you should have the moonburg roll the proof roll the oddities roll and then like you don't leave discord you don't it just it's instant it's unreal and so um we just felt like with our data with and just to be really crystal clear on this the reason it's instant now as opposed to what you're describing is you no longer have to go to open c and put this scramble of words into the bio right because you as preeminent the way pre-mint works is usually i connect my discord or my twitter handle or whatever to prove that i'm a part of the discord or following something in order to be allowed onto the raffle for the allow list so since you already have the discord id data you can check that against the wallet that's being submitted essentially instantaneously without having to leave and go to open c that's to make it better we have and we added multi-wallet as a safety feature so you can now say like oh if you if like if zenika wants to do a giveaway for his community but the 333 passes 10 eve you don't want that in the same wall that you're minting we always like harp on like make sure your minting wallet is essentially empty um and so now in premium you can attach multiple wallets to your account you can say okay check my ownership in this wallet but submit this wallet for minting so that means we it's not only just like a discord connected to one wall but a lot of times the discord is connected to like someone's whole batch of wallets so it really it's pretty foolproof now it's not all the time like if if we don't have your wallet or your discord it'll just be the regular vulcan experience you'll still go to openc or looks rare or wherever you want to go but um but it's it's pretty crazy how our hit rate is what was the the business case for this acquisition as opposed to just a partnership where you allowed you know you could have the same dynamic occur in theory without owning the company right um somewhat i'm very sensitive to user data being shared and i feel like this is you know the we i didn't really i would never feel comfortable with like giving a third party access to be able to like ping premium with its uh discord id and get information back without the user saying i'm okay with that happening so there there really wasn't a way to do it unless we owned them um the founder could well i was just going to say so this is very much not a hey we're going to monetize vulcan in some particular way that's going to grow the margin of premium business case this is very much like we want to overall improve the user experience or a little bit of both um by far the this is a safety thing for the community we do have a fun uh some some fun exercises that we're doing around what is a better giveaway bot experience because as much as i love pre-med which obviously uh i want people to use pre-med it's it's a little painful to know that like in in zenika server if they want to use premium to do a giveaway they're putting a link in discord that takes you out of discord right like it's sort of practice what you preach and i think what we can do with vulcan is is build sort of the giveaway bot experience where you do a reaction but giveaway bot is amazing but it has some limitations to it um i think we can sort of take a lot of those limitations away and the cool thing about i mean this is sort of we're still working on this but the problem with giveaway bodies you end up with your winners and then generally it's like cool if you're on the list please dm me your wallet address and it's like this whole it's a it's a chore for the creators to go ahead and do it it's why most people have moved to preemine we've got a solution where just like the verification it'll be like here's the list of winners congratulations you won and then the actual server owner will get the list of wallets immediately or you'll be able to choose like which wallet you want to submit to whatever you just want so it's gonna be cool uh we're still working on it but and in that case we might that might be like limited to cream and creator pass holders only and so there might be like a monetization there it's not really what we're prioritizing but like what i've learned in software is you just want to make sure you if you're going to monetize it you should monetize it early so people don't expect it to not be monetized and be mad later so um so but the core part of vulcan will continue to be free and it's actually been really great for adam the founder because he was starting to go down the road of i need to make money off of this to continue to do it we can just take that away from it right like yeah it's so we can scale this much farther that's great this will be my last question before we we fully get back into the security piece of this how much of all of this is is a doubling down on discord where discord needs to maintain sort of the hub for nft activity for this to all be relevant in a year and how much of this can be potentially pivoted as i i'm hoping a better discord emerges i'll give you my answer and then senna can give you what he thinks about discord um and i sort of already have i believe you go where the users are it's crazy to me um to think i mean at some point there will be better versions of discord and i'm sure some people will use them and people will migrate to them and i'm excited for that and there's nothing about vulcan that is specific to discord um i mean right now there is but like but the code is easily modifiable to be applied to other similar platforms the the experience could exist other places including primo by the way this is something that we're going to be working on but like i would like to remove wallet connection from pre-med 100 and maybe when you come to pre-med when you connect your wallet you're going to use our vulcan tech to be able to connect your wallet you will have to go to openc and all that but it's going to be safer right so i see um i see you being able to use sort of the vulcan method across the board but like yeah if like gm is one that's out there right now gm.xyz there's metal link or metal lab i forget what it's called like a lot of them have inherent wallet connections but maybe they don't want wallet connections right maybe they would be better off with a vulcan like experience at least as an option so but i believe discord is gonna be around for a long time people about it but it's pretty damn good it solves the problem i don't know if you've ever thought about like oh i i agree as well i think you know it's not perfect and has a bunch of like little things that are annoying and you know people have issues with it all the time but it it is pretty good and it's used by so many people like we've seen the power of like market share and getting like opencv is such a great example like people about it and openc has like a lot of things that aren't great aren't ideal for the user experience higher fees than the competition there's looks rare there's x2y2 there's another one i can't even remember the name of uh but open c still has a vast majority here's where i i'm disagree i would disagree with you guys which is i find some of the the discomforts of discord like extremely dis uh uncomfortable or and maybe it's partly the job i have which is like if i'm trying to find some sort of historical thing that's relevant to me that happened like a week ago in board apes i'm scrolling for hours like i can't just like go so there's things that i think are really inconvenient and but the distinction between like openc and the discord comparison is open c is specifically designed for nft traders so something is enough of a problem for us they care about fixing it discord is gamers first like they're trying to appeal to a couple of different audiences whose needs are going to be different so i don't see discord as having the incentive or the interest in like really fixing things for me the nft trader user etc who's trying to get information on projects the way that openc has a desire to fix things for the nf for its main user so i i am optimistic that we're gonna have something emerge eventually that's really specifically designed for our use cases and therefore will be much more like malleable to to things that i personally find like really annoying about discord the fact that a post comes up and i click it and i just go to some like it doesn't take me to the post i was trying to see it's so bad there's so many things that are so bad and i just don't apparently gamers don't care i don't know well but you know a question i would ask i think it was a mistake for them to come out and be so strongly against doing nft stuff a few months ago that was a surprising move i know they were trying to appeal to the gamer world but like it just felt bizarre for a company to basically say we don't care about this emerging market that isn't really important i think you can do both but again i don't work at discourse i don't know um but i don't know i'm kind of on the the the side where i feel like gamers will be nft people i don't think that that was not going to happen and at some point discord is just going to be like we're still appealing to gamers we have to build all these the sign of tea stuff because gamers or games are being powered by nfts i can see that happening potentially faster than a bunch of companies building the boilerplate features of discord and then building a better discord i would i would make this bet i would make this bet with you because i just i don't think i just think gaming even as it becomes super integrated with nfts in some time horizon there's still different use cases in some ways like wanting to chat with your buddy while you play world of warcraft or whatever is just a different use case and has a different set of needs and requirements than like i need to get information about an investment i'm about to make right like it's the way you want to use that is just quite different um maybe it's a matter of taking the investment side and the community side and sort of like you can go hang out with your community and discord but like the fact that that's where like so much critical information about these projects is being shared and like trying to sort through that and sort through also just like a bunch of people saying like gm and like what i'm gonna have for breakfast like that's like a really there's there's too many things there that are all happening in one place okay i want to talk maybe xenica i know you talked about the google authenticator you're moving to a yuba key to tell me for you as an individual person who's been hacked all right you're showing it off here what are the steps you've additionally taken now to prevent this from happening again in the future what should i be doing i'm not nearly as famous as you are but you know like what should people be doing yeah so um basically after i got hacked a lot of people asked did you have 2fa on google earth etc etc and i said yes and a bunch of people in comments said get a yubikey which is this um if anyone just listens to the podcast it's like a physical device it plugs into the usb port of your computer and you can kind of think of it as like a hardware wallet with your social media accounts or for other accounts so it's not just twitter you can you can connect it to binance you can connect it to you know a bunch i think um github and anywhere that you want to like secure your login via a physical device uh ubq will help and it's like the the highest level i'm pretty sure of security short of deleting your account and not using not using a service do you have to travel with it yes well so you need to use it whenever you need to log in again so if you have an instance logged in then it's fine and this is another security um issue and so on something that i learned in the last week or like was alerted to it's like a way that people can get hacked and fish and i think this is what happened to ross um albright is he was at a cafe had his laptop open went to the bathroom and some feds came and installed something because his laptop was open and so if you're logged into twitter and you know your hugo labs for instance one of the founders and you go to the bathroom and someone comes and is tracking you they can get access to your device because they don't need to re-log in so can we just for take a minute and just how ridiculous it is that ross albrecht who's running the silk road left his laptop open in a cafe to go to the bat like yeah that is brilliant but for you to get taken down in that manner it's really pathetic i i heard this second hand so i'm not 100 sure that that's correct but no that is correct i've read the book about it and i'm yeah he definitely was in a cafe when he got taken down and he had like had his laptop there so yeah most of that i can verify is true based on a bucket yeah that's so easy yeah but uh in terms of like securing your account against someone like phishing you or or hacking you from elsewhere having the physical device and traveling with it is the is the is the gold standard um and you can get multiple i got two and they both um you know if you lose one you have a backup and so you can safeguard various accounts using this and that's probably the most extreme step i've taken to now secure not just my accounts but um zen academy's you know socials and stuff like that and anything that we're doing um i actually took uh so the night after the hack occurred or it was later that night i can't remember i it happened at like midnight my time and i was still awake at like 10 or 11 a.m and i was like in bed trying to fall asleep and then i like like uh sat up and i was like remembered our website and so like we'd recently launched like just a landing page website nothing fancy but um i did not know whether it was hackable or not like i didn't know the level of security that the website because we had a website design and developer and i was like just concerned about that again because i i thought about what happened to preeminent brendan and and so and this is pre the hack the hack on your twitter this was like this is after this is after oh so after i was going through my head and thinking about like various attack vectors like discord and git book and stuff like that and website i was like oh crap uh just i simply don't know so i went to where we host the website where i have access to um made sure that account was secure and then i just basically took it down by like taking i deleted like the records that point to the server and because i didn't know like and it's still down at the moment i'm like working with people we're going to get a new web developer and just to make sure that that is 100 secure um and yeah like that's the the the nuclear option right you get a hardware thing or you just take the service down um but yeah yeah the hardware hardware keys were sort of a standard thing when i worked at google like it was just part of now the problem that people should know about it's sort of like a ledger ledger is great unless you want to access your stuff and you're at the park or you know you have to go get your ledger but uh that's the and this is the reason that security is hard for the vast majority of people it's like it's kind of a pain if you like oh i need to tweet or i need to reply to a tweet or you know you need to use your twitter account but you're out to dinner or you're out and you don't have the key or even connecting on your phone with a key is tough like it's a pain in the ass which is why it makes it hard to hack and that's the balance that i think everyone has to we had to use the hardware we i guess they must have been ubiki's on when i worked on yang's presidential campaign and i was like this is the worst thing like this sucks like it's a it's a it's a pain um but the whole team is going to be moving toward them too for what it's worth like i think it is the safest um most secure way of keeping keeping at least someone's machine safe and zenika you were just saying that the nuclear option is taking down the servers but you're not going to do that preemptively obviously so i mean yeah it's it's really um yeah well unless you know an attack is coming okay preemptively after all hack has happened though right like people can't just go run off and but but it is maybe a lesson to go and talk to your website team and understand what security precautions they've taken and have control over that so brendan you said there were like a bunch of overhauls you made obviously your problem was a plug-in that you all were using you sounded like you had multiple plugins you were using like what did you do if i'm a business owner now who knows i've used plugins and setting up my site what do you do yeah i mean you should you should do if you can you should do a full audit of any third-party software that you're using um there are probably um and this is where the team that helps me you know my team does is really the technical side that dug into this at a much deeper level on the security side but there's um and so i won't i think we might publish a post that that outlines all of the things that we did there's things that you can just make sure that certain files haven't been messed with certain files can only be accessed by certain ips just all that stuff and honestly a lot of it is again this is why like we're kind of owning this is like there's stuff we should have done but like we've been running really quickly to build out a lot of stuff and it just hadn't been uh we hadn't seen this coming so some basic hygiene but then we also just put in place uh a lot of sort of let's put it this way um we've decided that we need bank level security someone was able to get into our site and basically withdraw half a million dollars from from users and in that case people are looking at this like these are bank accounts like with seneca's you know building a site that sort of looks like his like they're basically setting up an atm and so which is it's i mean it's a shame that this is happening because like you know we're talking about hugo labs having a security team like who thought drawing some apes would end up with the security team but like i think we all need to be thinking about as as a surface gets more sort of more of a destination it needs to be thought of more like and we don't even have transactions on our site that's the crazy thing is we've always been pushing like we never do transactions but people were still able to do this so we're moving to like a bank level security type framework um and uh my i think what seneca's been talking about with the site and i agree i wouldn't necessarily call the nuclear option but like i think that if you are if you are a well-known entity in the space you should do everything you can to reduce the amount of surfaces that someone could potentially uh attack you on so like i gave the advice to a team yesterday that had like a thing that set up where some of their holders could log in and see some stuff and i was like my personal opinion is that you should shut it down because unless your users are like loving it it is just another place that someone could mess with and like as these teams get teams and projects and people get more popular all of the hackers just are looking at like who are the popular things you know and so i think good hygiene really is like what are the maxim you actually just said git book we just launched some docs on gitbook and i was like that's a really good point i need to make sure that that's locked down probably in ways that we haven't locked it down so yeah the less services the less plugins the less surfaces that you're you're operating on you have a facebook page great but if you do you really need a facebook page or can you get what you can get out of twitter like do you need to have you know i think the five year 10 year ago model was like i'm a business i'm a startup i need to have instagram accounts and facebook i need it to be everywhere it's way easier for me to tell people like pre-med doesn't have an instagram account black and white then like our instagram account has this url and we you know it's it's just it's easier to just not have it so that's that's the best thing that i can get it's really interesting last topic i want to make sure we touch on here you mentioned it was half a million dollars stolen from pre-mint my understanding brendan is that you all have decided to refund folks and maybe refunded 400 000 or you know the vast majority of that money zenika i know you spoke about how hard it was to make this decision but ultimately decided not to refund folks not set precedent maybe we can talk briefly about this and how you each came to those decisions brandon i also think it's interesting so i think you said in general you agree that it's maybe not always it's not necessarily right to refund people um and on principle but but y'all decided to go the way you did here um why was that maybe brendan you you start and then zenika um because we're owning it and it happened on our platform um and it happened on our domain name there are people that launch projects on prement that that like take people off premium and go to their websites and it's a it's a rug or something like that and we do everything we can to flag projects but we always say like if it doesn't if you know this is not happening on our site there's just we can't get in the position where preemin is going to say no matter what website you go to we verified it's safe it's just an unhealthy thing absolutely and it's impossible even if we were to look at contracts they could swap the contract out last minute like i just don't see so we've been pretty black and white on like we don't compensate but this happened on premit.xyz which was our domain name even though it wasn't our code that was running you know some of our like vulnerabilities that let people put so for me it was like i wanted to do something um and so we actually i mean i think fully refunding is would have been wonderful but in in our world like there's so much subjectivity over what an effective price is for a higher value yeah yeah so the only way we could do it um was to be very objective about like have the same rule for everyone so we just said we looked at everyone's nfts we looked at the floor price and we sent everyone eth that was that much and then the other thing that we were able to do the reason we were able to do it is we have a very high confidence that we have a list of the full list of affected wallets because as soon as you start compensating you know thousands of people start saying i was hacked too um so we because we felt so confident that we actually had a full list we were able to do this if we didn't have that confidence i don't think we could have done it because it would just be an endless endless amount of you know tracking but we were able to do an analysis that really gave us what we think is the fullest and then we did a outward facing like if you got hacked let us know give us details and we had hundreds of people do that we were able to confirm that our list was a full list and the people not on that list were not hacked so that just all for all those reasons like exact data happened on our platform um we felt like we could do it didn't make everyone whole but it was something yeah but in general i think it's a horrible idea to refund people well that's a good segue to zenika your decision not to yeah um it it was tough and i think anyone's anyone who's like got a conscience first instinct is oh people got hacked i want to make them whole and and find i feel bad for them and i do i feel genuinely awful for anyone that they lost assets in this hack or any of any of the recent ones or any of them um but i guess i've been thinking about it quite a bit um partly because the 333 club discord was compromised back in april and then we've seen so many attacks since then uh and punk 4156 i think uh wrote a pretty good thread after the the nouns twitter account was hacked and and uh i believe they refunded everyone but then he wrote a thread saying he he's not sure that it's the right approach or the best approach because it's sort of a not encourages but like it supports the behavior where people's self-custody isn't like reinforced and like personal uh accountability is not as as seen as as important if every project is always refunding people if they they click something that they shouldn't um and also i mean there's the the other piece where it's like it actually opens up a new attack vector or a new way to get scammed where scammers are now double dipping they they perpetrate a scam they they load up a fake wallet with with real assets you know they but they control the wallet that has the assets and then the one that they get drained to and then it's really really difficult to genuinely authenticate and and like you know you can say okay this this wallet did sign a set approval for all and this wallet did lose assets to this other wallet or this contract but you can't know for certain without a ton more research and like you know verification that it was not a hacker controlling both so the the precedent it gets like a really slippery slope as it continues um [Music] those are a couple of reasons when the 333 got hacked a few months back i i felt more ownership and more responsibility um and it brings back into that piece because the way it happened was one of the our team members was socially um engineered and he had too many discord permissions basically so then that the hacker and i was like all right that that's much more i felt on us i felt like okay i should have proactively done things better whereas and it was sort of a different time in the space and now with more hacks continuing to go on plus i feel like i took adequate security measures like high a really high qual amount with google authenticator 2fa it's not like i didn't have any 2fa on i might feel differently if that were the case um and literally the day before maybe like 12 hours before or something like that i had made an announcement in both discords um because of the hugo labs thing and i said hey we will not be doing i will not be doing any stealth mint so be on high alert constant vigilance um i wish i had tweeted that i just posted in both discords i don't know why i tweeted it's one of those things that you wish you could change um so for all those reasons yeah i i sort of and so one last thing i i'd spoken to so many founders over the last six to 12 months who have been in a similar position and wrestled with whether to refund or not and i i know people who have and regret that they did and then people who were really unsure about it and and i think i i it is sort of like a precedent that i i want to start to try and change um and and while i feel really bad for everyone um it's yeah it's difficult and so like what what i decided to do was at least send everyone a zen academy genesis token which um actually for about i think 30 to 40 of of the victims that was making them whole that was the highest value asset loss so that that i think is and in a way um some of the criticism i received was you know people come to you to zen academy to learn and and to understand nfts and crypto and you're you're not refunding them as like well for those people i think for the most part they are getting back something significant and then there was one person who had and this was the the largest loss basically an other side with a coder on it 20 38 and i think if you're at that point where you have tens of thousands of dollars worth of assets that's where the the i don't think you're considered a beginner anymore necessarily like yes you can be you can be very wealthy and but like that's where it's like at this difficult point yeah yeah you really can't be clicking a link with your with your hot wallet or your you know your your wallet with with high value assets in it and and and signing things i also i feel somehow intuitively the distinction between a business and an individual right like part of it also like says that academy then you know the 333 club gets hacked and it was different circumstances but it also feels different have your business and then you personally your personal twitter gets hacked and somehow you need to be responsible for everybody like that that feels viscerally different to me and i'm sure i could find a way to rationally justify it verbally at some point but but there's a visceral difference there's also there's also the thing is like we were lucky because we built a business with a business model and being able to do this for people was very painful and will hurt some of like the you know our trajectory as far as like our road map and resources but we were able to do it um and that's because a lot of people give a because we charge for certain things but we're like this is why it's because because as a business think things happen and you need to you pay people to do the work we need to pay a security team now and and part of it is like we have enough funds to be able to pay people back or to refund some people um but a lot of these people are getting hacked are just people and it's not like they have a half a million bucks that they can just refund and there is no as far as i'm concerned and if you're listening to this and you have advice for me let me know i don't think there's any insurance like there's no business insurance you'd get for like someone putting up leading people from your twitter account to a fake website and popping up a wallet and stealing assets like the the rest of them an interesting idea though that's actually an interesting business yeah think how think how quickly that insurance would go to business because of all the scams that would happen right this is like we live in this world that um in general i mean i've learned so much about you know asset uh reclaiming that there are some ways that you have plenty of people reaching out saying hey we can help maybe get some of these assets back and here's how we do it and it all seems like a little bit of a pipe dream sometimes it happens but it's unlikely so i don't see an insurance that you could get that wouldn't that would make sense as an insurance business point being is like you just there's a lot of people who couldn't give people their money back and so there's that whole side of it there's a lot of people get hacked that have have a great following but might not have like a huge revenue stream that they can just turn around and refund people so it's really like it would be a horrible precedent to set in general um it would bankrupt a lot of companies to have to do some of this stuff so it's just i agree i mean people need to be smarter it's just so hard and i'm sure as annika you dealt with this of like the stories that people write you with half of which are probably scams but like the stories that people write i mean it was like the worst week because you just feel like you even though you didn't let anyone down you feel like you've let them down you feel like well i can help you a little bit it's just it's like oh god it is just a horrible horrible feeling so and you just have to kind of like you can't dismiss everyone but you can't give them what they want and see yeah it's really hard and a lot of people honestly i don't know if you experienced this like and some really sad stories of the people who weren't involved but did get something stolen all right and i wrote him back and i was like i just want to explain to you why you weren't actually on our list and how this happened and they were just like we just i just appreciate you writing me back and even just talking to me because i feel so horrible or like yeah i don't know it's just oh god it's the worst it's the worst it's it is yeah we we had we asked anyone like impacted to create a support ticket in the in the discord and yeah i was up for like hours and i i really i made a point to just go and talk to everyone and it was just not a pleasant experience but it was also in some instances um it was i don't know if nice is the right word but like there was this level of um like people were were i guess understanding and and the the one that's the the instances that sort of affected me or the most were when i i had this happen more than once other people were apologizing to me and they said i'm sorry for the inconvenience of my getting and i was like yeah this is it's it's compassionate beyond belief but yeah let's end on a high which is the community responses which but i i brendan you mentioned earlier and zenika you've posted about which is the incredibleness of this space which is like when this stuff starts to happen it's like immediately people start spreading i mean i feel like within seconds zenika was gonna hack i don't know if it actually was i checked it later i was like i don't i was in the middle of something and then saw it like i mean i was getting dm'd and i and multiple channels i was in were people were posting it and somebody had texted me like you know this just it starts to spread really really quickly and the community really rallies around to protect people um any closing thoughts on that and then we'll we'll rap yeah so i it was crazy how quickly it spread uh with both instances for sure um like and and it happens whenever there's a big hack basically like all the discourse put out announcements on twitter and people are retweeting and saying do not click etc etc uh in the case of mine i was actually i was in a meeting when it was happening and then i uh one of my team members was calling me on on whatsapp and like they never do that and i was like initially i thought it's some butt dial and then it kept going and i was like all right let me let me just have a look at our slack and that's when everything's blowing up and i had to drop off the call and before like this was within like minute one or two and like in our servers uh my mods and community managers had made announcements everywhere i was blasting uh within uh like 13 minutes the the website got taken down someone reached out to some domain hosting service or some some magic that they worked and got the website taken down my twitter account got like locked so that the the hacker couldn't post anything within around the same amount of time um and and just sort of like that that rapid spreading of news and and information is certainly what helped protect a lot of people obviously not everyone um yeah so that gives me some hope that you know people are on the ball and out to protect one another it's like and and so like i was in this scramble mode where i was trying to get in touch with someone at twitter to try and you know get locked down the account and then get access back and i had the amount of people i had that reach out and either new contact even without me being proactive um people that like i've not really interacted with or just have known the space um in a couple instances people that like we're not on the most friendly of terms but you know when hits the fan you bound together we're all we're all part of the same community so it's really that that part is really nice to see yeah i would agree with everything that you just said i mean we had ours was different because it happened in the middle of the night and god forbid that i sleep which incidentally like since since this happened we have hired more global team to help with some of this um but the but we had a situation where the site was still up for hours um but even after the hack had been completed and people were you know and so we eventually took the site down fixed the site but the community response in that first little bit was so much that it rendered the basically that the hack useless even though they still had access to the site like everyone else had just flagged it so much that they just stopped it was like on ether scan it was which was pretty amazing i mean we were very lucky because it could have gone on longer but it eventually was shut down really quick i mean in every discord and now obviously we have i mean the negative for us as like a business that depends on people using the site is there's so much trust we need to rebuild because the words that were that what was being spread was stop using pre-med pre-meds and breach and so we're we're coming out of it but it'll take a while and we need to earn that trust back um because it you know in the course of a few hours basically the we were trending on twitter um for people to stop you know going to the site and stuff like that but you know yeah the community was the reason that it wasn't way worse than it was and um and also the community is is also sympathetic right like they're reaching out to zenika saying i'm sorry your twitter's act for us like i woke up to like people being like i'm so sorry this happened to you you're trying to do the right thing like this is it doesn't seem fair but like trying to help you know we had a lot of people who were trying to help um ultimately we only had about 170 people who were actually um victims of this which is we have two and a half million users so the fact that it was 172 people is crazy crazy sucks for them but um but it was we were really fortunate and thankful yeah awesome well thank you both so much for sharing about this giving your tips uh i i do think this is surmountable like we are going to come out of this period of this technology just like it was risky you know credit card security wasn't there in the early days of the internet to to go and do e-commerce like these are solvable issues uh and i appreciate both of you uh driving forward getting us to a place where where they're no longer concerns and issues and people can safely engage with the blockchain can i can i end with one or my last comment which was which was from some so we sent everyone all pre-med collectors this is months ago we sent everyone a ledger um which i wish everyone had been using um the um so we did a seminar with ledger last week which was already scheduled the irony of all of our security workers it was all already scheduled and then we got hacked like the week before but we did a security seminar and i thought that ryan from from ledger's it's like one sentence that just encapsulates everything and i'm gonna misquote it but he basically was like if you click a link and your heart is beating quickly it's probably a scam right like everyone saw zenika's post that was like get here quickly and mint something like it's this like and unfortunately this was a thing that people were this was social engineering that people did about a year ago to try to get the urgency but now it's like most people use pre-med or something like it to do an allow list like there isn't if you feel like you need to quick quickly click and connect a wallet and like or you're going to lose out you're probably getting scammed i think that that like and when i think about all the hacks that have happened recently like that pretty much would be the big warning sign great point so yeah i love that well stay safe out there folks thanks for listening um we'll have both of you back zenika you're regularly scheduled brendan we can regularly schedule you love having you here anytime and uh and have a good weekend thank [Music] you you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode please go ahead and hit subscribe it
