[Music] all right guys today we are talking about the story of people pleaser and people pleaser down and x times y equals k the uniswap animation that came out announcing unit swap v3 this is such a crazy story uh so let's go ahead and get right into it this is going to be something new there's a mixture of medias going on in here we got me reading this article that i put out on the bankless newsletter today we got uh short interviews with leighton cusack who started people pleaser dao and then we also a 20 a 20 minute interview with um uh people pleaser towards the end along with a few clips we're also going to put some gifts in here as well so we're experimenting with new media formats here on bank list but before we do we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these

gemini.com go bankless let's get into it the story of people pleaser people please or doubt and x times y equals k and how tokens and dows can allow us to focus on what we want on monday march 22nd the unit swap twitter account released a 45 second long animation of a unicorn that walks through a trippy colorful seemingly defy themed landscape let's go ahead and give that a watch [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] the unicorn uniswapped spear animal walks alongside flowing 3d curves which are an allusion to uniswap's x times y equals k price curve model the colors used in the animation are influenced by the various tokens that trade on the uniswap exchange life blossoms in the wake of this unicorn illustrating the creative power that uniswap and ethereum bestows upon the world and is also an allusion to the forest spirit from princess mama manoki i don't know how to pronounce that which i believe is a shared beloved movie of some of ethereum's core deepest contributors and the artist people-pleaser herself it seems to be that every single element of the x times y equals k animation has deep metaphors to defy apps ethereum culture and the values it bestows upon the world here artist the people pleaser tells a behind-the-scenes creation story of x times y equals k so let's watch that too hey it's people pleaser here's a behind the scenes of the uni slot b3 video the piece titled x times y equals k tells the story of a unicorn that brings life to this desolate land and awakens all of these elements of defy as well as the curves that are featured throughout the animation which represent the bonding curves and we see these curves breaking through barriers and ultimately uniting with the unicorn and following the unicorn to find the ethereum promised land khalil and i had bounced some ideas off of each other initially and then i sketched out a rough storyboard which then turned into an animatic before fully kicking off production in 3d now let's dive into the symbolism of the animation the overall style and aesthetic uses my signature tune shading look while the remix of halftone textures are inspired by medieval tapestries which are essential to the unisoft aesthetic other referenced materials include mobius illustrations as well as anime and the opening two shots pay tribute to the forest spirit and princess mononoke taking a closer look at the curves themselves the colors are sampled from this whole swatch of colors that represent the various tokens and the sliding segments of changing colors represents the v3 feature where you have the ability to select a certain segment of the unisot price curve the constellation in the last shot represents the uniswap liquidity pool formation and how they're interconnected but ever changing and the effect is done completely in 3d and the spheres are spawned at moving points in space and then lines form or break depending on the distance between two points and the formation of the final v3 were done separately with inherent particle modifiers and then the opacity is driven with a noise node which masks out the render pass to give it the final sort of blinking and layered effect the entire piece took a little over a month to produce and will be tokenized to live on the blockchain this friday so feel free to check it out if you're interested in owning it on foundation the animation x times y equals k was put up for bid on march 24th with a starting price of fifteen thousand dollars and bidding slowly crept upwards so slowly but andrew kane came and dropped a cannonball of a bid at 100 eath which held the top spot in the auction for over 12 hours which is over the half the length of the auction um but then just a few hours before the end of the auction a the 108th bid from andrew was outbid by a new entrant into the auction pleaser dow with 110 eth in under 24 hours a pleaser dow had been formed specifically to source enough capital to purchase this nft the genesis of pleaser dow was from this tweet from pooled together founder leighton cusack anyone want to create a quick dow to bid on this when people pleaser release her animation on twitter on on monday pleaser dot was formed when leighton decided that he wanted to own the x times y equals k nft but assumed that it was going to sell for too high of a price for what he could afford he needed a little help from his friends and there was a lot of interest to be a part of this dow here's defy ted saying shut up take my money jameis i joined for sure andy i'm in uh let's go into this quick nine minute interview with leighton about the formation of pleaser doubt where did this idea to get a collection of people come from like what was the genesis of uh people pleaser dao yeah i think yeah please your doubt yeah i mean the genesis was basically really wanting personally i really wanted to have a a a piece of this nft which i think is an amazing ft that represents so much about d5 it's all in one um and also just knowing that i just made an assumption like i'm not gonna be able to afford this personally so i just kind of threw it out there as like hey let's try and get some people together who are reliant on like owning this piece of defy history that's how i see it the genesis was i really want this but i can't afford it right so the compromise was well we can i can just get my internet friends to band together and we can all buy a share in it so how did you how did you get these people your internet friends to coordinate and like how did it how did the coordination happen i just shared it on twitter i just shared the idea i was like hey anyone interested in this and there's a couple people who responded and said like yeah i would be and so it started with that couple people um it was like uh there was like three people and so we i i so then i started like a group chat on twitter from that we set up like a telegram group we basically decided like hey let's all put in a minimum of 10 10 eth you can put in more but like minimum attendees and we'll try and get enough people to be able to purchase it and we sort of assumed the bidding was already at 100 eath and so we sort of assumed like maybe it would go for like 150 maybe 200 it ended up going for a lot more but we were like okay so we need 10 to 20 people and so we just sort of pinged people who we thought were um would be interested in in participating right so it's kind of like a word of mouth organizations like oh people's like oh i guess with this opportunity perhaps i will do this thing because like the damn that's already at 100 eath i would never buy that myself but if if if everyone's just contributing 10 eth well what would you say was like the average like contribution size and how did you guy how do you guys even how did you guys even do accounting the average contribution was slightly above 10. certainly the most people contributed 10. i think one thing that's interesting and andrew andrew kong um i don't know if that's how you pronounce his name i haven't met him in person but um this is sort of interesting he had the 100th bid but we were bidding against him right and so we did against him but then what happened was someone someone in the in the dao uh reached out to him and was basically like hey we're making this down to bid on it why don't you join us and so andrew actually took that hundred eighth and put it into the dow and if it wasn't for him we probably would not have had enough to actually make the purchase because that was a substantial so anyways basically most people contributed 10 eth a couple did 20 and 30 and then like andrew did 100 and i think maybe one other person did like 50. yeah he was going to bet 100 eath himself but then he realized that like well instead of going into a bidding war i can just join this dell i guess the compromise is that well now andrew has to share this nft with other people but i would i would assume he has perhaps like the largest share of the people pleaser dow ownership of that nft and so a bit of a compromise but now it's part of this cool story where like at least he didn't get outbid or had to pay an even higher amount because he coordinated with his internet friends yeah and he did he had the high bid he so he he placed 100 and so we outbid him and this idea which is obviously very crucial to d5 and ethereum in general that like if we collaborate we can actually do a lot more than competing against each other ultimately the price uh turned into a bidding war and uh like all good auction mechanisms the foundation app resets every time a new bid is is accepted so there's 15 more minutes to set a a bid you know so that bidding works so andrew joined into into the people pleaser doubt army you guys have now now you guys have more people more capital ready to bid more who who was the next bidder that you guys had to bid against do you know we don't know but they had a lot to eat a lot and we were like watching because they they had a wallet they were like dropping ethan from tornado cash and so we were like oh man they just added another 100e and so you know that's the thing i'm like blocking like you can see all this right and so we're like oh it bid incoming but we just anytime i mean i think they they probably had to be intimidated right because they're seeing this wallet that has tons of people sending into it from all different addresses and it's like how do you compete against that right especially when like the the invitation to the group is open and if people are interested they can find it and just throw in their capital like how how are you going to fight against the army of the many right right yeah we actually wanted to um but we it was just like we only had like 15 minutes but we wanted to send them like a message on chain and say like hey come join us that's hilarious don't fight us just join us so what's what's the state of the dow now like how are things organized as soon as the auction ended what i did is got four other trusted members of the dao on a multi-sig and transferred all the eth and the nft to the multisig so that's where it resides now right okay so what is the future of the dow like how are you guys going to manage this nft you guys are just going to have this multi-sig that owns this nft and then all the excess east is getting returned pro rata to the dial holders how is it how is this going down well that's a great question i think you know as obviously with the dow i can't speak for the devil but i can speak for myself i can say that i don't think anyone's interested in returning the youth i don't think anyone wants to eat back i think what people are really excited about is actually growing it and um i do think there is a little bit of a niche here with with sort of um these collectibles or you know collectibles is too trivial of a word they're really like pieces of history that are specific sort of to defy i mean people pleaser is to me a quintessential defy artist right like she's been doing so many videos for so long um and so owning something from her uniswap obviously the quintessential d5 protocol and there's other there's other artifacts like that that we can continue to collect that are in this um nft art but also sort of intersecting with d5 category and so personally for me i hope that the dial um continues collecting these because i think to me we're building we're building a museum on chain of financial history and it's going to be awesome that's so cool yeah i saw somebody's tweet that they had a people-pleaser piece of of art on for for auction somewhere else and they said oh i was trying to figure out why my piece that i forgot that i had for sale was bid on and apparently other other artwork by people pleaser was immediately bought up on the on the secondary market after the fact was that you guys well yeah so there may be some that was brought up but some was bought up by dow members yeah so someone bought down members because obviously the name's pleaser dao and again like you know we we think very highly of her art and and think of her as being really again like a quintessential defy artist and so we do want to collect a lot of her art for sure um and also uh but also you know brought more broadly these defy artifacts that um are really again it's the history in the making and we're kind of collecting it in real time that's cool this is such a fantastic story it's got a little bit of everything it's got like social organization spur the moment social organization using a dao a dao and an nft as a financial asset like capital allocation and digital art and meaning and culture that's pretty cool well and and also like let's not forget the the philanthropic side of it too you know because that is yes right of course obviously like a huge shout out to uh few people pleaser like she could have made a lot of money off of this and she decided to to um support a cause that's really important right now with all the racism against um asian americans or just asians in general i guess maybe in other countries but um yeah so anyways that's that i think it's really cool because that is like that's also ethereum's ethos in my mind right right uh did you did you read vitalik's piece on legitimacy uh before this event happened by chance no i hadn't seen that until you tweeted it and so and i actually i read your tweet but i haven't read the whole thing yeah it was it was so crazy like he put out this piece like a week ago about how like nft the reason why people are paying so much for nfts is because versus like like versus a copycat nft where copycat nfts are the same nft but one is legitimate and one's not and he said well a way to help gain legitimacy for nfts is if um the artist commits to doing something valuable for the world and that bestows legitimacy upon this nft and then uniswap like ethereum's de facto like application that exhibits all of the values of ethereum it uh runs this nft that is exactly in line with like this predictive like legitimacy model that vitalik had the the timing of that was just so cool that's amazing yeah i'll definitely need to read that metallic's always ahead of the curve this is always true but only by one week this time we're catching up that's good awesome leighton well thanks uh thanks for coming on and let me let me record on the youtube yeah thank you all right i'm gonna reiterate something that we were just talking about with leighton but i wanted to put it in the article as well access to the dao was passed by word of mouth from people who signaled interest pleaser dow was open to anyone who cared enough to voice their interest and ready to contribute members of the dao sent in lots of 10 eth and with enough contributions 110 eth was sourced to outbid andrew king's 108th bid but here's where it gets interesting instead of entering a bidding war with the dao andrew kang instead joined forces and sent his 100 eth to gain membership to pleaser dow andrew kang tweeted almost got into a bidding war with an army of symptoms today but ended up being a part of pleaser dao a first of a kind art dao dedicated towards crypto art the future is community ownership with the powers of with the power of a handful of individuals coalescing pleaser dao was now a force to be reckoned with only two bidders remained between pleaser dao and his nft now that andrew kang was part of pleaser dao bitter number 0x421595 was out priced by a 165 east bid from pleaser dow and that was the second to last bidder and the last bidder was vas rail poor uh in vast rail poor kept in dropping 100 east from tornado cash from uh into his wallet which layton said that that was kind of like intimidating right like how much east does this guy have like he can just where's what is his capital size how much ammo does this bidder have at their disposal but on the other side of things imagine being vass rapport was beating against this dao who had this open invitation for anyone who was interested in computing uh contributing like the dao had already gobbled up andrew kang like where where would it go next like the capitalization of the dow was only limited by the number of interested parties in joining and who knows how much total desire there would be to be a part of pleaser doubt after a bidding war that kept on extending until the end of the auction pleaser dao slapped down a massive 310 eth bid thirty 530 dollars fast rail poor folded to the power of the dao and pleaser dow successfully won the auction for the x times y equals k piece with a 530 thousand dollar bid thanks to the power of capital formation and the power of permissionless financial tools the power of the many was able to coalesce and become focused upon a single objective generating more capital for the desired object than a single alternative opponent this is the story of group coordination overpowering a single entity you know this is this is a symbol there's a metaphor for all these individuals who were you know small fries but with coordination tools they could out coordinate the big guy that is the that is the best metaphor for what ethereum can do to the world i think i i have seen illustrated all right so let's get into people pleasers side of the story the artist people pleaser on the other side of the story is the artist people pleaser who has an impressive resume of animations both inside of crypto and out so here's her website with a bunch of her artwork right all of her past animations and then here's the one that caught my eye the diablo 4 cinematic which i remember watching a couple months ago when it came out and i'm a huge diablo fan and so finding out that this person just made a uniswap nft that sold for a half a million dollars was a really cool story uh she also has extensive work making animations for various defy teams you know here's the ave animation and the sushi swap animation and she's also done stuff for somebody else and and so many other teams and now of course unit swap i had the chance to sit down with people pleaser and we talked about the creation of x times y equals k so let's go into it that interview as well but it was i did like work a lot throughout this like month and a half but it was like it was like really fun which is why i put so many hours into it because i'm having fun and i'm actually really glad that you know the people that i brought on board said that they also had a lot of fun it's just everybody had fun making it and that's i think that's like the main goal at the end of the day i think artistic products always come out looking a lot better when people are passionate about what they're doing and that's that's something i'm personally very hopeful about with what ethereum can bring to the world around it is the opportunities to create value that people had fun creating along the way um and i think that's a this is a perfect manifestation of that yeah the full interview is going to be down at the very end of this uh end of this youtube video so check that out uh people pleaser told me this story about how her and uniswop came to team up to produce x times y equals k and where the early inspiration for this piece came from she her story shared some very thematic components with what i see going on in ethereum at large finding enjoyment in the collaborative process of creation was a key component of the story gaining confidence from her community and from her environment to actually put her work up for auction right it's a very like it's very testing time to have your work just be auctioned like it's a testament like it's like it's like you're being audited like this is how much your market your market is worth that's that's a crazy thing yet she said that the environment the uniswap team and her community helped her gain the confidence to do that uh also discovering a mechanism in the nft to create value from her skills and also a desire to help others follow in her own footsteps and achieve similar results these are all to me things that i see happening in ethereum all the time people pleaser said that she was inspired from a tweet from cal wang who suggested that um people who have recently made a lot of money in crypto and defy should find ways to flex that wealth by helping others financially and so kya wang has this tweet if you made a lot of money playing the markets in 2020 just know that this type of activities contributes very little to society i say that as a trader and investor if you want to really brag brag about how many people you've helped financially so here's another clip from people pleaser that we'll go ahead and get into i really think that there's so much money going around in in crypto that we definitely have more than enough to sort of distribute it and put it towards something that's like worthwhile actually i was really inspired by uh one of chow wang's um tweets a while back which i had retweeted um which he was talking about um sorry i don't remember the exact quote obviously but he was basically talking about how um nothing against trading but just oh the act of trading is not necessarily like beneficial to society um so you know instead of like flexing on you know material goods or something you should flex on how you've helped other people financially i did feel very resonated with his tweet like his weight was so inspiring i was like oh yeah i think totally more people should be doing that in the space and um hats off to people who already are and i hope that you know i'm like i'm not wealthy myself so um i was like but i have this ability to sort of generate uh like you know using my skill set to generate something that does have value hopefully and which turns out it did um that and i had always thought about um wanting to do an nft drop that was um committed to charity but i just never found the right sort of opportunity to and to be quite honest i was also a little bit scared to take that leap of faith because doing an auction is scary right it's um not something like this auction thing is not something that i've ever done before but so i think you know with the sort of like support of unisop um i felt a little bit more confident being like okay i think you know there's gonna be at least i knew i had you know um like a great community that i had always supported and were fans of my work but i wasn't sure you know the valuation of that or anything at all and so yeah this is just crazy i'm super grateful and i hope that this will also inspire more acts like this in the future as well ethereum's maximum potential to redefine society doesn't stop at permissionlessness or disintermediated financial services ethereum's true potential extends into redefining the culture and people that inhabit ethereum in my opinion ethereum will truly change the world by inspiring a new cultural disposition in how wealth circulates while applications like uniswap and nfts can help facilitate alternative wealth circulation mechanisms is ultimately up to the psychological dispositions of the people that make up this cultural environment in which ethereum operates i believe people pleaser and her work are an exemplar example of these new cultural ethos being found in d5 and ethereum i hope that people-pleaser leads many new artists to come and create in ways that re-circulate the value that is generated throughout the world if ethereum is going to meaningfully generate change for the for the world for good it needs to do more than just build new financial software it also needs to generate a more positive sum attitude in the people that it enables and this is what i believe is the power of ethereum x times y equals k was sold for over half a million dollars because it leveraged the best of what ethereum has to offer capital formation using the dao a financial asset using the nft cultural expert expression using the animation and the market value based on human values which is the legitimacy which we're going to get into in a second the permissionless nature of ethereum enabled a dow to form under extremely tight time constraints a tweet was made signaling interest in the forming of a dow and in under 12 hours it had sourced 465 eth 800 000 with a singular goal to purchase this nft the power of ethereum is the ability to produce attentional focal points tokens are things that can receive attention from people and taos are things that can focus attention ethereum is a lens that allows for people to focus capital upon objects that they perceive to be valuable and so this is a little uh diagram that i hacked together using a an image i found on google so we have this camera and a camera works by focusing light on a particular point so it takes in light from an object that is trying to focus on and it focuses that light upon the sensor the sensor of the camera or the film of the camera and in this case the metaphor is the film is the people and the object in focus is the assets and because of the instantiation of the actual piece of artwork in the nft it allows people to actually focus on the value of that artwork as the value of the nft and all of this is done by ethereum right the ethereum is the camera the ethereum is the thing that does the focusing the power of nfts is they manifest a specific instance of an object into reality and that object is then associated with a piece of digital art a digital creation or some other form of value the power of dao's i kind of just explain this the power of dao's is that they facilitate the coordination of like-minded people who have a shared goal that they are all in the individual pursuit of because of the dow people can combine their energies their money their value or labor in pursuit of a shared goal the power of ethereum is that it is a platform that enables the instantiation of objects of desire tokens and the desiring objects daos and individuals and these two separate instantiations have no intermediary separating them they can just connect directly valuing legitimacy just earlier this week vitalik wrote in a blog post the most important scarce resource is legitimacy in which he described illustrated various examples of how humans human subjective perceptions of legitimacy is an extremely powerful force if humanity collectively determines something to be legitimate it has value if that thing loses its legitimacy similarly it loses its value so here's a quote from vitalik's piece vitalik is a pattern of higher order acceptance an outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same which nfts people find attractive to buy and which ones they do not is a question of legitimacy if everyone agrees that one nft is interesting and another nft is lame then people will strongly prefer buying the first because it will have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way if the conception of legitimacy for nfcs can be pulled in a good direction there isn't an opportunity to establish a solid channel of funding to artist charities and others some institution or even a dao could bless an nft in exchange for a guarantee that some portion of their entity revenues goes towards a charitable cause ensuring that multiple groups benefit at the same time this blessing could even come with an official category categorization is the nft dedicated to global poverty relief scientific research creative arts local journalism open source software development empowering marginalized communities or something else vitalik this last line is crucial to the story vitalik suggests that an nfc can further instantiate its own legitimacy as an asset by committing to donate to some of the revenues generated from its sale to valuable social institutions that are aligned with our human values oh yeah did i forget to mention that people pleaser the artist behind x times y equals k is donating 100 of the 310 eth revenue from the nft sale to charities supporting aapi and other minority representation yeah she's doing that that's pretty cool all of it's going all of it's going uh to support marginalized communities and people please retweets i've been looking for a way to meaningfully contribute to the nft space and this seems like the right opportunity for it check out this site in ways that you can help in my opinion you could not have orchestrated a better ethereum story if you tried uniswap an application highly resonant with the values of ethereum launches a v3 promotion animation from peoplepleaser a new financial asset in nfts are instantiating the value of this animation many disparate individuals are coming together to get something that they all want individually but need the power of group coordination to access and then lastly the bestowing of legitimacy by financial contributions to public goods this story is a perfect example of what makes me so optimistic about the future that ethereum can help enable a world of open financial tools that help facilitate human alignments between our cultural values and the market valuation of our assets so congratulations to people pleaser for producing something worth 529 thousand dollars congratulations to a pleaser dao for winning the piece and congratulations to both groots for donating all that money to marginalized communities that don't have access to the crazy upside that crypto brings and of course congrats to uniswap for inspiring it all and now a final message to pleaser dao let me in the dao i want in uh please consider me finding a way to get me in the dow i want in this this is a fun experiment and uh thank you everyone for for listening uh and watching on the bankless youtube and uh cheers alright guys let's get into the full length interview with people pleaser but first before we do let's take a

feels good i'm just it feels surreal almost like i don't haven't really like sit in yet other than that there's like a huge pile of each like sitting in my wallet right now that um myself and the unispot team are gonna link you know figure out how we're going to allocate the funds and then we'll post a follow-up on twitter about it with all the details and stuff so how did you and the unit swap team come to be how did you guys meet um tyrone chitra texted me a while ago it was in january um he texted me and then he was like hey somebody from unislop just messaged me asking if um you'd be open like to working with them and i was like i mean yeah let's go into the process of like how the symbolism for the in the in the in the piece x times uh y equals k actually came about um was that all all your creative work or was there like a back and forth with like maybe hayden or people on the uni swap team like how like the obviously the unicorn would be a core feature but there's so much more in there as well tell us about that process it's mainly there's just a chat that has me um hayden uh teo and um khalil so teo is the strategy lead at uni swap and then khalil is a designer at uni swap and then so initially actually khalil had spoken to me about making several different like short animations sort of like going through the the concepts of v3 um but then it's like eventually we decided to sort of just do like the one sort of hero um teaser video because at least like my my approach with these things is um they're always like as you probably noticed like not not so literal and um they're like more abs on the abstract side of things like abstract with a meaning obviously like you know i always um everything in my videos always means something but it's not maybe immediately obvious to the viewer um which i think is part of why people find the videos fun i guess it's like a little easter egg hunt or something right um but yeah so and so eventually you know we kind of decided like well there's some really technical um explanations about you know like um features of unislav v3 that you know require very very literal um animation videos which um you know also came rolled out later you know on on wednesday with that blog post and i mean that was your world as well no no no so that was um but they still looked incredible and helped people understand the concepts which i think was really great and then so i was able to sort of sort of just focus on the one like hero launch video um and yeah so then since that like decision was made then i was a little i i had like way more sort of like room to just expand creatively and then just sort of do what i always do um and so there were definitely a lot of like uh brainstorms back and forth you know between khalil and i about uh initially we had just talked about you know something that involves you know one of the main features is how uh like the of the bonding curve is now sort of like modifiable or you know like customizable essentially and then so you know we discussed maybe concepts involving like um maybe like a power user that's like uh morphing something or you know like just something that's like you know like involving a user and like manipulation of the the curve itself or you know we even threw out crazy ideas like what if we had like a landscape and like somebody was like you know like morphing the landscape or something and then the actual video came into fruition because khalil had showed me this a short story um and it was like about just like a magical forest or something and i i just like i really felt inspired by that short story and also you know when like he showed it to me i was just seeing like um you know like images in my head um already like i mentioned in the video princess mononoke was you know like high priority like visual references for me because one of my favorite videos i'm sorry movies and so um yeah so then it kind of like in my head started to come together at that point and then um so then i i was like okay let me like sketch up a storyboard and then you can talk about it and so pretty simple like four frames i had meant for it to just like here's just a rough like four frames and then we can talk about it but then it actually just ended up being like i guess these four frames work as each like individual shots and then so so yeah um that's kind of like how it came about and then obviously all the other like smaller details and stuff are um so that was like you know the sort of like the skeleton of the video and then the other small details you know usually come up like as i'm doing production or something you know like they always it's always like an ongoing process right like you know you literally be walking outside and then you're like well i have this idea or you know like even up until the last minute when when i'm like editing or something you know like like in the week like leading up to when the video is about to be released uh there could be like new ideas and i'm sort of like yeah like for example the the idea with um like so khalil had said that the uni swap team were uh hoping for like the the curves to be like um you know like more than just like one color and then um from that input i decided to like instead of just making like individual like strands different colors but why not also integrate like the fact that the colors are like sliding which is sort of reflecting that kind of uh which section on the bonding curve like we're gonna choose here to provide your liquidity so yeah like and that was like super late in the process as well and um so yeah there's like so many things that kind of it's kind of like a it happens yeah stream of consciousness and happens with a lot of my videos too where i feel like there's a lot of happy accidents as well where like i thought we'll just like either randomly roll in or you know i'll be making something and i'd be like oh that looks cool what can i extrapolate from this or i don't know just i feel blessed that just the whole thing came together nicely yeah it's an amazing piece of art and i think my favorite piece about it and you talked about this in your like behind the scenes video was how the unicorn starts in like this desolate land and then moves into the world of ethereum which is like lush and rich talk about talk about that metaphor and why you think that that is a worthy metaphor to include in this uh in this piece well i mean i think obviously unisop being so essential to the entire d5 space and actually um the like the whole ethereum eco space i think is um sort of something that i wanted to convey in the video as well so at least my take of it and you know the video is always also like open to some degree of interpretation to the viewer as well but my take of it is that sort of like you know one uni swap was introduced to the whole defy space like they kind of changed the game right like they introduced all this like new possibility of exchanging different tokens and providing liquidity and stuff which um so you know like the way it like said it in my video was like oh it's like a desolate land was maybe kind of like a stretch an exaggeration like obviously the land was rich already before that but it's kind of like yeah like unisop kind of brought this whole you know um ensemble of like innovation and just like color you could say to the whole device space and then so that's kind of what um sparked the idea and then really drove the sort of like narrative throughout the video and yeah so you know i i did i did just always have the intention of making the video slightly like psychedelic which is why you know like the end the result is like stuff swirling around too i mean i try to keep it a theme throughout the entire video as well there's there was so so many things that i wanted to fit in the behind the scenes video but um i didn't want to make it too long because you know like i wanted to keep it short and sweet but yeah like even there's like even down to tiny details like um that the saturation levels in the video from the beginning to the end uh change as well so it's like starts out a lot less saturated and then um it gets way more saturated towards the end you know as everything sort of like comes together like um unicorn ethereum and then there's like a pool underneath which is also you know could be like a liquidity pool and then the constellation above like you know when everything comes together it's like harmonious and colorful so how long were you working on this piece before it was actually from start to finish actually i think from ideation it would be about a month and a half unfortunately i did um have i have like two artists who um were able to sort of like i was able to delegate some tests too and also help me out with like so i had this artist um hafid who is a great ex particles emulation artist um that's a good in case you're not like familiar with it it's just like a specific sort of like task and within the animation pipeline um and so he's really good at that so you know there were a lot of things like involving like particles and um simulated in the video that um he uh did a phenomenal job with and i also had one of my old co-workers like a girl that i and a good friend that i used to work with and her name is marion super talented animator she's worked on like uh the new pokemon movie um like animating the future and stuff did such a great job i asked her to help me out with uh the sort of the movement of the unicorn and that's why you know it looks so smooth and amazing that's all hats off to her so i was able to sort of just um focus on like directing and also obviously like i did everything else so you know like all the other like animating parts of it like assembling the scene like building some models and then also you know like curating the entire look and palette um compositing rendering uh post-production all that kind of stuff i think that definitely helps the production sort of like speed up a little bit um but it was i did like work a lot throughout this like month and a half but it was like it was like really fun which is why i put so many hours into it because i'm having fun and i'm actually really glad that you know the people that i brought on board said that they also had a lot of fun it's just everybody had fun making it and that's i think that's like the main goal at the end of the day i think artistic products always come out looking a lot better when people are passionate about what they're doing and that's that's something i'm personally very hopeful about with what ethereum can bring to the world around it is the opportunities to create value that people had fun creating along the way um and i think that's a this is a perfect manifestation of that yeah definitely so uh this animation is almost a week old in the public's uh sphere and so uh you know a week ago none of this none of this all this news event hadn't happened yet so while you were but you knew that you were going to nft it did you have any sort of like guess as to like how much this would go for on the secondary market before the actual nft auction started i had no idea i mean um the the nft wasn't actually part of the original plan at all it was just an idea that i had um sort of like halfway through production um it was also because i there were a lot of people who uh i hadn't you know like i hadn't been minting some nf just like you know way like when we say way back in the day in crypto it's like not that long ago but um but it was definitely you know last year essentially and then so um like i haven't you know because i've been sort of like so invested in the d5 video eco space that i hadn't had time to sort of like dive into the nft space and obviously like nfps like recently really blew up too and um there was like a tiny little bit of fomo there but also just like people constantly like always messaging me be like why aren't you like selling any nft they're like why don't you admit nfts like i would love to you know like buyer and t or whatever and i'm just like i'm too busy like making videos um and then i was like well why wouldn't i like double up on this you know but obviously i think um sort of like that the way i looked at it was just you know obviously the goal wasn't to make money but which is why i brought like it was all part of like i was just like to unicef i was like why don't we make this an nft and like make it worthwhile which is donating it to a good cause like i have no idea how much we're gonna raise which is why we didn't also didn't like settle on like one specific charity yet because i was like i like i don't want to promise like oh we can donate to three charities just in case i only sell it for like a hundred dollars and we can only like donate thirty dollars you know what i mean so like it's like it wouldn't even be worth the gas fee so yeah like that was kind of why but i was like you know depending on how much we raise then we can sort of like um decide on how many we can actually allocate to which you know ended up obviously way exceeding my expectations like this whole dow thing that just i was like i woke up it was like we're gonna get into that for sure like the bidding war ended like in the morning of my time and i woke up was like there's suddenly like a dow named after me like what so yeah let's get into that so the auction started on thursday my thursday and and then ended on friday which was your saturday morning uh and so then this massive bid hundred eighth bid comes in from andrew king and uh i'm sure that was that was surprising and then leighton cusack signals on on twitter saying hey who wants to like pool our capital together so we can buy this thing because we'll need to match we'll need to beat this 100 eath bid were you watching this happen or were you asleep while this was going on i saw his initial tweet about like oh does anybody want to get together a dow because um jameis had sent it to me and then i was like oh that's cool and i actually told jamis too i was like i i actually love obviously i didn't know who was gonna win the auction at the time but i was just like i actually love the idea of the video being owned by like the community the same community that supported me you know from day one right like that's awesome to me at least i was like and it almost feels like weird that because like this is like the unisab v3 like announcement video obviously it was like a big deal when it came out too so it's like it almost feels weird if it like just belonged to one person or something but i i was just thinking that it was a cool idea at the time i didn't know how they were going to do it i just knew that they were they were gonna sort of something about that was happening but obviously you know i wasn't like involved in the channels or anything and then so and then yeah like uh when the hundred east bid came in um i was just like okay this is already far exceeded my expectations like literally i was having a conversation with um khalil the designer like you know a few days before like we were about to drop the nft and then we were just checking out foundation and we saw this like one nft that sold for 10 even we're like wow 10 each like that's amazing and then yeah so obviously 100 came in like it was just nuts and then everything else was even crazier right so now this group of i don't know how many of them there are like 12 15 people they now they have this an actual dow like you said named after you please pleaser dao uh and when i was talking to lace layton leighton said that well um the this pleaser dow has excess eath left over and he doesn't know like the the dow members he thinks doesn't really want any of their eath back and they actually want to like grow the dao but then what that means is that people pleaser the artist needs to produce more art for the dow to have a purpose so my question to you is what's the future of your artwork and as it relates to tokens on ethereum and and has this event changed that trajectory at all it definitely has because um i had always been also kind of cautious i mean or not even cautious because it never really even came to me that i would be minting these videos as nfts because in my head um obviously always the ip would belong to the protocol who commissioned it in the first place right which is why i'm obviously super grateful that uh unisoft were so supportive of this decision we're like yeah um you know it's yours like minted but obviously the donation we're making together because um this wouldn't have happened because of them but um yeah i'm just like so grateful that they gave me this like chance to sort of um broadcast my artwork to such a large audience as well um because d5 i think was sort of like a more niche community before um so but hopefully uh you know going forward i i think i would like to sort of um have a combination between minting my personal artwork um and then also uh definitely but i think within i also was having these ideas about you know even within my personal artwork i want to still keep the same theme about you know putting in um subtle references here and there to either defy um or ethereum ecosystem and i think it would be a fun way for uh people who are interested in um the art to sort of look for those things as well and you know towards a broader audience like just a general nft audience you'd just be like oh this is a cool animation or like a cool piece of art but for um the d5 community which is you know my og community um there's an extra meaning behind that where they can pick up on references to certain things that maybe other people wouldn't understand or just not know about the fascinating thing to me about this story is that it is such a perfect like accidental orchestration of what makes us ethereum so awesome we have this application that is so powerful and in my opinion like resonant with the values of ethereum we have this dow which collected many different people to to empower them to get something done that they wanted and then we had the funding of cultural and artistic expression which wouldn't have been uh been able to have been funded with half a million dollars to in without this uh medium uh and then right before the other coincidence about what happened is right before vitalik on his blog put out this post about legitimacy and talked about how like nfts and many other things receive a lot of value because humans deem them to be legitimate and when he explicitly said in this one paragraph about how the creator of an nft can help bless the value of an nft by perhaps donating some of the revenue generated to a charitable cause that humans agree has uh value and uh i don't think that i think by the time this blog piece had come out you had already committed to donating uh all of the revenue to charity uh and so the fact that you were doing that without like the input from vitalik which many people just take vitalik's input and run and runs with it i think you did it with by committing it before that was incredibly cool and that just really just ties a great bow on this story how do you how do you think about that that component of the story and how it kind of uh impacted the story of this animation i actually yeah i didn't know about it until i saw it in your tweet initially um and it's it's pretty crazy to me i everything about this whole situation is just seems like a crazy blessed coincidence almost like you know including the dow forming was unexpected and then also i didn't um prior know about this um vitalik article and it's really just a very crazy coincidence and um i'm glad that he sort of shares that value you know i really think that there's so much money going around in in crypto that we definitely have more than enough to sort of distribute it and put it towards something that's like worthwhile actually i was really inspired by one of chao wang's um tweets a while back which i had retweeted um which he was talking about um sorry i don't remember the exact quote obviously but he was basically talking about how um nothing against trading but just oh the act of trading is not necessarily like beneficial to society um so you know instead of like flexing on you know material goods or something you should flex on how you've helped other people financially and um i'm actually not a trader myself because i don't have time to do those things but um but i i did feel very resonated with his tweet like his week was so inspiring i was like oh yeah i think totally more people should be doing that in the space and um hats off to people who already are and uh i hope that you know i'm like i'm not wealthy myself so um i was like but i have this ability to sort of generate uh like you know using my skill set to generate something that does have value hopefully and which turns out it did um that and i had always thought about um wanting to do an nft drop that was um committed to charity but i just never found the right sort of opportunity to and to be quite honest i was also a little bit scared to take that leap of faith because doing an auction is scary right it's um not something like this auction thing is not something that i've done before but so i think you know with the sort of like support of unisop um i felt a little bit more confident being like okay i think you know there's gonna be at least i knew i had you know um like a great community that i had always supported and were fans of my work but i wasn't sure you know the valuation of that or anything at all and so yeah this is just crazy i'm super grateful and i hope that this will also inspire more apps like this in the future as well yeah yeah that that last point inspiring more acts like this i think it's really important because there's a frequent line of conversation in the crypto space like oh cool we're playing with these new financial assets you know everyone's getting hilariously rich like yeah yeah yeah uh and then and then the question is like well what happens if we just create the same old institutions and same old structures that we came from except now like great now new people are rich and my answer to this is always like well if we if we do want to have like a revolution in how society operates it's not going to be just the technology but it's going to be what how what people and and how people leverage this technology and the the way that i see this truly being different is like there's a different cultural shared ethos of how we recirculate value and like like to what you said like trading one asset for another doesn't create value creating value creates value and if we can recirculate that value in ways that are better than on our previous system through means such as nfts then that is something that is meaningfully different and in my opinion a much better improvement upon the way we used to do things yeah i completely agree and you know vitalik's point about how um not just the legitimacy but you know about how multiple people agreeing that something has value and then you know compounds its value essentially and i think yeah and then his point about how you know when you put this to a good cause it i think it will definitely amplify amplify that um value because you're not only just people agreeing that this has value now but that it's directly benefiting people who are in need for example um and i think that in itself is just so priceless um so yeah this he really hit the nail on the head with that article people pleaser you hit the nail on the head with your animation and so i could i think i speak from basically all of uh nft speculators and ethereum culturalists that we will watch your career with great interest uh you have made a in my opinion a landmark event in the world of defy and nfts and i hope this is the first of many oh thank you so much
