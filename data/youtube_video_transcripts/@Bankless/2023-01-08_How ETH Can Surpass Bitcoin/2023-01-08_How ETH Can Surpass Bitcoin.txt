I think ether versus Bitcoin can go up way faster than what people expect because we are in proof of stake with eip1559 like we are in a new paradigm of ether price action and so like the previous coupled relationship that we had with Bitcoin from proof of work I think is much more broken and so I tweeted out this tweet the lappening is going to be 10 times easier than the flipping what's the lappening date oh I'm so glad that's your private meme yeah and so the flipping is when ether flips Bitcoin and market cap the lappening is when ether is worth 2x what Bitcoin is what I'm saying here is that it's taken a ton of work to even come remotely close to the flipping we're like less than 50 of the way there although I do think we're closer than we actually perceive it to be what I'm saying is once we do flip Bitcoin when we get to 2x Bitcoin that is going to be 10 times easier than getting to the flipping because once you flip Bitcoin it's so easy just to do it again and again
