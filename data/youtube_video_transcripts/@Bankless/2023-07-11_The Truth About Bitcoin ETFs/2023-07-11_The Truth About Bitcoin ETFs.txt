yeah let's be I'll be very blunt if you look at all the things that they have said and written over the last three years this will be denied but there's a lot there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that um it will be approved it goes back to what I said they can back into whatever decision they want to um okay so you said two things there uh James I want to be clear when Bitcoin ETF that is the question on our mind today is the Bitcoin ETF actually happening or not will it happen this year or not BlackRock Fidelity is some of the largest ETF issuers in the world have now submitted filings for ETFs with the SEC is Gary Gensler going to let them through and at this point can he even say no that's the question we raise with James safer he's a Bloomberg analyst who's tracking this thing closer than anyone I've ever met he's on the episode today and he gives us a date by which we should have a clean answer from the SEC on the Bitcoin ETF so is he over or under on the probability of the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF this year you have to listen to the entire conversation to find out I am psyched about this episode and before we begin I want to address a question that some of you might have which is why is bankless even covering the Bitcoin ETF that's not very bankless of you you might say I disagree with that and here's why I think when people buy crypto assets they buy into crypto values not all the way not all at once but a little bit at a time this is just another step forward crypto ETFs in my mind are a gateway drug a type of gateway drug I don't think people will stop with just the Bitcoin ETF in their retirement account I think that's the gateway to them setting up an exchange account for instance and buying spot Bitcoin or spot ether that way which is the gateway to going full Bank list and taking custody of their own keys in order for people to care about crypto they actually have to own crypto and this is an easy way for people to own crypto in their retirement accounts when we get more crypto ownership we get more Economic Security and we get more people who care about crypto issues in their respective jurisdictions we need a lot more people to care about crypto in the United States in order to turn the regulatory tide there's one other thing I think we get from this episode which is learning more about traditional Finance how is crypto supposed to eat traditional finance and disrupt it if we don't even understand how it works like do you understand how ETFs work today what backs them why people love them why they're popular I didn't and that's where we start this episode with James this is a college level course on ETFs from their birth in the early 90s to the Bitcoin spot ETF and the possibility of that today I'm doing this episode solo today David is off climbing mountains but he'll be back soon and uh he'll certainly be back in time for an event that you should pay attention to it's called permissionless This is the crypto conference to go to in 2023 if you only pick one and I think you should pick one the bear Market conferences are the best conferences you gotta come with David myself the rest of the bankless nation to permissionless it's happening in Austin Texas September 11th through the 13th so that's Texas Austin September 11th through the 13th and we have an absolutely stacked agenda we've got Eric Voorhees who's talking we've got Hester Pierce from the SEC commission we've got stani from Ave go click the link in the show notes get a ticket and come with us to permissionless this year all right guys it's time to go find out about this Bitcoin ETF we'll be right back with James but before we do I want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible including Kraken the

seyfert is a research analyst at Bloomberg he's got one foot in crypto on the other foot in ETFs he's currently a Bloomberg intelligence ETF analyst and he's here to drop some insight on the question I just opened with when are we going to get that Bitcoin ETF James welcome to bankless thanks for having me Ryan happy to be here you know uh we talk a lot about crypto in on Bank lists of course and so I think it's in some people some listeners they um got their first exposure to finance by way of crypto actually my co-host David Hoffman is very much like this so I don't know if David's ever purchased an ETF in his life and I think there's probably some Bank list listeners that fall into that camp too so could we start by going through some of the basics what is an ETF I think I know the acronym does that stand for exchange traded fund is that correct correct and what is this thing that we're talking about today that is 100 correct um so it's exchange traded fund it's basically people a lot of people have 401ks 403 B's these types of plans at least in the U.S and usually what you're investing in is a mutual fund and those have much longer tickers with an X at the end typically but essentially um what that means is those funds are not traded so you give money and at the end of the day they put that money to work the next day for when your money comes in and for mutual funds for 401ks and plans like that it makes complete sense it's easy you're not usually super time commitment because you're just contributing on a regular basis but an ETF is a traded vehicle and basic the real story here is that the ETFs were invented after the SEC wrote a report in 1987 there was this big crash a lot of it had to do with Futures and derivatives and the SEC said basically they wish they had something that was more physically backed rather than derivatives or derivative of different assets and basically this this guy Nate most came up with the idea for what is now um an ETF and it comes off the idea of these things called commodity Warehouse receipts those have been around forever and the idea of commodity Warehouse receipts if you think about it this way is like say you had a bunch of gold or a bunch of barrels of oil or uh whatever wheat corn you name it right and one thing that you used to be able to do is you would store that somewhere and then the warehouse would charge some sort of fee and in return they give you pieces of paper that say you have this much exposure or it was a vault or gold you would say you have this much gold and rather than moving that physical gold those physical Commodities around you trade those pieces of paper so those pieces of paper were a right to those things held in that warehouse and that's where the idea of an ETF came about and basically the first one in the US was the S P 500 and it basically those instead of Commodities being held in that warehouse it's um stocks or the S P 500 the stocks that make up the S P 500 held in um by a custodian so those stocks are held by somebody and what that means is at all times the key thing that makes an ETF work and why it's super efficient is because you can always access those underlying stocks and or in the example the Commodities you can always those access those underlying Commodities so basically those Shares are a right to your ownership of the underlying assets so in the S P 500 ETF you can always trade in shares with ETF and get back the underlying stocks into a potential Bitcoin ETF would be the same way you could always trade in the shares of the ETF and get back Bitcoin or vice versa you can always trade in Bitcoin and get back shares and what that means is we can get into this more but like one thing that I'm sure a lot of your viewers have heard about is gbtc the grayscale Bitcoin trust that operates more like what we what in our world we would call a closed end fund it's technically not one but it means ETFs have that mechanism where you can create shares and redeem shares because always the underlying can be exchanged for the shares of the product right so in grayscale's case there's no way to access the underlying Bitcoin I can't hand over gbtq gbtc shares and get back Bitcoin which is what grayscale is suing to do to try and get access to that mechanism so that you don't have a situation where the price of those shares is very different from the value of the underlying assets they hold so when you have an ETF that problem doesn't happen because you can always at some point if somebody thinks the price of the ETF is not in line with the underlying asset you can buy those shares of the ETF or buy up at the underlying asset and exchange them it's called Arbitrage they're always the same thing so basically there's some trading costs so there's my new differences there but for the most part you can always exchange shares for assets and that's what what's causing a lot of the problems in different parts of the market so the way to think about an ETF is if you're used to looking at stocks or even cryptos really right you it's you know the supply so for the most part Bitcoins bitcoin's bad example since its Supply is ever increasing but if you look at a stock typically the the supply of shares is relatively stable right you know what it is and what drives the price is that change in demand so if you think about like two bars in a graph basically the what drives the price of most assets is the change in demand right obviously Supply impacts it as well the benefit of ETFs is as demand changes you can change supplies you can add more shares to meet demand and if demand drops you can destroy shares to meet demand so that way the price and the value of the underlying asset so the price of the fund the price the value of the underlying assets are always going to be very close so that's the background of an ETF and why so many people view this as like the um the key to the holy grail for for crypto and Bridge to stradfy you just opened up probably a thousand questions in my mind and I want to get to them that that last point that you mentioned I want to draw an analogy for bankless listeners so as the demand changes you can increase the supply usdc you know a stable coin kind of works like that as well um think of that right so how much usdc can be minted well kind of pretty much as long as the US continues to give access to Pace to encircle to U.S bank accounts is kind of an unlimited Supply it's as much as as the market will demand and it sounds like ETFs work that way too so a few things just to recap so this is a newish product I guess in the in the full scope of financial products um you said it sounds like it was invented maybe in the late 1980s so it kind of took off 93 was the first one so technically I told you about that guy Nate most yeah he actually went the first ETF ever launched was technically in Canada a few years because the SEC took like three years to get comfortable with the ideas we've done this before yeah so Canada did it first and like 91 after talking with Nate most and these guys so they got it done in like a year and then we came along afterwards in the US and finally figured it out um but yeah so 93 was the first time and they're along the whole way there's been people questioning the the structure saying it was going to cause issues and they've done nothing but prove themselves as an efficient it's the way to think about it is it's a wrapper and it's a technology in a way it's a democratizing technology in the way it's been used in the tradition it's interesting that people would say that this would cause issues because actually seems much simpler than the other kind of like price exposure mechanisms based on derivatives and that sort of thing it's like because it's pretty simple it's just a wrapper for underlying assets right so like what can go wrong yeah so we don't need to get too far into the weeds here but essentially a lot of the people say like if you're looking at bonds so they all there's Bond ETFs they hold other assets that are less liquid than typical stocks but so people like think you're adding liquidity there's a lot of nuance here but essentially what it comes down to is in in the good times an ETF can be way more liquid than the underlying because people don't have to go and access the underlying Market to trade it right they can just use the ETF shares and sometimes it just trades back and forth there's a lot of market makers that can handle that but in times of stress that like excess liquidity the ETF offers is not going to be there it's not magic so basically if the underlying Market freezes up like happened in in March of 2020 during covid um those they basically the ETFs don't aren't they're not magic so if the underlying Market is locked up there's going to be issues with the ETF with an ETF you can always trade so basically like yes in the good times there's more liquidity because the ETF is there it's operating on Exchange there's market makers there's always bids and ads so if you think about a bond market it's mostly over the counter traded like literally some of it's like phone calls still like that's the way things are traded so but like basically what happens is like that the ETF will look like it's dislocated but what really ends up happening is just the underlying Market is out of whack there's not enough liquidity nobody's willing to buy or sell or there's just mismatch of what's going on so there's plenty of examples of things like that that happened in March of 2020 but all the ETFs in the US and around the world have held up extremely well and we're perfect beacons of of efficiency during that time they really like proved their medal even some of their most Ardent critics even had to come step back and admit like they did extremely well in handling the issues you sound like an ETF bull my friend yeah yeah I mean one of the the things we've always said is like we can we're going to get into a lot of this but like if the SEC had approved this thing honestly all the people in these markets these market makers that operate in this market like they're not going to let some of the the fishy stuff that has been going on in crypto like they're going to go to the exchanges that are operating cleanly they're not going to get involved in a lot of the other things that plenty of people have been involved in uh in this space So if we do get one it's going to clean things up it's going to drive down trading costs ETFs trade like pennywide very very tight so there's no transaction fees on most brokerage platforms the and then if you look at most Brokers platforms they don't really tell you what the bid ask spread is you can kind of back into it by looking at like what the trading looks like on coinbase or binance or any of those things right but you there is a spread so you know you're paying a fee typically to do the trade and then there's also a spread um between what the bid and the ask is and like usually market makers are making that money so there's a lot of money to be made in offering markets in the crypto markets and what an ETF comes about it's going to get way tighter so you'll see a lot of people who trade Bitcoin specifically in crypto markets to learn to start to use the ETF and vice versa people from the ETF world will probably go to the underlying crypto markets and make things more efficient and more liquid because you have the behemoths of the U.S trading and financial system come in I think I was first exposed to kind of the ETF concept uh just just you know earlier in my sort of a you know adulthood and early investing career through like Vanguard group and John Bogle like the the idea that hey you know what you don't have to like outperform the market you just buy buy an index fund buy a low-cost Index Fund of some sort and you'll outperform you know like 80 percent of active uh Traders out there and so it's always been a good concept and of course you want to keep your management fees low and uh my understanding is a lot of ETFs can can somewhat provide that so that's what is that a reason I mean I want to ask you who are the holders of these ETFs is it um is it like kind of large Pension funds is it sort of big money Capital Pools or is it is it mainly like individual Americans like retail investors with a Fidelity account or a Schwab account uh with their 40K money as as you alluded to earlier who who are the net buyers of these things so really it's that's the beauty of the ETF it's everyone so in the old mutual fund world what you're used to looking at in your 401k or whatever it might be if you're a US listener um there are multiple share classes so like you need to invest certain amount of money to get access to this lower fee because you get all these other things right the economies of scale whatever so they have all these different shared classes a b c i for institutional there's different things right but what the ETF did is it democratized it all so everyone's playing in the same pool so if your grandma wants to buy an ETF she's buying the same ETF as Citadel if they're looking to trade that or some other big hedge fund or pension or PE fund so really everyone is involved in this and that's the beauty of the ETF ecosystem because it incorporates everyone so you have all the liquidity from the big Trad five players who are looking to make short-term trades alongside the Mom and Pops you were talking about who some of them might be looking to do short-term trades a lot of them are just looking to buy and hold like you were talking about low-cost ETFs and hold them for a very long time they can get exposure and part of the reason they can be so cheap is because so many people are using them so many different types of people are using them how big is the ETF Market James in terms of you know assets inside of ETFs are we talking hundreds of billions are we getting into the trillions here yeah no we're definitely a trillion so like we're right around 10 trillion globally but most of that is in the US I believe we have I'm looking it up right now I think we have seven I think we're right around seven trillion um in the U.S alone uh I'll tell you the exact number 7.25 trillion where do you find that info is that like a Bloomberg terminal yeah that's a Bloomberg function um but I don't I probably vetify etf.com things like that will probably have that type of information but the though Global markets like over 10 as well but that you got to remember that includes like it holds stocks that's going to hold bonds it'll hold treasuries yeah Commodities everything you can think of if it has basically been thrown into an ETF wrapper even even cryptos just not in the US what right right we'll get we'll get there decrypta you know we're building here building our understanding here okay so uh 10 trillion dollars worldwide how much of that would guess is kind of like uh retail Mom and Pops versus like the big guys uh it's hard so a lot of the so if you look at the way the U.S market works like for the most part A lot of the money is via advisors and platforms so we can't see exactly how much is retail but a lot of people will use advisors so roughly we estimate right now that U.S advisors the people that are helping like if you went to somebody to help you manage your your money right um they they control about 30 trillion in assets and they love ETFs specifically independent advisors so um the way the old mutual funds I keep talking about used to be sold is there was basically Kickback so if you put your client into this fund you've got some money out of it and possibly into perpetuity and different things like that so basically mutual funds were sold um by people that were wholesalers and trying to get advisors to put their clients in those funds because they get more money everyone basically the money gets is kicked back all over the place ETFs it's not some of that kind of happens but it's not directly the case it's more that ETFs are bought so advisors are huge owners of this hedge funds like to use these things institutions are using these things to park money for the most part because they're super low cost so retail we don't have a like clear breakdown on that front but it's a decent chunk I would say uh at least 30 percent probably more um just because a lot of it is Buy and Hold but there's also plenty of ETFs that are not built to be bought and held some of them are built to be traded and like I said the SEC came about this because they wanted an alternative to Futures and different things that were happening so they wanted people to be able to use these and trade and there are some ETFs out there like the S P 500 from Spy and plenty of others that we refer to as like pseudo Futures where institutions are using them for liquidity so like they had they got a certain amount of money they can't put it to work fully and exactly what they want to so they're going to throw it into an ETF or like you even have mutual funds some of those guys that were talking about that are picking bonds picking stocks and what they'll do is they'll pick they'll hold an ETF in like three percent of their portfolio or four percent of their portfolio if they're a large cap manager they'll hold a large cap Equity ETF if they're a high yield Bond manager they'll hold a High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and basically they just use that like sleeve almost if you think about it as a moat around their portfolio they're picking the bonds they think are going to outperform the most give them the best whatever characteristics they're looking for and then rather than holding cash which is what they did historically which doesn't give them exposure to the market it's called Cash drag actually in the last couple years it might not have been that bad with the way rates have gone but um essentially what they do is they want to have exposure to the market but they know that ETFs are super liquid so I keep going back like everyone uses this people across the traditional Financial ecosystem are using ETFs in many different ways yeah and I'm looking at kind of a list of different ETFs you probably have a better list in your head but you know like you basically buy any collection any set of Assets in ETF so we mentioned you know the Spy S P 500 Index if you want in General stock index in the US uh you know there's a NASDAQ we've got Equity uh precious metals so you buy a gold ETF I'm sure you could buy silver I'm sure there's all sorts of other Commodities you can by Platinum Palladium you name it yeah I've seen um you know certainly yeah oil ETFs as well if you kind of want to go down the commodity stack real estate ETFs of various types I don't know if it gets as specific as like let's say I want to bet on the real estate market in California maybe that's a bit too specific but you know maybe maybe they have something like that actually they do have some stuff they have music bonds that focus on they have Muni bonds that hold focus on that so you could bet on the California Community Market um but also like the basically there are those real estate ones they don't own physical real estate they own REITs with the real estate investment trusts which have been all of the news lately because public REITs are trading very different from private reads but ETS will wrap those things as well um and hold them so give you exposure so like maybe one read specializes in like the Southwest United States so they'll have California Arizona whatever um and so you if that's what you're after you could just buy the re that's kind of similar to like buying a stock and these will give you like here's the U.S market or here's here's a Reit for like multi-family homes or stuff like that there there's it's becoming sliced and diced in different ways there are REITs out there that Focus specifically on like retail warehouses or data warehouses that hold all these servers so like if they own the real estate and people rent those warehouses to put all their servers in them and that that has been one of the best performing areas of the read market so like there's ETFs that specifically Target that so yeah there's money markets can you just buy like dollars in an ETF or something could you yeah there's actually yeah so there's some dollar ETFs that like basically they the way those work though isn't like they're just holding dollars there are money market fund ETFs elsewhere there's money market funds obviously that aren't ETFs for the most part people just use like treasury ETFs if they're looking for that type of exposure um because it just holds treasuries the treasury bills specifically you can look at t-bill ETFs um but yeah there are some money market ETFs in Canada just not in the US yet but again you get those t-bill um type ETFs and they give you a very similar exposure otherwise there's ones that basically you can bet on the direction of the US dollar so it'll go like long US dollar Futures and then shorts a basket of other currency Futures so short the Great British pound the Japanese Yen the Euro um Brazilian real like you name it so it'll tell you what it's going along and what it's going short and that's how you could bet like tactically on where the dollar is going all right for kryptonators crypto listeners um tradify uh you thought of this idea of tokenization before crypto did this looks a lot like tokenization of different assets doesn't it um okay so this other point that you raised which is like the thing that's different about ETFs is you can always access the underlying assets I think that will come into play when we talk a little bit about crypto again we're still building to the crypto conversation James but this idea of you can always access the underlying assets I want to get into the details of that right so for something like stocks it's it's weird it's interesting because like when we say the underlying assets what are we talking about actually like piece of paper like legal documents somewhere I want to contrast that from a commodity like uh gold or like oil for example where the underlying asset at the root of it is is much more clear the underlying asset is like a barrel of oil somewhere in a warehouse you know you hope so so actually so for oil it's you mentioned I've been I was debating saying this before but like oil one of the we we like to call some ETFs or like wolves and sheep's clothing because like they're simple there are no ETFs that hold physical oil because you can't really store it it costs too much money um there's a multitude of reasons there are some people like I know some people who are thinking they want to give it a try but really all the way Warehouse oil yeah that's a little Warehouse oil yeah they want but the only way to really get the oil ETS work is they they roll they they invest in Futures they invest in derivatives um which is how a lot of commodity ETFs also work except for those precious metal ones you were talking about and there are some others but all right well so let's talk about those so first let's talk about maybe the precious metal ones so if I buy a gold ETF of some sort um where is the actual gold bar you know stored and can I actually like can I actually redeem that for gold and you said you said it's always able to access the underlying assets I want to convert my my gold ETF into like you know a physical bar of gold am I actually able to do that or are there some intermediaries in between here yeah so this is going to get in the Weeds on like Market mechanics of ETFs a little bit so I'll do my best to keep it simple but essentially the way to think about it is um there are there's a few people involved in a creation Redemption process so usually it's it's what we refer to as a market maker think of those as the big trading firms the citadels if the people out there have heard of obviously people have heard of Jane Street if you're listening to your show uh virtue those are their big ETF market makers they're they're pairing trades and they will access the underlying if they have to make a trade happen or it's more efficient to do it that way than just sourcing the under the the actual shares in the exchange so I keep saying at any point you can access the underlying Market to create a redeem shares these market makers know that and they know what's more efficient is it more efficient to just Source the actual ETF shares or is it more efficient to go to the underlying market and make this happen sometimes the buy is so big that there's not enough shares to be demand so you have to go to the underlying Market to make it that might be a little more uh costly or it could be more efficient than buying those that many shares in the market like it's the same thing as like a big whale comes to a crypto market and buys a ton of Bitcoin you're going to below through the price but if you could theoretically figure out a way to buy Bitcoin more efficiently um that's how you would do it um so but the way this works is those are the market makers there's also something and called an authorized participant which has been in the grayscale situation as well and the aps are the people that facilitate that creation thing these are the huge banks with massive uh balance sheets think uh Bank of America uh Goldman there's a whole bunch of APs out there Merrill Lynch they they'll basically like they are the people that facilitate that creation of shares and Redemption of shares that work with the issuers that own these ETFs now for the most part it's these market makers and these APS that are making sure that the market is efficient in the underlying if you need to tap the underlying Market whether it's to create ETF shares or destroy ETF shares they're the ones doing it so the market makers are constantly trading every day they're dealing with the aps the aps are dealing with the issuers in some instances not to get too wonky the market makers can be an AP as well but like essentially it's these people these institutions that have specific specific licenses to operate in whatever markets that can operate in those markets and make the creations and redemptions that said that's the way most things work because for the most part you need like a hundred thousand shares of the ETF to do a career Redemption right so these are Big so like if if you that's what make like you or I or actually I don't know maybe you're a well but like if you wanted to buy an ETF it's these people in the back end that are batching the entire Market together to make sure it's operating efficiently there's a very low cost to trade um all of those things they're making sure that the ETFs are created or destroyed to for demand to meet Supply now that said there are ETFs out there like ounz um for gold ETFs this is a gold ETF and basically the the creation and redemptions are way lower the minimum so like there is going to be a cost if you owned enough you could get gold delivered to your house but that's like a special exemption that they went through to get to happen but also like most ETFs hold their gold in vaults in London um there is one that holds it in Switzerland uh there is an ETF that used to hold it at the Perth Mint in Australia so there's like all these different ways you can do it everyone has different custodians but gold is like a unique subset um so some people like the true gold bugs are like I don't trust anyone to hold my gold there's a lot of issues where people are worried about paper paper gold with Futures uh but for the most part the gold has to be stored in the vault and every share of the ETF should be backed by physical gold now sometimes the trading is literally like some guy in London goes into the Vault for the spider GLD and takes gold out and moves it to the Vault down the street for like some other trading firm or gold trading firm or whatever what may have you um but like at on to our view like that's gold leaving the trust that we we were interested in or the one we were looking at and going into a different one right that's a creation of redemption um so hopefully hopefully they're using a Brinks truck or some you know security apparatus for for that transfer but okay so no and literally sometimes it's the same building like it's just literally a different like it's moving it from one volt to another and if they didn't if they didn't move it would we really know yeah who knows yeah okay so there is like auditing and stuff and then more than the I'd like to think it's better than the auditing we've seen in the next well I couldn't it couldn't get uh worse with yeah with respect to FTX and the custody but what's interesting is like we have you know as with crypto we have like with the gold example we have an actual bear asset which is like we don't have it like it's it's kind of valuable like that's the thing possession is the asset itself it's not like Equity it's not a legal agreement or something like that that's enforced by uh some sort of uh you know legal code it is actual physical possession and but there's a clean separation of responsibilities in kind of ETFs you mentioned the aps you mentioned the the kind of the market makers and then a a third group you said is kind of the custody providers whether that's a you know somewhere in Perth in Australia or that's somewhere some some vault in um in London these are not the same entities right like the vault is not the AP is not the market maker generally these are there's some clear division of responsibilities is that approximately right that is correct which is one of the things that the SEC is going after coinbase for in this lawsuit they want them to break up their brokerage their custody all those things into separate legal entities cool um you know I I you know I appreciate the coinbase or sorry uh the SEC is like asking for these things but it's also not providing a clear way to actually do that which is this weird scenario we're in okay but so if I own a gold ETF it's pretty much like it's pretty rare to own an ETF where um I could actually get the gold bar delivered to my house maybe there's kind of one of those um well well so for the average person if you had millions of dollars in there you could ask absolutely get the gold right like you could like it would not be a problem but like for the average person who's not going to have millions of dollars in the CTF I don't even know with gold it's so weird though it's like let's say I had millions of dollars of gold like would I just show up with my like minivan or something like loading yes so like Canada specifically does they have ETFs that do this as well the the Canadian Royal Mint has had they're actually I don't even think they're technically ETFs but they operate like ETFs yeah um you can do the same thing right you you can get it delivered to your house essentially like I I don't know exactly what it looks like uh but I imagine like basically it brings truck would show up um but I'm sure if you're moving enough money it's not you're not going to have it delivered to your your house okay so you could but Bitcoin obviously is different because of the way it's transmitted and stored and we can get into that and to be clear who is responsible for approving ETFs who's kind of The Gatekeepers as somebody in government is this always the SEC you have to it's always nasty you have to register there are different divisions in the SEC that make these decisions on different ETFs but it's always the SEC the one that we're specifically uh these issuers are dealing with right now and the one that has been the traditional hold up is a place called the division of markets and trading but it's really SEC and it comes down to Gary Gensler he's the overarching head if basically they do what he says for the most part so uh Gary Gary gansler or the the current whatever who are that whoever the current chair of the SEC is basically Emperor king of like um well you know giving the this final sign off for an ETF is that it yeah pretty much but the thing is here like the way that you might have seen like notice about like some of these Republican Senators who are pro-crypto trying to change the way the SEC is set up but basically there's there's um four Commissioners and then also uh chairman and usually it's two Republicans two Democrats that's the way it works so then the chairman is the one that has like the overriding power because typically it's two verse two so theoretically if you were if somebody was able to swing which I wrote about in one of my notes one of these Commissioners basically did that could change things as well because like Gary would be outvoted um but the the Hester purse which I'm sure anyone listening knows who that is crypto mob um she has dissented on multiple ETF denials in the past her most recent the most recent descent came this year and for the first time the new commissioner joined her under Descent of the sec's decision to deny um Vanek and I don't I think it was vanak this most recent one but whoever it was they they wrote a descent letter kind of like you would see from like the the Supreme Court dissent from judges that disagree so um if they get one of those other Commissioners to agree with them one of those two Dems against Gary then all of a sudden this thing is likely to get approved so it's not as cut and dry as like Gensler is fully in charge but like 95 chance that Gensler is the one making decisions here because and and you gotta remember he reports to the Democratic party right um I think Elizabeth Warren um the the there's a lot of jokes about her like getting orders from Elizabeth Warren but there really is a lot of ties to that side of the the Democratic party um and what's going on here but let's draw that out because um shouldn't the ETF process us or maybe I'm asking a question of historically how has it been so who are the issuers of ETFs who are filing and asking for the sec's um you know permission to do this this is a small collection of of very large companies or is it pretty uh you know distributed and diverse and what's the process I I would assume that we've had a process in place for Regulators to be somewhat uh neutral and to have kind of guidelines and rules but they can't I would assume they can't necessarily pick winners or losers right like I have friends at at BlackRock uh versus like you know I hate Goldman or whatever and I'm going to choose one issuer over the other what's this approval process been like historically for uh traditional Finance so let's just say that they can do that and they do do that and I'll go into why they do that but they basically can make their decision and back into it legally but wait wait they can be biased however they want the technically they shouldn't be but they can already that you would have to prove it and I that grayscale is trying to prove that in court right now right but for the most part they have been biased and some of the things that they're doing um and it's definitely coming down from what the Democratic side of the the ticket wants to have so it's already criticized prior to crypto you would say is this like kind of like a part of it so like on the inside yeah so I would say like the Winklevoss twins tried to do this first in 2013 right they were small they got denied they tried again they ended up getting denied again in 2018 that was the first time that Hester purse dissented on a decision I would argue that the denial then actually kind of made sense because the way that the Winklevoss application was constructed um I don't we don't need to get into the Weeds on that but it's a lot of different issues so I'm looking now I have 40 different filings for spot ETFs and 37 different filings for futures ETFs what do you mean you have them you're just seeing them I just look at a list yeah I have a list of like it's literally an Excel spreadsheet of where I track them and I can look at the links and see what the SEC is saying about them and all the above I try to track everything that's going on um it's basically so when I first came to bi I was covering Commodities and we added crypto and I had already um owned crypto personally and was interested in it personally and I reported to Mike mcloone who's our Commodities analyst who covers crypto heavily as a strategist and then I reported to Eric Bell Tunis who is my boss who covers ETFs and eventually I got moved up and I'm specifically in the ETF side but that experience of my personal experience covering crypto from a strategy side of point of view and having all my ETF knowledge made this like ETF potential fun uh crypto stuff was like my squarely in my wheelhouse um so that's why like I was tracking this stuff already on my own and it was made a complete no-brainer to start writing about it so how many on those lists are crypto related in your queue do you say it was like 40 or so so a lot of them have been denied there's only eight that are currently active for on the spot side but if you look at all the filings you're at let me see yeah you're at 40 plus 37 you're at 77 total filings 30-ish issuers how many how many uh filings so far if you include the ones that have been denied and are active and these are Bitcoin ETF filings to be clear not just Bitcoin they're crypto but some of them each Futures ETF a couple of them are each spot which had no shot of ever getting approved but I guess people figured they'd try um but uh yes 77 different filings and there's some others that you could argue that will are kind of like uh crypto ETS but they're a little they might hold a little bit of Futures but they also hold some other stuff so um but yes 77 different ETFs are have either been approved denied or um are kind of like in limbo right now waiting to see if they get approved well jumping back to that question about the the neutrality of of kind of a regulator like how are they supposed to go through the process of approving an issuer but and then also contrast that with how it it happens practically for um like for requests outside of crypto yeah so the SEC is supposed to be a disclosure regulator they're not a just a merit regular so there are some countries that have Merit Regulators that decide whether an investment has any Merit and should be allowed the sec's job is to do basically have they disclosed all the risks they're not saying whether or not something is a good or bad investment and that's stated in the in the law that that yeah yeah exactly so Hester has written dissent saying we're getting danger dangerously close to being a merit regulator which is a key term that like I think a lot of people don't realize how strong that statement is um but they they're really doing a really good job of Towing that line and I would argue they've kind of crossed it but it's more of a gray Zone than like a black and white they're saying this is a bad investment which is not something they should do okay so they're supposed to be basically a new chair neutral regulator uh if they're not supposed to make merit-based decisions and what that means effectively is you know they may personally think that um gold is just a you know a coin asset or whatever ever it's like completely useless they might hate it um but they cannot you know have that determination in in their rulings right they they have to be neutral with respect to what they decide to allow retail ETF investor not all ETF investors exposure to or not and that's different than some other regulatory apparatuses outside of the United States is that approximately correct yeah so the way to think about it is their job is to prevent fraud manipulation anybody getting taken advantage of that's what they're there to do they want to make sure that's not happening and honestly some of the stuff that they've done that has been questionable has probably saved some people from getting rugged that's happened in crypto space but I would also make the argument that they should have been going after these um these actors before or anything ever happened but that's a whole different discussion but the the way that the process works so there's there's two ways that this works so basically this all goes back to the 1933 act in the 1940 act which are just laws about the U.S financial markets Securities markets we you don't need to get two in the weeds there this is where the SCC was formed it wasn't an SCC previous to this right yeah I uh yes so essentially the way that it initially worked was like everyone had to go through this 19b4 process which is essentially where what we're doing right now with these spot applications and what that means is there it's exchanges that apply to the SEC for a proposal for a rule change and at the end of the day the rule change is to be able to list the spot Bitcoin ETF right um and those are specifically for ETFs that are under the 1933 act in 2019 this they made this rule called an ETF rule for anything that's under the 1940 act 1940 I think things that hold Securities that are Diversified uh there's more requirements on those on those types of products um they made the rule because before this everyone had to file 19 before to launch an ETF right for if it was remotely new now under the 40 act it's just a more simple process you apply and you have after 75 days the prospectus or the application to launch a fund goes live and you can start trading it before those if those in those 75 days the SEC can say no no good you can't launch and then it's bounced but it's not the same process of the 19v4 process Futures ETFs the first one that came out were launched under that process because the STC didn't have to trading a markets didn't have to okay anything that happens with those applications because they're 1940x products because the Futures ETFs they hold treasuries and you can argue that holding treasuries and Futures is Diversified portfolio and therefore they can fit under the 40 act which is the same reason that all these Futures ETFs they actually all got denied in June because they applied in the SEC within a week was like no take them back the 19 before process is the process that we're going to spend most of the time talking about which is what spot Bitcoin ETFs have to go through and that process like I said is for the proposal of a rule change can you define that term uh spot Bitcoin ETF spot Bitcoin what's the significance of saying spot Bitcoin versus just Bitcoin ETF yeah so we have Bitcoin Futures ETFs which like a Futures ETF typically the way it works is most of them hold like the front month Futures Contract so a Futures Contract basically means you enter an agreement to either buy or sell Bitcoin at the end of a month on a given date and you can trade that right to do that or the the ability to do that via Futures contracts but the problem with that is that like I said it's every month so right now if you're holding a front month Futures Contract for Bitcoin you're gonna have to sell it towards the end of July and then buy the August contract right and typically the way these markets work they work in like where they're in contango so the July contract is maybe priced here and then the August contract might be priced just a little bit above sometimes that can get steeper or not but that means you're selling low and buying high and it eats away your return so this is constant churning of holding things of holding these Futures can be bad detrimental long-term returns that said these Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been in the market have done very well uh historically they if they had launched a few years ago they would have vastly underperformed the spot Market or physical Market as you can also call it but it's really just the Futures Market versus the spot market and the Holy Grail here would be to have a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF meaning the the Bitcoin is stored in cold storage somewhere and you have the shares of the ETF are a right to the underlying asset in this case about Bitcoin whereas in the Futures ETFs that the SEC has approved you have a right to those Futures contracts so we want spot Bitcoin because it's just a much better user experience right I I can't imagine if I was purchasing sort of a Bitcoin ETF in my fidelity account as a retail user and I'm trying to deal with like selling at the end of the month to buy the kind of the next month and just what terrible user experience Compares yeah so for the ETF you don't have the ETF does that for you so it does that for you so but that rolling is the problem right and it's not actually holding spot Bitcoin it's it's paper exposure it's derivative exposure okay um so a lot of people prefer not to handle that so we talk about oil ETFs before sometimes those things can go into massive contango where like uh the next contract is super expensive or backwardation which is where the current contract is more expensive than the next one so I don't know if some of you guys probably remember when oil went negative in 2020 that caused a lot of problem for these oil ETFs um but because like I said they all hold Futures to get their exposure so I if I'm recalling correctly and you might remember the full history so correct me if I'm wrong here James but I I think when a Gensler took over that was when maybe the Bitcoin Futures ETF what was approved somewhere around there am I wrong with that yeah so he was already in charge um he took over after the Ripple lawsuit had been filed but so that's what most people associate with him and after coinbase went um was like approved to go public but he is the reason that we have Futures ETFs he gave a speech in Late July Gensler once 2021 and this is not verbatim but he essentially said they had denied all Futures ETS up to this point and at the end of the speech he was talking about a little bit of crypto and he said we look forward to applications for Bitcoin Futures ETFs filed under the 1940 act that one line in like a relatively longish speech and then like everyone filed for a spot for a Futures Bitcoin ETF and sure enough we got one approved in November we also have an 8th one too right and ether one no we don't have any we don't yes yeah so they've applied but they haven't been approved so the SEC will not approve ethereum Futures ETFs um largely we Kenzo the one thing where he he will admit is the security is not a security is is Bitcoin and he won't say the same now for ethereum which has been covered extensively so yeah I don't think he's going to allow those things anytime soon okay but but because of that statement and because of us talking to the people is why in September or October of 2021 why we were so bullish on the fact that we were going to get a launch and we actually were very uh different from a lot of our counterparts at the Trad five space saying that this launch was going to happen and most people were just banking on history and what the SEC has typically done and saying no shot that this thing gets approved and that's where we made a name for ourselves I I guess honestly on on the on that front so why is Gensler in favor of kind of the the Futures uh Bitcoin ETF style and not the spot Bitcoin ETF like what like so I can tell you his argument what's the difference okay yeah his argument is it's their their CME Futures so um they are covered by the cfdc it's a regulated market um there is not going to be any manipulation of those Futures contracts um that's what they would say but the the real fact of the matter is the pricing of the Futures markets are dictated by something called the Bitcoin reference rate and the Bitcoin reference rate is based off of a bunch of spot markets including coinbase Kraken and a few other Gemini some other so it's literally the price of those Futures contracts is determined by um an aggregate uh of the spot market value of Bitcoin okay well uh Gary's a smart guy I mean he surely knows what you just said right so that's what he said what do you think the real reason is uh do you care to speculate I don't know why he I think I think the problem is they couldn't deny they realized they were going to run into issues with the fact that the cftc had approved these things and let them list they are not making an argument that Bitcoin is security and basically saying that you can't launch these ETFs first of all the the like I said it goes under a different process so it didn't go through division of training and markets so these things kind of got a little bit of a green light because they didn't have to go through the same process then 19 before so yeah Gensler kind of gave that to the crypto community and it's what's biting him now so ironically there were other ETFs that were filed before Gensler made that speech and this 19b4 process takes 240 days um basically you file um the SEC can bounce it back to you for changes and then you can refile but essentially it starts a clock and the clock goes 45 days and you have to approve delay deny 45 days 90 days and then at the end of 60 days after that you either have to approve or deny there is no more delaying and there were was an occupation from a company that is a commodity CTF provider to Graham that had filed before against or gave that speech for a 33 act one that goes to this 19 before process and I wrote about this six months before it happened but I said this is putting the SEC in an absurd place to be like they approved these Futures ETFs under the 40 act um and now we have 33 act applications that are fundamentally very there's very little difference between the two of them um and the SEC is going to have to decide how hard they're going to stay on this 19b4 process in approving them versus not not approving them and what they did is they approved this ETF and the argument they made so one of the reasons why all ETFs have been denied just because there is no surveillance of an underlying market and they specifically say they want surveillance uh surveillance sharing agreements or they want a regulated spot Market of significant size and the two keywords that are regulated market and significant size and the way that they got around those this is where I said they can kind of back into what they want the way they got around those requirements for the CME Futures Market because if you talk to somebody in crypto they would tell you there's billions of dollars trading in Futures markets in Europe and on these exchanges and what have you but um specifically regulated crypto regulated Futures markets the SEC basically said that it was a regulated market of significant size with respect to itself so the CME Futures Market is a regulated market of significant size because it's a market of significant size because the entire Market they were looking at was not nothing but the CME Futures market so like they can kind of like make they can kind of back into whatever reason that's what I kind of hinted at before so that's a good example of like what the SEC will do just to make sure they can do things the way that they want to and that in that application they spent Pages upon Pages explaining why they were going to prove that Futures ETF and still not allow spot ETFs and then a couple months later we got the grayscale denial which we also fully expected and grayscale has sued and now that's where we are guys I think we're gonna get to the crypto part of this conversation all in on whether we're going to get a Bitcoin ETF anytime soon I've got a lot more questions for James but before we do I want to

okay you mentioned that the SEC can basically back into whatever they want and it's seems like they're having trouble maybe keeping their story straight with all the different things they've said and actions they've taken is there like a real reason that the SEC and Gensler is not just approving a Bitcoin ETF okay surveillance all of this type of thing is it I mean crypto will just tell you I mean there's definitely um a lot of conspiracy theories here of course but the simple explanation seems to be Gary Gensler and some political body uh within the government does not want to propagate crypto any further and so they're just trying to hold the line for as long as possible and delay things for as long as possible because they don't like crypto is it as simple as that James or have you seen anything in your journey here to uh to bring up kind of an alternative alternative explanation for all this um that I would say that's a huge part of it but you also like it's part of it the other side of that is one that sounds very wrong but at the same time like look what's happened with FTX look what's happened with Celsius I mean those are the ones that seem to be ones that committed really bad acts then you have Prime trust also and then you have the companies that went down with them whether or not they committed bad acts and block fi and Voyager I mean we can name all of them right and this kind of gives Credence to the sec's argument as far as I'm concerned right there is some well Dustin let me ask you this though but like if they to your point earlier I think you made this point that um if we do get an ETF it'll clean things up right I mean like the reason that people um had to trust an FTX or felt like they did wanted to trust the Celsius or something else is because our regulator our gatekeeper wouldn't go through the process of approving a regular um spot Bitcoin ETF do you think that argument has any merits like I mean people crypto don't want to get ripped off either so so how about The Regulators um create some Alternatives rather than just setting up blockers all the time do you lend any credibility to that argument I lend a lot of credibility of that argument so like I I find that when I'm on Trad Phi um type uh we'll say podcast but it's really anything loaded if it's a client call I find that I talk about that side a lot more than the side I spoke about earlier because they focus on that side so basically the whole thing is like there's two sides of the coin here um but I agree with everything you said um the problem is that also I would say some of the some of it wasn't people never bought DTF because they were chasing Celsius and those other actors because they were promising like whatever unimaginable returns and people didn't do their research didn't understand how it was actually working it feels like the Spiderman meme of all the Spider-Man like just pointing at each other and blaming each other all right so uh something new it feels like has happened this year but I I want you to tell us if uh there really is anything new here of course you said there was 77 different applications for Bitcoin ETFs or crypto ETFs over the years but this year some new participants have thrown their hat in the ring one of which is Blackrock it's very interesting uh earlier this week as well we had Larry Fink doing kind of the that's the BlackRock CEO uh doing kind of a mainstream media tour and talking good things about uh Bitcoin and about crypto in general which is very interesting because you know six years earlier uh he had called it I think the direct quote as an index Bitcoin is an index for money laundering uh so definitely a change maybe some education that that happened maybe just changed his mind maybe has a product to sell I don't know uh believe what you want to about that but BlackRock entering a nine trillion dollar asset manager the largest in the world is that different uh there's also a stat here where they've done like over 500 different ETF applications and they only missed once uh is like uh so they don't often miss once they file applications so that feels new is there something new here or is this more of the same so the one when we go basically coindesk broke the news that they were going to file and we saw it and we me and Eric and other people are team are like whoa and in the industry we're like is can this be true sure enough few hours later we got the filing hit and we were like my eyes were wide open you were not expecting this so let me explain what we were expecting so like one BlackRock is the only new entrant everybody else has already tried this this year so the only new entrance to this space to try and launch one of these is Blackrock like even Fidelity they had tried previously yes yes multiple times actually um so there's been multiple people that everyone else who's doing this has already done it in the past aside from BlackRock that said we always expected BlackRock no matter at one point they were going to launch a Bitcoin ETF particularly after they partnered with coinbase last year for for different things they they use coinbase for their institutional their institutional clients they use them for pricing into their Aladdin some technology that BlackRock sells which we don't get into but they've had a partnership with coinbase they we knew they weren't shying away but BlackRock is so big they have so much distribution they have so much marketing power um we didn't think they were going to waste time just fighting with the SEC to get this thing launched we figured it would get approved and then BlackRock would file and they were they would be ready to go so this caught us by surprise not that BlackRock filed at all but that they were filing to fight with the SEC to get this thing out the door first you just thought they'd be a fast follow after somebody else gets it approved then of course blackrock's gonna throw their hat in the ring but like why be you know Machining your way through the jungle and be kind of a lead here yeah exactly and honestly you mentioned that that Fink interview that was like way stronger than I expected him to like we always so one thing we also knew once they filed this we knew Larry signed it off on this right Larry is one of the biggest figures in in traditional finance and we knew that if BlackRock filed this they knew they were going to start a race right they knew they were gonna if they filed that everyone else was going to file after them because it's just the way the the way things have worked historically the key difference here with what BlackRock offered in their filing is they said they were entering into a surveillance agreement with a spot Bitcoin ET trading provider um we guessed at the time that it was coinbase uh subsequently we learned it was definitively coinbase after the SEC made them name it before they could fully file um so uh that's the big difference so they entered into a surveillance sharing agreement I mentioned those earlier that's what the SEC has said when they denied all of these they want a surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size I a lot of people initially said no way coinbase is not a market of significant size I've written notes that debate the opposite because it is the largest Bitcoin trading pair with US dollars they are the largest U.S exchange they are the largest exchange that accepts US dollars as an on-ramp so with in our mind uh it is a market of significant size the biggest Market is obviously binance uh but binance all that is done on stable coins like tether and true USD and things that the government really doesn't like as it is anyway so um I think it is a marketing in size and then everyone else jumped on board to try and get this now one thing I said that I want to correct is I said BlackRock filed technically these 19 B4 filings are filings from um the exchanges that they're partnered with so in this case it was NASDAQ that filed this in partnership with BlackRock but it's a NASDAQ application and then we have other nicey New York Stock Exchange and CBOE has partnered with other issuers to also file them well that seems to let lend a bit more credibility to I don't know how this works but when you say NASDAQ plus BlackRock is filing rather than just uh you know BlackRock um that's very interesting or NASDAQ on on their behalf but is this also with kind of the comments this week from um Larry Fink is this also a signal from uh BlackRock or like are they trying to broadcast something are they trying to say hold on U.S Regulators you've gone a little bit too far we actually want to lean into this asset class and if you're not going to let us do it in the U.S then we're going to fall behind all the other jurisdictions is this uh kind of a coordinated pushback is there a signal or should we should I not read that into uh what the messages that are going on here so I would say like that that's putting your tin foil hat on a little bit that might be the case honestly we also thought that it's because of BlackRock let's be clear BlackRock is the gorilla in the room right BlackRock is 31 33 of us ETF assets Vanguard is 28 and then everybody else is nowhere close right so it's BlackRock and bear guard Vanguard is never will never file for a Bitcoin ETF if I had to guess maybe very far down the line but why are they just they're more conservative it's not they don't have a gold ETF it's not something they believe in that's not something they do um uh they're low-cost index equity and bonds that's what they do right like that's what they specialize in um they don't even have a gold ETF Jack boldel didn't believe John Vogel didn't believe in investing in gold to be ex and he hated crypto and Bitcoin but he's not there anymore they've changed a lot of things that he didn't like he also didn't like ETFs I thought they promoted too he he thought they promoted too much trading um he much preferred the old mutual fund index fund cheap yeah um for stocks yeah he was a yeah exactly Eric baltunas my boss has written a note basically says like D5 people can learn a thing from like from Jack Vogel stations you learned that yeah I forgot where I was going with that but well let me just ask you so um BlackRock filing is that just slam dunk like it's going to happen now or is it that not the case because I've given you like that track record which you you you know I think maybe I probably read it from a tweet that you put out which is yeah once out of 500. yeah it's five we've said 575 I think the technical number is 546 if I'm upon like super close inspection that we could find but we could be missing some but either way it's over 500 they've only lost one and that one that they lost it was for something called a non-transparent active ETF or we call them ants active non-transparent and it's just a structure that doesn't have the same like most ETFs are fully transparent so you can see what's in the ETF every single day when it's trading you know exactly how much of each stock or Bond or whatever and this is like where it's kind of hidden a little bit so people can't front run you and that was in 2014 and they approved these things in 2018 I think 2019 so something like that but It ultimately did get approved uh they were just early uh so that's a good sign um the other point is like if you look at bitto which is the first Futures Bitcoin ETF in the US that thing got one and a half billion dollars in two days that has 96 of the Bitcoin Futures ETF assets and 99 I don't know what the numbers are but it's like nine over it's in the 90s it's the one billion trading 1 billion in two days is that good one it's that was the best launch ever if so the previous record was GLD the gold ETF in 2004 which hit over a billion in three days which let's be clear a billion dollars in 2004 is worth a lot more than a billion dollars in 2021 but it did that's the way we we kind of having to look at it okay yeah but even still bitto would have beat it because they went to 1.5 after two days so it wasn't like they just cracked the one billion dollar Mark so um and but the problem is like they're a first move Advantage right so if BlackRock thinks they could possibly be first and get that type of exposure and charge relatively High fees compared to what they're used to charging um the the odds don't have to be very high for them to take that swing right like if the if the benefit was not that high maybe they wouldn't have taken this risk but I think the this is me Playing devil's advocate a bit like they don't have to like even if they think the odds are 10 or 20 they could be out first like the benefit of getting that what they think maybe two billion dollars in a week or 10 billion dollars in a year and charging 50 60 70 basis points on that is very strong even for BlackRock despite the amount of assets they have that's a lot of margin that they can get so like the benefit of being first and doing that is pretty strong so and the downsides are yeah so what they have another loss on the record and they piss off some people at the SEC like there's very little downside in my eyes but that said BlackRock is not in the game of filing things willy-nilly just throwing spaghetti at the wall right this is not a company that's going to do that this is not a company that's just gonna jump into this uh without doing their due diligence and they also have very close ties with the government they've done some of the they've helped the government do like different exchanges the FED do different things with buying programs so there's a lot of I don't want to say it's not a revolving door but it kind of is there's a lot of people that are at BlackRock who are at the SEC and vice versa um so uh I mean this is a close relationship there there has to be some political pressure building on the SEC to to kind of do something and this is why I'm just like totally speculating but it feels like it's it's never been closer even though the SEC is is you know in 2023 especially been very anti-crypto I mean this feels pretty big but you you do think still James there is there is a possibility there's always a possibility but like it's not a remote possibility that uh Gary and the SEC could still deny BlackRock that's still on the menu right yeah yeah let's be I'll be very blunt if you look at all the things that they have said and written over the last three years this will be denied but there's a lot there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that um it will be approved it goes back to what I said they can back into whatever decision they want to um okay so you said two things there uh James I want to be clear so you think that um if you look at the his like the the history of the last three years and what they've kind of you know said then it looks like it's a denial yet when you look at the circumstantial evidence you think that it's maybe pointing to an approval yep exactly so like BlackRock jumping in uh we think grayscale is going to win their lawsuit so grayscale's lawsuit is hinging it's called an administrative procedures act if you were in the U.S and you heard about like some overturning of the EPA saying they overreach their bounds and stuff that the Supreme Court has done the administrative procedures act basically says like you overstep your power or you didn't treat like situations alike and that's what this one is and grayscale's whole basis is like you can't approve Futures ETFs and then not approved spot ETFs because the Futures Market in the spot Market are completely intertwined which is an argument that everyone has been making since the Futures ETFs were approved but the SEC has basically said there's still no way to detect fraud and manipulation in the underlying spot Market which again is a kind of an overreach from anything they've done for other commodity ETFs like they don't like if that was the case then we shouldn't have oil ETFs because OPEC is completely manipulating that market right like so so you can push arguments and push buttons in any different way that you want um but yeah so there's a lot of circumstantial things but we think the SEC is going to lose that lawsuit to grayscale and what that means is the judges will almost certainly say look you can't deny for the reasons you gave go back to the drawing board and either the SEC is going to have to approve grayscales application that they're they're suing over which is to convert gbtc to an ETF or they're gonna have to deny for other or those same reasons and additional reasons on top of it that make it so that the situations are not like for like so there's pressure building from multiple angles here not only do you have like you know Larry Larry Fink and you BlackRock and kind of the 7 27 previous application for crypto ETFs you also have this grayscale lawsuit and what's the timeline around the grayscale lawsuit like is there any like when would the court have to make a decision by yeah so with the the decision need to be done and if we it doesn't have to be done so that's not the courts kind of like roll through things right but our litigation analyst Elliot Stein who I work with expected it by the end of before the end of the third quarter so that's before the end of September um so in the next couple months here we're expecting it decision wow really the one but the one thing I would say to caveat everything we just said the circumstantial evidence is there's hard evidence that the SEC is suing coinbase and they're the people that are going to be the custodian for this BlackRock ETF they are going to be the surveillance sharing agreement partner and but this is obviously they're suing coinbase over other things not Bitcoin exactly that's the key Point here right the SEC is Bitcoin is one thing that Gary will admit is commodity it's not a security he's suing coinbase and finance Finance for every different thing syracusing finance a fraud manipulative practices wash trading spoofing all the things you can you name it they're accusing behind and stuff they're not accusing coinbase of that they're saying they're basically an unregistered Securities broker um because they're trading Securities on their platform so that in my mind if if Gary and the SEC are going to back down anywhere and give like bend a little bit on this front it'll be on the Bitcoin so yeah that's nowhere else that's what it's felt like to me but of course you you know better um but um so are you over under on a spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of 2023 so this goes back so now we gotta get into the detail that's something we didn't talk about okay when BlackRock filed there was so I talked about 19 before process right so you submit the application The Exchange sends it to the SEC and the SEC has some time period before they have to accept it and acknowledge it or they send it back and they basically say you didn't do this with BlackRock that's what they did with all the CBOE filings uh vanack bitwise that nicey um you name it Invesco and Galaxy Wisdom Tree they sent them all back and said you can't submit this with the surveillance sharing agreement without telling us who it is and giving us this happened recently wasn't this yes yeah this is a Wall Street Journal article okay and which was not surprising the SEC was never going to approve these things because these filings said they were going to enter into an SSA right um so it wasn't surprising that they shot them back but the key difference here is that 21 shares which is an ETF issuer in Europe they own they launch they have the most crypto ETFs launched in Europe based in Switzerland um but they partner with Arc which is a big ETF issuer here in the US to launch an ETF they were denied recently this is Art this is Kathy Woods are Kathy Wood she's partnered with Kathy Wood so Kathy Wood has been on the board for um 21 years we actually just did a podcast yesterday two days ago with the president of 21 shares um if anyone's interested so she gave us some insight into what they're seeing on their end um but that's on the trillions podcast sorry to promote something no no in the in the show notes um so Julian's podcast okay yeah that's that's belch Eunice's podcast um so uh they filed so they were denied them and Van EK were denied and then the SEC I told you issued those to send letters but after they were denied Arc and 21 shares got right back on the horse and applied again um I'm pretty sure it was so they basically applied not too long after we heard the oral arguments in the grayscale case um and that's when we got we were like after hearing the judge's conversation with the grayscale lawyers and the SEC lawyers we were confident that grayscale had a legitimate shot to win the case not guaranteed obviously beats my litigation analyst put it at like a 70 odds of Grace go winning and we talked about what that means really but uh they filed so I think they filed because of that right and they wanted to have an application outstanding with the SEC so they submitted that on April 25th and then the SEC acknowledged it on May 9th so the only application that's active in that 19b4 process where I talk about that 45 day 45 day 90 60 day process the only ETF that was active or the application that was active was Arc 21 shares in partnership with cboa so then BlackRock dropped this application on June 15th CBOE and a bunch of issuers and nicey and bitwise filed suit and they were bounced back by the SEC and then the first one we saw was r21 shares submitted an amendment so basically their clock has already started so we have a date we have dates on when we know the SEC needs to issue a response delay deny approve for Arc 21 shares all the other ones were sent back and bounced back to the issuers and the exchanges and they had to refile the SEC hasn't acknowledged those and basically acknowledge means they post it to the Federal Register but like it's essentially the SEC says we got these and they post them to their website and then we get dates of when these things are going to happen but the only ETF that we know exactly what those dates are right now is our 21 shares and the next the fun the interesting thing is the SEC on June 15th um came out and issued arcan 21 shares a delay but the deadline was until June 29th so they were the SEC was required to respond with a delayed deny approved by June 29th and they delayed on June 15th the day that BlackRock and NASDAQ filed their application the next date is is August 13th now again the SEC that's a deadline that can go before that but at the end of that 240-day time period is January 10th of 2024. so we will have an answer by January 10 2024 at the very least um and and okay so this this would be basically like the 21 shares uh the arc one that you mentioned that's kind of the leader right that's the first one and like the way it would be very difficult for the SEC to deny this one and then like approve some of the others in queue right so is that why you're thinking that this January 10th 2024 date is kind of the the last and final cannot be delayed any longer date on which this entire crop of ETFs in this season in this cycle given this political climate um will either be approved or denied yeah so let's be very clear Valkyrie has also followed a NASDAQ so they also NASDAQ is either when they're they're further along in their agreement with coinbase we don't know exactly where it is but there's different language so um in the first filings we saw expecting to enter into a surveillance sharing agreement right expecting so the CBOE still said that in their amendments and they named coinbase but the BlackRock one said they executed a term sheet to enter in a surveillance group so there's like they I don't know exactly what all these mean from a legal perspective CBOE says their time term sheet is already ready to go to but essentially BlackRock and NASDAQ most specifically NASDAQ is further along than CBOE and nicey right so they have gotten further along in the process so if for some reason which I can't I don't think this is going to happen that like CBOE can't enter into an SSA with with coinbase that's the one thing that differentiates BlackRock and nasdaq's application um then maybe they could deny our 21 shares and approve BlackRock but that would be shock that would be absolutely shocking to me but also what the SEC could do is they could approve like I said there's all those deadlines but the SSD can make a decision whenever they want right they just have to have a decision before those deadlines for example they went 14 days on Arc and delayed it um initially I thought that um the first deadline's August 13th with the Savannah sharing information if they delay there then it's probably just going to get denied the more I look at it the more I talk to people this is going to require a long conversation this is this whole process is going to be a back and forth between these issuers the exchanges and the SEC so I would say now that if they do delay at the first instance of the BlackRock and all these other applications and Arc 21 shares in August I expect blackrock's deadline to be I'll tell you right now I'm estimating because it depends when like I said the SEC doesn't always acknowledge them on the same time frame but it'd be like the the first week of of September that we would get a delayed deny approve on the BlackRock and other ones got it so this is all kind of coming to a head over the you know next few months and this this also matches the January 10th might be might be a date at least for the 21 shares Arc one 2024 um but this also is interesting timing with the grayscale case which you said a decision could be made you don't know when but September is the possibility here so all of these dates are kind of like uh narrowing in by the way just a quick um a side quest on the grayscale thing gbtc that was um a I think a cause or folks in crypto have said that not having an ETF and being reliant on gbdc caused a whole Cascade of of shitty things to happen in 2024 right we had three hours Capital insolvency which let this yeah I have strong views here give me your very strong views okay because yeah so there's a crypto narrative around something that you know like people want to blame the gpdc and the SEC not approving an ETF and others will say well that had nothing to do with it what's your take James it did have something to do with it a lot of these applications have said including grayscale in their applications to prove it's like this product is broken retail and the sec's goal is to protect investors right and this product is broken a lot of retail investors got hurt or have been hurt by the the huge discount and one of the arguments has historically been look at what we have in the market now there's already things out there people are using microstrategy to get exposure like an ETF is a proven rapper that we know that's so crazy investors by the way that we have to use microstrategy and Michael Saylor as a proxy to getting Bitcoin exposure in a public uh that's crazy yes it's but the SEC has come back and said they don't take that into consideration and look they're trading is in markets um way that they're looking at things right they just basically said they don't care about that that's not something they're worried about they acknowledge the situation the flip side of this which I do agree with all those things said is we might not have found out the that 3ac and FTX were doing without this entire blow up it could have gone on longer exactly if the SEC had approved these things we might not have caught all this this fraud um blatant fraud that happened or I guess I shouldn't say blatant because it hasn't been proven yet but it's it's likely to be seemed pretty blatant in the FTS yeah ftx's case ftx's case but I mean you look at three AC which arguably triggered like what's some like they were also triggered by the Luna stuff so it was all kind of related um Genesis is having issues because of this block Phi was heavily invested in the gbtc stuff um it doesn't look like block five necessarily you're saying but like you're saying you're like well the ETF is not approving the ETF is is to blame here but like consider yourself blessed crypto Market this needed to happen this is a cancer that needed to be caught up uh cut out at this point in time it would have just uh consumed the entire body if we had another like three to five years for this malignant tumor to to kind of grow and it would be continuous leverage and doing things yeah so I I tweeted to the day I made the argument that like you know like this might have been like one of the best things the SEC could have done for the long-term health of the the crypto and Bitcoin Market specifically uh well because they didn't allow people to get out of it basically it comes down to the fact that people couldn't access access the underlying value of the Bitcoin in gbtc which you can do an ETF so because they couldn't access the underlying big value of Bitcoin they couldn't like cover up all the other they were doing I didn't expect to come near to the end of this episode and and say thanks Gary but maybe maybe that's a part of the conclusion here uh just a couple other points before we um uh before we depart on this uh on this issue so one is that Bitcoin ETF spot Bitcoin ETFs are already uh outside of the US this is already happening in other jurisdictions is that correct yes there are Canadian spot Bitcoin ETFs as of 2021 2022 early 20 I don't even remember 2021 2022. um I can remember the exact date even long before the long before that they were available in in Europe they're not technically ETFs in Europe they're what's called etcs but functionally their ETFs they're spot-backed um physically backed Bitcoin ETFs and they have plenty of other crypto ETFs they have some stuff I mean they had an FTX ETF in in Europe so uh the BNB UTF in Europe they have a lot of like things down in the U.S it's very far away from Ever Getting to um so um do with that information about you but yeah and the other thing is I want to say is like they've been around they were around for all this crazy stuff that happened and they handled everything perfectly um there was no issues no no issues with accessing the underlying asset there was no issues with um coin just not being in the in the on the Wallace that you expected to be um and it traded very smoothly it traded very tight it was about as efficient or as good as you could hope that it would be and it should be used as an example of what we can do here in the US and I know for a fact what the SEC will say because they've said in the past is we're the oldest most uh trusted financial markets are going to have more requirements and blah blah but if you look to other markets uh these things have handled even Brazil Brazil has Bitcoin ETFs from hashtags which I mentioned two Korean before but hashtags is a crypto ETF provider that basically uh partnered with tukrium to take over their application because two camera is like we're not first like it doesn't matter to us anymore but hashtag is a provider that wanted access to the US market and they partnered with them to launch it so hashtags which is ticker defy we have something we haven't touched on yet it's the only 33 act Bitcoin Futures ETF 33 act future 33 act ETFs are the only ones that can hold spot Bitcoin so theoretically if we do get an approval here that could be the first ETF on U.S exchange that holds spot Bitcoin they would just have to change the prospectus and file an amendment with the SEC and get accepted but theoretically they could be one of the first ones holding spot bigger that's interesting oh okay so um ethereum as an ETF is that happening anytime soon no unfortunately not why not um because um there's ethereum Futures ETFs and I thought they were going to come quickly after the Bitcoin features ETFs but Gensler and his SEC uh bounced that back immediately right after in 20 early 2022 I said over I I gave it a year and I said we'd have future CTS within a year of the Bitcoin Futures ETFs and I got that blatantly wrong um and basically it's because the the SEC is like arguing now that ether security um they won't probably base that on the Hinman speech right like kind of the SEC yeah yeah exactly it's based on the Hinman speech I thought for sure was going through the fact that we had Futures the volume on the Futures in the CME were strong um and the fact that it follows the same it would follow the same path that Bitcoin did but Gary has held the line and almost regressed on the sec's posture towards 100 has regressed yeah I totally agree with that so not happening anytime in the US but is well actually let me give you one caveat there it's not happening unless Congress steps in I'll give you multiple caveats unless Congress stepson gives some regulatory oversight and Clarity please Congress yeah but that I won't hold my breath for that to happen uh the other thing is it's not going to happen with Gary at the helm so if a republican wins in the presidential election Gary will likely not be at the Helm of the SEC and then you'll have somebody in the Republican so theoretically um Republicans have been more Pro um eth crypto Bitcoin on that side of things so you could get one that way but uh it still seems very unlikely because he would have to undo some precedent that the SEC has already sent and set in different ways but like I said ethereum Futures we had ethereum future like give me one second I'll tell you exactly when we had ethereum Futures ETFs apply in June uh no in May of this you had three yeah we had so basically what happened there was grayscale applied on May 9th for a few three ETFs um and they would go under that 75 ticking clock time period one of them was a Futures ETF and then four issuers followed suit immediately the next day and applied for an ethereum Futures ETFs and those were denied um one of the ETFs that's likely going to launch on it'll be approved it'll tell you exact date uh July 23rd this is this is also kind of comical because it looks like this he's going to have to let it go through because it satisfies all the rules they have but what it'll do it's it's going to hold a slew of international Bitcoin ETFs the likes of Canada and Europe and for like 40 of the fund and the other 60 is going to hold Bitcoin miners um so basically so give me that's a silly product I feel like but okay I don't know if the I don't know if so one thing is that the uh Grace it's called the grayscale global Bitcoin composite ETF but they're using ticker BTC um and that there's some wonky stuff here but I think they need the file have an active application because they're hold on the ticker BTC might have gone so I don't know if they actually plan to launch this um but if they do um it would be completely it just shows the Ridiculousness of like the sec's current stance and if even if you talk to anyone in this for the most part they agree that improving Futures dying spot um it doesn't make a lot of sense even people who are vehemently anti-crypto so those people tend to advocate for the position that the SEC is going to have to basically reverse their decision in approving Futures ETFs for Bitcoin uh in order to get out of here and they do that they can't reverse they have done it in some instances in the past uh but it would it would probably open them up to more lawsuits wow this is very fascinating of course this um you know it comes into play when you have a gatekeeper over kind of uh your tokenization uh types of events of which uh Gary gensley and the SEC is uh James as we get to kind of the the end of this episode then concluding question to me is um some people will have been listening to this being fascinated by this exploration of ETFs and and how this works and all the people involved in the companies all of these things and then they'll ask the the question of like well why do I care like I can just go buy Bitcoin or eth or any asset that I want on coinbase uh this isn't a very bankless product is it an ETF product is by definition custody by someone so is by definition banked can you tell us the prize here like what uh markets does a Bitcoin ETF actually open up like why is this good for maybe for people who are very price conscious bitcoin price or for Bitcoin being a price exposure being hands of of more people why is even having a Bitcoin ETF a good thing how does it affect the market how does it affect price from your perspective I mean the dumbest answer is that it's just another way uh another Market in a way that people could buy but the really way I look at it is it's going to act like a bridge right there are going to be some people that go in this way and might go over to the bankless side of things right like it's that's not that's how a lot of people have acted I know for a fact some people have gone through the grayscale option and then have figured out ways to to do it differently um the other side of it is it just opens a whole bunch of people there's a lot of endowments Pension funds institutions that have mandates on what they can and cannot invest in and a lot of them say they can only invest in Securities or they can only invest in Securities and debt instruments so they are literally against it would be against their mandate against like everything they were founded on to hold Bitcoin directly so when you have an ETF all of a sudden in ETF is security so you're wrapping it and you're able to hold it in that instance so that's just opens up for a lot of different people um to to hold this and use it or trade it if you will um the other side of it is um in the US I hinted I said this before there's 30 trillion dollars with advisors right and advisors love ETFs specifically and independent advisors but um because it's the most tried and true trusted practice right so if there are products out there like on-ramp and other things they're trying to work with advisors to custody the assets for their clients right if you had an advisor typically the way they make money now it used to be like you get paid uh commission Kickbacks for for selling those mutual funds now it's a more fiduciary standard and you get paid say all right if I was your advisor I get paid like the average is like one percent of your assets every year and so what's happened in many instances is clients of them of these advisors one they couldn't they had no way to get access to the crypto markets or Bitcoin um so their clients were doing it on their own and they don't know what they're doing so they don't know what their risk exposures are they don't know like they wouldn't the advisor won just from like a this is a pro level this is a positive way to look at it like the advisor doesn't know that the client is risking all this money in this market that they can control the other part of it is as selfish is that it's not under their umbrella where they can charge the one percent fee um so they would much rather bring that under the one percent Under the Umbrella where they can charge for it the other part is like I mentioned this on-ramp allows you to kind of do it directly there's other competitors that are trying to allow advisors to store in Cold Storage wallets or what have you but um it's it for most of these advisors they're not going to be putting significant client Assets in these things right they're going to give them one five percent exposure to something like this they probably would honestly prefer like a crypto index ETF to put like a couple percentage exposure and if you're going to be doing that you don't want to be setting up like tons of different contracts with different providers and custodians like it's just so much easier to be like I can just hit click and buy for these clients and then I have it under my traditional Financial it basically takes Bitcoin it puts on the traditional Financial rail so this is what GBC did gbtc did but in a less efficient manner we talked about all the issues with that but this would be the Holy Grail of of doing that as far as I'm concerned I've actually talked with um the CEO of OTC markets which is where gbtc trades a lot of these pink sheets think penny stocks but they they have a market and he thinks another area is these things will trade as um basically uh depository receipts um I I think that might happen as well but I think just an ETF is a tried and true um tried and true uh technology wrapper and easy way to do this we know it will work we know it's clean we know it's efficient and people would love if they're if they want exposure that that's how they'll get it fantastic summary James I appreciate all your help on this I think that the the bottom line for for bankless listeners for those crypto investors on the journey is this could be a bull Catalyst of course the exposure of potentially you know tens of trillions of dollars uh into crypto the opportunity to purchase an ETF could affect price in some ways there I'll give you one counteracting point that um we had CME Futures launched at the end of 2017 and early 2018. and Bitcoin Futures ETFs launched at the end of October in 2021 um so if you've been killed the market in 2017. Yeah the more the the hidden can't kill what's already dead man like crypto's down bad uh you know exactly it's a very different Market cycle right now but who knows where we'll be in January yeah that's a great Point James this has been incredibly helpful some action items for the bankless nation I think the first action item is you should go follow James on Twitter if you want updates on the Bitcoin ETF James what's your Twitter handle j-s-e-y-f-f there you go we'll include a link in the show notes James I just want to thank you for coming on Bank list it's been a lot of fun today yeah thanks for having me Ron also another action item in the show notes the 21 shares podcast that James mentioned will include a link to that gotta end with this risks and disclaimers crypto is risky price goes up and down we don't know when we're getting an ETF all of crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
