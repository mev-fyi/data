i was born in soviet ukraine i grew up in ukraine when i was very small when ukraine became independent the conflict we see now is really a continuation of the tragedy that the country experienced with the soviet rule this is the root uh motif that brought me into krypton because as a kid i saw the consequences of the centralized economy centralized political system playing out on the society where everything collapsed now that it collapsed it's just like it never really worked in the first place the soviet union was the total mass everything was in shortage like the shops were empty everything was this balanced people were on like dismotivated but what we see now is like the empire strikes back the antidote to this is to give more power to people
