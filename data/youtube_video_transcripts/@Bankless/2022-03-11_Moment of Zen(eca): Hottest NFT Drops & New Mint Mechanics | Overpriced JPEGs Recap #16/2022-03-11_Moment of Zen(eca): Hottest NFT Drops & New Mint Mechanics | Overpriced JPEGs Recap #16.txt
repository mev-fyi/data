everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs and our favorite recurring segment we'll laugh at every time because it's the only recurring segment moment of zenica with seneca33 thanks for being on as always seneca thanks for having me on do other people call you roy not so much anymore like some people do uh when i first started like i don't know eight months ago having video calls with people like in the real world despite being senica people would say some people be like do i call you rory zanika and i was like call me roy zenika is so weird but now it's like it's become so just ubiquitous that people it sounds normal now yeah that's fine which is cool okay yeah well i won't chit chat too much in the beginning of podcast because i like when podcasts get right into the meat but maybe we'll chitchat about that a little later um we are doing what we always do on moment of zenika we're going to give like a macro update here from zenika about what's happening in the world of nfts over the last week or two and then we're going to dive into some specific project frenzies cyber brokers is the big one v friend series 2 is coming out this 10k tf drop that's happening oh yeah gucci thing yeah your upcoming now's academy lessons which i'm excited about the course there uh other thoughts it'll be great it'll be a great episode but let's start let's start with the general macro updates what's going on zenika what are your thoughts on it yeah i mean i think it's quite clear that the market has been pretty bearish over the last two weeks i think since since we last chatted uh which is about how long this sort of this bearish period has been going for honestly a little longer maybe all of feb was kind of bearish um but it i think people started to really see and feel it over the last couple of weeks especially when like blue chips started tanking a little more and bleeding a little more and projects weren't minting out and and those that did were like dropping below at least a lot of them were dropping below mint price quite quickly and i mean it's there's lots of reasons for why it might be bearish uh just the world in general i mean obviously everything going on in in ukraine is just really wreaking havoc on all sorts of markets and creating a lot of um understandable fear and uncertainty out there uh which has flowed into nfts a bit and then sort of the the thing that we talk about every time there's a bit of a bearish market or even when it's not it's like it's just the sheer volume of new projects being released is there's just not that demand to keep up with it there just isn't um 95 of projects are just not going to succeed um which i think most of us have understood for a while now in yeah in these bearish times though it's like even the five percent that are gonna succeed they struggle a bit and that's what i think panics people um a lot it's yeah it's sort of um it's like this issue of liquidity right that there's only so much money that can be put into projects that can be buying up secondary markets to make floors go up and yes there's lots of new people and with that new money entering the space every every single day but can it keep up with the sheer volume of projects and especially now that more projects are like going higher on mint prices with dutch auctions you know starting at higher points that's sucking a lot of liquidity out of the space so there are a lot of reasons for the bearishness uh again as usual i have no idea how long it's going to last i don't know if it's going to end tomorrow or would be bearish for the next two years like who knows but it's um hopefully it's not the latter um yeah that's just the general market sentiment i think yeah i wish we could and it's impossible to do but you we could have that psychological shift as human beings to see moments like this as opportunities to get into the projects that maybe you had wanted to but couldn't at different price points but it's just so hard to to not feel sad because because your portfolio is worth less you know but it really is like in it's an opportunity uh it it really does feel like it kicked off with ukraine does that feel correct like that that precipitated it now that's not the only factor maybe maintaining it but like that feels like the thing that really depressed things uh is that yeah true i think probably maybe like a one-two punch i think the pixelmon fiasco where you know they sucked like 70 million dollars out of the ecosystem and then uh it wasn't that long after that i mean it was maybe like i can't remember exactly how long a week before the reveal and then the reveal was just you know very clear that they it was like basically a scam um though kevin is one of the best things to have been in mind i love kevin oh my god kevin it's so funny it's a very quick side note but um i wanted to do a meme project kevin for ukraine and just like raise funds and put it out there and i really wanted to do it quickly um but it just didn't take like we sort of missed the window but i tweeted out do like does anyone want to help with this and then uh zagabond who is the founder of azuki was just like he reached out to me and said let's do it and then we've actually got it all ready to go but we feel like the window has passed we don't want to put it out now but if kevin comes back there's the meme project coming um oh wow oh i'm you're gonna get tweets after this being like oh put out your kevin meme project come on you know maybe we still will anyway yeah uh that uh yeah the peace of mind fiasco and then uh ukraine uh really was yeah two big factors i think into the current beer on top of just the general oversaturation and actually it's an interesting point that is different between this bear market and i think all the previous bare cycles that we've had in the nfd space is that all of the previous ones seem to uh in part coincide with gas spiking a lot gas was consistently high in like october november gas was high in like april may last year and those were sort of bearish points gas is not really high at the moment that there's gas is very low actually which is amazing um i'm into three nfts yesterday it cost me a dollar seventy per nft which is is is incredi insane wait and what yeah you did three nfts on ethereum main net i mean yeah it was it cost money and it cost you 1.70 1.70 per nft yeah which is it's like what contract were they on that they're that's not even that's not low gat that's what that's yeah so it's it was um astro girl society is the project and and the um the dev is really amazing he worked on um fortune friends club as well and i think he's got um his name is uh bowstronot like bao astronaut um actually i don't know they i don't have to hiroshi um and they're now working on a new project and um yeah so it's just like people are like innovating and getting smarter with contracts oh that is the bullish that is the most bullish news on ethereum i have heard maybe ever a dollar seventy to mid three dollars so it was whatever five dollars total to me three out of ten but a dollar something for an nft yeah oh my god well that's it everyone buy eve are you kidding me we've made it we've done it and this is before like layer twos are really out there and before um sharding and all sorts of other things that are going to make it even cheaper yeah dude so bullish eth hearing that okay right that is a really interesting point though well i i was gonna say something similar in that you know you obviously had a bit of a boom a boost to like ethan bitcoin and these things after biden's executive order which was yesterday the day before a little bit longer ago when you when you finally hear this episode but um and so which didn't really seem to kind of put the the steam back in the nft market which just further i think uh validates this sort of decoupling narrative where crypto is sort of impacted by one thing and nfts are obviously connected but not in lockstep anymore and in the way that i feel like at one point they kind of were um so that's interesting as well yeah no i mean that it was i think that that was like there was a lot of fear about what that executive order would be and then so maybe that was also contributing to the bear and now that it's come out and it's not bad it's not it's not a bad executive order yeah if anything is good um and i guess it's still a little too early to see what's gonna like eventuate from that crypto had a boost but it's like today it's tanking again this is just like it's oh i haven't looked today oh i got it um who knows who knows there's infinite factors out there but um yeah i think to your point we are definitely seeing nfts and crypto decouple more as time goes on which it just makes sense as the markets mature they're just different people involved in both and and yeah yeah well you mentioned the high-priced dutch auctions and and like sort of pricing structures changing here in the nft world price you know projects are launching with higher sort of start prices than than they once did and that is kind of a convenient segue into frenzies have you been following frenzies at all not really i i heard that they're doing a dutch auction starting at 4.28 i think right yes though they just announced i think yesterday that they were going to be dropping the starting dutch auction price to 3.33 each after a lot of really negative community feedback around the 4.2 and that seems like you know i think they posted it like last night made that announcement and the the reaction at least that i saw was really positive to that and felt like okay thank you so much like we that this like more than satisfies us and we appreciate you listening either i know well so so what do you know about the project i don't know that much so yeah okay maybe so enlighten me i will give you what i know so it's funny i was actually on a twitter spaces with so oshini had them on the oshini show and i was on that episode a little bit because it was yang was on it and i was like sort of distracted like trying to get a bunch of different things done and out before yang's part of the show came on and it was one of the and they made me a speaker and i was like oh god like i am only half listening to this space right now like you know one of those kind of moments so i love you shiny i love you uh you know thank you no shade at you but i was like sort of half kind of paying attention during it but i got the gist and i've gone back and kind of looked back at the project so basically it's these two artists who have been really making art for a decade i think as far as i understand it they actually have had like affiliation with netflix like they build build these really cute characters 20 years ago they were calling them friends now they've evolved to frenzies but they all have the same very like kind of lovable child friendly cute look and um their main bread and butter has been like i think exhibitions and like they were at art basel with these characters building these big exhibitions for this upcoming frenzies thing that's happening they're taking over a corner of christie's here in new york so they do a lot of like in real life activations and i guess five or six years ago they did one where they had they were playing with vr and um and nai and so they had sort of an irl activation where you could go and interact with one of their cute little characters in like a vr ai setting where it would it would sort of learn you and be able to react and they were like that was five years ago though the technology was so much worse than it is today but that was really the the the seeding ground for what has now become this upcoming frenzies drop which they're calling your ar ai companion and so my understanding and i will say it's like maybe a tip to the team like it's kind of surprisingly hard to get like in one place the information about like when does this mint how exactly is the mint working other than the dutch auction because i've heard allusions to this creating your own companion uh process where it sounds like you're kind of building the avatar yourself in some capacity but i i haven't gotten full sort of clarity on that um like how that dovetails with the dutch auction um so it seems like there's some some way in which you're kind of building a character based on their basic kind of frenzies cutesy's model and then it's ai programmed and in some capacity so you can interact with it and the their goal their stated goal is that over in these long periods of times it really become it gets to know you and it it sort of morphs to what you need it to be whether that's just like somebody who can reflect calm when you're anxious or sort of like a record of your own evolution and your own different emotional states over periods of time i mean it's all kind of like abstract and woo-woo but there they seem like really well-meaning artists there's been a lot of like fud around this is a cash grab i think because of the mint prices and this and that but from what i've seen like going back and re-watching some of these spaces like they read to me as quite um like genuine in their you know approach to being artists and doing interesting things with ai anyway that is high level what this is it sounds awesome like yeah i hadn't understood that that sounds so cool uh i mean again i i don't know whether it justifies the three eth price but again it's a dutch auction people always say it's a cash grab when it's a dutch auction starting at a certain point but it's an auction you don't have to buy at the start price you know it's people buy when they think it's valuable and worth buying um yeah i totally agree i i also find that a little strange when people and i guess i guess the frustration i think the frustration comes from i don't know a different project was it lives of asuna like there's been different projects that have done the dutch auction and then the price tanked and then the holders get mad i don't know i i don't want to call it live so soon if that wasn't the one but you know in that era of like crazy crazy hype with azuki and zipsies and lives assume i think some of that was happening and and people felt disappointed i think you and i had even said at that time like only start the doctor auction at a price that you think you can actually sustain but like what can projects it's so hard to really know um what what your project what what the you know the destiny of your project is going to be in the short term right you can know you're going to be long-term in something and like anything can kind of happen in the short term so um speaking of this would love to to get your thoughts one of the pieces of feedback that i saw on the frenzies piece was i think carlini saying you should do a dutch auction where whatever price the project mints out at and you actually explained this to me yesterday on discord because i didn't quite understand carlene's tweet but it sounds like it's basically like if you start the doctor auction at 3.3 but the project ends up minting out at one eth anybody who bought higher than one eth gets refunded so that they also basically will have ended up paying a one-eighth price that was your understanding of what carlini was suggesting yeah yeah what do you think about it it makes a good amount of sense it doesn't punish the people who maybe are the most avid supporters and who buy in early um i i guess the i mean there's people who will try and it's sort of like it creates this really interesting dynamic where no one wants to be the last person to buy because then they're locking in this price whereas if you just wait then everyone gets it for cheaper so how do you reconcile that and then like does someone from the team come along and buy the last one it's just really it creates this interesting dynamic but i think it's um the thought is well intentioned and it's a step in the right direction and something that i would like to see projects experiment with and try because uh yeah it just doesn't make sense in some ways for like for large collections to say a 5 or 10k collection um for some people to pay way more than others basically for effectively the same thing and especially if they're the ones who are um maybe the biggest supporters and most excited and passionate about the project why are they necessarily paying more and then i think i mentioned to you an idea that i i heard uh last week as well actually i yeah so the idea of like a blind auction a blind reverse dodge auction where that is there's various ways of doing it but the the crux is that people you know lock they price is going down they say all right i want to pay this price and then like the money is held at an escrow or like you know it's locked up for a couple of days in smart contracts until the dutch auction ends and then say there's 10 000 nfts the 10 000 highest bidders either pay what they bidded or pay the lowest price so that's combining it with kalini's idea um and i think it's similar to what um loomlock did i don't know like eight months ago something time is weird but um with the wassey's project um and and they had like a blind i think it was like a standard auction or an english auction or something where you know people could bid and then there's a leaderboard and like at a random time a snapshot was taken in the top 100 or five i don't know however many people each day would get to mint at that price but yeah yeah i think there's a lot to experiment with with mint mechanics and dutch auctions and i think having some element of blindness as well as you know refunding people who bid high perhaps i don't know there's a lot yeah i like that i will say i'll shout out my friend kai who i've talked about a number of times on this project who who's co-founder at block block where i work and we were kind of ideating on a project many months ago where the drop mechanic he wanted was what i'm realizing is like a blind auction didn't even have the dutch auction piece though i don't think like i think his was truly like you had to just like input what you wanted his idea was like you would just input what you wanted to pay you know and then yeah i'm trying to remember all the specifics of it right but like the the incentive to not go too low was that if you were too low you wouldn't get the opportunity to to buy it you know and um and then there was some some mechanic of like you know you took like the average price and maybe dropped it a little bit lower and then anybody who admitted above that you know could be it was it was something really interesting that i liked again as part of sort of a price discovery tool um that uh that i think is interesting and haven't really seen done um so lots to play around with there i'm sure projects and teams will just continue to learn as we see what's working and what's failing in the in the space it's also um i just one last comment on that it's sort of in terms of whether something's a cash grab or not it's sort of it'll vary so much project to project and i think it depends on how much work has been put into it what they're promising what they're going to build and where the mon where the money and the funds are going to go to um and i i think that that's it's just always important to think about like not all projects are created equal basically uh yeah yeah i agree and that's why team is so important and we've talked about this obviously numerous times that the team is like an undoxed team like azuki which again is why my bond keeps being like people just keeping like well they're such a talented team i'm like you don't know like they could be lying but they came on like you know your spaces like if you've heard these people on spaces enough et cetera um i think that that obviously can help to combat if if they're undoxed um okay cyber brokers do you want are you i feel like you would be into cyber brokers are you like deep in cyber brokers or no i missed you you missed it i i saw it and i was like this is really really cool and it was like when i first saw it uh before minting i was like because we're in a bear market it's a 10k collection mid price 0.35 seems a little high they didn't have that many followers like i was a little trepidacious i didn't do a lot of research and then when they minted out were minting out and they were like around the 1.5 1.5 i was like i did more research this is really really cool but i just generally don't like buying when there's that much hype and pumps was like i'm just gonna wait if they drop below one eighth i'll get in and then now they're at four and i missed it oh i'm my infinite regret just the infinite regrets that i guess so i'm pretty sure apparently to get on the white list to get a cyber brokers you'd like you know be active in her discord or i think josie bellini's the artist behind cyber brokers or i think subscribe to her newsletter i'm pretty sure i'm subscribed to her newsletter like i think i could have gotten on the freaking allow list like that's how just like it's just impossible to track everything in this space and and then i was really debating getting in on one at 2.3 yesterday morning i was actually i did a live stream with nansen yesterday and we were looking at projects and looking at cyber brokers and i was sort of talking it up and it was 2.3 and i was like oh like but i had the same reaction you did which is like it was like um pranksy had just come in and swept the floor at like 1.5 1.7 so looking at it at 2.3 feeling like that had been a a wave up that had been ridden off of pranksy's um you know sweep and so i was like okay like let me wait for the like kind of pranksy hype to die down and then yeah of course i think it was at like 4.95 at one point like it like literally i think it got up to like nearly five so crazy and then i'm like and then of course you're like i was also on a stream with well i we interacted just briefly but i was on a live stream for the defiant a couple weeks ago and josie was was the artist he was on um and i was like oh this project seems really cool whatever again like just infinite regret um should we maybe give folks just high level you know you said you did a little bit more research and and thought it was really cool just give the high level for maybe somebody who hasn't been fully tracking yeah i mean i i did a little bit of research i don't know a ton about it but basically um as we said josie bellini the artist the artwork is it's really just honestly really really cool it looks um i don't know exactly how to describe it but like a little bit like futuristic and um anyway the the art is going to be all on chain and so it's not yet on change so what's going to happen is that at some point in the future they've committed to basically uploading all this art on chain and the quality of the art is going to be i'm pretty sure way better than anything we've seen as an on-chain project normally you think on-chain it's like pixelated crypto punks um chain runners is on chain and like a little more sophisticated but the reason is sort of the i think the the prime example of really you know impressive art that is on there on chain yeah uh but the reason you don't see too many like bought apes on chain or something like with really in-depth art it's that it costs a lot of money to you know write data to the ethereum blockchain and it would just be prohibitively expensive and now this art looks like it would be prohibitively expensive and it's definitely going to cost a lot i don't know how much but a lot but they have committed to it and they're going to upload it all on chain i think it's like um the the file format there'll be like svg files and people can then you know there's this whole element of composability and interoperability when all the the data is on chain that people can use yeah it's just it's cool it's it's they've got a great community great artist og artist behind it josie is fantastic and has been in the space for a long time um yeah it's just it's a really cool pfp project that um we missed yeah that's a i think a great overview can you explain the what the composability piece what does that mean in like you know when we talk about composability on chain et cetera et cetera like what does that mean yeah so basically uh composability is just basically being able to use an nft or anything that's on the ethereum blockchain and interact with it um and like build on top of it in a way that you can't really do with something that's not on chain um i don't know if i'm explaining this right like very well you're right yeah but let's say you want to add um and i don't actually know what the intellectual property rights are for cyber brokers or or if anyone can like create derivatives you do yeah i can chime in it's it's very bored ap um it's it's permissive she's she said it's gonna be very permissive you can make do whatever you want with your cyberbroker and monetize it etc i don't it's not like in the full cco category but i think it's in that sort of towards that end of the spectrum a lot like a board ape so we'll use the board apes as an example then if you want to create a derivative of your board 8 basically because the the image file is not stored on chain per se basically what you do is you go download the the png i think or jpeg high quality file you create art you do whatever you want and then if you want you can re-upload that to the blockchain as a new nft um with cyberbrokers because they're all going to be on chain you can sort of interact with the art directly via a smart contract to smart contract and maybe write a smart contract that you know takes the the art and all the data on chain and adds you know a different background or a different a hat or accessory or whatever um and really manipulate the data in a way that's not possible with board apes like with board apes it's sort of like um the the aspect that's on chain is sort of a url like a linking to the image file plus the traits so it'll say like gold teeth trippy fur um whatever crazy eyes um and you'll have that information but you won't necessarily be able to like just looking at the data and know what that looks like like a smart contract won't be able to manipulate that in the same way that i think with cyber brokers you will be able to um yeah it just leads to cool cool new opportunities yeah well and it strikes me that this is the kind of thing that right now our imaginations can only go so far with what that means right we're like oh you can add a hat or a background but that in five ten years like we'll be they'll be really wild stuff that's happening because of smart contract interactions like uh uh not to take us too far afield but i've been doing some research on this is for another project i'm working on which is like the first car ever invented which was like the first automobile was in like the 1800s it was bentley whatever some name that you would now recognize um went like 11 miles per hour at like its top speed and then the model t which people might know you know came out like 20 years later could go i think as fast as 45 miles per hour all of which was slower than a horse which at a sprint can can reach like a good horse can reach like 55 miles per hour so you can imagine people in like 1908 being like why the what is the point of cars we have horses it's slower it's stupider and i feel like that's so much of what we see in the blockchain space right now for people who on it they're like it doesn't really solve anything like and you're like well not first of all it does right but like it's not it's so nascent still imagine when it's you know when we're the car industry of you know 2020 compared to the car industry of 1908 so that's what i feel like some of these some like when i look at space doodles rap doodles like right now some of it feels it's performative and it's intellectually interesting but there's sort of an element of like okay but like but what you know but i think what it really is it's these stepping stones to things that i think are going to be really interesting in 10 or 20 years um or or less time probably right um so that's how i feel about some of this on-chain like cyber broker yeah you're pushing the boundaries and right now we can't even imagine what it's going to be able to lead us to yeah and also um we're not developers you're me so there's probably cool stuff that you know people can do and we'll do but we're just we don't know because there's just so much that we don't know but yeah you're absolutely right that you know there's a lot of what's happening now i just really the very early stages people are just experimenting with with this tech we were talking earlier about how you know i i paid a dollar 70 to mint an nft go back six months ago that was unheard of you'd pay 50 100 at low gas and because people hadn't optimized contracts they hadn't come up with new ways and you just every week every month people are just discovering and pushing the needle forward in so many different areas and capacities and i think that's just that's not going to slow down for a long time absolutely i still have you tweeted that like how is this not news i i that am i why is this like hitting me so hard and see you're like you just like threw it out casually earlier like hey this is a good thing i'm like did i miss that this was happening like is this is everybody else realize that people are minting that cheap i think so like it's not the first project like there's been i don't know a dozen maybe projects that i'm even aware of that that have minted close to that cheap over the last couple of months and again minted some like erc721a contracts that were awesome but it was still like 30 right it was still like the gas was like 25 30 and i was pumped a dollar 70 is like a whole different ball game to me i think that's why i'm freaking out so much because i'm like that's like it's really different that's like that's like we're getting to true accessibility there because even twenty five thirty dollars for some people if you want to mint a bunch like or you know the whole thing costs 60 bucks like that's still kind of a thing like six dollars and you imagine we can get that down to three dollars like what okay yeah you can sell nfts that the price of the nft is 15 bucks 150 300 nfts now you can have like 10 nfts that you pay a dollar two dollars to win exactly that that's the that's the thing to me is like these you look at like parallel which is not even that expensive but you know they wanted these parallel packs that are that are even cheaper i think they're to do physical card packs whatever point being like you know it that that to me is actually wildly game changing that we can do that okay uh let's move along uh r.i.p that neither of us owns cyberbrokers and also like josie bellini's written a bunch of lore on her newsletter which is why i had again i think i'm subscribed i think i could have been on this wait like this allows i'm so bitter but anyway but her lore is really like cool and interesting and gives you a vibe and so you can go check that out i think it's on our sub stack um so there's just a lot to this project that's i think being done exceptionally well everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's

i'm so bummed that i didn't get in at mint because i've been a fan of garyvee's for like 15 years but i missed it and then i bought in eventually and i'm happy to be holder um but i still i i've never really dived deep into the ecosystem like you have so what what i feel like there's been a lot of news this week on series two yeah what's going on yeah a bunch of news um also i will say so i did meant be friends it's the only thing i can hold over you in our entire nft relationship is that fact but i'll tell a funny story just briefly because i was with a friend of mine the other night i have a good girlfriend who i actually met through andrew's campaign but she's very like uh she's like cool you know in like a mainstream way that i'm not you know and we have a fun relationship because like i'm like the weird nerd and she's like you know like the kind of pretty cool girl and um she had a birthday brunch last year she was born in may during the mint thing for for gary vee's so i and and i don't anyways we met at work so like we're not in like the same friend groups like all of our friends are also like cool like kind of hot girls you know i came with like my backpack and my laptop so that i could mint a v friend at this birthday brunch which was like you know everybody was like very lovingly kind of like what the heck is wrong with you what are you doing this is so weird and of course now i get to be like yeah it's worth so much okay so so be yourself folks don't be afraid to be your nerdy weird self being a nerd pace um uh so news this week um v friends two big announcements and hopefully i'm not um there aren't others that i'm even missing because there was a lot just coming out of this but basically they uh announced how you can get on the series 2 list so there's uh you know he's doing a viewfriend series 2 which he's talked about is because v friends one kind of skyrocketed even faster than he was expecting and has become so inaccessible that he sped up the timeline for doing a series 2 so that people uh could get in and get into his ecosystem and series 2 is not a utility play like series 1 is it's really an art play but it's part of this whole ip like you know series 2 doesn't get you to vcon and all the rest of it but series 2 is a part of this broader ip world that he's very openly building and these characters and and all the rest of it so that's what series two will be and the only way to get into series two is to hold book tokens which you also have seneca so if you haven't sold them yeah you have an opportunity for series two so uh basically series you don't get into the cu3 by holding a v1 well so here's what he's doing this is the other big piece of news which is every series one holder is going to get a unique series 2 that that won't be available in any other way of whatever their series one character is right so i have i have like crappy series one characters um i have like a shrimp i like my hermit crab i have a happy hermit crab so i will get one a one-of-one piece basically with unique pose like any pose and unique all these things i think i actually have the exact language here it was uh the series two for the for the series one holders the series two they will get will be a true one of one with a combination of different characters poses and backgrounds making up the complete token artwork and again you'll get whatever character you hold as part of series one so that's a special thing that's happening for series one token holders and then but then the broader kind of ecosystem of characters to get in on that will have to be through holding book games um so he's still rewarding series one but he's also rewarding the book game token holders where basically there's 120 000 book game tokens and of course that was so many and that was the thing people were freaking out about before book games was revealed was like how is he possibly going to create demand for 120 000 tokens like that's crazy and of course he's gary vee he just he i don't know how he does it he just he does it like love or hate his content and like the way he expresses himself man he has done this nft thing so ethically well um so i you know and i held a bunch of book game tokens and i've joked about it here because i sort of traded and flipping them on on tokentro which is the imx platform that they're on and i checked the other day i hadn't checked in a while because of all the news that's come out like more than half of mine had sold that i listed for what i thought were like kind of high prices you know like double triple mint pr you know like the floor price of the time that i listed them and i was like god damn it like i should have been tracking this closer do you know floor now is like almost at half an eighth um which is crazy because these things cost like 300 dollars to buy the 12 books to get one of these nfts yeah they were actually i think i have it up here oh it's dropped a bit it's now at 0.392 um still but yeah i checked it was over 0.4 it was like approaching half an eighth um so i mean look i've made a good little a good little chunk of money but i could have made more infinite regret because i wasn't tracking closely enough to realize that what i was listening had gotten to be too low based on the news that was coming out but um i still hold a few and so hoping that i'll get on that series so how do you get from having book game nfts to being on the series two lists yeah and also do you know how many series two nfts there will be oh that's a good question i don't actually know he may have said but i don't know how many series two he's releasing um i can try and find that and then so the way it's gonna work is it's pretty random so there's 120 000 book game tokens all together 32 000 are being chosen i believe at random to make it on to the friends list for uh for series two so it's you know 25 or something in that ballpark i think it's maybe a little higher um i think it's like yeah thirty two thousand out of 120 000 or something and um so you know you'll it'll be random you'll you'll get a whitelist spot or a lala spot and then there's gonna be a 12 and a half day minting window for series two because this book was 12 and a half lessons or whatever the heck and so um i think it's happening you so it april 5th it'll be announced like you'll you'll find out basically if one of your tokens is one of the ones that it has like a spot um and i don't know when i don't know that he's announced when minting starts but uh at some point there will be this 12 and a half day window and if there are any book if there are any series two tokens still available after that window which my guess is going to be that there probably won't be do you think yeah i'm going to guess i think people will just be on the list and then forget like yeah as as like you did with the jersey bellini thing as everyone does with everything in this space it's like you bought books all right they're in my wallet they're on immutable x oh i didn't pay attention to v friends for a month i missed the window that kind of stuff okay you're probably right i just think when i checked and saw like how many of my book tokens had sold and and like looked at how much money i already made just i'm like how could anybody underestimate him at this point ever again and not just like yeah like because the thing with josie bellini was like there's still that little piece of you that's like i don't know if this will make money like it's i and maybe i'm just so locked in i'm like gary v just like makes you money if you buy what he buys like yeah and so he's like the um the good version of beanie right because a lot of people said they followed beanie they hate him but you know he made it he makes you money he pumped up uh punks comics and all that and whatever wolf game and great people forgave a lot of stuff and then whatever um because he also loses you money right like he also does he also does projects that go to yeah yeah yeah people seem to forget that but i loved your uh i should maybe i'll say so i tweeted the other day like choose your fighter pick your fighter because it just so happened on my twitter feed there was back-to-back tweets one from andrew wang being like i will never go back to my day job i love this space like no matter how like how much my like you know nfts fall in price and then right below that was a beanie tweet being like can't wait for the you know nft class of 2021 to all go crying back to their day jobs in 2022. and it was such a funny contrast so i tweeted it out and you like replied being like i don't know who that second guy is yeah yeah it's also crazy because last year he was tweeting so much like everyone you should quit your day jobs and come to nfps why have you why are you still working in nine to five why don't you quit and now uh and then yeah anyway he tweeted something at me last year um i think he tweeted something and then i i called him out and then up and he he replied like who the are you and and i was just like and then he deleted it and then now i just whenever he preach i'm like who is that guy who is who is he [Music] i was conflicted tweeting it because i didn't want to give more energy to his stuff but i was like this is too good and i do still follow him because i it feels relevant to know kind of what yeah but what he's doing he's tweeting way less but um good or at least i'm just or or i'm not seeing them uh yeah which is why i've had him for a long time and he's had me blocked so yeah anyway love the influencer feuds of of nfts um okay do you okay which which uh this is the question i want to ask which viewfriend do you hold because that will impact which series two oh um it's a good question let me let me i think it's an ostrich is there is there an ostrich one uh probably probably there's a lot of they all have like uplifting names don't they um yeah they do oh yeah they're all yeah values organized ostrich i just found it out that's adorable okay that's nice that's that's a that's like good it's a it's like a cuddly character like my shrimp i literally don't know what gary's gonna do for the shrimp i'm convinced it's gonna be the worst one i was hoping it would give me access to fly fish club because there's like a you know sushi like fishy theme yeah um but like it's it truly is the ugliest character but i i got it at at mint floor you know which like i got it for like half anything and um so whatever beggars can't be choosers yeah but but yeah it's it's really ugly um okay i am hoping you can tell me about bobu and azuki do you want to go there next yes i can i can speak a little bit to that so i'm sure everyone knows azuki they come up with this idea where uh they created well there's one azuki nft and they created like an identity for it bobu the bean farmer and they said what we're gonna do is basically fractionalize bobu and then sell uh fractions at 0.01 eth just because again azuki is so inaccessible to so many people now the floor is around 10 eth has been for a while um and they really wanted to do it as a i think i mean i'm putting i don't want to put words in the mouth but like a as a way to make it more accessible for newcomers and b just to get the community involved in building sort of the ip and the and the story for this character because you know it's sort of it's a fractionalized ownership of this nft and they'll have like they'll build out a story there'll be governance where if you have one bobo nft you have one vote and all that kind of stuff and they fractionalized it into 50 000 fractions which is a ton and then i think that they had a public or like the the sale was for 20 or 30 000 of them and then the rest i don't know exactly i think the team is holding them for the time being but then i don't know what the plan is for them but effectively there's a ton of these tokens out there now um and the floor price is like .06 so it's definitely it's gone up a lot since mint um and yeah it's just like a cool initiative i think um they definitely got some backlash and thought about you know why are you raising more money you know all that kind of stuff but all the money raised is going into like a treasury that's basically being managed by this dao i don't know if it's actually a dao but it's a whatever for legal reasons quasido type thing and it's it the it's it so it sounds like it's like an ip governance token not intended to be almost like more like an erc20 sort of ecosystem uh currency yeah yeah yeah is that right okay i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna i'll read the description they have on their urban z page bobo tokens are an experiment in decentralized ip brought to you by azuki.com who is azuki number 40 an honest bean farmer will become one with the izuki community bobu tokens are a way to join an experiment in decentralized character ip governance bobo tokens grant access to closed discord channels proposal voting and more surprises uh we are bobo and then a bunch of disclaimers come their lawyers i'm sure told them to put there um yeah yeah so it's an experiment which i think is really cool i love experiments in this space um yeah and what i love is azuki and you know it's a testament to them i guess and the quality at which they do everything you know seems like their community loves them so much they just have so much goodwill that they are a project that can really take some risks and experiment and it doesn't seem to i don't know blow anything up i guess i hear there was some fud but you know it hasn't affected floor price which i think is still around 10 you know where it just seems to stay and live yeah exactly um and so i i'll actually i'll give a little teaser which is that we i think the last time we talked i think i said to you like on air like can you just like give me somebody who can explain azuki to me you gave me eddie who is lovely and i did have a conversation with him last week and i actually recorded it because i was just going to call him and be like okay i just need you to explain why azuki has sort of defied a lot of the typical patterns in some ways i mean it did ultimately dip down a little bit but dip down to 10 i mean geez and um yeah so he and i had like a 40 40 minute conversation and and right before we started i was like you know what like screw it other people are probably interested like would you mind if i just recorded this and so i haven't released it yet because i've had a bunch of kind of sad content that i've been releasing but i probably will at some point so you all can look forward to that if you like me have been like what explain it why is this why was this such a thing um yeah i break it down with eddie and really or i should say eddie breaks it down and i nod beautifully uh i love eddie he's got great energy and yeah champ i'm sure it's going to change great he's in your 333 club i hear yeah he is yeah yeah yeah he's uh very sharp yeah what to join the 333 club you get to hang out with cool people you know plug yeah um actually it's yeah do you want to say something or i can feel you battling with yourself it's just like it's basically sold out so it's like it's very difficult to join at this point but um got it anyway are there any three three three club members trying to sell on secondary yeah secondary for like 6 8 now and there's like 60 spots available but i opened applications again on the weekend i got like 400 applications so it's going to take me a month to go through that um good problems good good to be zadaka it's good to be done okay yeah um okay uh let's i know we have a hard stop here so i want to talk about your upcoming course on nas academy nas naz academy can you go to me yeah um yeah give us the what's what's that all about yeah so nars academy just quickly is sort of like a masterclass style website where anyone can come and create all anyone but they pick people who have some level of expertise or knowledge from any background whether it's like a photographer a chef you know just like master class whatever and they want to teach something and they've been making more of a pivot towards web 3 over the last few months and had a few other great creators on there ben you from curious addies did like an intro to nft's thing randy zuckerberg did a course as well and then i did one that i've been talking to them for a few months so actually i flew to dubai about a month ago to film because they have a studio there and like a full-on setup with you know a director multiple cameras a set all that kind of stuff which was really awesome experience um and so yeah my course is going to come out next month it's on how to launch nfc project which it's so insane to just condense that into a course like it's a seven day course and there's like 15 hours or 10 to 15 hours of video content so it's it's a lot but then i found myself every single thing i was like i could and should speak for another 10 hours on this particular point and then on this point and then at this point and like oh i didn't cover that so i i don't want people to think that you'll take the course and then immediately know how to launch a successful nft project but it's more like these are some of the things that are involved and that you should think about and hopefully hopefully people learn something and take something away from it a really good starting point well this is gonna be my follow-up question which maybe is what you're about to say and i don't know and if i'm we'll cut this out too if if i'm wrong and this is gonna be awkward but uh my understanding is it's you know it's a paid course and that you're donating all of it right yeah so okay it's it's a paid course it's 399 usd to take it um maybe there's some discount codes that will be given out it'll be free for anyone that's got a zen academy nft or a 350 club nft yeah um which i mean the floor price is like 0.28 anyway so it's like if you want to take the course you might as well buy the nft but anyway um for everyone else it's paid course and then of the money that is generated uh it's like a 50 50 split so 50 will go to niles academy for you know filming and putting together the entire thing and then 50 will go to me and then my allocation they can pay out in eth basically so i've set up a new wallet called the zen bank and it's all going in there and then 25 will go to support ukraine i don't know exactly which charity or initiative but it's earmarked for that and then 75 is going into what we're calling the zen academy scholarship fund and again it's not exactly defined what that's going to do but the idea is to support artists up-and-coming artists creators in the space perhaps people who take the course and want to launch a project but need some funds and there's a lot of cool things we can do with the money basically yeah at the end of the day like i didn't do it to profit and i don't love the idea of charging people for education but then i understand that there are real costs involved with producing content um especially that's like well produced like their content is um anyway yeah so i just thought that was a cool idea to have this have the eath go into a wallet that can then be decided on where it's gonna go okay well now we're down to three minutes so here's what we've got okay here's what i had on my on potential things to talk about in the agenda this gutter cat clone juice thing so guttacat gang is a project that launched shortly after the bordeaux yacht club last year like i think within three weeks and they basically straight up just copied the concept and you know credit to them there's there's been 10 000 projects that have copied that playbook since then and they were just the first ones to realize and jump on the bandwagon and come up with an nfc project that's a community with a club membership type thing it was great like i i've been a fan since day one i'm interested and i still have some and uh the biggest problem both like a double edged sword they launch with a collection size of three thousand so obviously supply and demand helps you know price go up if there's not many but it really capped like the community size and so i think a lot of the power of bought apes and many collections at our 10k is that there's thousands and thousands of people on twitter who are like networking connecting and being advocates for the project with the gutter cat gang you know maybe they had like a thousand or 1500 unique owners and and that's a great percentage ownership but flat numbers it's it's not that great and over time they've sort of released additional companion collections so i had the gutter rats and then the gutted dogs and gutter pigeons to like 3 000 each of those to build out the collection size a bit but by and large it didn't do that much because a lot of the owners of those were owners of the cats as well so it's just like in pure numbers it didn't i think really expand and so that they came up with this new new idea where they said all right we're just going to come up with gutter juice which anyone can use on an existing asset and create like a clone based like a mechanized android version of this as a new nft and they drop and they're like all right we're gonna do 40 000 of them so like they've really gone ballistic in terms of expanding the community size um and they had a public sale of 28 000 and then like the other 12 000's being airdropped one to one for the existing holders um and it was a dutch auction that started at point nine and ended at point one pretty sure it sold out at a point one or just uh above that i think it was point one one or something i saw yeah yeah and and now it's trading at like point one six or something so it's gone up a little bit um i think it's brilliant i think it's like what they needed to expand the ecosystem yeah wait so i have a question so i i've again loosely tracked this but not well-versed so this gutter juice i can apply to what yeah um so basically the vials are used in what they're calling a clone machine that will spit out android versions so i don't think you need an existing guttacat asset to use it with it's just you go to their website use the machine and then you'll get like there's four different types you've got to choose there's like a cat rat pigeon a dog you go to their website put it into the clone machine and it spits out an android version so i it's not like you're using i want it i couldn't tell if it sounded like you're using it on like an existing nft of yours no i don't not like another nft it's you just go to the clone thing and they spit out sort of an androidized thing okay interesting yeah yeah gutter cat gang is definitely one of those ones i is that the gang gang thing yeah everyone on twitter goes gang gang it's just like they call call yeah that's like their their sign they're they're in the yeah okay okay cool that was helpful because i wasn't fully tracking and it brought us to just about time so zenika i will let you go to this meeting and i so appreciate you hanging out and uh we'll see you in a couple weeks [Music] hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to
