[Music] hey hey coordination got a really great episode for you glenn weil puja oliver and leon erickson are on this episode and this episode is about decentralized society a paper that glenn and puja and vitalik buterin recently wrote about how blockchains can serve as the basis for global coordination by solving for some of the challenges of trust so basically imagine a network of accounts that have soulbound tokens issued to them soulbound just means non-transferable token but you can think about decentralized identity verifiable credentials basically a cryptographic tag on each account that is issued by an on-chain entity so imagine a world in which git coin was issuing on-chain identifiers for everyone who contributed to a bitcoin grants round and there was a network of these tokens in a graph and basically as this graph gets populated by multiple on-chain entities for multiple credentials for multiple accounts what you get is this giant network of how the trust flows in the web 3 ecosystem and what types of trust imagine that you have a proof of voting imagine that you have a proof of skill or a proof of burn for a token delegation time locks employment records ownership a network of how trust flows in a decentralized society could be the basis for how we can build a richer more pluralistic ecosystem and solve for things like undercollateralized lending civil resistance creating a network of bottoms up map of where the trust flows in the web 3 ecosystem so vitalik and glenn and puja kind of explore this design space which they call decentralized society and the values that are associated with it pluralism which basically means a diversity of mechanisms and users local control mechanisms that allow for clusters of users to co-create their own destiny and i'm just really excited about this episode because decentralized society has been an idea that has lit the twitter sphere ablaze for the last couple weeks as people debated its implications how do we preserve privacy how do we make sure that these attestations are bottoms up and are consensual and in this episode we dive into a lot of those topics we talk about what decentralized society could be how it could allow blockchain to serve for the basis for global coordination by increasing the trust and the network of relationships of the participants in the web 3 ecosystem so coordination i think you're really going to enjoy this episode this episode was an experiment for me in not only checking out what decentralized society was going to be but also in having a guest co-host the first voice that you're going to hear once we open up the episode is leon erickson who is my co-conspirator at get coin and also works at radical exchange and he'll be doing most of the hosting for this episode so without further ado i give you decentralized society enjoy refi summer has arrived and sello is here for it solo is the layer one blockchain for the regenerative finance movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world cello has committed towards producing a sustainable future from the very beginning and is the world's first carbon negative evm

happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits [Music] set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile sees the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] so today we'll talk about how non-transferable tokens can make web 3 more pluralistic i'm consciously using a less politicized term than soulbound right now so some of you might have uh yeah read the decentralized society paper and some of the discussions that were going on on crypto twitter and elsewhere around it um before we get into it uh let me introduce um the speakers who are here with us today uh two of the three authors of the paper pujol harvard and len weil um yeah i'll give a quick introduction to the two of you um glenn weil is the co-author of radical markets a book that got kind of popular in the crypto space in 2018 and he is also the founder of the radical exchange foundation which is a social movement for next generation political economies basically the radical exchange movement started as like the public discussions and excitement around radical markets picked up in 2018 in his day job he's leading political economic and socio-technological research at microsoft advising its cto and collaborates with various universities and intellectual communities worldwide among other things he is inventor of quadratic voting notably quadratic voting or funding is a magic matching funding method underlying good congrats many of you know pooja olharva is a strategist at flashbots the largest maximum extractable value research initiative in ethereum she's also a lawyer and serial entrepreneur who spends a great deal of time thinking about philosophy economics and politics i met her at my first radical exchange meetup in berlin in 2019 then together we um helped organize the radical exchange berlin conference the same year which hosted audrey tang the digital minister of taiwan and a bunch of other radical exchange community members where len actually already introduced what he then called radical exchange 2.0 2.0 which was kind of about like acknowledging that we need to recognize the complexity of social ecosystems and incorporate the richness of sociality into the formal mechanism designs like qf and i feel like um the decentralized society paper is an attempt to to bring that spirit to web 3. arguably get congruent is one of the largest life examples of ideas from the radical exchange movement and specifically the largest example of quadratic funding in action so um yeah most of you obviously know uh kevin owaki who is the founder of git coin and took that research back in 2019 into action and builder yeah unique web 3 product and community around quadratic funding um glenn's work pretty much gave me a mission when i discovered his work as an economics and philosophy student back in 2018 and until today it's kind of my north star so after graduating from university i joined radical exchange foundation for about two years and then joined git coin where i'm now working on the future of our grants protocol um so enough with uh introductions um and one other thing about you though leon i just want to say is that the ideas that we're going to talk about you played a critical role in our early thinking about them and pooja and i ended up just because of time constraints you know forging ahead on this but uh you were critical to those early discussions and produced a lot of uh key thinking so it's wonderful to be in conversation with you about this thank you man yeah thanks for looping me into that discussion back then um so yeah pluralism is i think the social philosophy that inspired this uh work on the decentralized society paper trying to bridge that value to web 3 and inspire jason's social experiments so i wanted to kick this off by asking you glenn also kinda jason to the other paper or essay that you wrote why are you a pluralist i i'm a pluralist uh both like at a fundamental level and at an instrumental level at a fundamental level i think that you know some people say they're utilitarians they want to reduce suffering increase pleasure other people say you have a religious purpose whatever i think for me uh at a deep level the the fundamental philosophy that resonates most with me is the enrichment of complexity and diversity and structure and you know novel uh diverse recombinant ecosystems it permanent permeates my epistemology like how i think about how we think how i think about what's fundamentally good about how i see reality but it's also just a very pragmatic philosophy because ultimately we're never going to come to that fundamental philosophical level to agreements we have to find a way to live with each other without you know violence and in order to do that we need to recognize the differences among us and find ways on the things where we can't avoid it to cooperate and on the things where we can avoid it to live in the ways that each of us find best and that's fundamentally to me what you know pluralism is about it's it's pragmatism and it's also a fundamental you know moral and epistemological creed for me cool um thanks for the introduction to that concept um as we're as i think the talk is an attempt to kind of bridge that spirit of like cooperation across difference to to web 3. puja would you mind kind of giving us an overview of what you mean when you say decentralized society and and how that relates to pluralism sure so uh in the paper we uh talked about uh dsoc is this kind of co-determined sociality but i think it's kind of easier to break it down a little bit more simply um it's i would say first and foremost a recognition that you cannot uh see individuals outside of the context of the communities in which they participate in and those communities define them right and and vice versa communities can also be understood without looking at the individuals that compose them and so like dsoc isn't a study of like the unit of individuals or even like the unit of like communities or networks it's really the study of the nexus between individuals and communities the trust the knowledge the shared resources like including data right between them and furthermore a study of how these communities can bottom up compose into larger coordinations and larger networks that produce broader shared goods um so uh glenn gave a really nice way to think about pluralism another way that i think about it and also kind of the way i think about dsoc is just being built off of sort of fundamentally a few deep principles one is local knowledge uh the idea that those who are closest to the problem usually have the most knowledge about it local control those closest to a promotes of the greatest stake in its resolution and then this final principle of cooperation across difference uh which which you've mentioned which is the idea that consensus by the most diverse stakeholders is key for composing local units into broader networks of cooperation so that was a mouthful but that is how i see dsoc local knowledge local control and cooperation across difference one other thing i'd like to highlight um is that so in the paper uh and this really builds on what pooja said um we both discussed the notion of sort of radically democratizing communities to uh you know take centralized power and diffuse it into the people that make it up and the notion of what we call community recovery where effectively the ownership over the these tokens that we're focused on is really belongs ultimately not to like the isolated individual but to the social network that constitutes that individual's context and to me what's so powerful when you put those two elements together is you start to really see like what would it mean to have a network society where like the network is the thing and neither the communities nor the individuals themselves are the thing and uh what that really requires is the notion of both decentralizing the individual to her community and centralizing communities to their individuals so that it it is the interconnections among them the fabric that ties them together that is that is the you know resilient thing and that that is decentralized society effectively do you think like there's any like necessary point of contact between like a particular technology substrate or stack to to realize this vision of a network society and and the plurality paradigm or the sunlight society paradigm um i think so like the key word in decentralized society is like there are two keywords decentralized in society but part part of decentralization is not just decentralization within a particular technological stack but like decentralization across technologies and different architectures and um glenn you can talk about this with you the paper you wrote with uh divia uh siddharth and daniel allen uh touch touches on this on on this uh question of architectural decentralization so i don't think it it requires a particular technological substrate as much as looking at that technological substrate in in in in different ways and allowing sort of plurality of technological substrates to sit alongside it i i'd also say that one thing i'm very confident of is that no existing technological substrate comes anywhere close to being optimal at representing what what we're trying to get at um i i think it's exciting that web 3 could potentially be something that we can build on to get there i think you know the verifiable credentials and decentralised identifiers which we can come to are another potential thing we could build on but ultimately the sort of data structures that we talk about are not what those things were optimized to do at present and there are newer uh architectures which probably have flaws in themselves as well that are probably better suited to what we get we get out we mentioned that in in the conclusion and we want to be pragmatic and build on things that have momentum and that people are engaged with and we also want to be principled and understand the limitations of those things and the need to combine together many different existing technologies and build newer ones that are better fit for that for those goals um what are like considering that we need to start somewhere and like perhaps as you say like work with the tools that we have now to to do some experimentation with these ideas um what are what are some of the like applications of this paradigm that you'd be excited about to see in in web 3 specifically one use case that i think is really interesting is actually uh science and scientific research and the production of scientific knowledge um there's always and i just gave a presentation about this at a dsi conference it should be up soon but there's always been this kind of perennial question about what's the relationship between markets and science and you know uh and in what ways does it it help or what ways does it misdirect and and i think um dsoc kind of really offers this really interesting third way to to disrupt some of the kind of bottlenecks in science today in particular journals that are highly rent extractive and really don't deliver anything to the knowledge supply chain other than charging a toll and and um you know preventing making what should be open science closed signs and so i see the the primitives of dsoc um and they could again be put on a different technological substrate as well but the idea of you know representing your memberships and affiliations in a field like science where there is such a high level of publicity and it is so sort of status oriented um and and people want that publicity scientists want to be public about about their you know qualifications and accomplishments that we could actually um you know representing those those those accomplishments and credentials and memberships they're really interesting opportunities to bootstrap um you know research dials that fork away rent extraction from journals back towards scientists and paying science scientists for their research paying peer reviewers and even introducing new steps um in the peer review process like uh re peer reproduction and and offering traceability uh and lab provenance and experiments so i'm super excited about that i i could speak on and on but i'll stop i'll like i'll let glenn talk about let me just build one thing off of that because it's close to github which is and actually integrates with it which is that uh open source software in many ways has a very similar structure to what puja is describing most of the rewards have to do with social uh standing and um people are very public about it for that reason it's a the whole concept is of like radical transparency in a lot of ways um so it seems like that would be another very natural ecosystem and in fact you know if if puja gets her way and i get my way on this i actually think it could be super productive to bring open source software and science much more together uh right now open source people who do who are you know prodigious open source software contributors get very little academic prestige uh and people in academia don't produce nearly enough usable software that can be scaled and hopefully if you can get some sort of an integration where everything is indicated just by journals but by a more fluid publication type process that integrates more easily with a lot of software stacks that maybe those worlds can uh can can take the best from each other right cool um yeah i guess git coin could likely be then one of the places to kind of try around with more play around with more of the plural iterations of quadratic funding where we're not just looking at size of contributions and a number of contributions and people but instead of like additionally also look at the diversity of the people that support the project right um i'd be interested um maybe maybe that's one for you then like what what do you think are like optimal mechanisms in in like a context like plural funding for um open source software projects to to approximate you know the the social diversity of the supporters of the project i know we were like kind of playing around earlier with this idea of just looking at some credentials of these people uh that are contributing and like taking the number of shared attestations that they might have you know at the stations about like what communities they belong to or like what software projects they use and and taking that over total at the stations but i was wondering if you have any thoughts on how we could improve on on these like parameter settings and and get like better approximations of how diverse these groups are or like or like where do we find a good starting point i think we're just trying to figure it out basically um i've got an intern working with me this summer at microsoft who's trying to formalize some of this i'm actually meeting with him in about an hour um but you know we're i think we're at the start of a very big journey i think this is starting to open up just all kinds of revolutionary research questions um about ai and prediction markets about funding and voting about prop you know asset control and ownership about um you know social media and how that operates about uh how you add people to a club or a network i i'm just incredibly excited because i you know don't feel like we have the answers i feel like we have some really important and powerful research questions that are pretty well mathematically posed at this pro point but aren't solved and there's hopefully going to just be a flowering of a field that finds those solutions and works with groups like gitcoin to experiment with them and then that cycles back into research and we really get a flywheel going with social innovation the way that we've had it with you know technology in the past so let's see but that's that's my great hope from the get coin side of things i know we're really excited about uh bootstrapping a virtuous cycle in which there's more dids and credentials issued and that creates more use cases in which they can be used for more things which is which means more dids and vcs get created in this sort of virtuous cycle of bootstrapping the network effect of this ecosystem and uh you know i think we've seen with quadratic funding that y'all wrote the paper and we're one of the biggest implementations of quadratic funding giving you data to see about how it's actually working in practice and would love to be a part of bootstrapping this ecosystem with y'all as as well in the future so more to come on that it's interesting for me to look back at that kevin because before this it was definitely the most viral that a paper that i've ever written went um and yet it took a week and a half for this paper to get as many downloads as that paper has had over its own lifetime so for better or worse uh i'm expecting that there will be an even different scale of activity around this broader set of things which intersects as you said very powerfully with you know what git coin has been about but also touches on a number of other topics so uh yeah i'm curious to see where it all goes well now the ecosystem's more familiar with uh radical exchange ideas i think glenn and i should mention that it's not just bitcoin that's doing this there's a whole diverse ecosystem of people who are working on quadratic funding and i'm sure uh decentralized society at this point so it's exciting to see that all flourish in a pluralistic way itself together something i wanted to ask puja is like do you see any like obvious low-hanging examples or like improvements this paradigm could have to like core protocol level like coordination and governance in in the blockchain space like kind of below the application layer like in in terms of addressing like mav problems or like just making ethereum more more just at its kind of core oh yeah well that's a tough one so we talk a little bit in the paper about um measuring decentralization and a kind of core principle of measuring decentralization looking at the uh solidarity sort of weak weak affiliations and strong solidarities right to get a sense of where people are likely to collude and then discount against that with correlation discounts or maybe over coordinate we call it accidental over coordination or intentional collusion so um i don't think uh we have the primitives yet uh to represent those solidarities um to to start to measure decentralization not just within a layer but across different layers right and then there's that that's one aspect of it but there's also another aspect of um you know control over computational resources so it's tricky but um i think with these primitives we will get closer to actually measuring up like decentralization in different technologies if we can get it off the ground in terms of mev mav is kind of like a actual special case of data cooperatives if you think about it the problem is people have a bunch of transactions that transaction has information value right and the information value is contingent upon the other transactions uh kind of coming in around the same time but but it's a very dynamic responsive system right if if some set of transactions pull out then the information value changes so in some sense it's a challenge to form very ephemeral short-lived data cooperatives that negotiate the val the information value of their transactions and uh so that's a very it's almost like the one of the most difficult case of like uh data cooperative uh coordination um so i i think if we can solve that then we can actually solve a lot of privacy and security challenges uh that we enumerate in the paper right um maybe privacy and security is like maybe not the most productive but i think for for the sake of all the discussions that go on and crypto twitter like an interesting issue um i feel like there's you know basically you guys dropped a very like inspirational meaningful like paper about like a social philosophy that tries to make yeah web 3 more pluralistic um way more than it is now and i think it's um kind of disappointing to see all the like very ideological camps that are developing kind of like there's this kind of no that like all these credentials need to live on the blockchain and like need to be sold onto an ethereum account and the other camp of like being like hey no we we this and any of this can't be on the blockchain and i feel like it it kind of um speaks to the nature of social media right as like it's kind of meant to be polarizing i guess and like dividing us so we're like spending time in our eco chambers all day long and i was wondering like do you have any um ideas like how this plurality paradigm could bring people in harmony like outside of um crypto let's say in like concrete like widely adapted platforms like twitter i mean jaren lanier wrote a nice piece about um recently in the atlantic about the future of uh twitter that was quite aligned with what we're discussing he put it in a maybe a little bit more sort of simplistic and less algorithmic way than we we would but he just said people should be basically forced to be parts of groups on twitter and they could be part of multiple groups but they'd sort of have to post through those groups and the groups would have to stay like sort of a small enough number of groups that they could enforce reputation and whatever i i think that if you really want to do that at scale you're going to have to use primitives like we're describing where those you know people participate in the groups the groups gain reputation they have these you know tokens to identify them they're rich you know quadratic voting like rep based reputation systems etc so i think i think gerund's basically right and i think that this set of technologies hopefully is a foundation for making some version of that uh possible um so and and i think it's quite plausible we can go in that direction we know that elon musk is very inclined towards some form of uh web 3 based direction for twitter we know that the current ceo is very inclined that way and we know that they have a foundation the twitter blue sky initiative that is thinking in these directions so i think uh that is very much in in the future um and happy to talk more about some of the specific design choices that i think will be critical like making that all work but i think it will involve a lot of these elements yeah i think this this kind of raises like the broader question and like broader project um if you think about it um technology uh are when we talk about this in the paper being a kind of like communication channel right and the challenge of dsoc is to make sure these communication channels are like uh locally controlled right um and uh not hyper financialized by a set of sort of monopolists and uh you know stays uh decentralized and so a communication channel like twitter um i i think the the primitives soulbound tokens could help right show the memberships and we could see okay where are these inbound tweets coming from what's a social context but at the same time um it in order for a communication channel to really be bottom-up owned and decentralized um it it can't really be um you know one uh overrun by bots hyper financialized and ultimately the control has to reside with with users and the decisions about that communication channel um should be stewarded in a kind of like uh as the principle of cooperation or consensus across difference um you know decisions that draw on the maximally diverse participants um and and and elevate their consensus more than anyone else's to prevent that communication channel from becoming rent extractive or financialized to serve one you know particular narrow interest or contingency so like i i'm i'm i i think the twitter thing is interesting but i also want to see uh decentralized communication channels um that are uh you know bottom up owned and maybe twitter can eventually fork into that uh but but i just wanted to point put that north star out there yeah i think one really interesting element that is related to what fuji just said is that there's kind of a dual problem here on the one hand we really want cooperation across difference on the other hand we also really want local control and we need to keep both of those in mind and in fact you can't really make one work without the other so if you're going to get people to say express through following or whatever else which groups and communities are important to them it has to be the case that that decision means something and that that decision affects their experience at the same time it also needs to be the case that you don't let people end up in echo chambers and so you need algorithms that help say sort of these things are the local remit of this community and if you want to have access to those things if you want to participate in that world you better be following or whatever the word is in the community sbt following vc like whatever whatever the choice you make is to connect to an affiliate with something uh better mean be necessary and allow you to participate there at the same time when you participate in broader conversations about issues that affect many communities it's got to be the case that there's a thumb on the scale in favor of the things that uh surface surprising agreement across those communities and getting that balance right uh is going to be critical to making the system you know work to be incentive compatible basically it seems like this is as you've also mentioned earlier like a almost a lifelong uh kind of research initiative to pursue and probably beyond that um and i'd be curious like in terms of building like a intellectual community around this like do you think we could kind of embed these research efforts into like academic disciplines that are out there today like do you think it kind of falls into economics or into sociology or like should we kind of create fundamentally new academic disciplines that are like communities that that do this work and i guess it could dovetail well like i'm working on that project right now uh i don't have all the answers but my my intuition is that it doesn't fall under any existing community um and and it uh also can't ignore those communities that they bring critical elements to bear and just like pluralism uh you know the principle pluralism it has to adopt the same thing in developing as a field it has to bridge the differences across a bunch of different intellectual communities and it will be precisely that intersection between those communities that creates a new field of this type of work so economics brings mathematical rigor a design mentality at least in parts uh sociology brings a focus on social structure rather than individual incentives which i think is critical computer science build brings an orientation towards like building things that can work at scale and be deployed technologies um you know and i could go on but i think you're gonna need that sort of an intersection between a lot of different fields in order for this stuff to work i think there are too many problems within each of those fields that can't be solved or even published internal to the discourse in those fields thanks for sharing your thoughts there i guess what what puja is up to with the flashbots project i think it's like naturally like a very interdisciplinary initiative right where you're like combining cutting edge like social science with computer science and cryptography and like [Music] being at the core of like kind of the intersection of computers and sociality i wonder if you have any like stories to tell like from how how the flashbacks movement i know is recruiting people or like how these people find each other who are interested in this very multidisciplinary endeavors well with flashbacks i think it's uh folks just kind of fall down the meb rabbit hole and it's you know it's it's a difficult question as i said the kind of information value around your transactional data and so uh yeah there's a lot of different uh you know we have um auction experts mechanism design thinkers obviously computer scientists and resident residents everyone is sort of a resident philosopher i would say so it is um it is a very multi-disciplinary group um and uh i think as um technological platforms evolve like it it those those um uh groups or uh even companies that draw on the best of a across all these disciplines well will be the ones that produce like the most robust results um that can survive uh you know uh and and flourish in diversity so um i would say flash boss takes a very pluralistic approach in hiring and uh check out our jobs page if you haven't if you're interested in mev um yeah nice um yeah maybe if if the listeners are not like a aspiring builder and like entrepreneur someone who who is fascinated by this uh vision to to make web 3 more pluralistic um how would you like how can they help what do what do you think are like the right places to to learn about this to contribute and and what are some of the challenges that you think are like tangible if you want to start something from scratch i don't know next week where would you start uh i i would start with community i mean web 3 is about i think fundamentally about communities um and empowering communities and empowering uh local control and decentralization so i i always advise people to just sort of like start where you are and start with what's around you and see how you can help your community and um yeah i'm glad i'm not sure what do you think well i mean it all depends on what your skill set is and who you are i mean for researchers in different fields there's a bunch of questions there's questions about uh incentive structures and multi-level uh you know intersecting community-based funding there's questions about um community recovery which is really more of a computer science type of a question there's questions about um how uh like moving beyond prediction markets and ai uh there's a bunch of computer sciencey type questions there but there's all research questions you know then there's a question of you know you're an entrepreneur what should you go out and and start building um and there are you know lots of different pockets here i think uh one one approach is you know try to find uh for example ways to build better collaboration software that incorporates sbts into something like discord which everyone in the dow world is using and allows for governance to be integrated natively there that's like one big gap that's sitting there that can build on technologies that already exist but i mean there's there's sort of like every page of the dsoc paper has like several ideas that i think both research questions and entrepreneurial questions so uh i could go on for some time talking about this i guess when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless

working your self-sovereign life there's one kind of persona that that we missed um i'm not sure we have many in the audience but maybe i know like both of you pooja and len have and kevin also like have interacted with audrey tang the digital minister of taiwan in there i wonder like if if you are like geopolitical leader listening to this what could they do what is some what are some of the lessons that we we can learn from audrey and and her work on making taiwan one pluralistic i mean i think the public sector has a huge role to play here and for all the celebration that web 3 gets the reality we'd have to do a calculation kevin but i think probably more total resources have been allocated uh speaking even if colorado where you're based as a result of our interactions with the colorado state government as you know within the uh bitcoin ecosystem and so experiments by governments with these tools investments by public authorities in shaping the web3 ecosystem to emphasize the most democratic elements regulation that comes down tough on highly financialized schemes but that actually encourages experimentation with democratic participation using these tools i i think that the public sector has a critical role to play here and not just the public sector public conversation the ethical concerns that the public has that are in the shadow of those regulations all of those you know things i think are critical to making uh this ecosystem work so i kind of have a thought a reaction to that um and this this goes back to your earlier question about what what can entrepreneurs do in web three and the premise of web three is decentralization right and a lot of uh web three entrepreneurs forget that and um it's decentralization which uh allows or which justifies theoretically web3 from you know not being regulated by antitrust or securities and if we don't keep web 3 decentralized we are essentially recreating uh in the case of d5 traditional finance or in the case of say social media we're creating like these web 2 giants right that like hoover up our personal data and we're kind of we might not just be like back to square one we might actually be worse off right because if it goes unchecked and we talk about this in like the heaven or hell section so i kind of uh i just want to footnote uh that you know the note to entrepreneurs um uh and also note to governments like this is an experiment in decentralization um and we should keep that at the forefront of our mind and i don't think we've had enough innovation on decentralization we've had more tendencies and trends towards centralization um and and increasingly are losing the kind of goodwill and legitimacy that the space has yeah i think it's interesting that like despite over like more than 10 years in existence and like starting from the kind of premise of decentralization web 3 didn't really have the impact on society that it claimed it might have it kind of instead rather concentrated power in like different hands but i think arguably like the like big public blockchains are not like the most decentralized places when it comes to power decentralization um and and there are also all these like internal epistemological conflicts right like between different like ideological camps in the space or like different philosophies like the hyper individualist versus like the pluralists that we are at gitcoin i wonder whether we should sometimes like personally i wonder whether um it might make sense to kind of give up web 3 and like start a new technological paradigm given given that kind of disappointment there or like are you hopeful yeah i'm actually i'm i'm not well i i think it always makes sense to be optimistic in the same way it always makes sense to be pluralistic but um i i actually think so the the kind of paradigm that we lay out for measuring decentralization looking at people's affiliations and solidarities right to get a sense of how right uh collusive or colluded a network is at particularly abstract like the same analysis could actually be done in traditional finance and should be done um and glenn you wrote about this in your book in radical markets like the chapter four was precisely about the kind of um uh collusion that you might that you have for example and like the fidelities and black rots who all own the same interest across the same major airlines and same major companies and all have the same incentive to say like um you know uh have anti-competitive policies and and and you know raise prices and like lower wages and a kind of a very dystopic race to the bottom like the same analysis should also be done with our traditional structures and so i i actually think uh web 3 can lead here in the sense that it can um show uh traditional finance like okay this is decentralization this is how it should be done and let's see how you stack up to this um and and in this kind of dialectic we move forward um so i i don't think it should be abandoned i i what i would say is i think it's you know the reason why the schtick the sort of pluralist stick seems such a minority view within the web 3 space is the web 3 space has a set of values overall which is like very different from the values of the broader society and like in some ways that's good because people are into experiments with really cool new stuff but you know experiments have to be guided by values and uh if you took if you sort of took the overall values of society and then just opened up people's minds like things being a bit different and projected them onto the web three space i think you'd have a much larger contingent of people thinking in this sort of pluralist vein and you'd have a much smaller relative contingent of people in this sort of hyper you know an arc capitalist way i think you only get there because most people aren't thinking about the space at all so i think a lot of our goal has to be to connect those sort of mainstream values to these conversations about the future um and bridging those two things getting the mainstream to care about the future and getting the people in the web 3 world to care about the values that mainstream people hold is a lot of the work that i feel like i try to do and it's it's messy and there's a lot of conflict and you can easily get both sides angry but i think it's critical if you want to live those values of cooperation across difference of looking at the different communities and looking at the overlap that they they can have and finding that consensus and making things work based on it that makes sense maybe let's end this session on a more like hope like on a very hopeful note on a optimistic note assuming that we kind of be able to get these zeitgeist to merge and like you know they're not good capitalists and the pluralists to cooperate and and kind of um build more plural institutions and i know even like the individualist quadratic funding and quadratic voting stuff might take you know at least a couple of years to really pick up into the mainstream and like i don't know reaching people outside of the social technological experiment realms and likely like a very fully fledged out decentralized society where i'm starting collecting like non-transferable attestations as a kid you know and like building up my virtual soul as i as i grow old will take another yeah will take decades and then also like developing all these algorithms that make sense of of these social graphs takes decades but um what are some of the big big hopes that you have in in terms of like things you'd like to see and i mean it's not narrow cells down on number but like in 20 30 years to to come out of this one really hopeful thing that i would say is that when i give that talk in berlin that you guys mentioned in radical stage 2.0 i thought maybe in three or four years from then we would have some sense of like how you might be able to do any of this and i guess it's three years later and i think we're starting to have a sense of how you might do it now it doesn't mean it's built or that it's working working but i do think we're we're tracking if not beating sort of like the pace of going from just the broadest sketches to like what actually might be a substrate for it and and people are you you know yes qf it'll take a while but governments are using it uh it's it's entered a lot of the more mainstream vocabulary in a very intellectual level but it's entering it uh audrey's story is becoming more and more so i i do believe we have a real chance of getting there and maybe even getting there ahead of you know the progress of anarcho-capitalists or um [Music] or sort of hyper-centralized dystopias so i think we've got a we've got a real shot at it super cool yeah yeah i was wondering like what what are the like formal social institutions that like you dream about when you like assume that that we can make it it's almost like the unimaginable unmanaged unimagined cooperations between people right and and uh you know i would like to see people like looking like less at their phones and more interacting with each other and less focused on their sort of hyper-financialized you know portfolios and trading and more on building up uh you know community resources and building up assets together right i think in some sense back to me vmev is kind of a symptom of hyper financialization and not owning uh the networks uh that you participate in so i would like to see just more um local governance and i also in in terms of like i i i don't project anything beyond like five years like four years is too much but i think in the next five years like i would just like to see like small scale experiments with like set of populations that can um uh help us think through the uh incentive challenges like i really do want to see experiments amongst like scientific communities that are naturally prone to high publicity and it's part of part and parcel of their job not like you know see experiments with just sort of ordinary people who don't really know what this is and and you know my like uh just fall into it i i want to sort of be deliberate and careful and progressively uh build out the the substrate without um uh with with minimized uh risk and maximum sort of cooperation and consensus i think art and like culture will also play a critical role in like kind of onboarding like the billions of people absolutely and uh you know one of the most important initiatives i i think we've been working on with radical change is the idea of making a documentary about audrey tong's life which is one of the most inspiring stories uh i've heard so uh absolutely we need to reach people with all kinds of culture and imagination and i thought it was very cool that people came out with uh uh interesting soul bound token uh artwork just a couple of days ago so all kinds of possibilities nice i haven't seen that in all right well i have to thank you all for coming on to talk about decentralized society it feels like this is the start of something not the end of something so looking forward to seeing the community get involved and leon thank you for being my first guest co-host of greenfield thank you kevin yeah any closing remarks it's kevin and so quickly after the paper it's great to see the momentum thanks yeah the paper is great any closing remarks theon yeah um i mean if you're listening to this and join us on this journey i'm sure i will stick around i guess for the rest of my life of my working life so um connect with us on the bitcoin discord or reach out to the radical exchange folks and join the project pluralism do you guys have any closing remarks then puja i just want to emphasize like in a few weeks i'll be like releasing like a kind of research agenda like open questions and so if you're a researcher you know feel free to dm me on that more more interested in you know collaborating with the research side of things um so yeah yeah and i would second that so if uh we're i'm trying to start a network around this a like academic research network so if you're an academic who wants to work on this uh yet reach out to puja reach out to me etc amazing thanks so much for joining [Music] you
