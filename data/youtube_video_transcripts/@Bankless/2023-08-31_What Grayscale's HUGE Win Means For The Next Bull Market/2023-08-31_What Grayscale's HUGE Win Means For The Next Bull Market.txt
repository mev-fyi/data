what reinforces the hardening narrative is the ETF narrative because if they do get approved it's going to be relatively close to the harmony so let's say they get approved in q1 right they all just get approved in q1 and maybe later than some people expect but they all have to get approved together because if they don't then the SSA opens themselves up to more lawsuits so that is q1 and then April 2024 is the harmony so you have ETF narrative into hardening narrative which is going to in my opinion you know be very bullish for for the market generally and then the flywheel starts from there Bank location is the last week of August and it is time for the bankless weekly roll-up I have with me not David Hoffman today but maybe the David Hoffman of the Southern Hemisphere Anthony sassano from the daily guay hey Anthony how you doing hey Ryan I'm going good I've never been called the David Hoffman of the southern hemisphere are you insulted are you complimented or is it something I I think that was meant as a compliment so I'll take a compliment hopefully bankless listeners will uh will take it as a as a compliment as well and of course Anthony you've filled in so many times uh this summer for us as we've been on holidays David's out at Burning Man so he's not climbing a mountain this week he's out enjoying himself at Burning Man and I have no idea what Shenanigans they get up to uh there have you ever had a desire to go to Burning Man Anthony no if if there's anything that is the complete opposite of a desire that I have of to do something that would be burning man it's it's not my scene at all I I am not about that but I think it's David scene uh definitely yeah I totally see David uh fitting in there but yeah I'm I'm like you it's not my scene uh but Anthony thank you so much for for joining us today we always learned something new about crypto new about ethereum and and maybe if we're lucky knew about Australia so uh I told you I was going to be late to this episode and you said no workers I think that's how you pronounce it no workers and you said that means no worries am I getting this right so yeah it's funny that you didn't pronounce it right I didn't pronounce it right no no so it said no Walkers no workers instead of Walkers um yeah it's just weird Aussie slang that some people use I don't know how widespread it is but I say it to my friends sometimes like yeah no Walkers I feel like I had to explain that to you thank you thank you all right well we got a lot to discuss this week including something bullish which I'm glad you were here for something bullish Anthony grayscale wins their court case this is a U.S federal court that rules that the SEC has no legal authority to block the Bitcoin spot ETF proposal that is of course Very bullish we're going to talk about that also X formerly known as Twitter obtained a license to store transfer and trade Bitcoin and crypto should we be excited by this we'll talk about that uh Lido is almost at 33 percent of total staking market share Anthony I want to ask you about that if we should be concerned and we've got some news about digital currency grip this is dcg apparently they agreed to deliver 90 of the value back to Genesis creditors I'm kind of wondering if we finally cleaned up the mess from 2023 so we'll talk about all of those items and more as we get in uh just want to set the tone here Anthony this ETF news will spend a lot of time getting into it but does this make you bullish on the week and and how how bullish so I think generally I've always uh at least for the last few months kind of acted with the assumption that these ETFs are inevitable over probably the next kind of six to 12 months so the grayscale wind just further solidifies that for me and I think what it also does uh for the wider kind of audience is solidify that for them as well it basically says yes okay the ETFs you know they've been teased for so long now many many years there's been there's been kind of like teasing of a Bitcoin ETF in the US and now it finally feels like that actually really going to happen this time and I think that this this recent win from grayscale uh just kind of like solidifies that for a lot of people so definitely bullish short term you know the markets are going to do what the markets do but I think that uh anyone doubting that an ETF is going to get approved at this point you know I I wouldn't be taking that bet to be honest yeah I totally agree with you and we'll talk about that in a minute and we'll also talk about how the markets reacted to that news which was quite favorably but before we get in a message from our friends and sponsors over at Ave I know Anthony I'm sure you've used Ave many times like everyone in defy Ave V3 is here they want you to know and if that feels like old news for you because that happened back in January now Ave really wants to accelerate getting the word out because there is apparently 2.2 billion dollars in Ave V3 but there's also a couple billion still in Ave V2 and their message is to go migrate your assets to V3 it is now time you can go to app.ave.com site in order to migrate your assets from V2 to V3 there's some big benefits there better Capital efficiency they've got some Supply and borrow caps that limit the amount in pools for a particular token this is called asset isolation mode and of course a cheaper gas prices so you can stack your eth rather than spending it if you're a builder as well they are subsidizing Ave grants towards their new stable coin go so you can check that out at the avegrants.org website there's a link in the show notes as well alright Anthony let's get to the markets uh these are the charts that Kraken is showing us on the week this is Bitcoin and we are up on the week my friend look at this glorious green candle right here I think that happened around the time of the uh the ETF Court decision that we were just talking about so let me read out some numbers we started the week at about 26 000 we are ending the week at least at the time of recording at 27 300 so we are up five percent in bitcoin price this green candle is this all directly related to the um the court and the ETF ruling oh it's a hundred percent correlated and related to that and I think that it's pretty much mostly Traders driving this as well because if you look at what the Traders have been looking at over the last few weeks or pretty much all of them have been talking about the grayscale decision because they've been teased that every Tuesday and Friday people were checking the uh I think it was the sec's website or uh no maybe not the sec's website but a website that would show you the result of the lawsuit um and it wouldn't it didn't come for like you know last Tuesday last Friday and a few before that and then it finally came today and yeah every Trader that I looked at was looking at the same thing they're like we're going to go down maybe uh if nothing happens you know if if grayscale loses their case we go down if gray scale wins their case we go up but whether that actually results in any kind of long-term sustained kind of um upward price movement at least for the short term it's hard to tell because I think I've I've been on here before and said to you uh last time we had a pump like this which was the SEC case against Ripple where Ripple won that case and we had that massive kind of pump on not just BTC and Heath but everything else and I said to you if there's no follow through we're just going to sell back down and the follow-through has to come from new money um because if we don't have new money it's just Traders and all the Traders are going to do is they're just going to short it back down because all they're looking for is that short-term profit they're not looking to invest right they're not investors they're they're literally playing a different game to investors it's funny that was uh the SEC Ripple court case happened another week while David was out every time he leaves something bad happens to Gary Gensler and I don't know what he's off doing but maybe he's like like hunting down horcruxes or something uh but yeah we need him to stay away for another week and then maybe Gary gets fired but so so you're just saying this this pump is basically traitor action and what we're going into this court case um what were people thinking like do you think people were over or under um grayscale beating the the SEC what were kind of the odds in the sentiment going into this I I really do think it was a coin toss for a lot of people um and I think a lot of people in crypto definitely don't have a very good read of the the legal world I think they basically learn about it because of these crypto cases and myself included to be honest I mean especially in the US I mean I don't live in the US so I've never really had a reason to pay attention to it so it's all new to me so I kind of looked at it like that I was like you know it's a coin toss it's 50 50. I've got no idea but then the Judgment came out and as we're going to talk about and it really kind of was less than it was it was sorry it was much better than 50 50 in in odds of of grayscale it should have been like 90 10 you know 90 that were going to win 10 they were going to lose just based on the the the the kind of result there but for Traders I feel like you you know you can see over the last kind of like week or two it was just completely flat and just pretty boring and that was because all the Traders I think were waiting for this signal in particular which is kind of wild when you think about it but at the same time there's also not much else going on as as you know we know there's not new money coming in right now in terms of Market activity I'm the uh The Innovation side and technical side of things is different but Market activity yeah it's it's really just the kind of trade a game right now well let's look at a few Trader numbers too ether's up on the week I believe we're at 17 15 at the time of recording that's up to two and a half percent so uh up less than Bitcoin as you'd expect Bitcoin kind of reading leading this because this is about a spot Bitcoin ETF but still up nonetheless and uh total crypto market cap 1.14 trillion on the week by the way this is about a if we're looking at the the one year view a 12 increase on the year in total crypto market cap but here are the charts that you were referring to that that maybe are even more exciting and not just for Traders but for long time uh crypto settlers this is L2 total locked value and uh the scaling factor for ethereum this looks at all of the the interesting metrics around our l2s and you tweeted this out earlier in the week Anthony ethereum layer 2 activity continue is being up only what bear market and here you're looking at a chart from L2 beat which shows the scaling factor that is activity on ethereum at a multiple of ethereum mainnet of 5.24 X which is absolutely massive and you can see it I don't know what the time is this just the last no this is the the the entirety of the last year and we've just had a 5x in transactions over the last year is that right mm-hmm yeah exactly well yeah I mean we're basically you can see there's that blue kind of section there the blue squiggly line that's ethereum L1 TPS which isn't going to go up because ethereum L1 is already at capacity and then you've got the the red above it which is showing all the l2s that l2b is tracking and their TPS just going up over over time and get and basically being up only over the last year at least for sure Anthony that is an interesting question it's like so um what is the capacity right now for this for this red line so of course mainnet the blue line has just 16 transactions per second it's kind of the full capacity of ethereum and gas fees start getting wonky and you know we can't go uh over that um but how about layer twos right now tell us about the the pre um proto-dank sharding EIP um 4844 world and then the post one yeah so it's always a difficult thing when when measuring TPS because uh not all networks are created equal of course and I think what l2b tries to do here is normalize the TPS as well because there are different kind of ways to measure it depending on the layer 2 that you're looking at so that's what they've done in in this chart here um I can't give you like an upper bound number uh of kind of total TPS across these l2s as exists today but I can say it's a lot higher than here we're pretty much nowhere near capacity um from from from what I can tell and what I've what I've been able to to research and then after erp4844 goes live that that goes up by at least 10x um from from kind of what I've seen here and I also want to note about ethereum L1 it's it's kind of funny when measuring TPS because the way ethereum works is that uh or at least ethereum L1 works is that it has what's called a gas limit which is the block size of of ethereum L1 blocks now this gas limit is taken up by various transactions and each of these transactions has a different amount of gas that it use uses so for example if all of the transfers on the ethereum or sorry all of the transactions on the ethereum network were only eighth transfer so transfers of eth the asset to and from addresses and things like that not smart contracts just to and from addresses the ethereum network could do I think upwards of 40 transactions per second just just doing that but because ethereum L1 does a lot more than just simple each transfers obviously we have Smart contracts we have D5 nfts um we kind of level out an average of you know 15 16 TPS or something like that because those other things take up more gas which means that the gas limit fills up quicker per block um or by those transactions and that's how the TPS is measured the same is true for a lot of l2s as well especially the ones that are evm compatible or equivalent uh but as I said because there are certain l2s that aren't like stock net for example they're pushing like hundreds of TPS right now but their TPS is measured in a different way that you would measure it on an evm chain and that's why I said that l2b in this chart tries to normalize it so that it actually is as close to equivalent as like L1 ethereum TPS measure as possible that's a great Point uh yeah thanks thanks for getting into that too it's something we often forget um this is also another screenshot from a new website that we just kind of uncovered it's called growthepie.xyz and this is another measurement of the layer 2 metrics this is actually built by someone in the bankless community so it's really cool to see this but uh another resource for you in addition to L2 beat um Anthony let's talk a little bit about some of your predictions actually because this was a tweet thread that I came across and wanted to include in the market section now that we have you as a as a co-host this week makes even more sense to talk about it you said earlier in this week it was Monday GM bulls and happy Monday I know that it may seem dark and gloomy in the markets right now but there are always bright spots over longer time periods and I'm here today to share some of them with you and so then you go over some of those bright spots over the next 12 to 18 months here are the The Outsider bullish narratives you mentioned the Bitcoin happening in April 2024 the potential ETF Bonanza which maybe that it's it's interesting because that prediction's already coming true you said this on Monday now by uh Wednesday we have this fantastic ETF news um Eve staking becomes very attractive to Trad five because of the passive income yield there's some positive U.S regulatory stuff maybe a stable coin bill which is kind of interesting because we've had a lot of bad regulatory news up to this point I would say and maybe you're you're saying that's going to start to shift Trad Phi companies keep playing with an adopting crypto visa and PayPal those are recent examples those are all of the outsider bullish narratives then we could get into The Insider bullish narratives but let me just just pause you're feeling bullish it seems like Anthony tell us about the big picture and then any of these Outsider bullish narratives that you think are most relevant right now mm-hmm yeah I'm I'm definitely feeling very bullish for the next kind of 12 to 18 months especially I I've kind of operated under the assumption for this year 2023 that we're basically just replaying 2019 in terms of kind of Market action General sentiment all the stuff that happened in 2019 that laid the groundwork and kind of like the Bedrock for the bull market of 2020 and 2021 and I'm feeling the exact same thing play out right now so if you were to take that to its kind of logical conclusion you would say that 2024 is like 2020 and then 2025 would be like 2021 hopefully with a lot less fraud because unfortunately there was a lot of fraud that ended up happening in in uh the last bull market led by of of course SBF and some other kind of actors in the space so I looked at the kind of a big picture here and kind of tried to articulate why I'm bullish and bucketed into two categories that you mentioned the outsider bullish narratives which are things that the outside crypto people can get excited about the things that are easily digestible the things that we don't have to spend spend you know a whole hour explaining to people for them to actually understand what's happening and then The Insider narratives now the cool thing about the outsider narratives is that the crypto natives can also get excited about the outsider narratives just as much as they can get excited about The Insider ones so we get like a double whammy by being crypto natives but on the outside of ones you know I look at the obvious things the Bitcoin Harmony it's it's kind of a meme or a pretty strong narrative that after every Harmony the market pumps right BTC pumps and then we get a bull market within basically six to 12 months of that happening and that has happened every time so far 2012 into the 2013 2016 into 2017 20 uh 20 into 2021 so it feels like we're on track for that to happen again but what reinforces the hardening narrative is the ETF narrative because if they do get approved it's going to be relatively close to the harmony so let's say they get approved in q1 right they all just get approved in q1 it may be later than some people expect but they all have to get approved together because if they don't then the SEC opens themselves up to more lawsuits so that is q1 and then April 2024 is the harmony so you have ETF narrative into hardening narrative which is going to in my opinion you know be very bullish for for the market generally and then the flywheel starts from there so I think could you imagine could you imagine Anthony so like BlackRock gets their ETF approved then into the The Happening and then they're starting to pump that the The Happening meme is like I mean that's something that could happen right in order to attract they're going to sell that to the new BlackRock ETF the the thing about the ETFs is that is that there's not just one of them and I think this is important for people to to kind of keep in mind there are multiple uh ETFs and they're all competing with each other and the start of the product is the most important because they want to show that they get the most inflows right like you want to show that you're the market leader so what are you going to do to do that well you're going to start now no you're not going to start when it's approved you're going to start now reaching out to your clients reaching out to your high net worth clients as well and you're going to be telling them hey you know know there's this thing happening there's this thing happening the hardening Bob and you're going to give him the bullish pitch because you want them to put their money with you as soon as that ETF gets approved because you want to be the market leader so that you can just start that flywheel of getting more money in so that's a great point I had not put that together this kind of this stacking of timelines here but you're exactly right yeah it almost seems like it's orchestrated some people said that to me they're like it almost seems like the whole thing's just manipulated and orchestrated I'm like it does to an extent but then you also need to consider that the four-year cycle is also the political cycle in the US right yeah next year's election year I actually think Satoshi did this on purpose to be honest um really so yeah I I have a I have a thesis that's never going to be proven or disproven obviously because we don't know I feel like that the timing is on purpose because election years um I will always kind of I guess like a a pretty fun yeah let's just put it that way I'm not gonna get into politics here and and it just it all lines up too perfectly to me fine as well forehead Anthony you could say that when you're not living in the U.S yeah exactly exactly and I think that there's other things around it just act as more positive narrative Catalyst because the narrative is what matters um uh for for the market at least over kind of like the the bull market period uh the fundamentals don't kick in until like the longer term uh and I think the narrative is is going to be very very strong next year uh at least you know the outside narrative but also The Insider one but that's my general view on the outside of stuff okay that's the outsider stuff uh Bitcoin ETF and The Happening a big thing here we also talked about some some positive us regulatory headwinds the stablecoin bill could totally see that and we've talked so much on the Roll-Ups about Visa and PayPal now has a stable coin but but this point on the outsider bullish narratives I want to dig in to you for for one more second here um each staking becomes very attractive to tratify because of the passive income yield so you know everything you were just saying about kind of like the black rocks of the world and Wall Street getting on board here that was all Bitcoin related but you also think simultaneously they will start to understand tradify will start to understand eth staking I mean I think I believe that too but I'm wondering if you have any like evidence for that or any thoughts on why that happens so I think that they're already kind of try to fight players getting involved with each staking uh to be honest they're definitely doing it through the providers that uh KY seeing them and things like that because they have to due to regulations so you're not going to really see it you know they're not going to go with with rocketpool for example at least not right now because they probably just legally can't uh they may not even be able to legally go with Lido for example so they're probably going with these other providers maybe coinbase there's alluvial that recently got announced they're targeting more of the kind of like Enterprise kind of stuff there but just generally tradify loves yield because they can sell that product to their customers very easily because the customers love yield they know there's this Obsession that people have with yield and I get it because it's it sounds nice um but I have my own opinions on yield generally but I'll leave those on the table uh but but generally I think when it comes to e-staking what people forget is that in a bull market the yield is going to go up because we're going to get more activity on the Chain which is going to result in more fees which is going to result in more yield for all the stakers which is going to result in a flywheel of people being like holy crap the yield's so high I need to stake right and we're going to get such an inflow of of each steak and um I do believe we're gonna get an ETF as well I don't know how long after BTC gets approved we'll get an eighth one I can't imagine it's going to be very very long after that and the number one selling point that these kind of ATF issuers are going to say about eth is staking they're gonna they're gonna pump the hell out of staking I I'm very confident in that yeah it would be it would be wild if we Bitcoin ETF approved uh get Gensler out of office you know something happens with kind of the elections and then 12 months later you have a an ethereum ETF approved okay let's talk about some of these Insider bullish narratives these are the ones for us that the outside world doesn't really know about um the overall four-year cycle timing is still playing out nicely and only maybe gets invalidated if 2024 is another crab year in my opinion that's your opinion so what's interesting is uh you just think the four year cycle we're on repeat yet again and some people always a criticism against that is like can't be that easy Anthony like come on man like that's just we we like to over complicate our investment thesis in crypto a lot and think we're very smart and so we they can't see history repeating what for the fourth time is this um you also also say Bitcoin actually pumps again after The Happening layer twos continue taking off we get a proper Layer Two summer so we haven't seen a layer two summers what you're implying decentralized social platforms uh ethereum is drastically improved Supply Dynamics finally kind of like kick in in the way like we we I I feel like they should have kicked in more and they haven't fully kicked in I think that's what you're implying here well Dex volumes Eve burn goes nuts yeah give us the highlights from The Insider narratives here yeah I I want to hit on that kind of like Supply Dynamic thing I think that they have played out in the bear Market but they've played out in a different way than what people expected so they played out with eighth going down only a little bit against the BTC uh this bear Market whereas last bear Market eighth went down 90 percent against the BTC from its top ninety percent so if you put 10 BTC into each at the top you were left with one BTC at the bottom right that is a substantial loss the difference here now is that it is only down 25 against BTC this bear Market which is substantially different now I chalk that up completely to it's drastically improved supplier Dynamics and its monetary policy with the merge issuance reduction and the burn which has further and staking of course which has further strengthened east's store of value properties which is all that matters for Value accrual uh at that size um store value and money is what BTC and Eid have going for them and eth has proven this bear Market that it has achieved a very strong store value property and it has out not outperformed BTC but only underperformed it by a little bit that's a great point so you're you're saying basically last cycle and people don't remember this last cycle 2018 last last uh bear Market eth got absolutely freaking slaughtered it got destroyed along with all of the alt Bitcoins you know the altcoins right of of that cycle this time it was alongside Bitcoin a flight to safety asset exactly and it slurped in all of that liquidity and that is so different from the last bear Market I I don't think I I properly took time to reflect on that but you're absolutely right and then similarly in the in the bull market when demand comes back I really do think that's going to play out in a really positive way for eth because there's just not going to be that much to buy and the narratives for eighth are really really strong obviously BTC has a strong narrative with the ETF happening right now but I think the I like to bucket these into two different kind of things I think the ATF narrative goes into my bucket of impulse narratives where an Impulse happens the news happens the price impulses up but then it kind of Fades away over time and it doesn't doesn't keep doing the impulses because people get over the news right it's kind of like whatever the news is the news we bought the news now we have to wait for new new kind of news and narratives and the narrative kind of loses steam but there's another bucket which is the fundamentals bucket right which is exactly what Eve has with its change Supply Dynamics which play out over the longer term and you can actually see this on each BTC especially recently um you know especially over the last 24 hours I know this is short term but this illustrates my point each BTC went down because btsa impulsed up on the grayscale news right but then April between they say has just started kind of like cruising a little bit back up again since then over the last kind of like 12 hours because the impulse is kind of over and now we're just going back to the fundamentals so if if Heath is going up against BTC based on on fundamentals when and demand is just there when the demand comes back in you can imagine a world where each BTC just continues going up only um over time and even potentially next bear Market maybe eth is the one that outperforms BTC and BTC goes down against Eve and eighth becomes that kind of like Top Flight to safety asset the real flipping finally happens uh yeah kind of the last Point here on the markets that we want to touch is this idea of Layer Two summer okay and so you're you're analoging this to the to the previous bear to Bull cycle right you know saying this is 2019 right and let's go with that narrative for a while so we had our defy summer in 2020 and uh that was kind of the year after right and you're analoging this and you're and you're saying your analog energizing this you're saying now now we might get a layer two summer in 2024 I think that's what you're saying so D5 being kind of the new layer twos it's also interesting here where you you talk about decentralized decentralized social platforms well maybe that becomes the new kind of nft of the of the previous cycle here um I want to provide some maybe thoughts around this or other numbers that that we see on the week base is the fastest Layer Two to a hundred thousand users this is Delphi digital tweet this Milestone was reached just 56 days after launch so a lot of users flocking this of course is is measured by um daily active unique addresses of course um this is uh haasu saying rule number one you always underestimate the importance of distribution even when you know rule number one and try to keep it in mind actually not totally sure what he's saying there but um fiscanti says this is wild given there was no expectation of an airdrop or base token that's what's very interesting about this rapid uptake is that there is no token to provide juice and yet it got to a hundred thousand users in record time do you think this sets us up for an L2 summer that is similar in some respects to D5 summer and you know tell me a bit about that too yeah so my whole kind of thesis on an L2 summer revolves around I guess maybe two main things the first thing is that l2s are finally here and usable and we have big institutions like crypto institutions like coinbase building their own and making it really easy to bridge into these things there's liquidity on them uh there there are apps on them uh it really feels like the you know a lot of these top l2s are just like L1 in terms of liquidity the apps that are on there obviously there's more liquidity on R1 still but for the smaller players definitely probably enough at this point on these platforms and and the second thing is just fresh money coming in now fresh money can come from various different sources it doesn't just have to come from the outside kind of new money that's not in crypto right now maybe it's sitting in a bank account earning some yield and then they come back into crypto fresh money can come from other ecosystems and also from people who haven't actually come on chain yet and that's my real ball thesis for L2 and this is the same thing that happened in D5 summer it brought people who had never come on chain that were in crypto maybe they held some Ethan an exchange they held BTC on Exchange and they saw what was happening in D5 summer and they said I want some of that right so they brought their eth on chain they learned how to use metamask and other wallets they learned how to put liquidity into uni swap pools they learned how to yield Farm they learned how to do all of these things and we got the birth of D5 and defies just kept innovating and growing uh since then and I think similarly with with l2s you're going to get the same thing where people are going to be like what we saw recently with friend Tech they're like I want a piece of that right I really want to get on chain and I want to get amongst this excitement that's happening right now and I think that just by the sheer number of l2s that we have going live and that are live right now the apps just scrambling to get on to get onto these things because I know that's where the users are going to be the ports of Entry becoming a lot easier because obviously you know coinbase supports direct bridging into base is really cheap it costs like 10 cents or something that's going to get cheaper over time all of that is going to bring more money on chain and also the the outside money is also going to come in and they're probably going to skip L1 and just go to L2 so I think that that's all setting it us up for when the market heats up and and that new Outsider money comes in we could potentially see a proper layer to Summer where things just go go nuts and we could potentially see new layer twos launching and within one day getting a hundred thousand users not 56 days there you go a lot of reasons to be bullish maybe right now or the setup is here if you're both an outsider you've got you've got some narratives and uh if you're an Insider you've got some as well but Anthony we've got a lot more to talk about coming up that big L for Gary Gensler and the SEC the U.S court said the SEC was wrong to deny the grayscale ETF we'll talk about that there's also an

the show notes grayscale just won a Monumental legal Victory against the SEC and the entire crypto industry including you and I Anthony we got a lot of costs to celebrate um this was the fight for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S and this is not we can't declare mission accomplished final Victory but this was a major step forward for grayscale and crypto to get a spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the US maybe just before we get into this uh some context what's your take Anthony on why doesn't the US already have a spot Bitcoin ETF I mean Europe has one Canada has one I don't know if Australia has one lots of jurisdictions have one the US doesn't why so I think in recent times it's because the SEC has just waged this war on on crypto um and I think this and by recent I mean over the last kind of like few years it seems they typically have kind of cited concerns around Market manipulation and things like that which I don't think that holds much water and then they would they would kind of cite concerns around custody but we have coinbase as a custodian who has been operating like that for over 10 years now and has never been hacked right and they have the best in class custody you're probably ever going to get from a crypto custodian so really I I don't think there's any reason for them to to be denying these things outside of personal bias and and just not wanting to see see this happen and that is pretty much I think what the judge has actually said here as well yeah the judge used these words uh arbitrary and capricious to Define uh what the SEC was doing and SEC leadership was doing if you just need a definition of what capricious means given to sudden and unaccountable changes of mood or behavior I love that unaccountable changes of mood and behavior and that's what the SEC has felt very much to I think the crypto community and a lot of retail investors is they're just not a cat like everyone wants a Bitcoin ETF I can't think of anyone who is a retail investor who doesn't want this if you just because the product exists doesn't mean you have to buy it right and so exactly why why are they restricting this choice I think I I go back to and I agree with you Anthony that's it's largely why don't we have a spot Bitcoin ETF it's because Gary Gensler doesn't actually want it so um this was a decisive ruling that happened uh the judge of a DC Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the SEC to vacate its own order denying greyscales application nation and what they were trying to do here this is grayscale applying to convert their G BTC trust into an ETF which would also solve a whole number of other problems right because there are a lot of retail investors who actually own gbdc and that is trading down and and lower than spot um Bitcoin so it's a very inefficient Market um so and the sac approved that product by the way yeah it doesn't make any sense so anyway this is a big setback a big L for Gary Gensler in the SEC and a big win for grayscale in the crypto industry this was actually interesting as well not only was it a pushback of the SEC they actually the court actually said that SEC violated the APA act which is the administrative procedure act if you look this up Anthony the APA is actually a set of laws that all federal agencies so you know if you're like the EPA or the FTC with the cftc or the S CC not just Financial but all U.S government agencies they're required to abide by a set of laws in terms of their process for rule making right they cannot be arbitrary and capricious right you know they they have to actually abide by a set of Standards when doing this rulemaking and the court said they didn't uh it's very rare for a court system to actually side with a lawsuit and find a regulator in violation of the APA so not only the is this a big loss in this specific issue I feel like it's a it's a major drain on SEC credibility right and I've got to think Anthony that's going to come back to bite uh Gary Gensler you have to start to wonder how long he's going to keep his job this is Jake chavinsky saying gray skills victory over the SEC is massive he also Echoes it's very rare for a federal circuit court to find that an agency has violated the APA by acting arbitrarily and capriciously the DC Court just delivered a huge embarrassment for the SEC and then he goes on and says but the ETF isn't approved yet uh yeah so what's what's your take on all of this so far yeah I mean the point about The ssc's credibility is a good one because I would say that right now the sec's credibility is pretty much almost zero right it's like Terra Luna after it crashed um it's just gone to zero uh because they haven't really protected anyone all of the settlements that they do just seem like protection money that they're taking in right they'll they'll they'll they'll sue someone for doing something and then they won't go to court because that someone or entity will be like well it's better for us to pay this fine which is normally less than the money that they actually raised from the alleged to unregistered security sale right um then go to court but it seems that every time that the SEC goes to court they lose you know they lost the Ripple case they lost this case are they going to lose the coinbase case I mean that's very good maybe they like losing I don't know yeah yeah exactly exactly so the SSS credibility I think is very low right now as as you said like it begs the question like how long these games are going to keep his job I think that it's a lot of politics going on obviously because Gensler is a Democrat appointee the Democrats don't want to be removing one of their appointees um you know like that all these firing one of their employ appointees like that during especially during an election year obviously as I was saying before uh next year it doesn't make them look very good but it could be kind of like a graceful exit thing where they kind of promote him to another position and basically say that oh you know he's been promoted and we're replacing him with someone you know better or something right so yeah just just generally um no one in crypto definitely thinks the ACC is a credible agency at this point with Gary Gensler at the helm and I think outside of crypto even the Trout fight people that I follow also think that uh Gary gensler's war on crypto is based on nothing uh and is really against the law yeah so I as happy as it would make me for Gary Gensler to exit his position that that might not be what actually happens but this whole thing could pot could cause him to to pause and take a step back or he could completely go to war and double down maybe he has the the political backing in order to do that this is Jake travinsky again one theory on where the SEC will go from here one theory is that the SEC will just pick a different reason to deny grayscale's proposal and force more long and costly litigation they could do that Anthony that's possible he says it's hard to understate the extreme hostility of the SEC leadership towards crypto wheelchair Gensler really accept this loss maybe he'll feel like backed in a corner and want to double down on his position but another theory Jake says is that the SEC will take the DC circuit Court's decision and do a semi-graceful exit from their anti-etf position Jake says I'm in this Camp it's the right move we disagree they could say but we're following the law it's that's an convenient excuse to back out of a losing battle so hopefully they choose to they're in this place on the check and chess board where where they're in check right now and hopefully rather than kind of like doubling down and and losing the game they actually just just back off um Jake says there's also political pressure on the SEC to prove the spot Bitcoin ETFs not just about grayscale all of tradfy is ready for a Bitcoin ETF including BlackRock and Larry Fink who also you mentioned the Democrats earlier he throws some pretty heavy punches in uh Democrat circles and political DC uh Jake concludes This Thread I have no doubt that we'll get a spot Bitcoin ETF sooner or later the only question is how painful the SEC wants to make it on themselves I strongly recommend that CC picks sooner rather than later we'll see this is um what we're seeing in mainstream coverage this is ABC News Bitcoin ETF appears to be on the way after Court hands the SEC a stinging loss that's what the normies are saying Anthony they're saying this is a stinging loss and then the ETF is on the way so um they're seeing it too I guess all good news from here and also to the point you made earlier there are a lot of ETFs that have applied that are due for rulings in the coming weeks and months so many I can't even keep track of them honestly but there's bit wise there's black rock there's vanak there's there's Wisdom Tree I think there's Kathy Woods Ark invest there's just a whole line of them and um you know they these will come out over the weeks to come we had an expert on uh bankless recently uh James effort he is a research analyst at Bloomberg he tracks all of these things and his prediction was possibly by the end of the year we get this but more likely in q1 of 2024 that's when some of all of the dates kind of converge and the bill really comes due and the SEC is essentially forced to uh either approve or you you know finally disprove all of these applications mm-hmm yeah and I think um the thing that throws a little bit of a I guess like uh what's the term looking for a little bit of a kind of uh a spanner in the in the works there is that the arc ETF that you mentioned actually has a due date before q1 like a final due date I don't know exactly when that is but it's sooner so the as I mentioned before the SSC actually has to approve all of these things at once they can't approve one and not the others because they're from my understanding they're not allowed to be seen to be picking favorites and if they do pick one at like if they approve Arc and not the others what ends up happening is that they open themselves up to massive lawsuits which they're probably guaranteed to lose and that's just even worse than the situation they're in right now so two outcomes The Arc ETF gets denied so that Arc has to refile so that um the SEC can approve all of the ETFs next year in q1 as we just mentioned or they all get approved by the arc date I'm leaning towards the former more um just because I don't know it makes for I think it's nice said just to prove them in q1 fresh new year right everyone's feeling bullish because it's a new year let's let's do that but it could happen at the arc date um but I think the funny outcome will be that the arc one gets denied and then everyone's like oh my God all the ETFs are going to get denied but in reality it's just because they want to approve them all in q1 so that's another kind of little bit of a short-term narrative to pay attention to that's a great Point um more on the SEC too they just charged an LA based median entertainment company called impact Theory which I've never heard of for unregistered offering of nfts I don't know if you you took a look at this story and yeah I want to just quickly uh notice note the headline here and I'd registered offering of nfts as far as I know is not a thing there is no way to register an offering of nfts right so if what they're doing here is that they're trying to frame that all nfts are securities by saying this right the headlines should have read an unregistered offering of Securities not of nfts because there the SSA has not been able to to kind of like state or prove in law that nfts are all Securities so they're trying to basically just do their regulation by enforcement um thing here uh which is just crap and I really hate the fact that they did this headline because it just speaks to the fact that they're still stuck in their ways um and I really want that to change but we'll have to we'll have to see yeah the framing was wrong uh certainly Hermione Wong agrees with you this looks like a naked yeah I got it from her actually I didn't know if you had this this thread here up but yeah she says the same thing yeah I um I I think that's true now I will say that this actual security offering disguised as an nft or kind of tokenized as an nft actually does appear to be clearly a security right I mean they really yeah I mean this is a really great project that yeah yeah Zach xbt did a threat on this project in 2021 I'm not defending the project here at all it was definitely very dodgy and definitely it looks like a security to me based on the the um assertions that the SEC made here but like again the headline is just ridiculous and second um they paid 6.1 million dollars in fines they burned the nfts that they owned and they raised 30 million dollars so did they actually come out ahead in the end that's another great question well Hester purse makes the uh commissioner has to post and uh her colleague another commissioner from the SEC make make the same point that that you're making is just let's make sure that this doesn't apply I don't know if this is a descent or just a thought piece from from commissioner purse this matter raises larger questions with which the commission should grapple before bringing additional nft cases so okay Hester saying that this is a you know a flagrant Securities issue but like hold on time out before we carry this to all of the nft cases uh let's pause and actually consider this for a moment I don't know if she'll be listened to um there were some other interesting regulatory news in the U.S the IRS released a draft of proposed reporting rules for digital asset Brokers the bad news here Anthony is they seem to want to treat everyone as if they're a broker and everything like it's a broker and this could include the front end of uniswap or etherscan or any other defy app interface that you use today and what they're saying is similar broker level reporting requirements would would come from them so if you make a trade on uniswap let's say then uniswap has to cut a file to the individual who makes that trade with kind of all of all of the the tax liabilities and you know the price related data and of course this is not how any of this works um the I like IRS is presuming that there's some form of intermediary like we're dealing with an exchange anyway this caused some concern of course in in crypto and and D5 as well and uh we'll have to see how that plays out they just put together a proposed ruling for comments so the industry is kind of commenting back and we'll see where this where this all shakes out but I think the big question to me is what what do you think about U.S hostility to crypto you actually implied earlier when we were talking about the the bull cases for crypto that the US might pivot its stance a little bit and uh I'm increasingly feeling and seeing a lot of doomerism in the space so this is a tweet all caps proposed tax regs threaten us blockchain access okay and I think that's true the proposed tax regs our regulations are pretty bad this is a Gabe Shapiro saying in the end our entire industry will just be run by coinbase and a small number of others they will all have government licenses and run some compliant kyc'd web app style sort of like an app store and all the D5 devs they'll have to pay their Vig to them and simp to get listed all right there's a lot of doomerism I think going on from uh especially those that live in the U.S this is um Antonio from dydx saying crypto Builders should just give up serving U.S customers for now and try to re-enter in five to ten years it's really not worth the hassle or compromises then he goes on in this thread to talk about how ironic it is he's an American he's writing this from his office in New York City and nobody in his company can actually use the product that he is developing and he says it's effing ridiculous and that is ridiculous what's your take on this uh you know kind of doomerism type feeling about the the US regulatory approach to crypto right now so I think the doomers are gonna always be kind of like very on the on the side of doomerism um for various different reasons and I I I genuinely take a much more kind of like uh I guess hopeful approach to these things I would say that Gabe's tweet is just being very kind of like out there with his assertion here that they'll just be government licenses and compliant kyc to everything it's just what it's doing is it's taking like the worst case as if it's the base case and then applying that and saying this is this is what we're gonna get right this is the end state of the ecosystem which I honestly think is a ridiculous take the proposed um the the proposed things you were just talking about the the tax regulations yes they are crappy they're bad they're unworkable but they're not law they're not the regulations yet they can be amended and changed over time and I I bet that they will be to the point where they actually get sanitized and look a lot better than what they do today um based on feedback and things like that and I also think that inherently a lot of stuff is actually hard to understand for even people in crypto let alone people outside of crypto so how much uh you know knowledge do the people writing these things uh have about crypto if they've got nothing then they're going to write it as if they are as they understand it then they're going to solicit feedback and get comments in whether they listen to that is another thing but that's that's kind of what happens from there and then the final point with Antonio's tweet here by saying that the crypto Builder should just give up and leave the US is the worst thing that they could possibly do because if you give up and leave the US that means you're not fighting anymore right and if you try to come back in five to ten years we're probably living in Gabe's world where he said that everything's just kyc because no one was around to fight it it's like it's like saying that well my house is on fire I'll just go down to the McDonald's for lunch and then I'll come back and everything will be okay that's not how it works right so that take to me is just kind of ridiculous but it is also ridiculous that his own employees in the company the the software that they're building in the U they can't actually use it like that is crazy right um and obviously diodex is not the only app that is gonna um the only project that's gonna suffer from this so that needs to be fixed but it's not going to be fixed by leaving the US and coming back in five years that's going to make it worse yeah I I agree and some of this honestly Anthony is like um cathartic for me to read because it's so frustrating right so a certain amount of I wouldn't say maybe doomerism but kind of alarmism uh rally the troops ism is actually necessary for us to kind of like take a stand and talk about how stupid it is that the US doesn't have a Bitcoin ETF why because some Regulators on a power trip how stupid it is that Builders uh D5 Builders like Antonio are building a fantastic application that like benefits the rest of the world and his own company he himself can't actually use it like how dumb is that and I do think part of this is letting our our voices be heard well not succumbing to kind of that doomerism that maybe Gabe's tweet suffers from this is Mike selig a crypto lawyer we've had on the show he says the SEC cftc fincen ofac New York Department of Financial Services and now the IRS have all tried to regulate crypto out of existence the us is going to run out of regulators to throw at crypto pretty soon when he regulate his holy crap I think that is a great point we have been at some point of like seeing the worst at this point in times like all of The Regulators have something against crypto and and we are making some progress we got a lot more to talk about dcg agreed to deliver 90 back to Genesis creditors that's big news also Anthony I want to ask you about Lido they're almost at 33 percent of each staked is that a big deal should we be concerned oh did you hear this too big boy crypto fired bit boy I didn't even think

week we're mentioning a Roman storm the developer of tornado cash how he was arrested by U.S prosecutors he is already out on bail according to his lawyer Brian Klein so that is good news Brian says although I remain very disappointed that the prosecutors charged him because he helped develop software their novel legal theory has dangerous implications for all software developers he notes that Roman storm is already out on bail so that is some good news just a follow-up from last week there is a link we'll include in the show notes where you can actually give Roman and other tornado cash developers their their legal defense you can donate to their legal defense if you want to do that this is from the free Alex persev website according this has been vetted by several folks I trust in in crypto and it looks like the funds are going to flow to tornado cash legal defense that's another way we uh we push back Anthony this was interesting to me we've been talking about farcaster a little bit on Bank list recently certainly web3 social has kind of picked up steam and forecaster V3 their roll up starts on Tuesday well actually it already started so that was yesterday at the time of recording what's interesting about this is new users actually have to pay money to use this network five dollars per year to use the network and that lets you store 5 000 casts 2 500 reactions and 2 500 follows I was just curious like what do you think of this model the the idea that we're actually paying rather than through our eyeballs I guess an ad model we're paying to use our web3 software do you think this will be scalable do you think we'll see this elsewhere yeah so I think forecaster is probably the best attempt we've seen at something like this uh in in and outside of crypto basically making a social media platform that people will just pay for right instead of as you said having our eyeballs kind of hijacked by ads and we become the product we actually pay for the product and we get a certain usage out of it so it's basically just API kind of like reads and and storage and things like that but I think you know five dollars a year I I think the the price was choke was definitely chosen by the firecaster team purposefully and the limits they've put in place for that was also chosen purposefully but I think that's going to cover most users and I think that being able to to get access to a decentralized social media Network that you can kind of interact with and be on for five dollars a year is an absolute bargain right especially when you can pay in crypto which I'm going to assume is going to be available from from day one here I've been on flightcaster for a little while now I've tried to engage I mean it's very hard to break my Twitter habit that that's for sure and I I don't want to kind of just be copying over everything I put on Twitter on firecaster but I've been on fire for a while in the closed beta kind of um an enclosed beta period and it's been really fun to kind of interact with it and and use it and it's really smooth I use the warpcast client because you can use different clients on it uh but yeah I do think that this model has the potential to to scale definitely uh but at the end of the day also people need to understand that if you're not paying for the thing that you're using then there are going to be ads because that's the only way that you can actually Finance it yeah your other product oh well here's another question unrelated to forecaster but one I've wanted to ask you all week so Lido is almost at 33 percent as one-third of all eth staked uh they are at uh 32.17 the time of recording and of course having one third of all eth in your protocol uh is is certainly a milestone when it comes to kind of uh consensus how worried should we actually be about this what's your take so there is a lot to unpack yes I'll try to keep it concise so I so I don't kind of like uh ramble on for people I think when people see numbers like this they automatically go towards oh my God you know ladder 33 that's a huge as you said like that's one third of the of the staked teeth that's a huge um part of the network you know uh what if they kind of turned bad and wanted to do something bad on the network right so that's that's the kind of thing that people automatically go to but what I want to unpack here and I don't want to pick on kind of Lido because this could could have been anyone it could have been coinbase it could have been binance you know could have been cracking and maybe it will be in the future you know who knows but with Lido people need to understand that it's not like when you stake with Lido all of that e-stick is going to one node operator as we call them one uh kind of entity that's operating all of the validated infrastructure there are currently 30 I believe nerd operators under the Lido umbrella so there are 30 different entities that are operating underneath the Lido umbrella of course but they're operating their own infrastructure and most of these entities as far as I know are outside of the us as well whatever that kind of like counts for here so so that that fact I think should be talked about more even though some people will argue that well yes they're separate entities but they still exist under the lighter umbrella and lighter governance can still affect what you know what they do and yes that's true lateral governance I don't know about right now but they may they might be able to do this right now but in the future they could vote to remove a note operator uh or remove a bunch of node operators uh for for no other reason than the the Lido token holders wanted it to be the case right um or they could vote to remove an operator because they were doing something like allowing uh transactions through that the rest of the lighter neural operators didn't want to happen or something like that so they're obviously centralization concerns here because lato has that governance token the ldo token which governs the the kind of whole later ecosystem so I totally understand that but the entities themselves are are definitely kind of like separate and it's not like if one of these entities was to go offline or get slashed it wouldn't affect the other ones because they are they are distinctly separate but and then the question Falls to okay yeah okay they're distinctly separate but let's let's assume that they're all going to work together and they're all going to include together as part of the Lido kind of entity what's the the worst they can do here well really at 33 you you can't necessarily do anything like catastrophically bad and I don't really see any incentive for them to do this to begin with but what what I think and and this is why I want to be concise here I'm going to miss a bunch of context here but what I want people to understand is that the ethereum blockchain is not defined by one entity it's not defined by Lido it's not defined by Kraken or binance or coinbase it's not defined by you or me the ethereum blockchain what ethereum actually is as a network is defined by its users by its Community by its stakeholders and these uh range from core developers to people that run validators to uh people building apps on top of the network we all have a say in what the ethereum network is and we have lots of precedent over this Bitcoin in 2017 had a hash wall with Bitcoin cash where Bitcoin cash forked off and said where the real Bitcoin and they had like a minor hash war going on but the thing is that the majority didn't believe that Bitcoin cash was the real Bitcoin so the real Bitcoin remained the big the Bitcoin that we we know today right and the same was true for ethereum during the Dow hack back in 2016 where people saying well no ethereum classic is the real ethereum but no one the majority didn't believe that the majority believed that ethereum was the real ethereum so if we're talking about attack vectors here if Lido was to become malicious in any such way right um what ends up happening is that the rest of the community and ecosystem would say well lydo is acting maliciously then elido is is trying to basically make the network something that it isn't so we're going to decide that Lido is is basically a bad actor and we're going to essentially socially Fork them out now that's a messy proposition of course and that's not something that we necessarily want a point that we want to get to but I just want to illustrate the point that a blockchain ecosystem is not defined by by these sorts of things um and and while Lido or any entity having a big percent of the market share is definitely a risk yelling about it and and kind of like uh being kind of I guess like um and fighting it and kind of being maybe Doomer about it is not going to move the needle and this is an unpopular opinion amongst a lot of my ethereum friends and they don't like it when I say this but there was a proposal to to uh to different staging providers I think it was last year it's been going on for a while to for them to self-limit the amount of stake that they would take into their their kind of like protocol and the limit I think was 22 or something like that Lido's already over that limit so what you're basically asking later to do is to reduce its market share a for-profit business mind you with a token to reduce its market share to 22 percent uh just to satisfy what you know whatever you your the criteria you've come up with here and and look I understand why people wanted to do that but that's not how you compete with these big ecosystems that's not how you reduce their market share how you reduce Lido's market share is by building a better product right and that's exactly what others taking providers have have tried to do like rocketpool for example and other ones out there um they have tried to build better products to compete with light and compete in the free market because Lido doesn't have any special privileges over the ethereum network they it's not like the ethereum network says to lighter hey you know you're going to get more yield because you're Lido no the ethereum network does not favor anyone what happens is that the Ethereal Network says anyone can build an LST on top of me that's fine and then you go compete in the free market so when you look at it from from that perspective at least from the perspective I look at it you reduce dominance of any one player by by increasing competition in the market and also the dominance of any one player needs to be looked at under a microscope under a lens of you know later is different to coinbase coinbase is different to Rocket pool uh you know coinbase is different to finance you can't look at them as if they're the same thing so as much as I understand the risks and understand the concerns around Lido specifically I also am a realist and I also believe that the we can keep talking about it as much as you want to keep talking about it but what's really going to move the needle is competition yeah I I think I I find myself largely agreeing with uh all of all of those points even though this is a very contentious issue and we did an entire episode this on hasu who we we sort of put on the on the hot plate to kind of like answer answer for Lido uh but you know he takes a very pragmatic approach to all of this and I think my conclusion at the end of that episode was like How concerned should we be about Lido having 33 it's not ideal let me be first to say it's like it's like not ideal to have this sort of situation but it's better than coinbase having it right one single centralized entity and coinbase uh having it would be better than like CZ and binance having it from my perspective so there's this scale of like you know not bad or good but like um good better and best right and and this is better than some other outcomes though though it's still not ideal I I think the one thing that really concerns me though about all of this Anthony is um actually more uh smart contract risk so I'm less worried about collusion of those you know 29 to 30 entities inside of Lido and governance doing something bad I think those are all concerns and by the way Lido's working in some ways to kind of mitigate some of those and decentralized elements of it like giving uh sdeath holders the ability to vote that kind of thing right um but I'm less concerned about that I'm more concerned what if there was like a bug in like uh the underlying Lido smart contracts right that caused like a Dao style of like event let's say what happens then but that also comes into play if we have a lot of ether crude and sort of like maker or in in sort of any def or eigenlayer or any kind of um large smart contract set of code that that manages uh you know a lot of Youth and then yeah that's table Stakes right yeah it's table stakes and they're back to your point we have to revert back to the social layer anyway so I'm not really sure what we do there but let me ask you this because so here's a little bit of pushback some people say in the community that no actually Anthony Ryan you guys are wrong uh people like you call them kind of ethereum community uh members and leaders you have the responsibility to actually stop talking about Lido like put Lido down in your education episodes right um tell people to go stake elsewhere and by the way you know we do tell people to go stake on Rocket pool around your own node those sorts of things if it's with it within your but like they think that uh the social leadership around ethereum should be doing more what's your take on that I'm not sure how much more I could personally be doing I mean uh and also also also um with bankless I mean we're both rocket pool Odell members right we're both part of the Odell we're both really big bulls on on rocker pool um I'm the same as you I don't I honestly don't tell people to stake with Lido but not because it's Lido I'll I tell them don't stake with the top provider right don't don't stick with the biggest entity stake with a with a small entity help the decentralization of of the network um because it's good for the overall health of the network but as I was kind of alluding to before I don't think it it actually helps us to to put down Lido because they've gotten to the market share that they have it's obviously the market basically saying that Lido is a good product and people want to use it and um as I said before the ethereum network does not favor Lido it does not favor any staking entity so if Lido is winning it's winning based on Merit in my mind and people may agree with that people may say oh well you know Lido does underhanded tactics or whatever but at the end of the day like any protocol can do do that it's not like as I said ethereum is favoring Lido specifically so I just revert back to my look you know you and I are doing a lot to try and kind of push the needle forward here I'm as I said I'm always trying to push people to others taking protocols and that goes back to my point about just increased competition in the market and that is a huge market share that um you know the LST market share I think is like what 80 plus percent for Lido that's a huge market share that can that competitors can come in and get for themselves and they will naturally do that and we've seen a lot of these competitors come online recently and even like rockapool is is continuing to grow they have a lot of really awesome plans coming along and I've been a big proponent of them so I think that rather than shooting people and putting and and kind of like going after the people and saying you know you should be doing more you should be doing I just kind of need to understand and maybe acknowledge that people are doing what they can at the end of the day um shouting can only get us so much talking about it can only get us so far there needs to be decisive action to match that as well all right there you go like yeah I think that's a good message moralizing can only get us so far at some point in time we have to like just build a better solution speaking of building great Solutions and this goes back to one of your your bullish points about fintech getting involved in crypto apparently American Express has partnered with poapp to give poapps for attending certain Amex events this is super cool uh this is a tweet from mambosian.eth and they say super cool I I hope this is just the beginning of Amex getting into blockchain Tech so not only Visa but looks like a Amex with an integration here I've not tested this out myself but um yeah look at all the AmEx terms and conditions here uh it's kind of cool to see that that level of attraction um this was also interesting Anthony from on on the Bitcoin side of things this is a tweet from Bitcoin magazine which doesn't often make it inside of a roll-up but here it is Elon musk's ex that is AKA Twitter obtains license to store transfer and trade Bitcoin and crypto I'm glad they said in crypto by the way I think you know thanks for that you know X obtained a currency transmitter license in the state of Rhode Island this license required if x were to provide virtual asset related Services there's absolutely no mention of Bitcoin in the licensing file oh no um and uh not necessarily I think that uh it you know when it comes to payments I don't know why so so okay maybe step back a little bit here and give some context Elon did payments in Bitcoin for Tesla right uh quite a while ago that went nowhere no one wants to use their Bitcoin as money okay and this was to be clear you could buy a Tesla with some Bitcoin if you wanted to yeah and also yeah yeah yeah yeah so so okay well then what that has either has Elon learned from that I maybe he he has and what what are they going to integrate into this payments kind of platform when it comes to crypto exactly stable coins stable coins that's where it's at and PayPal just announced their own stable coin you know you gotta you gotta think there's some movement going on there so I I definitely think that stable coins are the more likely candidate yeah maybe you will be able to do Bitcoin as well but I highly doubt people are going to be using their Bitcoin uh for payments your Bitcoin Community is so funny like simultaneously they've told us how valuable Bitcoin is never sell your Bitcoin and then they also want like Bitcoin to be used to buy a Tesla I was like I don't encourage anybody to spend their eth on anything it is it is a store of value Asset all right we'll create a unit of exchange through some other mechanism but but don't sell your Bitcoin don't sell your eth um I you know I don't know that's uh it's funny to me when that sort of stuff comes up um this is interesting though Anthony dcg digital currency group man they've been at the center point of a lot of things most notably I think in retail investors mind there is an 800 million dollar loan from Gemini the Gemini earned program that that um digital currency group and Genesis basically owns Gemini earned customers they have not paid back and here is a statement this week I've not gotten in depth on this from digital currency group they're pleased to reach an agreement in principle with Genesis and the unsecured creditors committee which provides a framework for comprehensive resolution man I'm not going to read all of this Anthony it's kind of legal speak I think that tldr is um dcg has agreed with Genesis creditors to deliver recoveries of up to 90 percent maybe that's the key word up to 90 so there's a lot of gray area uh from the numbers of zero to to ninety percent but um some details are dcg plans to take up new debt facilities and a repayment agreement this will include 300 28 0.8 million loan facility two-year maturity 830 million dollar loan facility with a seven year maturity there's a lot of details here and 70 to 90 percent uh recoveries for unsecured creditors and US Dollars equivalent 65 to 90 recovery of in-kind basis depending on the denomination of the digital assets I haven't heard from the Gemini side um whether they feel like this meets their needs or not so the story is kind of not a full yet but I'm wondering from your perspective if you think this is kind of the last cleanup that we have to make from all of our our sins in in 2022 and you know maybe the sins of Barry silbert and uh you know suzu and some of the the centralized lending borrowing providers mm-hmm yeah I think this is is one of the last ones to be honest I mean there's still obviously the FTX bankruptcy process which is just going to take forever and and seems to be just draining money out of um FTX creditors unfortunately the lawyers seem to be cleaning up there um and there's a three AC case as well which I believe the Gemini oh sorry Genesis was involved with and that's why they kind of got kind of stung with with some bad debt here uh but yeah hopefully this this ends in a positive outcome for for um a Gemini uh creditors there and Gemini earned customers but you are reading all the legal speak and all the up twos and everything it doesn't Inspire that much confidence right um it really seems like this is going to take a lot longer than people would hope to to kind of like get repaid here um what is going on here bit boy crypto is no longer employed uh employing bitboy I don't even know how that works um yeah I didn't know that big boy crypto was more than bitboy but apparently there are other people that like were on some videos and stuff I mean obviously I don't watch the the big boy show but I saw this and I'm just like uh that's really ridiculous he's been fired right that's what happens yeah yeah like company like yeah yeah and I feel like the company's gonna die because I mean the only reason anyone followed it was because of big boy like why did they even can you explain this to me why did they even follow it even even like while what is the appeal of bit boy I I've never I don't I don't I don't know personally um I think really the the appeal is is that it appeals to the Degen gambling side of crypto the people who want to kind of like buy into these low caps and be told that it's gonna go like 100x and they're gonna make life-changing money um but yeah I I've never these kind of people have never appealed to me because that's not something that I'm about but yeah it's got a lot he's got a lot of subscribers right 1.5 million or something like that it's just crazy it's absolutely insane even when you compare that to like bankless or daily Quay viewership it's just like he dwarfs us uh like in a massive way and it's a part of this uh do you remember this clip this is from October of last year I'm just gonna play this so for people who have no idea who we're talking about this is this is a flavor of uh how Bitcoin uh talks and how he speaks this was him from October 2022 of last year but this guy right here Ryan Sean Adams I don't know who the f you are because you're not important but here he says please dear Lord and any lawmakers or adults reading this tweet just know bitboy doesn't represent this either talk to Jay Stravinsky talk to Miller cwl talk to coin Center you know what we are tired of people that look like this guy trying to run stuff I don't represent the people the I don't oh my God it goes on but it's it's just an unhinged rant and I think he actually got fired at least they'd said that he got fired because of substance abuse and maybe you can see that in this video but I don't know how true how true that is but um yeah it certainly seems like he's he's unhinged yeah and there's this weird populist uh rhetoric that I've never kind of identity identified with and just you know sends Tinkles up my spine uh anyway um Good Luck Bitcoin bit boy in the future um did you see this Anthony so instadapt is rolling out a multi-sig and I'm wondering if if this is going to be a safe competitor uh yeah definitely a safe competitor yeah yeah um it's got like very similar features to safe you know the the apps the the bridging the stuff like obviously the multi-sig thing um and I think we need competitors in the multi-six space I know it's a kind of scary thing I think for people to build because obviously multi-seeds can be like huge pots for assets and stuff like that but we can't just rely on one I don't want safe having a monopoly over over multi-cigs I agree are you at the point where you like trust safe like you trust uh definitely or an eoa yeah I mean I'm I'm definitely at a point where I I kind of like trust safe I mean it's been around for a very long time now and I think that I mean I I don't want to say anything definitive but you know it's got such a large honey pot there that I feel like if there was a bug probably would have been found by now but there's always there's and I know I don't want to jinx it there's there's always the kind of there's always the kind of risk with these things but the multi-stick stuff is actually more secure than a vanilla Hardware wallet because you can have Hardware wallets as your multi-seek signers right so you can do like a three or five and then just have you have one of the wallets you know two other trusted people have them and then it needs all three signatures in order to do any transactions rather than they're just being one um but yeah it does come with the trade-off as we were talking before about smart contract risks generally um being prevalent um in these things or being kind of existing in these things yeah uh 100 though and by the way the ux of these multi-6 like safe has gotten so good uh these days it's just uh it's really a pleasure to use guys we got more coming up some questions from the nation a question to Anthony myself why on Earth would there be thousands of chains instead of a winner take most type of Market we'll talk about that idea and also is staking eth really risk-free we call it the risk-free rate can we justify that uh stay tuned we'll be right back talk to you soon arbitrum is accelerating the web 3 landscape with a suite of secure ethereum scaling Solutions hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one with flourishing defy and nft ecosystems arborstone Nova is quickly becoming a web 3 gaming Hub and social adapts like Reddit are also calling arbitrim home and now Arboretum

first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web free space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramps so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle question this week from the bank list Nation this is uh lime as what's the counter argument to l2s being a winner take most what actually meaningfully differentiates individual chains in the op super chain Vision why would users and developers not flock to the market leader I think the question here is like there's this idea that we might have hundreds or thousands of chains like why why is that even an attractive notion why doesn't everyone just flock to like their favorite optimism or arbitrum evm chain and it becomes kind of a winner take most or winner take all all kind of network effect do you have a take on this yeah I mean I think the obvious take is probably that um we get more scalability by modularizing everything even though they may connect to something like a super chain where they share liquidity and and stuff like that um still by modularizing it we get just like more scalability than we otherwise would have but I think generally this is actually an open question and I actually don't think anyone has a definitive answer to this if you want to take the kind of uh history here we only have history when it comes to l1s and really l1s have been a winner take most Market where ethereum has taken the Lion's Share of of L1 activity um and that has been true for for quite a while now but we don't know what how it's going to play out in the L2 world you could make the argument that's going to play out the same way but the L2 world is a bit different in that we're going to have like you know the op super trample we're also going to have uh polygons version of the super chain and potentially zk6 version of it and then those things may just connect together and share liquidity and interoperate so the way I maybe like to think about it if you want to use real world analogies is that blockchains and l2s they're just like Nations right they're just like countries where you have big Nations like the US and you have small Nations uh like Australia I mean economically we're pretty big but population wise we're small um but what they all trade with each other right they all interoperate with each other we have Global Supply chains all those sorts of things and that way we have more scalable things like culture which I think is very important and often overlooked but more scalable kind of manufacturing more scalable economies generally so that's how I like like to view it and in terms of flocking to the kind of like uh in terms of being a winner take most I think the long term it probably won't be because there's just so much opportunity out there and there's so much kind of money and activity to be had that the competition is going to be very Fierce and I know that liquidity begets liquidity but the same could be said for really anything and I don't think we see the real world play out as a winner take most kind of thing we do have dominant players but there are also smaller plays that can bat above their average as I said Australia has a relatively small population we have a rather large economy because we have a lot of minerals that we dig out of the ground and sell to other countries same is true for l2s maybe they have something that they sell to people not just block space maybe they have unique block space where they you they let you program your smart contract in a language that isn't solidity or something like that right so there are these differentiations that can happen and that's how I generally think about these kind of like l2s yeah I think that's a pretty good analogy and and by the way it kind of fits because all of these these genes and networks are kind of they're almost like a emerging economies so you can think of kind of emerging Nations and yes we do have hundreds of of countries uh across the world but there is a G7 and then there's also a G20 and that is kind of disproportionately weighted towards the larger companies with with um you know larger economies as well and so I think we'll start to see that one interesting question though is whether that kind of breaks on the um you know kind of the super chain level or the individual chain level or kind of like the the main chain level what I mean is um you know will it be winner take most or winners take most on at the super chain level or uh like you know optimism and maybe a couple of other chains like they start to accrue all of their value optimism polygon arbitrum or will it be at the chain level and that's something I I uh I also don't know I don't know if you have a take on that I mean there's an argument that if everything becomes interoperable it's actually the bridges that occur a lot of the valley right right you know what I mean so there's that argument as well and I as I said I don't think we actually have a definitive answer that could be given at this point in time it's still too early um I I just gave given a slice of my kind of uh views on these sorts of things but this is exactly why I am personally investing in as many of the L2 kind of things as I can because I don't know which one's going to win I don't know who's going to be the market leader um you know and to use an analogy up until recently people thought that arbitrum and uh was the was the the market leader right of the l2s they thought the uh the arbitrim had just had just squashed optimism had crushed it but then optimism came back with this op stack thing they landed base and they're getting all these people building op stack change now and now suddenly everyone's changed their narrative and changed their tune and they're like you know optimism's the market leader so this is what I mean by it's very hard to kind of pick a winner because the winners can look look like they're winning at one point but then be like a loser another Point not to say that arbitrim is a loser or anything like that but I'm saying that the rankings can change uh pretty pretty quickly in this ecosystem except ethereum right Anthony can we pick ethereum as a winner I mean yeah I I think at this point we definitely can for for I mean too many reasons uh that I don't have time for on the show obviously but um but still there's always that kind of like you know less than one percent in my mind risk that ethereum loses its its kind of like Market leadership totally well here's a question about eth in particular to this idea of the risk-free rate so here's the question from merkelroot.eth I love the notion of staking as the risk-free rate internet Bond but when I seriously consider staking a meaningful amount of eth I get stuck is it truly risk-free and does the 4.2 percent justify the risk the poster goes on talking about how they tried Geth and prism it was kind of challenging took 32 eth lsds there's cot smart contract risk uh worried about staking with Lido all of these things so the the over arcing question this idea of risk-free rate is it truly risk-free and uh 4.2 percent does that justify the risk what's what would be your answer to this question I mean I I probably wouldn't consider it risk-free under any kind of capacity here I would say if you want to get as close to risk-free as possible you would be a solo Staker running it all on your own running all your own infrastructure uh running your validator keys yourself and and and the validators yourself and everything like that that's as close as you're going to get but even with that comes the risk but the risk-free the term risk-free is is probably being used in a different context here because what it means when it comes to kind of like treasuries for example is that it's as close as you're going to get to to a security guarantee because the US government is guaranteeing that kind of like uh that Bond or that kind of like uh treasury note right um whereas with ethereum if you're solo staking the ethereum network is going to guarantee that as long as you follow the rules it's going to pay out the yield that um it's supposed to pay out to you based on on the network uh rules and based on obviously other things like fear revenue and things like that but it's not going to guarantee to you that you're not going to get slashed or that you're not going to go offline right um and it's obviously not going to guarantee teach you there's not going to be smart contract bugs if you're staking with lighter or rocker pool whatever so I think that the term itself probably doesn't map one to one um but if if you wanted to try and map it one to one I would say that solo staking on your own completely on your own is the closest you're going to get otherwise yeah there's risks with every kind of staking setup do you think it justifies it right running a solo sticking to get 4.2 percent eighth if you if you feel comfortable doing it sure I know that people don't feel comfortable doing it for a variety of different reasons I would say that the risks of slashing are vastly overstated you're you're most likely not going to get slashed unless you're trying to actually do something malicious on the network and going offline is not very punishing it at all it actually is very forgiving if you go offline um so yeah I would say that generally it's it's definitely worth it in my mind and I have most of my eats staked um and the reason why it's not all staked is because um I don't have enough um at times to spin up on the solo validator obviously you have to hit the 32 8th and also I want to have ether gas fees obviously as well also keep some ether guest fees right yeah you know what for for me too and by the way this is um every investor every you know each Holder will have to make their own decision and what the your risk profile kind of looks like um for me it also recently crossed that threshold where I you know I was not staking very much of my eth and now I'm mistaking the majority of my eth and it recently kind of crossed that threshold to me because we're like a you know a year plus into um kind of the merge and all of these things and so I'm feeling a little bit better about it but yeah I I will plus one um what you just said Anthony and This this term risk-free rate is actually like a Trad five term okay so in the context of eth it doesn't mean that there's no risk to staking there is a slashing risk there are other risks you have to consider what it means in tradify is it's generally applied to like t-bills or you know treasuries the U.S treasuries and so like if treasuries are yielding a five percent interest rate that's like considered in in Trad Phi the risk-free rate the reason it's the risk-free rate is because if you're going to invest in anything else if you're going to buy a property if you're going to invest in a stock if you're going to buy any kind of asset deal to return it better damn well be a above five percent or else or else what or else you should just park your money inside of a t-bill and get that five percent yield so that represents the risk-free rate and then you evaluate all of your other Investments and the other ways you'd spend your your Capital um and they would have to exceed the the risk-free rate right and that's I think that is actually a helpful framing of how you should think about um you know crypto and eth so if you're gonna take your precious Heath right and you're considering um diversifying investing in anything else well that investment better exceed uh 4.2 percent the risk-free rate of of ether if you're gonna make that investment as denominated in ether or else what or else you're better off staking and so I do think it's actually a useful Paradigm but um not kind of apples to apples you really have to understand it's a it's a trad-fy term all right takes of the week uh Niraj here from coinsetter this is an old tweet but I feel like it was pretty applicable on the back of the tornado Cash He says this I'm sorry that your warrantless surveillance regime was built on the assumption that people would always need intermediary is to transact uh well said I think our entire uh regime AML kyc fincen is all built on this stupid assumption that really falls apart and this is why and this is why they're fighting it so hard as well and pretty much like all the regulations are built on the assumption that these intermediaries would be custodians of the assets right in one way or another and that doesn't apply to D5 obviously because the the there are custodians that can interact with defy but if you're a user and you're just cursing your own assets and playing around with these things then every regulation or almost all of them doesn't apply to you and I don't think that they like yeah exactly okay so do you think let me ask you that because this goes back to something we're seeing earlier do you think it's uh malevolence or do you think it's ignorance I think it's a bit of both I think I think so malevolence is is a lot harder to kind of see because obviously all this stuff is done like not behind closed doors but it's not like they're on live streams talking about this and and you know telling us what they're thinking but I also think that there's a there's a huge chunk of ignorance as well because I mean in the US if you look at the average age of of a politician right in Congress it's it's not great right these people didn't grow up with yeah yeah these people didn't go up with technology and they certainly do not understand how crypto works so I think that plays a big part in it as well take from Chris berninski often newcomers to crypto investing want to put 1K to work hoping to find the next Bitcoin and turn that 1K into 1 million dollars in search of the quick 1000x they don't realize they're wanting to gamble not invest and learning to invest through cycles makes all the difference keep it simple many quality obvious names still have 10x upside tranchin tranche out fix a on Perfection and you'll miss don't just don't don't get discouraged if you're down dig deeper find joy in what's being built and how attractively it's priced don't get drunk at the highs some Timeless advice I think there from from Chris what are your takeaways from that is this how you've approached investing yeah I mean it definitely is timeless advice I think that's the perfect way to put it because it applies to not only crypto investing but just investing generally and it will probably always apply to all types of investing for as long as we have financial markets right and and I understand the people who want to find the next Bitcoin who want to or who want to turn a little bit of money into a lot of money because that's what the media reports on when it comes to crypto they say oh this guy put in like 1K and he became a millionaire or this guy putting this and that and that's what the people think that they can do but the thing is is that one guy does it and then a million people don't do it and that people focus on the one guy who did do it and and one and the million people who didn't win and lost and you're you know almost certainly going to be part of those million people who lost so my I mean my investing strategy for for a long time now not always because I was definitely one of these people in 2013 um but for a long time now probably since 2017 was to just invest for the long term and and basically keep it simple uh but also do a little bit DJing on the side not with my whole portfolio obviously but with a with a decent chunk of it and then slowly kind of I guess like reduce that chunk over time as I accumulated more wealth you know go from wealth generation to wealth preservation mode get rich uh slowly I think is is the key for crypto let me ask you though do you think there's another 10x left in ether the price of eth oh definitely definitely yeah I mean but the thing is is that like it's not going to happen for a while right and these people they don't want to wait years for it for a 10x they want a 10x in like a week which you can still get mind you but that's gambling as Chris said here that's not investing you're throwing money at a meme coin hoping for a 10x that's like throwing money uh on you know on at the casino hoping for for kind of like black or something right it's it's the same thing yeah I know it I I think people don't realize how much risk has actually been boiled out of assets like uh ether at this point in time right where it's like 10x is great who cares if that takes like three to five to ten years right I mean it's 10x in your money where else can you get that at this kind of um you know risk risk minimized uh the sort of state that we're in Anthony gotta ask you near the end so what do you bullish on uh these days my friend well I mean always eighth of course I think that's just like the table Stakes answer to give um but generally I'm bullish on watching the cycle play out the same way it's played out every cycle in crypto and I know we talked about this earlier but the reason I'm bullish on that is because I think that there's always going to need to be a shelling point for the market to kind of rally around or any Market to kind of rally around and I think in crypto for the foreseeable future while we're still not very deeply integrated with tradfi our shelling Point has always been that four year cycle right and that that hardening narrative that that applies to all of crypto and I'm excited to to see maybe it it had one last hurray maybe by the time the next cycle rolls around we're too deeply ingrained with Trad fire and it no longer becomes a a four year cycle but um that generally is something that I I'm just pretty excited about because I'm basing obviously a lot of my investing assumptions on this four-year cycle uh playing out but I also think that it'll be good for the ecosystem for next year to be a good year so that we can actually get some fresh capital in and use only these new pretty toys that we've created over the last couple of years yeah you know I'm I'm bullish on something we were talking about earlier in this episode I want to make maybe a link near the end so um I think the Bitcoin ETF would be a big win and we've talked about all of the reasons why but I think one may be underrated reason which some Bank list listeners might be uncomfortable with and uh I'm somewhat uncomfortable with as well but let me kind of run through the calculus here this gets Wall Street on a crypto side in a big way um if you are a cynic about the US political system you might say something like yeah the banks run politics right and like I mean maybe there's some elements of Truth in that maybe there's a hundred percent truth in that um to date Wall Street like the big asset managers of the world like the black rocks of the world they haven't seen any big wins from crypto well that changes when they get an ETF okay then they have an actual product to sell and when they have a product to sell they'll sell that product into our legislators into Congress and all the law being required to get it pushed through I somewhat see this as an Unholy Alliance by the way because uh let me be first to say I do not trust the banks will you protect our peer-to-peer defy you know privacy um like all of the decentralization kind of the reason we're here but they are a useful adversary at this stage in the game because one of our main opponents so far have been Rogue Regulators that don't want retail to buy crypto at all and so this is like Checkmate to Gary Gensler and I think once you get kind of Wall Street in some of the banks on crypto side then you you get some wins so the ETFs will fall next is stable coins they will get on board with stable coins that's another product that they can sell they'll be very excited about that we'll we'll have to fight them later I think for some of our our defy uh rights but by that time again the market cap of crypto will be much larger and I think we'll be in a better negotia dating and bargaining positions so that's sort of a hidden benefit of this whole Bitcoin ETF thing that I think people fail to appreciate once we get the Bitcoin ETF I think the politicians will start singing a different tune because of this effect definitely yeah yeah I agree with all of that and I think you you hit nail on the head by calling it an Unholy Alliance because yeah I mean I feel the same way it's definitely not something that we ideally would want but it is necessary I think at this point in time we are playing the game The Game of Thrones here uh let's end with the meme of the week Anthony this is something I picked up from uh one of our chat rooms I think GM fellow multicycle digital currency enthusiasts we are looking at a sad wojack in the center of a circle here uh what are we looking at can you describe this meme for us Anthony yeah I mean this is basically the meme of uh investors always kind of missing the bottom to buy and then always uh missing missing the the kind of like uh uh top as well uh so this happens a lot I think to especially for cyclists and any maybe even second cyclists where essentially they're like oh I'm not gonna buy yet because the bottom is not in and then the bottom actually is in and then they wait for the bottom to be kind of like retested it never comes right and then they're like okay well we're going up but I'll just wait for the market to pull back uh in order for me to buy now but then the market tops out and you end up buying on the downtrend in the bear market so this is a harsh lesson for people to to learn but I think people need to learn it yeah totally and I can identify with this too even I get sucked up into this uh sad wojack chap here uh guys we've got a Moment of Zen for you coming up it's a song in Dayman talking about the Gary gansler court case I think you'll enjoy that also want to give another shout out to Anthony sassano for coming on the show today um he just uploaded mid episode so the refuel which is absolutely like on the daily must listen to uh content for ethereum and and crypto Anthony what have you been talking about recently on the refuel I mean a lot of the same stuff I guess we've talked about on the on on the roll up today of course um I think that I've been trying to follow more closely along with the individual l2s themselves and seeing what they're doing because I feel like a lot of them are coming into their own right now where they're actually defining their vision and what they actually want to build out for their own kind of platforms and ecosystems so I've been trying to kind of relay that to my community there uh but yeah I mean and core development too I mean eip484 is around the corner I think it's going to go live in November of this year that's kind of my estimate that I've been talking about for quite a while now and it seems to be on track so that's those are the kind of main things I've been trying to focus on mostly for the for the show but of course covering the day-to-day news as well guys there's a link to that in the show notes and I recently saw that the refuel is now on Apple podcast so you can go catch that there in your podcast player I'm going to end with rest in a minute but first we disclose I think the only thing to disclose today is I'm an angel investor in insta dap uh we talked about an application for institute app today of course you got to know both Anthony and I we are long-term bullish holders of ether but of course you already know that we are long-term investors here at bank list we're not journalists we don't do paid content there's always a link to all Bank list disclosures in the show notes you
