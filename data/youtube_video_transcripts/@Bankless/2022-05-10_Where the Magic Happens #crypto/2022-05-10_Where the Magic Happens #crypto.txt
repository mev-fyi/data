does the counterculture of crypto always move towards the periphery if bitcoin's at the center of this whole industry because it started this whole thing but now bitcoin is becoming institutionalized and it's no longer the frontier and so like you know the frontier is always going on and that's where the meta is changing are all of these things tracking in your brain yeah it's something i strongly believe in i always feel like frontier and encounter cultures are much more interesting and provide much more opportunities especially for smaller players or users good example is unislap version 2 versus unison version 3. despite the fact that uniform version 3 is like much more efficient clearly unislab version 2 was by far one of the biggest innovation within d5 or maybe crypto in general frontier is always where the magic happens i always rather be on the frontier and make a bit less money just having more fun discovering new ways how to do things then compete with bigger players in some already established meta and trying to figure out how to make trading for big institutions 20 more efficient
