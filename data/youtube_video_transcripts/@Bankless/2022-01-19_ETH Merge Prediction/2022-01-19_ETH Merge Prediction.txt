one of my predictions to me this is kind of a hot take for 2022. the ethereum merge will happen this year it'll be a historic milestone in the whole you know history of crypto that's how it'll be viewed in the decades to come but when it does happen people will still be disappointed because there's this idea david that eth2 and the merge will actually reduce gas fees and that's not what's going to happen it's it's almost like a efficiency improvement right you're ripping out the old proof of work engine and you're installing this this hyper efficient electric engine so we've gone from a combustion engine to an electric engine but it is not going to alleviate gas fees and i'm worried there's this sentiment that people think oh when the merge happens suddenly gas fees on ethereum will go away that's not what's going to happen that is not ethereum's scalability strategy so i guess a quick psa for people who didn't realize that and also the take there is um i think some people will be disappointed because there's a lot of bad information about what's going to happen in the future with ethereum's roadmap
