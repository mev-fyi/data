and the other thing that I don't think Washington is very good at is sort of thinking about okay no one cares whether the Securities laws apply or no one outside of Washington cares what they care about is are we making the world a better place by applying regulation or are we just making things complicated and not serving anyone's interests welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless today we have Hester purse SEC commissioner on the episode as we're three months into 2023 which seems to be the worst regulatory environment we've ever seen in the United States and she comes on to drop some insight Hester of course is often known to dissent from her colleagues other SEC Commissioners on crypto related actions and we talk about that today a few things to look out for number one we talk about what crypto could be if we had a first principles SEC number two we talk about the definition of a security what is a security can we Define it yet number three we hear Hester flat out say that the SEC is trying to increase its jurisdictional reach surprising number four how do we move forward with the SEC that that is a question on all of our minds and number five how can crypto take its share of the responsibility to move things forward with our Regulators David so much covered in this episode what should folks pay attention to I think Hester really offers us an archetype of a good regulator to actually latch onto uh and so the the SEC is on a monolith there's five different Commissioners there and so while everyone kind of considers the SEC to be Gary Gensler there are other Commissioners in there who disagree with the overall direction of the SEC and Hester purse is one of them and so Hester purse offers us a perspective of what the SEC could be if it had aligned in first principles regulators and so that's one of the first perspectives that I think uh bankless listeners will be able to walk away with I think the other big one is is that gone are the days of us being able to just like oh is the SEC really just trying to increase its scope and increase its power and authority it's like yes is like the it's not a conspiracy anymore like this is just now flat outstated and so now that that is what is just known now we have to account for that and how do we move forward when the the you know the mask has been ripped off uh so these are I think the two big things that people can walk away with uh from this episode and just like now that they they the game is a little bit up how do we proceed how do we keep on moving yeah uh The Masks are off certainly as we get into this episode we know where people stand uh David there's so much more I want to talk to you about in the debrief uh this is just a fantastic conversation and I I want to discuss what this means of course bankless Nation the debrief is our episode that we record right after the episode that has our thoughts on this episode with the Hester purse and you can upgrade your membership to bankless citizenship and access the debrief episode now at a brand new website bankless.com yep we got the.com go ahead and do that there is a link in the show notes where you you can get that done and access the debrief guys we're going to get right to our episode with commissioner purse but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible including Kraken our number one recommended crypto exchange for 2023.

commissioner ever since 2018 her term is ending in 2025. i definitely wish it was longer here David uh Hester is also a previous podcast guest on Bank list she consistently makes statements about the SEC how it should regulate Capital markets from a first principal's perspective which we think is definitely the way to approach this and why we've enjoyed her guidance so much Hester the last time you were on Bank list was two years ago so it was April 12 2021 my how time flies how are you doing and welcome back well thank you Ryan and thanks David um for having me I'm going to start with my little disclaimer which you all know which is that my views are my own views not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners it's hard to believe that it's been two years I feel like nothing has been accomplished in that time um so yes I'm a little discouraged but um we we have to continue on and try to get some things done so um you know obviously we've had some bad bad events happen since in those two years also some very bad events I think they've been learning experiences for everyone involved for Regulators as well as for people in the industry um but we also I think have had some bad events on the part of regulators and I'm hoping that that's what we can work on changing absolutely so are we we're actually optimistic about the future they say that the best way out is through and we're certainly going through it now um Hester we want to cover a number of things today including kind of first principles of the SEC just refresh folks on that what's going well what could be improved making the case to crypto natives of what's good about the SEC what should we appreciate from this regulatory body and also we'd love some of your feedback on how we in crypto can engage better how our industry can improve as well you ready for all that I am before we get in just a quick touch base uh the U.S banking system has had some events here recently uh just curious because it's top of Mind current event of course does any of that touch the SEC or how how is kind of the um what you Shepherd and have oversight over affected by some of this I mean certainly the financial system in the United States is is very connected and so what happens in the banking system can have ramifications for the markets that we regulate um and and sometimes the entities that our banking entities have have Affiliated entities that we regulate so there there certainly can be connections and and sometimes banks are public companies and we regulate disclosures of public companies so again there's another potential touch point but I mean certainly we're watching closely what's going on and um it's you know it's it's never it's never good to see those kinds of things happening um and and so we watch to make sure that it doesn't have re reverberations on the on the entities that we're regulating directly so Hester for people that have not watched our first episode uh with you which was a great Learning lesson for me about just like the first principles reason about why we have the SEC I'm wondering if we could just return to that conversation start there because I I believe you listened to our my uh own little rabbit hole investigation of Securities why we have Securities laws in the first place uh and if from the crypto perspective it's very easy to say oh SEC bad like Regulators bad uh so I'm hoping you could pitch to The bankless Nation about like why we need an entity like the SEC what the SEC does and then after that we're going to rotate into the conversation of what the SEC can do for crypto uh in the if we can all allow this like a future world to to come about in the way that we hope it does so but we'll we'll start there like make the case for why we need Securities laws and why we need an organization like the SEC yeah so Securities laws are there to address something called information asymmetries that's that's one of the key purposes which is if you're if you're trying to raise money to build a company and you have all the information yourself right you know what you're trying to build you know you know what your background is but someone buying shares of that company doesn't necessarily know all that and so the SEC comes in and says all right we're gonna help level the playing field we're going to make sure that the person raising money is providing sufficient information to the person who is providing the money and so that can be a very important role it doesn't have to be played by government but I think that the SEC has played that role well over the years and then we regulate various entities in the markets we regulate broker dealers investment advisors stock exchanges so again those infrastructures are so important to the economy to the functioning of the economy and so having someone uh having a regulator looking at what they're doing can be very beneficial um for the smooth functioning of those entities so um Commissioner of purses is part of you can call me Hester thank you Hester is is part of the role here here to like remove information asymmetries or provide transparency to those information asymmetry so when an information asymmetry is identified where some Insider group has knowledge that the General market doesn't maybe in particular the retail Market how does the SEC work to bridge that gap or make that more transparent or what actions do you take yeah so if if it's a public company the company has to make filings that everyone can see and those filings talk about whether it's making money or losing money talk about what their their risks are the nature of their business how much their executives are getting compensated so there's all kinds of information that we require companies to produce and so that does eliminate um the the this disparity between what the Insiders have and then what investors have now that doesn't mean that we eliminate all information disparities I mean different people have different information and they make decisions about whether to buy or sell based on that information it's only when they're insiders that we want to make sure that they're they're operating on a Level Playing Field but if you sit down at night and you do a lot of research on a company and you have a lot of information and I don't have that information you're under no obligation to provide it to me if you're not if you're not somehow affiliated with the company that's that's kind of generally I mean I'm I'm I'm simplifying it a bit but that's kind of how how we think about things there was this big just aha moment big unlock moment for me when I was really approaching understanding the SEC and securities laws from the concept of centralization and decentralization um decent in a decentralized system or a decentralized asset like a commodity or assets that are commodity like there tends to not be information asymmetries because there's no centralization there so there's this innate relationship that's that the SEC has with centralization it is a check on what is the principal agent problem that naturally comes along with centralized entities and capital markets in capital formation and so understanding that like in a decentralized world the SEC doesn't really care so much about the decentralized world because there's no information asymmetry there in a centralized world when someone knows something that the public does not that's when management of this principal agent problem become becomes appropriate and so Hester I'm wondering if we can start to apply some of this under David I think you put that really eloquently I like that a lot I think that's a good a good frame to think about things in so go ahead appreciate it yeah and I'd like to start to apply some of this kind of uh perspective towards the crypto markets because I think there is a big is ought Gap in what crypto is today versus what it could be in the future uh as it relates to good Securities regulation and good SEC regulation so Esther I'm wondering if we could just Daydream for a moment about a future state of crypto that has good healthy SEC regulation and a in a fantastic relationship with the SEC what can we do in this future state of crypto that I hope eventually Rises like what could that become sounds so nice when you put it that way David we're hoping we'll get there um well I mean I think first of all centralized entities I mean you can come to different conclusions about whether you think centralized entities in crypto need to have a federal regulator a lot of people I think especially after the events of last year are very comfortable and enthusiastic about that idea and so if we're going to do that then the SEC is a potential candidate to be the the regulator of trading platforms of issuers of tokens potentially um you know I think we have to think about that but if you're if you're really talking about a state where crypto has reached its potential and there's a lot of decentralized activity I think we better be careful now to make sure that we're not just layering on the traditional regulatory system on top of decentralization because as you pointed out the the decentralized model really solves a lot of the problems that you would be trying to solve with regulation everything is open source so everyone can see what the terms are that they're engaging on no one has access to more information than anyone else and and no one is able to shut anyone else's access off right this is everything everything is accessible to everyone and so whatever we do I think we we need to carve out the decentralized aspects uh and really yeah it a different regulatory approach needs to be taken I would argue a a much different one where a lot of that doesn't need the regulator sitting on top and watching what's going on my Layman's view here Hester is that anything with this uh information asymmetry right that that it you know has this market failure uh mode where some Insider knows more than than retail and causes a market inefficiency and causes some unfairness in the market anything kind of like that or in that sphere from a first principle's perspective sort of um a security but I feel like we don't necessarily in crypto have Clarity we have a new set of assets here that are digital assets on which of these assets might be Securities and which might not be and I I do feel like this is still the case um you know two years later since we first had this conversation I don't feel like we're any closer to actually getting that clarity I mean so um nfts uh are these Collectibles or is this something that should be regulated by the security does it depend on the type of nft and and what it drives um various tokens like are these Securities are they not does it does it totally depend um are we any closer to being able to Define what a security is I know often quoted back to to crypto as well there's the Howie test which is some Court precedent we understand that but it doesn't answer all of the questions here particularly as we address this new asset class so do you feel like um you are the SEC has a good definition on what a security is that it can present to crypto or is this an area of work I mean it's certain we're certainly not any further along than we were and look the definition of security is Broad you mentioned the Howie test that ties to investment contracts which is one piece of what a secure one one element of the definition of security is this broad investment contract category and that's where a lot of the discussion has been around crypto offerings because what the SEC has said is look if you have someone selling a token along with a lot of promises that they're planning to build a network and increase the value of the token because the network is going to be great then that the SEC has argued could fall within the category of an investment contract and therefore there needed to be some sort of registration with us or some sort of exemption from registration the problem is that this is this is really a a difficult application because if that invest token was sold as part of an investment contract does the token itself have to register as a security or and be treated as a security all along so one question is what is a security and the second question is well if it's a security doesn't even make sense to regulate it the way we regulate other kinds of Securities and so we we need to be thinking about making adjustments now I've taken a bit of a different approach than some of my colleagues where I really do think you need to think about that token on its own as a separate thing even if a token was sold as part of a Securities offering I don't think that transforms the token into a security and and I I think we haven't done the hard work here at the SEC and some lawyers have been suggesting maybe that we we think about things a little bit more rigorously here because it is leaving the crypto World in this state of uncertainty about how to even move forward um we haven't even gotten to nfts and there are lots of other types of things that we we really need to sit down and think okay at what point do the Securities laws apply and if they do apply what adjustments do we need to make to make sure that people can continue using these things without it you know the the legal the legal structure being placed on top of some of these activities could actually squelch them entirely and that doesn't make sense so let's figure out how to deal with that yeah I'd love to actually explore that a little bit more because there's this self-terminating nature of if you what happens if you applied existing Securities Frameworks towards crypto assets crypto Network assets like our crypto networks um like and these protocols that are built on top of other Protocols are all designed to be Community owned and and totally decentralized yet there's this this chicken and egg problem that all of these tokens eventually start in some Inception point they start in this very centralized way but they are designed to be as decentralized and diffuse and Community bottom-up owned as possible yet applying Securities laws framework actually prevents them from achieving that state so there's this like weird self-terminating relationship where like okay yeah they kind of start off in the centralized way but if you apply Securities laws as they exist today they actually I never get to the point of them being in there maximally manifested state which is not as a security so because you are defining as a security you actually Rob these opportunities these tokens of these opportunities to actually achieve the state that it would be if it was actually decentralized and I think that's perhaps what you were alluding to with more rigorous thought uh by the SEC Commissioners and chair I'm wondering if there if there is this understanding or acknowledgment of this like Catch-22 of we want our things to not be Securities and the the best the worst thing that you can do is to actually create Securities regulations about these things that are designed to be decentralized do you understand the conundrum that I'm trying to express yeah I do but I think what what's going on at the SEC though is I mean there's there's Fair a lot of capacity to do to do good rigorous legal analysis but the issue is that we are taking positions that maximize our jurisdictional reach right if if it if if most tokens are securities it means that most platforms where tokens trade are going to be entities that we regulate if most tokens are securities it means that any broker dealer that it deals with any firm that deals with uh these tokens could end up being classified as a broker dealer so it it's a way I think of of maximizing the reach of the Securities laws and if we this is why this is why I really think Congress needs to come into this conversation and say all right look we agree when there's a token offering the initial token offering it would be great to have some disclosure let's have the SEC write up a disclosure framework or we agree you know we think that these platforms need to have some sort of regulator um okay maybe that's the SEC maybe that's the cftc some combination of the two and so that would then sort of free us up to do a to do a better legal analysis but right now this is a lot of this seems to me at least to be about planting jurisdictional Flags by just taking these very expansive approaches to where our Securities laws apply and the other thing that I don't think Washington is very good at is sort of thinking about like okay no one cares whether the Securities laws apply or no one outside of Washington cares what they care about is are we are we making the world a better place by applying regulation or are we just making things complicated and not serving anyone's interests and so the the ability to take a step back and think about those kinds of things is sometimes hard for a regulator with a with with you know A History A long history and and you know a real intense desire to protect people right this this is a very there's a lot of good motives here people want to protect people it's sometimes hard to take a step back and say wait a minute by protecting people you're actually preventing people from getting access to products and services they want and you're actually not even getting them the kind of information they would want I mean let's talk about what does SEC registration look like well the reason that we don't really know is because it's really hard to get through a process that's just not designed for your asset class or for your type of entity and so this isn't a good outcome but you know for a regulator we're like well you know we're looking at our regulatory checklist and if you don't exactly tick every box on there then you know we're protecting investors by telling you to leave Esther this is why we appreciate talking to you because there's just such Clarity and willingness to kind of engage on these uh on on these issues that the community and that's really the relationship I think a lot of people in crypto are are looking for uh from from their regulators and and you're right we don't have Clarity on some of these things but to the point of maximizing jurisdiction I wonder if um the argument has made internally whether the SEC actually wants this jurisdiction or not I know uh you know bankless we we put out things that are you know we think are funny sometimes but uh we went through a thread recently of things that we're not sure if their Securities or not Chuck E cheese coin versus like uh you know an erc20 is it a security what's the one-to-one mapping we've got baseball collectible cards that aren't Securities somehow um how about a digital collectible how about that um you know sword of uh fire that just dropped and your video game is that a security and I start thinking about all of the opportunities for like digital assets and we start thinking from the crypto vantage point of the explosion of digital assets which is just going to absolutely balloon right the way websites did in the early internet you know you started off with 20 websites and then before you know it you have a million and before that you have a billion and it keeps going from there does the SEC actually want jurisdiction over this because it seems like a complete mess to go through the process of trying to regulate a you know a sword in a video game if that's kind of the direction we're going in I'm being a little hyperbolic but does this make sense I mean not really I and that's the SEC well look Washington Regulators typically want to expand their jurisdiction but I I think your your point is a good one which is that if we apply the analysis we've been applying with respect to crypto we would be regulating a lot of things that we're not regulating now and so is the answer to say well yeah we want to regulate that stuff too or is the answer to say wait a minute we need to like rationalize what we're what we're asking for here what the SEC should be regulating is is is capital raising um that's our mandate right to to regulate activities around Capital raising and where it's something else that really doesn't belong with us and I think if we don't get it right now what we will end up with when more of the world is digital more of the world is digital assets more more things are happening in that world then we will end up with the SEC regulating everything now I will tell you that outside of crypto also the SEC is taking extremely aggressive jurisdictional stands and we are trying to regulate a whole host of entities that are not Congress hasn't told us to regulate but we're looking around for as many pieces of the economy to regulate as possible so I I you know nowadays I would say yeah our goal is to regulate as much as possible and I I speak not that is not my goal but I but I think as an institution that's that seems to be our goal I think we're going to need some more Commissioners then if that's the case better look at number six and seven if we're to go in this direction well so so Hester I think the crypto community that pays attention to these kind of things have come to that conclusion that gone are the is the opportunity to interface directly with the SEC and come in and shake hands and here are the days of that's a trap and uh we all everyone kind of understands that the SEC is interested in expanding a jurisdictional reach and kind of putting his original first principles mandate secondary to that uh which is um a sad State of Affairs but understanding that this is kind of the Paradigm the the Paradigm that we're stepping into what advice do you have for our industry when we when the whole industry does kind of understand that like the SEC is not really here to advocate for our Capital markets or our assets like what advice do you have for us and how do we proceed on this I mean the SEC is never there to advocate for any particular asset class so so don't set your sights too high but I also think that we're in a bad place right we all acknowledge that it's kind of a dysfunctional relationship the SEC is is you know lashing out by bringing lots of enforcement actions and again there's a place for enforcement actions right I think we all know there's a lot of Fraud and and we've seen a lot of that come out and there is definitely a place for us to to bring enforcement actions but then you know the industry is is like well looking at the situation and saying well it doesn't benefit us to talk to the SEC I still think we have to have those conversations I'm trying to push from inside for us to have more productive conversations with the industry um but I think that needs to come also from from people in the industry or people who use crypto and and want a better regulatory framework around it um you know maybe you don't want to come in on your own uh but you can come in as groups uh in in groups of like-minded folks and come to us with use cases show us what you're actually trying to do with with the technology because I think that's a really powerful reminder that this isn't just regulating away some useless activity it's regulating a way things that actually could transform people's lives and I think that's what a lot of people in crypto believe and so you've got to make that case with concrete use cases um and we we need to keep having these conversations because what if if people who are trying legitimately to build things within crypto just say you know what we're just not even gonna go and talk to The Regulators in DC then what is DC left with we're left with stories of really bad things happening in crypto and enforcement action after enforcement action where you know the conclusion then becomes well this is just a lawless group of people they're not interested in complying and so why should we waste time with doing anything other than bringing enforcement something worse will fill the void is what you're saying I fear that's the case and and you know look I I am discouraged I mean you know you're telling me it's been two years since we talked I am discouraged by that I'm discouraged that we haven't made more progress but I'm also optimistic that we can make progress and I think it is really important for people to remember that even if The Regulators themselves don't remember this Regulators work for the people it doesn't it's not the other way around um and so it you know ultimately even though we're a little bit removed from direct political accountability there is accountability to the people and so that you know that's something that we can continue to work on uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody

website and the most recent one came on March 10th five days ago alongside of commissioner Mark yuida pardon me for improved you wait up for butchering the last name uh and the last sentence of this statement is uh we descent so that you're not alone of course you're not the only Soul dissenter as the of the five commissioners of the SEC so there's at least more than one of you and I'm wondering like to what degree are you actually able to sway the direction of the SEC with these descents there's multiple people dissenting to what degree are is that actually effective and how how much control do you feel like you have over the the ship of the SEC well I think it's an important question and I think a lot of people looking at the SEC have no idea how it operates right it's a weird entity with five people running it but chair gansler sets the agenda and the staff report to him so obviously he has more more control um but the the the the five of us um do you know we're all involved in the decision making whether it's about rules or enforcement actions and it is a majority rules thing so the two of us dissenting that was on a a Bitcoin exchange traded product I know bitcoin's not your your primary interest but but I think the the point that we were dissenting on there was that the SEC is applying different standards when it comes to Bitcoin exchange traded products than it does with respect to other exchange traded products that's a similar concern that I have more broadly across crypto which is we're just making up a new regulatory framework and applying it to crypto and so the fact that one of my colleagues came alongside me and said yeah you know I look at that and I see a distinction between the way crypto is being treated and non-crypto things are being treated I think that's a really good development and I have my colleagues my other colleagues have open minds too and and I think commissioner Crenshaw has expressed a real interest in meeting with people from the crypto Community for example um I'm sure commissioner lazarga does he's he's the newest commissioner I'm sure that he does as well and so you know people can change their minds we can't give up on on people and then if they're three then we've got a different ball game here so so I I really think um yeah dissenting on its own maybe doesn't move the ball but I think it does help it it helps us to think about what the issues are and maybe what some potential Solutions are um and so I think it's important to have that conversation and have it publicly which is why I put out so many Public Defense well we definitely appreciate reading them anytime uh Gary Gensler chair gunzler comes up on the Friday weekly roll up that Ryan and I record we always jokingly and and the section is like but Gary Come on the podcast we'll talk so we can talk I'm wondering how sir do you think Gary will listen to this podcast he he's a busy man with a lot of rules to write so I'm not sure how many podcasts he listens to well uh maybe if you style it as a rom-com he he really likes rom-coms what wow so that's going in a place I don't think the the podcast has ever gone David but uh no we have not you never know there's always New Frontiers to open um Hester this is um you know you're talking about you're basically saying hey crypto industry don't give up on Regulators uh and you're saying to kind of regularly say you know we gotta we gotta engage with the community and I just want to Echo the the the problem that we have I think between the SEC and regulators and crypto is a problem of mutual trust and the best way you restore that trust I'm a podcast maximalist maybe but is conversations like these it's engagement and so I just want to say we appreciate you engaging with the crypto community in this way and having a conversation and we you know we may not see eye to eye in everything and that's totally okay but I think that the other SEC Commissioners will see a set of shared values that we have in crypto that are also expressed through uh Regulators like the SEC um so that was one dissent that that David brought up which is the the Bitcoin ETF descent um there's also the the Kraken staking descent as well and what is the kind of the core of your uh what was the core of your descent in the cracking uh staking Initiative for bankless listeners who probably know Kraken uh display banned their staking product what was that man time flies a month ago something like this uh David probably even more okay but I don't know a time does sorry we've had a banking crisis between now yeah February 9th was the date of your descent so just over a month ago um and then you you kind of wrote a descent on the back of that can you tell us about that that dissent um what what was your purpose in that and what um were you driving towards what was the core of your argument sure well the the Kraken um staking service was shut basically shut down in the United States by that enforcement action and so the first question I ask is like okay if if we think that this was a Securities offering which you know depending on the facts and circumstances one of these staking as a service Services could be categorized as a as a Securities offering then let's think about what it would look like for Kraken to come in or another provider of a staking service to come in and register with us so they you know they come in and they say okay you know this is what we're trying to do um we'd like to register with you the SEC if if the SEC were actually to say all right we recognize that this is a bit different than anything we've looked at before so let's figure out what kind of disclosures would someone who is a customer of wanting to you use one of these Services what would they want what information would they want okay we can figure that out we can sit down and figure that out but I think it's more likely that the response that someone coming in would have gotten is a very long drawn out process with probably nothing to show for it at the end because we haven't you know we just want to jam everything into the Frameworks that we're used to but why I mean we've in other circumstances with asset-backed Securities for example we've said you know what these these are a little bit of a different kind of asset so let's design a regime that makes sense for them we could do the same thing for a number of things whether it's crypto lending or crypto staking or um you know stable coins if the if if those were given to us by Congress to regulate whatever it might be right we could come up with a regulatory framework that made sense and so I guess I was frustrated by the fact that our answer is just to say all right great we've kicked this this service out of the United States so now we can count it as a victory for for investors well I mean not necessarily because some people understanding the risks and the potential rewards might decide they want access to crypto as thinking uh to staking as a service offerings right and that's really not my decision to make and say no you can't have access to that and so I I just didn't count it as a win for for investors plus then it was being used that one settlement was being used as a definitive statement around crypto staking which every product or service has to be looked on on its own facts and circumstances and so you can't use one settlement and again when people settle with the SEC there can be a lot of reasons to settle with the SEC you know like they can't afford to litigate or they don't want to go through the trouble of litigating or whatever and so you don't have an airing of the issues before a neutral Arbiter so you can't take a settlement and say well that's law now and it's it's it's determinative one of the patterns I think in some of these descents is this idea of of guidance versus enforcement what you're just illustrating there it seems like an enforcement approach was taken rather than guidance is that kind of a common theme across many years I mean why not why not do it this way why not identify discrete issues take those discrete issues put out a position paper hey world this is what we at the SEC think when we look at nfts we think these are markers that might indicate that an nft is a security fits within our our Realm put it out there in kind of a draft form invite people in for a public Roundtable where you've got people actually sitting talking to each other and doing it in public so this is not developed in some back room and then after hearing that conversation then we could go to a proposed rulemaking or maybe you know we have other tools like exemptive orders or a guidance document interpretive guidance document but it would be informed by a discussion with the community that knows the technology that knows the ins and outs of this that can react but instead we come out with these you know these these developments through enforcement actions which then we expect everyone to adhere to and no one had the chance to have a conversation about it it just it's not even the most efficient way to do things I mean if if we wanted to go one by one and bring enforcement actions against everything that we think is is a token assuming you know as some have said at the SEC that pretty much everything I mean as a security some people have said pretty much everything is a security we would be doing this for hundreds of years and why would we be ahead in that situation why wouldn't you want to just establish rules people could see the rules and then if they don't abide by them then you can bring enforcement actions it's just a very inefficient and very not non-productive way of moving forward and we have other options which we've used in other circumstances Esther what you just described of people coming together to kind of talk about what the the guidance should be it just sounds like from from the crypto community and from from regular it just sounds so functional like it's just not do it we could we could tomorrow we could come out and we could say you know what we've rethought where we are and where we're trying to go right and we're gonna just do something new let's try something new so I I would love that like plus one to that how do we make that happen I I guess um you've got a common sense approach these things I'm wondering about staplecoins so there's been some uh you know action with busd and you don't have to comment on any specifics with this but like what is the status of of stable coins uh you brought it up earlier that maybe some some um legislation needs to be put forward but like in a common sense regulatory mode how could you see that being dealt with in the United States well again we could do something similar as I said we could we could say here because again not every stable coin is is is identical to every other stable coin and so we could say here are some things that we think maybe pull it within our regime but because stable coins is an area where Congress has at least expressed a pretty direct uh pretty um you know they were they were actively negotiating legislation for stable coins in the last Congress I think it really at this point makes sense for us to wait for Congress to tell us what we should do in that space now with everything going on over the past week whether whether Congress is going to turn its attention to crypto or not or or focus more on banking we'll see but I still think stable coins is an area where Congress could write some you know it's a pretty discreet area so they could they could figure out what they want the regulatory framework to be um and so my preference would be for us at this point just to wait to hear from Congress on that Hester I'm I'm curious kind of um like your feedback to uh the crypto industry as well we want to be we want to do our part in engaging with regulators and um of course crypto it does not help that crypto has in 2022 had a lot of Bad actors that made headlines and done a disservice uh to what we're trying to actually build here and do here I know that doesn't help our cause certainly I'm wondering if you could give us a a critique or a take what could people in crypto be doing better at this point in time what what are your frustrations with the industry when you look at it well look I mean some of the lessons from traditional Finance are certainly applicable in crypto and people need to internalize those you need to be thinking about who your counterparties are you need to be asking whether something seems too good to be true you need to be looking at you know leverage can can put people in a worse position you need to be asking whether statements that you're getting from centralized counterparties are actually backed up by reality or not um and you need to be demanding transparency from entities centralized entities right and then identifying Bad actors and and telling The Regulators about those Bad actors there's a lot that the industry can do on its own to protect itself right you don't need to come crying to the government always for help and that's sort of one of my general themes is it's generally better to try to figure out Solutions other than regulatory Solutions even when things are really bad sometimes a privately designed solution can be more effective um but and then the other pieces as I said earlier telling the government about use cases is important thinking about what the questions are that need to be answered by the regulator concrete questions and then offering up Concrete Solutions to how could you achieve the regulatory objectives in a way that would still allow the industry to move forward as it as it should and then I guess one pitch I'll make is that in the process of this don't lose sight of those first principles because this is a moment for us to to be defending some of those first principles it is a moment for us to say no we don't want the government watching everything that everyone does we don't want the government to um to be involved in everything that happens on chain right and that's okay right because they're because again there are other protections that are available through the technology and so let's have this moment to say is some are some of the approaches that we've taken so far in regulating the the the economy and the financial system do they work or do they need to be rethought so don't um to get a short-term gain don't give up those first principles because they really are important and I think the decisions that we make now will have profound implications down the road and so we we can't lose sight of that even if you know sometimes it's tempting to say okay we just want a short term success on the regulatory front you have to be thinking down the road of of are we really going to be in a better place with this kind of regulatory framework uh in in effect Hester I think one of those first principles that crypto the industry the community that crypto natives need to hold on to is this principle of decentralization and I feel like sometimes we have not been diligent enough in piercing through when things are called decentralized there's this decentralized theater about certain projects about certain things going on and I think one thing that could help you tell me though is that the crypto immune system becomes better at identifying what is actually decentralized and what is centralized and learning about that I I do think even though through these mistakes though that this is how the market realizes uh there are centralization attacks so when we had like block fi and Celsius and Voyager and all of these failures I think a lot of people realize the market got more intelligent on where the the centralized attack vectors actually are and the weaknesses and failures are and that is how a market levels up um but that I feel like is something that we could improve on moving forward and we definitely want to do our part on that yeah I think that's a really important point because if if you have stuff that's calling itself decentralized and it's actually centralized you're playing right into The Regulators hands who are saying this is all just a centralized yes industry and we're going to regulate it all just the way we regulate other centralized Industries um so be honest because you know it sometimes does take some time to move from a centralized point to a decentralized point but you have to be honest because people can get very badly hurt if they think something is decentralized and they're actually um you know three guys sitting there with with the keys to a treasury that's growing and growing and growing and then they run off with it so you know I think we have to um you know we have to be honest both as Regulators but also you you and the industry have to be honest about that and what I do worry about is I worry that the The Regulators really want everything to be centralized and so we're going to be we're going to be sort of playing that up and pushing centralization so I think people need to be pushing in the opposite direction of decentralization to show that we're we truly are dealing with some something different here now there are again I think a lot of people would argue that when you have a centralized entity it doesn't get a pass just because it calls itself crypto so um you know then we have to deal with the risks that arise from centralized entities I really think that's what I would like the bankless nation to uh lee be left with after the end of this podcast is that uh there's this inherent uh resistance towards Regulators in the crypto world we just don't want Regulators you know you know get out of our industry but then really the question that comes out of that is like well when you when you have that sort of just spinal reflex against Regulators then you also create an environment for the reasons to be regulated in the first place to arise right and so without us self-regulating and being equipped to understand why we have Securities laws and things like the SEC in the first place without understanding that then we will just fall victim to the same trap that will invite The Regulators in in the first place uh I agree David it doesn't have to be a black and white picture right we can we can I mean look I have my own views I'm I'm a pretty free market let people make their own decisions let them let them make mistakes and learn from those mistakes kind of person um whereas some of my colleagues for example and a lot of the American people would would rather have a much more active and interventionist regulatory system and that's okay but we need to have those conversations honestly and then figure out what is the right you know what's the right Middle Ground there that allows people to to realize their own dreams and and and take make their own choices for themselves and their families but also um prevents or protects against some of these really bad things that we've seen so we actually um invited you back onto the podcast after both Ryan and I read your remarks at the digital asset uh conference at Duke uh this was in January 20 20th in uh of this year and so I just want to read a small excerpt from towards the end of that those statements where you said uh last year was so brutal for crypto that some people wanted to regulate it to the Dustbin of failed experiments rather than swiping left on crypto however we should remember that new technologies sometimes take a long time to find their footing what kind of country would we have if Regulators prohibited people from experimenting with technologies that other people think are stupid or meaningless or even ones that could cause harm our country is built on a presumption that people are best able to choose for themselves people know their own preferences limitations risk tolerances and circumstances better than the government does sure sometimes people make very bad decisions on behalf of themselves or their families but handing over the keys to government does not ensure that decisions will be good and I think that'll be how we how I uh leave this with the call the action for the bankless nation is that we will have good relationships with the SEC if we also regulate ourselves better than the SEC can so the responsibility is actually on us as well to to do the sec's job and then we will uh have the best foundation possible to actually interface with the SEC that's my takeaway from these statements that you gave at the Duke speech and I'm wondering if you had a moment to reflect on them no I mean I think that that's a great Point like take the responsibility yourself and and show that um you know you are being proactive about getting rid of the bad activity within your own space and I think that that makes a good selling point to say you know Regulators we really don't need you to make every decision for us because we're making some good decisions on our own but you know I think we as Regulators also need to be introspective and and think about where we can add value and where we can't um so I hope I hope we'll do that on our side as well and the other thing I would say is I love talking to people so um people in the industry I always learn from those conversations and so talk to my colleagues um but I often when I travel let people know where I'm going to be and I I really do welcome the chance to to hear from you directly so just putting a plug in for that as well you need to keep us informed I need I'm constantly needing to learn and and so I appreciate people who are willing to take the time with me well Hester thank you for taking the time I think um we established the framework for for how we could move forward I'm just just envisioning uh people in the industry maybe all the shadowy supercoders get together with all of the evil regulating bureaucrats and we actually have a conversation face to face wouldn't that be amazing why not right why not and I absolutely going to 2023 I think that's possible we appreciate all that you are doing at the SEC to make that possible and we'll continue to kind of fight the fight on our side and last thing I want to say is um please stay we appreciate you I know there's lots of places you could go it's so important to have Regulators in a government that are willing to engage in this way and I worry a little bit about that power vacuum of course I know this is not an appointment for life but I I worry very much that we don't that's the key point I think that's a key point which is that government is not ultimately I mean we need to have institutions that are strong institutions that it won't matter who's sitting in my seat or who's sitting in the next seat and that means institutions have to respect the rule of law due process and and and the the need for people to be able to live free lives and so it it won't matter whether I'm sitting here or someone else is sitting here that should be totally irrelevant and so that is the the world I'm trying to get to is where where we have these and and I think that's true of these institutions I mean we've got great people who who want to come in and serve and so we it won't matter if I'm here or not that's that's um the key is to just get that those institutions working for the people and I think that's where we're all we're all aiming for that that is the key incredibly neutral SEC a credibly neutral crypto uh commissioner purse thank you so much for joining us today we we certainly appreciate you thanks to both of you it's always fun to talk to you thanks Nation have a good afternoon uh bankless Nation a couple action items for you uh some descents will include links to the show notes to some of the um some of the speeches that we referenced also the Duke speech gotta end with this risen to claimers none of this has been regulatory advice of course Hester said that at the beginning neither has it been crypto or financial advice you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
