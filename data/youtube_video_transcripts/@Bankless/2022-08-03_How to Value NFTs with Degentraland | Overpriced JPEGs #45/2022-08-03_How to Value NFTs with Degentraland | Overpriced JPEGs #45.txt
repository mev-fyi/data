[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i have a very special episode today i am joined by the gentleland folks probably know matt you say your real name right people you're not private about it matt better known as degentraland on twitter i feel like you have struck the perfect you've like won twitter because you have the perfect combination of just posts like internet snark you've got that voice nailed and then interspersed with really thoughtful awesome educational threads that give great insight into the news of the day and the space in general so congratulations sir i tipped my hat thank you yeah it's been a it's been a wild ride i've been tweeting for about six months now and about two weeks in i realized how short the attention span of the nft investor is the only way to communicate with them is to do it in a digestible format which tends to be shitposting i uh it is you're exactly right it is something that i think about probably not as regularly as i should but i will at some point really decide i'm going to double down on twitter and actually try and get good at it which is something i have not really tried to do yet and i will look to you for all my tips uh all right we we're gonna dive into so much good stuff here you know i heard you recently on a block workspace i thought you were just fantastic talking about macro environment you know some big picture stuff some small picture stuff we'll talk about nfts your framework for them i really want to get into doodles i think you and i maybe have uh uh i don't know differing opinions but maybe we'll converge in the same place around what chain doodles should land on other side meta you have some some awesome insights you had a great thread about other side meta

this on july 28th crypto is pumping nft volume is down those two facts seem somewhat connected we usually when when crypto's sort of volatile and moving we tend to see lower nft volume what's the state of the market where are we how are you assessing things yeah i i think to understand the crypto market you have to understand the wider market in general crypto prices are inextricably linked to the stock markets of s p 500 and the nasdaq albeit with a higher beta so when the s p and the nasdaq dropped 20 percent you're gonna see crypto uh coins chains dropped 60 to 70 percent and then like yesterday when we saw the nasdaq go up three or four percent ethereum prices are now up 15 to 20 so the question is why is the market in such a bad place right now what caused the downturn and the question that everyone wants to know the answer to is when are prices going to go back up i think the answer rests in inflation so inflation's the highest it's been in 40 years it's at 9.1 percent right now we have to look at it from both the demand side and the supply side so from the demand side we have a ton of excess liquidity in the market right now so the us government injected a bunch of cash through biden stimulus plan everyone got 1400 payments and we also are seeing low unemployment it's 3.6 right now so at the beginning of covid service industry collapsed waiters hotel staff they all lost their jobs but tech companies were hiring like crazy in consumer products consumer goods were performing extremely well so now we're in a situation where no one wants to work everyone's demanding higher wages which of course drives up the price of inflation from the supply side the fed thought that inflation was transitory because as the world opened backed up uh supply issues would be solved but mandatory lockdowns in china crippled supply chains um you could look at the prices of chips for instance which have gone up tremendously which flow into automobile prices manufacturing costs and commodity prices are up they're through the roof because of war in ukraine gas is at five dollars a gallon in the us for the first time ever and india banned wheat exports because of food insecurities all this is to say the fed needs to raise interest rates uh in order to bring inflation down and bringing it back to the crypto market every nft project every crypto platform just trades like a mid cap tech company whose valuations are determined by future cash flows so when interest rates go up those future cash flows look a lot less appealing hence ethereum down 70 i love that great breakdown i want to push on a whole bunch of things you just said i want to start with inflation because this is something that has been like gnawing at me a little bit for a while which is to me or i hear all over the place oh it's because of the stimulus and we pumped all this money into the system and that's why there's inflation and that i just can't compute that to me this feels like such a supply-side inflation problem where it's it feels very supply and train driven 1400 like it's been a year how long has it been since the last checks went out we're still just all like cruising on 1400 that seems insane to me and the other thing is we're seeing inflation like in at the grocery store we're seeing in everyday goods that you're not buying more of because you suddenly have more money i totally get that when we print money and we give people money that's when you see equities pumped people throw their money into crypto and we could see inflation in those asset classes but nobody's buying like six loaves of bread because they were given fourteen hundred dollars so the day-to-day inflation that i feel like people are really reacting to it's all supply chain based is my feeling and i feel like i'm taking crazy pills because i feel like i hear all over the place that it's about the fact that we printed stimulus and i'll say i'm a ubi fan so maybe i'm a little defensive because i feel like this is like everyone's like oh ubi would cause crazy inflation you must work for andrew yeah have i shown my hand but i uh can you respond to that for me yeah well i agree with you it's it's much more supply side than demand side but at the same time if you if you pump the market with a ton of extra cash than consumer goods and they're going to just perform exceptionally well and so people are going to raise the prices right so here's my concern yeah you say we have to raise interest rates what interest rate raising will do is kill demand it doesn't fix supply chain issues so it feels to me like the fed feels like they have to do something because they were they got they messed up they said inflation was transitory they were clearly wrong now they want to show that they're doing something about it all that they get it all but the only instrument at their disposal is not actually an instrument attacking the real fundamental problem again am i taking crazy bills do i have a right to be concerned about this no i mean i agree with you the the the outcome of raising interest rates is that gdp growth is going to slow down right but at the same time that's going to flow back into the demand side and hopefully fix supply issues in the sense that demand is going to be lower so we don't need as much supply people are going to be saving less money because interest rates are lower right now american savings are really high because again the of the stimulus checks hopefully that flows through um i will say i don't blame the fed for thinking that inflation was transitory i think it's hard to predict global events happening happening and crippling supply chains as much as they did uh did anyone think that war between russia and ukraine was going to happen probably not ukraine is one of the biggest grain exporters in the world and when you couple their decreased oil output with opex decreased oil output i mean supply chains are going to just be hemorrhaging right and to be fair well i guess not to be fair to to attack the fed to take the counter the fed was saying it was transitory before russia ukraine hit right they were they were saying that in fact i think they switched their position on the transitory thing around the time that that russian ukraine has the world open back up sure so the fly issues related to covet would be solved yeah and and look i don't think they're wrong about that i think they got the timeline right like what what is transitory if inflation eventually decreases right like what is the timeline at which it's transitory if it disappeared in a year is that transitory but disappeared in a month is that i don't know what their their measure is but i don't think they're wrong i think they're probably wrong in the how quickly it was going to happen you can't shut down a global economy and then for months and then expect like on a dime that can just turn all the way back on which i think is what we've we've seen i mean it's like once traffic starts moving again when there's been a big enough traffic jam it takes a while for it to trickle down to the the cars in the the way back even if traffic's moving so i listen at this point everything just comes down to semantics like you have the white house and the fed saying we're not in a recession after we've seen two consecutive quarters of negative growth if we can just change definitions like that then words stop to mean things yeah you look at cpi like inflation's reported at 9.1 percent real inflation's probably double digits right now it's gonna keep going up uh it usually takes like three to four quarters for interest rate hikes to actually see an effect in cpi um the market right now is pricing that we're gonna go to 350 bips by the end of the year and then once we start to see inflation go down the fed is going to lower interest rates significantly like they've done in the past so everyone wants to know when prices are going to go back up don't expect it to don't expect us to see a recovery for another 12 to 18 months not the news we want to hear man not what i want to hear well we'll talk about that means from a trading perspective and and where you think you know how you're playing the next 12 to 18 months but i want to keep unpacking your your call it initial monologue which i think packed a lot of awesome info in there you talked about the the tight coupling i suppose of of equities and crypto and yeah i'm curious first and foremost do you think we'll ever see that decouple or these two asset classes always are they gonna move in tandem with equities driving yeah i mean the reason that they are coupled right now is first institutional and retail investors are going to dump their most volatile assets first and that really just translates to crypto and nfts and netflix and like that's why we saw that big tech drawdown companies that companies that are priced on future cash flows are going to be hemorrhaging when interest rates go up right uh i think we're going to see a decoupling it might not happen for several years you have to think about the value propositions of bitcoin right and i'm by no means a bitcoin or ethereum expert i mostly focused on nfts but the value proposition of bitcoin is digital ownership and digital sovereignty right it's it's theoretically supposed to be a hedge against inflation but right now it's doing the exact opposite right it's traded in tandem with the stock market uh that being said listen my original thesis for getting involved in crypto and nfts is that right now if inflation is let's call it five percent year over year on average and the stock market is going up six to seven percent on average year over year you're really only seeing two percent gains so my bet is that all of these financial instruments that are new to the market crypto nfts all of the different chains and platforms bridging solutions etc the expected value on them is higher like you have you have an option between earning two percent year over year or earning something like 10 to 20 year-over-year you just have to have the appetite for risk um i think this is such an important point and i'll say why because historically we've seen average stock market returns of what seven eight percent year over year you know over a long enough time horizon and i think you know i know for myself that was sort of the number i had gotten locked in on of like okay great i just dca into some vanguard you know s p 500 style thing and i can get my 78 return if i just keep it there you know until i retire or or whatever and this unlock moment for me of like oh no no no you know like that has been the last 20 years or or 50 years or whatever it's been that's not guaranteed to be the future and actually if we look at because of the money printing going back starting from 2008 how much money has just consistently been pumped into the system that has probably created these asset bubbles in things like equities we really should expect lower returns moving forward if things start to normalize a little bit and so and then you look at inflation being what it is like you're actually losing money then over the long term if these returns end up being more like four five six percent instead of seven and eight percent and so then you have to look at where else can you go i think new technologies like crypto and nfts obviously i've made the same bet you have there the other one is it's it's arguably a a call for entrepreneurship and that like one of the best ways to to maximize capital is like literally investing in yourself and a business that can have much higher growth rates um so i appreciate you bringing that up i think all of this was highlighted during so the fed dropped interest rates to zero they said for the first time in history they would consider the buy-back of equities which really just translates to most companies right so the fact that no airlines went under during covid just screams we're in an art price pump so you're earning three percent on equities during covid investment grade bonds are earning like very very low yields because rates are down the fed is going to bail out these companies so that's why you saw a major pump of crypto assets because people just weren't earning the same amount of yield in their traditional financial instruments yeah so what's what's fascinating to me you mentioned that these blue chip nfts which are the ones that have really held up during this period trade like mid-cap equities and we're seeing them take a hit as interest rates go up because as interest rates go up that you know there's those cash flows become more appealing rather you know like safer investments like bonds whatever become more appealing rather than the future cash flows of mid-cap equity stocks etc do you really feel like the blue chip nft investor is that savvy and is thinking along those lines it makes sense to me when you talk about equities because you have these big institutions that are are thinking to that level of granularity and are modeling it out like that but your average board a poll there is that or maybe not average holder but like board apes are also moving on those same whims uh the short answer to your question is no not the slightest i think there may be five percent of people who are buying nfts who actually think in these terms but it doesn't really matter most of the market is controlled by a very small number of people like you can look at any percentages of you know the top 100 holders that own all of these projects and most of them dictate the market but i think what's important to note is that the nft market is not going to have different market dynamics than the traditional market so in times of recession you're going to see a flight to quality and what is quality in the nft market uh board apes artifact doodles moon birds and proof art blocks so art blocks yeah i mean that's that's a separate conversation too is like what are the safest assets in nfts you have two types of nfts in the market right now you have you know your traditional cryptographic art with no utility and then you have cryptographic art coupled with utility so the punks and the art blocks of the world in my opinion are always going to be valuable but for a very different reason and something like doodles is going to be valuable and in times of market downturns like these are going to be the best performing assets because not only do all of these companies have a ton of runway but they also have a long-term vision they don't care about market dips every six months right they care about 10 years from now i almost worry more about the assets that have a utility component to them and i've talked about this in the podcast a couple times recently so people might be hearing me say this again but there's such a clear analog for fine art as a store of value and so it's not hard for me to make the case to my 60 year old father that generative art is an uh uh an understood art form that will grow in significance and art blocks are going to be the picassos of the future that will trade in the the you know fine art houses and it's a good store of value the concern i have is that there will never be utility delivered by board a b yacht club that itself justifies trading at a hundred thousand three hundred thousand half a million dollars and at some point that comes to a head as people realize there's never going to be a utility that warrants that i so i totally agree with you and i think that's why we're seeing a massive market correction right now the prices when board apes the floor was 450k pure speculation like you're not going to be receiving 450k worth of utility for a decade right and all of that comes down to mass adoption the only thing that gives all of these nfts value is if other people are buying into the ecosystem and the only reason other people are going to be buying into the ecosystem is if the brand grows as if there are underlying use cases so maybe at this point we should talk about the actual value of pfps and if someone is trying to explain to their mom and dad why they just spent two hundred thousand dollars on an nft how they can actually justify that so i think there are four value propositions of pfps the first is digital identity the second is conspicuous consumption the third is community and the fourth is utility and utility is really a black box right now uh i would almost make the argument that there is no utility in the market right now that these in real life activations these exclusive merchandise those don't actually count as utility and airdrops certainly don't count as utility which we can talk about but let's break down all of those buckets so in terms of digital identity humans spend about one third of their lives staring at screens as another point of contact according to a barclays survey in 2018 about 10 of consumers buy clothes just to post on social media what do those two stats tell us they tell us that digital identity matters as much if not more than physical identity how does this translate into pfps well pfps can be avatars in the metaverse they can be characters and play to earn games they can be your icons on twitter on discord so there's something there right and i think as the world continues to trend more digital these are only going to go up in value the second is conspicuous consumption the bevlin model that is price goes up demand goes up conspicuous consumption whether or not you choose to take part in it will always have a role in market dynamics people will pay for lamborghinis over bmws despite them driving very similarly people will pay for rolex's instead of digital watches even though they both tell the same time if anything digital watches tell a more accurate time people just want to show off these ornate displays of wealth the problem with physical conspicuous consumption is that you can only show off that wealth to the people in your immediate vicinity well unless you're buying it so you can show it off on social media which we know people are doing which plays back into the digital identity yeah but when these assets exist on the blockchain you can theoretically show them to the over six and a half billion people that own smartphones so this conspicuous consumption is is going to compound over time next we get into community founders like alexis ohanian have made their entire careers around empowering creators via digital communities there will always be this in-group out group psychology you see it in the real world with sports teams religions colleges every other institution people want to feel part of this community there is some intangible value that you will always receive i would argue that the biggest value proposition as it relates to community is actually networking so right now web 3 is attracting the smartest people from every verbal of web 2 this is not always going to be the case if you think about internet companies in the late 90s and early 2000s back then there were internet companies and today you just have companies that use the internet i think the same thing is going to happen with blockchain and nfts where right now we have a ton of companies that are blockchain native web 3 native companies in the future every company is going to be integrating this technology they're not going to define themselves as blockchain companies so right now you have the smartest people that are all joining these communities and buying pfps there is this network effect right now that you cannot get in any other industry or any other space and then lastly we have utility and again this is the biggest black box i don't think utility actually exists there seems to be this narrative in the market that air drops are the biggest form of utility the problem with air drops you can look at any graphs the combined value of the original asset plus the follow-up asset is almost always less than the original assets value was pre-airdrop so airdrops definitely have some value to them in the sense that they can give holders less exposure to the project so they can de-risk by selling the airdrop without completely exiting they add extra liquidity to the project as well but i would by no means consider it utility so what is utility going to look like in the future this is the big question everyone wants to know i think it's gonna happen in a few different phases i think first we're gonna see utility with uh low hanging ventures like ticketing hospitality and reputation score so let's just look at ticketing first ten percent of consumers also admit to buying fake tickets this is american consumers if tickets exist on the blockchain then you have automatic verification of authenticity so you never have to worry about buying a fake ticket moreover there are billion dollar companies stubhub seat geek which act as middlemen for the transacting of tickets if these tickets again exist on the blockchain then there is a free open market economy with true price discovery for secondary sales of tickets again artists can add utility to these tickets in perpetuity so let's say the weekend i was listening to the weekend when he only had 40 000 plays on spotify if i could have bought his ticket yeah flex this was back in i want to say 2015 or 2016 when i was in high school i absolutely loved him i have you be happy i listened to the weekend in 20 summer after my freshman year of college 2013 2014. somebody introduced me to the weekend i wasn't on spotify so i didn't even know how many streams he would have had at that point yeah when the weekend said can't feel my face it really resonated um so if i had bought the weekend's nft when he first came out and he was offering 20 discounts on his tickets in perpetuity or if he were offering uh incremental benefits like backstage passes then i as a consumer start to reap the benefits of investing in the artists early on and in the secondary market they then generate royalties so it's another revenue stream for them this is a pure form of utility which i think is gonna touch every industry it's gonna just take a while to scale can i just ten percent of americans have bought fake tickets do you know where that number comes from that's that feels like a shockingly high percent of americans i was actually going to say well it's better now than a few years ago but yeah hundreds of millions of dollars where have you bought fake tickets uh stubhub i i don't know what the stated stubhub is now if they chan if they check them but before they weren't yeah i i bought a fake ticket to brooklyn mirage oh wow you can see that i'm not cool and i buy tickets to very few places and i like i'm not like a concert goer particularly i love music i'm just not a concert goer so this is not uh i have not dealt with this that is fascinating i i will say i talked about this on the show before because i'm very bullish on on nfts tickets and i've talked about that as being to me probably more than gaming the trojan horse that makes this all go mainstream uh i know one of the challenges is that your like ticketmaster for example owns most of the biggest concert venues around the country so they have to get on board with it because if you're the weekend at this point to do a tour you need some of the big stadiums that ticketmaster owns so you're quite beholden to like the rules they set so until ticketmaster has decided that they understand the the kind of monetary value prop to them which they should because again they could take a cut of secondary sales just like the artist um you know it's it's not just up to the artist at this point at least when it comes to the super big ones who need who need these big stadiums as part of their tours but let's keep going so you said ticketing you the third um the third utility you mentioned or the third example remind me what that was it struck me as interesting yes so hospitality and reputation score break that down yeah so hospitality makes a ton of sense let's think of soho house as a comp so if soho house released five percent of their membership supplies nfts then first of all again we have true price discovery where let's say it costs a thousand dollars a month to join soho house but the average consumer values that at five thousand dollars then suddenly we're going to have an open market where the company itself is generating higher royalties in the secondary market now soho house might not be the best examples exactly exactly but there are a ton of examples that are going to integrate this into the future and then in terms of reputation score i know a lot of people have been talking about this vitalik is is very big into the idea soul bound nfc soul-bound nft is right now and this will not always be the case there are and we have to be realistic here there are a lot of scam projects um a lot of ponzinomics that we're seeing in the market right now and a lot of this is because people can remain anonymous people are throwing millions and millions of dollars to projects that they know nothing about with us founders who are not established by any means in the future this meta is going to change and you are going to need to see someone's digital resume someone's digital passport um you're going to need to see people vouching for other people like you would on linkedin so you can give someone a thumbs up or say they exhibited these qualities and this is going to be the meta going forward where people aren't going to be throwing a ton of money into projects that they have no insight into and reputation score is going to touch everything to me every single web web 3 platform is going to integrate it i think people get nervous when they hear that because they think of like china's credit scores being built on like you know did you once piss off somebody who can you know hurt you in this that or the other way and so i do think there are reasons to be wary of this but i also think there are really obvious maybe even earlier steps than like broad reputation to give an example of what i'm thinking is like what we just saw with three era's capital right like suzu is borrowing money a billion dollars or whatever he's borrowing from celsius over here and so and so over there and like and none of these lenders presumably knew that he was going to all of them and getting a billion dollars and had they known probably would have been a lot more skeptical and a lot more reticent before they gave him a billion dollars so loans and and i actually think this is something vitalik talked about has talked about with soulbound nfts specifically and i think it even predated the three years capital situation is is the loan example of like you know we we should be able to see out publicly and it gets uncomfortable right because maybe as an individual you're you don't want all of your loan data shared but like ways for if if you're asking for a loan from somebody else they can access and see in these immutable ways what else you have outstanding so we can prevent these kinds of scenarios 100 i think we're going to integrate zero knowledge in the future where maybe not everyone can see it but in order to take out a loan from one of these companies you have to share your soul-bound nft with them i want to get us into some specific nft projects again doodles other side meta but i want to i want to stay a little bit in this more abstract world for just a few minutes more i want to ask you uh again kind of going back to the macro environment where we see consumer demand despite consumer sentiment being really low consumer demand has remained strong and this is in theory what the fed is trying to kill which is uh with interest rate hikes and et cetera et cetera um i i i would guess you were do you listen to the all-in podcast i would you would strike ah i feel like you would enjoy it it would strike me as somebody who would listen to it i i only listen to yours oh nice well played damn suck it up to the host love it um david freeburg an investor and um very smart man on the island podcast has been beating this drama of a credit crisis and and feeling like the fact that consumer demand hasn't seen more of a hit or haven't seen the hit we would maybe expect given inflation and all the rest of this do we have a looming credit crisis and i'm just curious if you have any thoughts on this and if if you felt like that's something that would really hit nfts potentially yeah it's a good question so right now if we just look at the credit market there tends to be a delay in the credit market in terms of pricing in recessions so a few weeks ago the credit market was only pricing in a 30 chance of recession and you saw investment investment-grade companies and high-yield companies still issuing a ton of debt because interest rates were low uh but they were they were expected to go higher so companies right now are really well capitalized and i think the same applies to the top nft projects so you saw doodles raise a ton of money um through venture capital other side has raised 450 million dollars from a16z 200 million dollars from their land sale 100 million dollars in secondary royalties moon birds um raised 90 million dollars through their uh primary sale so these companies aren't going anywhere i worry more about the smaller companies that don't have this runway but have these big plans and big developments like how are they going to be paying their employees in the future especially when secondary volumes again are just tied to the overall market and they're down tremendously if people were pricing in people were forecasting in their budgets that they were going to continue to get the same amount of money that they had been getting for the last three to six months consumers just consumer sentiment is like the worst it's ever been right now i want to talk about some of the obstacles to mainstream adoption that's obviously what we're all trying to drive at and and you made an interesting point that i i heard at one point about like ease of use none of us this isn't a hot take to say that crypto and nfts are not easy to use or nfts in particular are not easy to buy and it's ridiculous and i just recorded a conversation where we were talking a lot about the scams that are happening and and how they're there are add-ons they're chrome extensions there's things you can add to your uh whatever life that are good that are good to help you prevent these scams but how the opposite of what we need right now is more hurdles more things that individuals need to do in order to protect themselves to get into this space and that's like the opposite of what we should all be shooting for um you made an interesting point you said 70 of shopping carts are abandoned before purchase in like the web 2 world so i maybe talk about this a little bit of just like i think it illuminates if you expand on it just how far we are from like where this hopefully will all end up being and how primitive so many of the systems we use in crypto are and i think the shopping cart example is a good example of that yeah so there are about 100 million crypto investors and there are only one to two million nft investors so why are there 100 x uh you know traditional coin investors i think the answer comes down to ease of use so to buy crypto all you have to do is connect your bank account to a centralized exchange click buy ethereum to buy an nft you have to do that you have to then send the ethereum to a wallet like metamask you then have to connect your metamask to open c and then from there purchase the nft in between all of these steps there is a high learning curve right it's easy for us we all take for granted because we are so accustomed to the ecosystem and buying an nft we don't think about in our first week in nfts how difficult it was to actually navigate the ecosystem so i think what's going to lead to mass adoption is a few things first i think credit card purchases are really going to help us you look at blockchains like flow for instance which integrate usd purchases i think this is a really easy way to onboard the masses when you think about it most people don't want to hold their uh cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges we all tout the benefits of having digital sovereignty but how are you gonna retrain seven billion people who have had their money in banks to suddenly trust it to decentralize wallets where they have to keep their seed phrase hidden right it's um it's a hard gap to bridge other than that when we look at the micro transaction market which i think is going to be what gets people to adopt nfts no so few people are going to be spending 50 000 on an nft when they don't really understand the value propositions of it so once nfts get integrated seamlessly into gaming platforms ticketing et cetera that's when we're gonna see mass adoption the problem with that is scalability so who is gonna pay fifty dollars in gas fees for an nft that cost 20 no one right so we're gonna have to move to chains like polygon immutable x flow that solve this scalability problem in order to actually onboard millions of people i really want to have the uh scalability conversation with you and and the kind of various theories of the case as to how we get there i've said now multiple times and i will say this is not a hard and fast opinion that i i see is unchangeable but i am i see the path for scalability for ethereum and i think uh it's it's i see it maybe more than i see the the case for like really secure bridging between chains um and which which leads me to a slightly more maybe ethereum maxi position because i think network effects will accrue there etc but maybe let's have this conversation in the context of doodles so uh because you you put out a thread it's it's maybe a few months old at this point a month old i i've lost a sense of time in this i write a lot and i've lost my sense of time in this industry of course uh but i think it came out shortly after nftnyc and after the the julian hogwin you know presentation and announcement about really like the future of of doodles so why don't you give me your your thoughts on doodles maybe outline the the business case etc that you made for doodles in that thread if you can think back and then that'll get us to what their future looks like and will they end up on flow and i've been pretty public saying i'd like them to end up on l2 and we can have that whole conversation uh yeah i think the team is committed to integrating chain outside of ethereum in order to scale for the reasons that i listed before so let's talk a little bit about their business plan and this is informal the team hasn't come out and say this this is just how i view uh doodle scaling over time so phase one is establishing doodles as an nft brand they have done this quite successfully the second is setting up a mass market framework that's the phase that they're currently in right now we're gonna we're gonna break that down and then the final phase is to monetize ip so once we have a bunch of consumers who are familiar with the brand how are we going to actually translate this into revenue so in terms of establishing themselves as an nft brand why was doodles a success story well first the art just resonates with everyone if you show someone outside of web 3 a board ape and a doodle i have never met someone who prefers the ape artwork over the doodle now that's personal experience some people are going to disagree with me but doodles is much less intrusive to the non-web 3 native consumer second is the team itself jordan castro goes by poopy is a thought leader in the space he pioneered cryptokitties back in he lifted wrapped asset technology from crypto kitties improved it and integrated it into space doodles and then they have nate alex who um just founded uh bucket auctions which is the closest we've seen to price discovery uh at mint and and we can talk a little bit about it i've talked about that on this podcast and nate alex i will say is is uh maybe the other poster uh poster i might like even more than you degentra land i i think that alex is a great a poster he's uh he's a forward influencer yeah great guy though great guy so okay they've established themselves as a leading nft brand now how are they going to set up the mass market framework to actually onboard millions of people like they say they're going to do first is moving to a scalable chain right again if they are pursuing wearables as one of their largest verticals moving forward one of their largest revenue sources they can't have this be on ethereum because no one's going to pay 50 for a 20 wearable so i want to respond to that go ahead because i think this is the perfect example to talk about so when you describe wearables these are wearables that presumably your doodle will change into this is you being able to have more control over your identity you'll buy a wearable my doodle can change into a taylor swift t-shirt if i want it to to really more fully reflect who i am correct so what i where the breakdown happens for me is if that wearable is on flow and my doodle is on ethereum that feels like a pretty significant conflict in terms of being able to get my doodle to wear my t-shirt whereas if i put it on a layer two i'm with you in that we may not be there yet but it's worth waiting to get to that point to have your entire ecosystem in one place rather than rush it out on flow because the experience is slightly better now and the scalability is there now and i think the team is smart and will end up there i so yes i agree with you i think every l2 chain or scalable l1 chain has their pros and their cons i think one of the best things about flow and i don't think the team is going to end up using flow i don't want to speculate but i think they're probably going to lean towards polygon or immutable x one of the benefits of flow and polygon actually just announced their zk evm which is going to essentially accomplish the same thing which is it's really easy to onboard web 2 developers into the ecosystem so flows language cadence is really easy for javascript developers to code on uh and sure it's important to onboard millions of consumers into the ecosystem but it's also important to onboard the people who are actually going to be flushing this ecosystem out uh i agree with you and i think the market would resonate much better with keeping all of it within the same ecosystem which is a benefit of polygon for instance i i wanted to i thought you had a really interesting point on uh that i i don't know well on sharding and on sharding putting the emphasis let me find the quote so and not to get too technical here because i'm certainly not the person to have a deeply technical conversation but i am i want to be open-minded and again i don't want to be an ethmaxy simply because i understand the ethereum scaling plan better than i currently understand flow or cosmos or one of these other ecosystems so i'm very open to always learning more and and that's why i say this is an opinion i hold but it's not an unchangeable position that i hold um you mentioned in this doodle's thread actually and as you were talking about flow and in some ways at that point this was several months ago making the case for flow um you said ethereum sharding loads the hardest part of blockchain scaling onto application developers rather than solving it at the the protocol level so this seems to get to the point you were you were just making around what you like about flow being that it's very easy for developers to be on onboarded into the system and sharding is the next phase of ethereum right we have the merge in theory coming in september from there the goal is sharding which will help scale us to a hundred thousand tps transactions per second so you're a skeptic so so help me understand just just again without us getting too technical we don't have to sit on this for too long but when you say ethereum sharding which again is the scalability the this case for scalability loads the hardest part of blockchain scaling onto application developers can you break down what that means yeah so the way that flow works is they break down validation into four separate stages so each node is in charge of validating one of four of those stages and then the ethereum ecosystem validators have to validate every part of that transaction so in that sense it's a lot more scalable um it's not that i'm a skeptic of how scalable ethereum is gonna be i just don't think we're gonna see the final form of ethereum for for potentially decades um and vitalik has tweeted about this a lot that there are going to be separate phases of improving ethereum and i'm sure you saw recently he said the merge isn't priced in and then he quickly backtracked until it's not priced in from a narrative standpoint uh i do agree with him i think the merge is going to do a lot of good and i think we're going to see a lot of traditional web 2 platforms start to um adopt ethereum and other blockchains as they become more scalable i just think the timeline on this is decades rather than months i think i'm maybe slightly more bullish i agree with you we've got a a ways to go i mean a theory uh vitalik himself has put has put sort of some percentages on this he said after the merge which should hopefully be september we'll be at 55 complete and then you'll have the surge and the verge and the purge and the splurge to follow i love that man so much um and and i guess i've been saying this for a while vitalik is the only person without a god complex who maybe should oh my god i love that's a good way of putting it i this will be now the second time today that i've just like had like a complete gushing sesh over vitalik where he is like it almost makes me believe in god i'm not a like particularly religious person but it's like the fact that like this is the man and and this is his temperament and this is the this is the kind of person that is leading this very kind of critical next phase in human evolution almost feels too perfect because how easily it feels like we could have ended up with somebody money obsessed or or dark or cynical and instead we get what feels like the purest human you could possibly imagine and it's um it's it's kind of remarkable i won't be too redundant because again the episode of the podcast that's coming out tomorrow uh will have me saying a whole long thing about metallic but i i totally agree with you there i think to your point really quickly i think decentralization should be considered the fastest growing religion in the world i think it has a cult following right now but it has everything that a religion has ideals values like what are the values of blockchain transparency efficiency objectivity fairness like these are religious qualities and i think uh as the ecosystem grows i don't want to say this but i think it will have a role in undermining monotheistic relationships i hope you're right because i think people need something to believe in and and so that's why religion you know we can't have a world where folks don't have things to believe in but things get very dangerous when people cling too hard to to things they believe especially when it comes to ancient texts immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9 000 transactions per second and instant transaction confirmation no more gas fees no more waiting around for your transaction to clear immutable's zero knowledge roll up finally unlocks the world of crypto gaming immutable x is the only gas-free nft minting platform with over 26 million nfts minted all with zero gas fees with the power of immutable gaming developers don't also need to become smart contract developers they just need to plug in to immutable's api and instantly start unlocking the full potential of crypto assets inside of games this is why world class companies and projects have decided to deploy on immutable acts like gamestop ember sword planet quest eluvium tic toc and many more behind the scenes so start building your game on immutable x two day at immutable.com there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and

rap on this doodles piece with a conversation on this and i feel bad because i feel like this conversation has seen me be quite cynical about nfts which i'm not in the least i do think that there's arguments for the ponzinomics thing you mentioned it airdrops is sort of keep the ponzi alive how does it keep the ponzi dynam alive dynamic to it but i think you lay out this really fantastic framework that i fully agree with when it comes to digital identity and conspicuous consumption which is why i am actually bullish on nfts despite also wanting to call out that i think you know the utility will never arrive to the point that will itself justify a 450 000 valuation or whatever so i say i give that caveat to say what i'm about to say with doodles which is uh i think doodles has a as a tremendous opportunity to be one of the you know disney level ips or whatever that emerges from blockchain if i think you have a lot of players out there saying hey we're going to be the next disney and very few will achieve it uh you know very few anything become really mainstream and worldwide known so that'll be true for nft projects um i i i'm pretty openly bullish about aku and akutars i think they have a real chance to be mainstream known and i think doodles is is as well in that camp the question to me is what does that mean for the original nft holders and doodles could have a tremendous amount of success without doodle holders all becoming millionaires and this is potentially going to be a very uncomfortable situation which we find ourselves in some number of years if this happens and doodles is obviously very open about wanting you know they've they're going to have an unlimited mint and they're they're trying to bring in unlimited new holders by they want millions of doodles out there which under makes a lot of sense for them as a business but what do you think all this means for doodle holders so i i agree with you i think it's important to remember that company valuation and holder valuation are not synonymous in fact i would take it a step further and say oftentimes holders have very little leverage so holders require the company to appreciate in order in order to accrue value but the company doesn't require holders to appreciate in value for them to see higher valuations so the question is how are holders going to accrue value over time it's very easy to see how the company is they're going to target synergistic partnerships they're going to monetize uh their gaming venture they're going to release merchandise and toys power holder is going to see value well i see this happening in three ways so the first is ip open ip like apes have there's a lot of value to this you can grow your brand in tandem with the brand of the company or the project the problem is that oftentimes when you give holders such open so few restrictions in terms of what they do with that ip it can oftentimes dilute brand so a doodles holder could open up a candy store which might be very synergistic with the company but then another doodles holder can open up a strip club or brand their own construction company right and if one of the biggest value propositions of doodles is to drive narrative forward and to create a cohesive brand then it's probably not in their best interest or the holder's best interest to give open ip so the solution here the second way is to do ip licensing where let's say doodles is coming out with a animated show on netflix and they want to feature some of the doodles characters in that show then holders can license their doodle to the company and then receive call it 10 revenue share off of doodle's profits that could be distributed pro rata let's say and then the final way where holders can accrue value and and this is i think going to be very important moving forward is to revise the dow structure such that participants can reward through their commitment to the brand uh there are a lot of different platforms that are targeting reward structures and incentive mechanisms coordinate source cred i think what's important though is to note that participation in dows is abysmally low especially in nft projects you're lucky to see 10 or 20 participation so the question is how can we incentivize participation in order to grow the company brand and also reward holders in doing so do you have an answer to that last question i do really like the coordinate model so what coordinate does they implement gift tokens where let's say every doodles holder gets 10 gift tokens if you keep them for yourself if you retain them they are worthless so you can gift them to other community members and then those community members can trade those in for say a portion of the dao's community treasury or if the project implements tokenization you can earn tokens on that and this is a really good way to incentivize this intangible participation so it's not just your participation in the dow but maybe things you do for holders in real life that they can compensate you for or your intangible participation on twitter or discord and helping grow the brand there are a number of downsides too one of which is the most notable holders are going to receive an outs an outsized portion of the tokens so call it me and nate alex maybe rewarded uh disproportionately to the work that we're actually putting in and embedded in i think all of this with the the answer you just gave and even the answer before where you're you're talking about like licensing deals or building your doodle brand alongside the growth of doodles themselves for example or that you know as a model in general in nfts whether it's specific to doodles or not um is this something i've talked about before on the podcast which is accepting the idea that it's it's not all black and white like not all holders have to become millionaires for for nfts to be a success story and i think i see this in in the art world or on the artist side of things where you'll have let's call it mainstream people or people sort of outside of crypto point to all of these artists who are not getting rich on nfts or or even are saying hey their work's been stolen or this that like what a scam and what a failure nfts and crypto are and it's like look we should deal with the fact that you have artists whose work is being stolen that's clearly a problem that i believe is over that is surmountable and we'll get there whatever but to point to the fact that not everybody is getting not every artist is getting rich from nfts as the failure point or even that most artists aren't making money off nfts as a failure of nfts and the technology is so bizarre because the story is actually the fact that any artist you know digital artist in particular who previously was really limited in the way that they could monetize their work the fact that any of them are now making a living in a new revived you know amazing way is the cool story and i think it's it's going to be similar here with pfps which is revising our expectations that it's not necessarily that every one of us who holds any one of these projects that has success is going to then see commensurate success but you are going to have people you know jenkins the valet may be a good example you're gonna have people who are going to build really cool brands build really cool things with the ip that they've been able to to to use from this broader brand grow it with this brand and that's so cool like that is a new opportunity and making sure that we stay focused on the fact that there are going to be some people who are going to have these new avenues from which to show their creativity as opposed to focusing on the fact that it's possible not all of us will will just we'll get rich from from riding the wave totally agree i think it really comes down to how you characterize yourself in the nft space so if you think of yourself as an investor what do you look for as an investor you look for a very high roi and when there is a really high entry point to a lot of these projects call it ten thousand dollars people want to make 20 or 30k on the other hand people who consider themselves collectors don't care about roi right they're buying the piece because they resonate with it because they like the community and so i see a lot of friction here between how certain companies think of nfts and how the actual holder base thinks of them uh and i don't think it's fair to necessarily deride some of these nft founders who really just think of their collections as collectibles on the other hand for holders uh if you are spending a thousand dollars at mint and then the company grows into a multi-billion dollar company you are essentially a seed investor who just made the riskiest investment of your life right the one that is probably going to see the lowest expected value so in that regard uh i think it's fair for them to expect some sort of high return let's maybe take this conversation over to to meta and other uh sorry to the other side meta not to meta that's deeply confusing the other side meta um i know you had a great thread on that as well um why are you so bullish you seem to be very bullish on other side and the other side metaverse and i would love for you to just articulate in in sort of broad terms why are you so bullish yeah so this is this is where i get into a little bit of a ted talk so bear with me uh i think in order to understand the other side metaverse we need to understand the metaverse in general and then the benefits of decentralized metaverses so what is the metaverse right there seems to be this misconception that the metaverse needs to be gamified that it needs to be 3d that it needs to be ugc user generated content when in reality we're already living in the metaverse right we're connecting to each other via social media platforms like tik tok snapchat instagram facebook we are doing this podcast over zoom we all have super computers in our pockets i think the definition though what most people consider this new wave of the metaverse to be is some open interconnected platform akin to the internet so the way i would define the metaverse is at its most simple level an interconnected network of protocols infrastructure devices payment rails and in the future blockchain technologies so to me the question isn't just what is the metaverse but what is the final form of the metaverse and i think this is where people start to disagree to me the final form of the metaverse needs to be decentralized it's important to remember decentralization exists on a spectrum i don't expect us to have any pure web 3 metaverse platforms in the future much like i don't expect any pure web 2 platforms in the future and i think decentralization is going to be the end game here because of the benefits of it so let's explore some of the benefits first we have interoperability second we have scarcity third we have aligned incentives between consumers and producers and then finally we have what i call perpetual sovereignty let's break all of those down so first in terms of interoperability what's important to us in the metaverse you have history identity status reputation currencies assets and other elements the problem is these can't exist in a closed platform so you can't take your wearables from fortnite and bring them into roblox right now you can't take reputation scores from one web3 platform into another you can't take your filters from tiktok into snapchat and what that does is that reduces a lot of the value i think the majority of the value of these assets is going to come from the creation of a cohesive digital identity rather than a platform specific one and then at the same time improving the user experience i'll also jump in and add the liquidity piece of that right like is if you're not limited if i'm not lim if the filter that i love isn't limited to only being visible to the people that i'm connected to on snapchat which frankly are quite different than the people i'm now connected to on twitter you just have a much bigger market and if it's an asset than that you're looking to sell or trade or whatever the liquidity piece of that is incredibly exciting absolutely and that plays into the interoperability of crypto currencies so in fortnight you can't convert your vbucks back into usd any other fiat or cryptocurrencies in roblox you you can't do the same with your robux uh and so the value of those coins only exists within the closed garden um and i don't think that's sustainable moving forward the problem with interoperability is that asset interplay is really difficult to achieve so a lot of different metaverse platforms require different file formats a lot of them are built on different chains so you have decentraland and the sandbox and ethereum you have star atlas on solana and right now we use uh bridging solutions to try and bridge that gap this looks something akin to like uh space doodles wrapped asset technology so you take your wearable from the decentraland lock it into a smart contract and receive that equivalent wearable on the sandbox but this isn't true interoperability right it's two separate assets and even if you burn one of them it's it's not the same asset uh so so what other side and and we'll talk about this when when we uh do a deep dive into their platform what they're trying to do is build everything on a common standard and a few days ago it was actually announced uh what's called the open metaverse alliance the oma where all the biggest decentralized metaverses are getting together looking to build on a common standard and integrate portals so you can jump from say decentraland to the sandbox into any other of animocas platforms okay so that's interoperability let's move on to scarcity for a true open market economy to exist you need market dynamics specifically supply and demand the problem with something like fortnite is that epic games can release ten thousand rare skins and there's no secondary market but let's say theoretically you can sell your account for a few thousand dollars then what epic games can do is write a few more lines of code and come out with a million more of those same wearables and we actually saw this from their season one and season two wearables where they came out with the same ones in later seasons what this does is trends all assets down to zero right if there's no if there's no supply cap theoretically they're not worth anything if our assets are built on the blockchain then there will always be that supply cap and you will always have those original assets therefore creating an open digital economy so next is aligned incentives between consumers and producers i think right now there is a misalignment between the value that consumers are getting and what they're giving up so you look at companies like google microsoft apple what do we give to them we give them our data we give them our privacy rights and most importantly we give them our time so right now we're part of what's called the attention economy where companies are no longer just competing for their bottom line and their margins but they're also competing for time spent on their platform and this doesn't just exist within verticals so sure spotify is apple music's biggest competitor but it also happens between they're competing with cnn they're competing with tick-tock they're competing with everything else that's competing for my attention that's exactly right and back in 2018 netflix came out in one of their quarterly reports and said fortnite was their biggest competitor this completely changed the conversation so if we are giving up our data our privacy and our time we should be receiving more in return than simply unlimited entertainment right so what decentralized metaverses allow us to do is as consumers actually earn from our commitment to brands and this can happen through play to earn this can happen through tokenization this can happen through the appreciation of assets but it's really necessary and this is why i think web 2 is not a sustainable model moving forward in the metaverse ecosystem so the last piece here is what i call perpetual sovereignty so it's kind of the value proposition of bitcoin that if you're in a developing nation uh any government can seize your assets no questions asked right and that reduces their value in the metaverse if everything is built on the blockchain then you can't have epic games shut down your account because you violate their terms of service if epic games were to suddenly become unprofitable they can shut down their servers and then billions of dollars of assets that exist within the fortnite ecosystem suddenly become worthless inaccessible so this idea of perpetuity in the metaverse this idea that you are the only one that owns your assets is really important to creating an economy right it just goes back to property rights like you would see in in the real world so i want to ask and and obviously we'll get this we'll make this specific to other side in a minute but i love how you broke that down but your origin your framing for all of this was was decentralization and your your strong belief that the end state of quote unquote the metaverse needs to involve decentralization and it strikes me that in a couple of those subcategories you just outlined uh like interoperability it seems to me that decentralization is in inextricably linked in all likelihood to interoperability but something like scarcity right you can have quite centralized blockchains that can still create a sense of scarcity or even uh i guess arguably sovereignty like the kind of asset sovereignty is is decentralization the question is is centralization inextricably linked to each of those sort of four components you outlined i think so i don't think sovereignty for instance can exist with centralization unless they integrate decentralized wallets right if you're holding your assets on coinbase that's a custodial service and it's the same thing now in america most of us view this from a western lens and we have faith that our institutions given their regulation and their reputation are not going to just go ahead and seize all of our assets but we're also seeing funds shut down and and withhold uh money from everyone who has the policy from their platform you're right on the sovereignty piece i'm still on the scarcity piece in theory that could exist independent of decentralization right uh it's it's possible i think um this is more of a philosophical conversation than one of substance because i'm fully with you like i also believe in in somewhere on the scale of decentralization i think your point about it's a scale is important because you know you need a certain level of coordination that can come from like you know centralized entities um and decision makers and vision setters but there's a lot of decentralization that can be incorporated within a vision setters agenda um so let's talk about other sides specifically and and i think you've laid out this this case incredibly well why does all of it amount to you being optimistic about other side yeah so i think the success of the other side comes down to how well they can leverage those benefits of decentralization that we talked about and more importantly combine that technological innovation with strong narrative strong creativity so i think the success let's let's start with technological innovation so we we can break down each of those categories as it relates to the other side so let's talk about skeuomorphism first this this idea that you can transpose real world dynamics into the virtual world so if you were part of their demo you saw firsthand almost 5 000 concurrent users sharing the same virtual space with spatial audio and seamless motion now i think skeuomorphism hyper-realism is going to be the future of the metaverse i don't think it's necessarily the deal breaker to it but you look at all of these centralized platforms right now all of which are targeting hyper realism unreal engine five epic games being the big one yeah exactly all of those ones and roblox is is text uh testing proximity based voice chat too and a lot of real world elements integrated into their game so if we can have 5000 concurrent users in a space then we target this idea of skeuomorphism in a way that we haven't before i think a comparable example is the travis scott concert on fortnite which saw 12.3 million concurrent users the problem that they faced is that due to computing power and some other limitations they could only have 50 people in each session at a given time so they had over 200 000 sessions streaming this concert to users now that is a feat of engineering genius where you are combining like an amazing music experience into a game but it's not skeuomorphic right and they failed to make the concert really feel like a concert so i think improbable is very well positioned to integrate skeuomorphism into the metaverse that's the first one second is interoperability hugo labs and improbable seem very committed to this idea so they are integrating metadata ontology 2d and 3d file formats universal scripting that can connect to other metaverses and this plays back into the omo the openmetaverse association we were talking about next we have scarcity and what they're doing is really cool because they're almost gamifying it so in the other side any user can create an object template so you can design anything that you want but only users that have resources can actually manufacture those i think this is where the play to earn component is going to come in where you are committed to the platform you earn resources you can then manufacture objects and theoretically earn from them now we don't have a lot of clarity on this but i believe that's where they're trending and finally we have aligned incentives and this is probably the biggest value proposition where you know you play fortnite you play roblox and you get a lot of entertainment out of it you do get some community um so there was a really cool study back in i think it was march of 21 that said fortnight actually led to pro-social behavior amongst adolescents so i i am not convinced at all with the theory that video game violence translates to real world violence i actually think that's one of the reasons as a little aside why suicide rates in the younger generations are higher amongst women than they are men um i think women interact through platforms like instagram where a lot of times you get validation from the likes that you're getting in the comments whereas a lot of men are interacting more through video games like fortnite and building camaraderie through that i would decide i would add the aside on that which is i think i think it could have both effects right like i think humans are different and we're wired differently and we have different outputs to the same inputs at times so i think it's very possible to me that they're super positive i think it's clear to me that there are absolutely positives to video games and it can lead to pro-social behavior i also think if you're wired in certain ways it can reinforce anti-social behavior that could lead you down a darker road where it leads to violence i think both those things can be true at once anyway yeah everything in life is out of balance right if you do anything too much it uh it could have negative effects but back to the play to earn i think the fact that users are going to be able to actually earn from their time spent the fact that uglabs is going to be integrating a lot of different gaming guilds bringing in some of the best play to earn players in the space this bodes very well for the future in creating a sustainable ecosystem what do you think is the biggest obstacle yuga faces in the successful development of this very ambitious vision yeah i think it is the obstacles that most decentralized metaverses are going to face so the first as we talked about is ease of use and ease of accessibility for this platform to be successful we need to onboard millions of users it's very easy to type in an email address on fortnight and set up an account it's much harder to set up a meta mask and uh keep track of your own seed phrase especially if you're you know 13 or 14 years old and then we also have the regulation component right where it's like do we really want 14 year olds to be uh in charge of thousands and thousands of dollars worth of assets they're they're gonna run into some trouble there then there's also this idea of volatility and we're seeing this in the existing decentralized metaverses like the central land and the sandbox engagement is inextricably tied to the price of their coin so if you look at those metaverse currencies uh post facebook's announcement that it was transitioning to the meta to meta they saw three to four x gains in you know less than a week what happened is that their users went up from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand uh and now we're seeing in this market downturn user engagement returned back to previous levels so given how volatile apecoin is i think a lot of their engagement within their platform is going to rest on how well their currency is doing now over time this should stabilize if they have millions of users within the platform then and everyone's transacting then there is going to be a less volatile um like buyer seller we're going to see a stabilized price but to get to that point is really really what about creating like game play balance and and so i i've talked a number of times on the show probably arguably too much about land sales setting up a strange dynamic in which you're beholden to to your land owners and to create some sort of return for them which creates this exclusivity there um but but you also want to elevate the best ugc and you want to elevate the best you know the most engaged users and and to some extent those two things are opposed to each other you can't kind of fully please both so they're already trying to balance that dynamic and then within the land dynamic as you described there's different levels of resources on the different on the different lands which will go into how much you can actually build or develop or or or whatever and getting those balances right so that it's not too heavily weighted towards one or the other and like how big of a challenge how surmountable of a challenge do you think all that is in terms of creating something that's sustainably fun for people [Music] uh to be frank it's very difficult so speculation leads to a negative feedback loop like you said where these land prices skyrocket in value real creators get priced out and then in order for the real creators to get involved in the ecosystem they need to rent the land or just land holders expect some sort of profit at the end of it so it creates some some friction between holders and and the actual um producers of content and also consumers uh i think there are ways to avoid this i think there are ways to create a game ecosystem where everyone can get involved with lower entry points so if you look at axe infinity what they did is you could rent out your assets for very low prices uh same thing with decentral games and their their ice poker ecosystem people can play and then earn at the same time as the actual owners of those assets can earn but it's a really difficult balance to strike and actually their most recent move on this front has been free actually like you can play for free with free axes that aren't nfts so you can get a taste of the game and the hope of course being that people like it and then upgrade to the to the axes that they've purchased and but they've struggled on the land front i mean they had sort of an uprising among their landholders because they had sold land a number of years ago and their land holders are like what do you like where's our value for this you know like what are you doing with this land and they had sort of insinuated that maybe they were gonna have like do free land for people i think in the spirit of this ugc model how do we get more users on there and then the land holders are mad so i just think you get yourself in a precarious situation like this i i think clearly i'm impressed and and everyone is impressed with what you guys delivered so far on this and i've been a bit of a skeptic of theirs but they're increasingly you know they're turning me around i'm not gonna deny their their success so far and um and their storytellers at their core right those founders are storytellers and i think that if they can make the story good enough and compelling enough that can also you know maybe paper over if they don't get certain things perfect out the gate when it comes to game play and they can potentially still build a really cool social experience for a large group of people absolutely i think narrative and ip is going to drive the space forward and we're already seeing it with the top projects you look at doodles they're integrating some lore into the space doodles azuki has bobo the bean farmer apes have apes from the swamp uh if you have a choice between going to disneyland or six flags assuming that their rides are equal which do you choose you choose disneyland because they have really strong culture great vibes people resonate with the ip i think the same thing i think the same thing is going to exist in the metaverse really cool point all right last question here bear market what's your strategy how are you engaging in this bear market are you buying are you holding have you sold anything what are you eyeing give us all the scoops i i do not suggest this for anyone listening to the podcast uh i recently liquidated my 401k bought a ton of ethereum and now i'm going on a little bit of a shopping spree no financial advice it's certainly not financial advice i should caveat i am in a very fortunate situation i grew up in a privileged environment and have some safety nets so um most people don't have that and i really would not i appreciate you saying that i think people like look at folks who like go and spend and this and that and like you never know somebody's you know family situation otherwise situation and yeah you know and i think sometimes people don't acknowledge if they have like other assets or means or whatever they just want to seem like they're out doing this so um well cool well so you're on a shopping spree i think i saw you bought a clonex yeah i got a few clones um i was i was fading the ecosystem for a long time my original thesis was that since they sold to nike they were going to miss out on the benefits of decentralization which we just talked about i i don't think that's true moving forward i think they're going to have a metaverse play in the future i think they're going to come out with a token probably in 2023 just my speculation uh and they seem to be very undervalued they're trading lower than azuki's and doodles right now but with the backing of nike the runway that they have the revenue they've been generating it seems like a very sure bet to me and the talented team like you got to give credit to a team that was on this so early and that clearly has a pulse on culture like these are founders who have had a pulse on culture since they were designing like video game skin stuff or like sneakers for video you know like he started designing sneakers from video game skin whatever right like there's a pulse on the culture there so uh oh it's not financial advice i don't own any clone x's i don't own anything that's the beauty of my position is like i can talk about all these projects be like i literally hold zero like so we're gonna have to get you into the doodles you go so i want to be but and i do lose my credibility of being able to be like look i don't even old one i'm just genuinely bullish on them um yeah one of the reasons i'm very bullish on doodles and most people don't mention this is that they have a lot more women in their community than other than other big blue chip projects uh and you can look at ape fest's irl event they had 95 percent men there it doesn't matter who you are you you don't want a hundred percent man at a rap concert that's just not the vibe um and i really do think the culture of doodles just like these are the most humble people i've ever met i mean some of these people have ten figures and assets and you would never be able to tell yeah i love that team i mean i don't know them all i know jordan primarily um but i know others sort of in the ecosystem you know and and jordan is what we call a floor influencer in the business what does that mean uh so it's like you know you have your floor nfts which are the the lowest value he's a floor influence or a floor twitter personality um it's uh it is the best insult uh in the web 3 space right now i don't i'm not cool enough to fully understand the conversation we just had but um i'm happy to playfully insult jordan at any point uh because i don't know because he's fantastic and that's a sign of love um cool all right well degentraland i so appreciate you thank you for hopping on so much insight on so many things and uh we'll be cheering you on i'm sure we'll have you on again someday to just shoot
