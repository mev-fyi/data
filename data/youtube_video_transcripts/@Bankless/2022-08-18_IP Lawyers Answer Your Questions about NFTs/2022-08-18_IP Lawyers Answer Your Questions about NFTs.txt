[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs we got another hot panel for you today and once again it is talking about cc0 though not exclusively cc0 i am here with several lawyers who specialize in intellectual property law and then max kernan the non-lawyer of the group i'll yeah introduce i'll introduce everyone here individually and then really the goal here today is to answer all of your questions when it comes to intellectual property and the law so we're going to talk all about trademark versus copyright how that impacts everything that's happening right now with cc0 we're going to get into some very specific hypothetical and non-hypothetical scenarios regarding moon birds and board ape yacht club and and maybe other projects here and then i want to talk more broadly about the call it enforceability challenges we have right now or just some of the broader legal challenges that don't get talked about enough in the space um so i wanna i'll introduce you each in a second but just thank you all so much for being here first and foremost thanks for having us all right joining me on the panel today we have alex modell he is the ceo of remaster and a trained lawyer remastered we also have our the ceo of remaster max kernan here remaster is uh providing solutions for some of these issues we're going to talk about here today we have jeremy goldman who is an ip lawyer focused in copyright and technology at frankfurt kernet klein and cells and he has really developed a practice that is entirely supporting web3 projects at this point he is in the room where many of these conversations are happening with many of these leading nft projects so he is likely not going to talk in specifics with us here about any particular projects that he may or may not be repping but he can speak broadly on these things very well we have daniel barsky who is an ip and technology lawyer at holland and knight he's also the co-director of the startup clinic at the university of miami and missing here is sarah odenkirk i'm sorry that we got times mixed up you were on a plane she was not able to join us today uh we are about to dive

just level setting and diving into what are the like verticals within law that make up intellectual property spoiler alert i happen to know i think it's like patents uh trademarks and copyrights and then really have you guys break down what a trademark is what a copyright is and maybe what we need to understand about these two as we engage in this conversation um jeremy do you want to kick us off there sure yeah so you mentioned the uh the trifecta of u.s intellectual property copyright trademark patent uh we could put patents aside for the moment for the most part patents cover inventions right and a patent is something that only you only get when you go through the process of putting an application into the patent and trademark office and they come back and they grant you a patent it's a pretty long arduous process that covers ideas that rise to the level of inventions and we can really put that aside that's really not an issue here so then we're dealing with the other two copyrights and trademarks and they're really different they cover very very different things and it's really important that uh that folks understand what they cover and there's gonna be some bleed over here when we talk about the concepts ahead so let's start with trademark actually and trademark is a uh is used to identify the source of a good or service that's what a trademark is right it's a it's a name it's a logo it's an identifier something that people the public consumers can see and use it to identify who is the source of this good or service and that's so that's what it covers and with a trademark you can obtain a trademark right without going through the registration process of going to the patent and trademark office and filling out the papers and getting a registration in your trademark you can get a trademark just by using something in commerce that people start to identify with your product or service so that's trademark and copyright totally different copyright covers expression that is fixed in a tangible medium right so what we're talking about there are your paintings is your art photographs motion pictures uh video games anything that you take when you take an idea you have to express it and put it in some creative way onto a page so when you just say something out loud if it's not recorded there's no copyright but the minute that you take an idea or you and you put it onto a page and it has a modicum of creativity a modicum of originality you automatically the author of that obtains the copyright in that and that's what copyright protects and copyright is often described the way i describe it in lots of people is you can think about it like a bundle of sticks because it's not really a monolith it's a bundle of sticks and each of those sticks represents an exclusive right to that that only you have the right to do and to authorize others to do things with it the biggest one is like copying right when you create something and you put it on the page only you get to decide that you want to make copies of it or to authorize someone else to make copies of it or to distribute it or to sell it or to perform it or to publicly display it or to make a derivative right to make a new creation a new work that's based upon the original all of those bundle of rights each of those is an individual stick over which the author has the exclusive right for a certain period of time and so that's what a copyright is and just like with a trademark you don't need to do anything in order to obtain ownership over your copyright but you can go to the copyright office of the united states and here we're talking about u.s law you can go to the united states to the copyright office put in an application to get a registration in your copy right and that will give you certain benefits and privilege and privileges including very importantly the right to sue someone for using your copyright protected work without permission and the right to get things like statutory damages and attorneys fees so it is sort of advisable if you have a valuable piece of um property that's protected by copyright you can go and get a copyright registration but you don't need to so just summing it up copyright protecting expressive works of authorship trademark protects it's a source of a good or a service it's an identifier that identifies with a consumer source of good or service patent covers inventions so that's that's sort of the the sum up there of ip in the u.s well and just a follow-up to that jeremy so if you did not file with the copyright office are your rights different and what are they so you're i mean use the copy or the nature of the copyright doesn't change but your ability to enforce your copyright is severely limited because if you don't get a copyright registration in the united states if you're a u.s person and you author something here in the u.s and and you cannot go to court and to stop someone from using your work unless you get that copyright registration um the additional benefits and privileges that you get in terms of what kind of damages you can seek right whether you can whether you have to just get actual damages or statutory damages that also will you know change depending on whether you get your copyright registration or not but something that i hear a lot and i'm sure daniel hears all the time is like do i i want to go and get a copyright in this thing or that thing it's all kind of a misnomer because the important thing to understand is that pretty much everywhere in the world now the united states wasn't like this always but we have been for for a while now the minute that the second the instant that you take your original expression and you put it in a fixed tangible medium you put it on paper you record it on the hard drive you capture on the on the in the camera you are the copyright owner right you don't need to do anything else to assert ownership over that over that work and just following on that's what makes copyrights different than really the other two types of intellectual property we haven't touched on trade secrets they're irrelevant here but if i come up in my mind if i have a great invention i write it down on a piece of paper it doesn't give me a patent in that right unless i take it over the patent office if i have an idea for a great brand or you know a great tagline that i want to use for my company and i write it down on a piece of paper but i don't go out and use it in commerce i don't have a trademark on but in both of those instances when i wrote it down on the piece of paper i have a copyright it just automatically comes into being uh in term just by my fixing it in a tangible medium boom there you go copyright and it writes a fix immediately again you don't like jeremy was saying without a registration you don't have full rights but there are some rights that exist instantly okay so let's talk about within this copyright bucket because i'm we're going to kind of show how what you guys just described plays out in an impactful way in some specific scenarios in in a later part of this episode but while we're just sort of in the definitional defining all of these terms period of this i want to ask what does cc0 then mean within the context of this broader copyright category i don't know daniel jeremy whoever wants to take that yeah that yeah that makes that's a great follow-on to what we were just talking about because cc0 basically is how you undo the fact that the copyright immediately and instantaneously exists um again if i come up with an invention i write it down but i don't do anything about it and somebody comes along and has the same invention and they go out and they publish it and they make millions and millions of dollars there's nothing that i can do about that if i didn't seek patent protection um but when i put something when i fix you know work of art in a tangible medium i write it down i take a picture of it whatever at that point i immediately have certain rights unless i disclaim them so with patent and trademark i can disclaim my rights by simply doing nothing by just sitting here i don't use it in commerce i don't seek registration et cetera but for copyrights i have to disclaim my rights even the limited rights that i have absent registration that's really worse it's the difference between like opting out and opting in like you have to opt out of your rights with copyright it sounds like correct so with the other versions you have to opt in other ip you have to opt in copyright you have to opt out so then let's talk about if you are somebody who's for example running an nft project and you want to do the in vogue thing of making your project cc0 and and the art that maybe you personally created or that you got the rights to through some sort of licensing agreement with an artist um how do you go ahead and make your project cc zero jeremy yeah you wanna sure i can address that um it's it is very simple uh it is very easy to waive your rights um which is uh well i guess that remains to be untested let me start here which is this is all untested all of it i mean almost everything we're going to talk about when it comes to nfts generative art that's associated with nfts creative commons licenses and how they work how they're enforceable whether you can change them how do you do them they're all it's all untested and what do i mean by that there hasn't been really any litigation over how any of this works there have not been courts that weigh in on whether these licenses are enforceable whether the waivers are enforceable whether you can you know put the genie back in the bottle whether you can change there's just been almost nothing even though these types of licenses and when i talk about these types of licenses what i mean are open source licenses creative commons licenses licenses that take a body of work be it software be it artwork be it literature and it's not an agreement between one person and another at arm's length but rather a creator or a project or a company that has ip and they publish a license that's supposed to apply generally to an entire community of people and users there has been very little decision making and court intervention and uh you know definitive precedent and analysis about how this all works that all said according to the creative commons license structure all you're supposed to do is take the work and essentially put a symbol this is you know a zero with a circle around it instead of what we have here which is the c with the circle around it right and you put a zero with the c around it and you link back um to the cc0 license which is published on the creative commons website and you kind of just announced publicly that i hereby publish this project um under the under the cc0 license as part of the terms that are associated with the project and that's kind of supposed to be enough in order to do that wow and so when you say link back to the cc0 license that the creative commons published do you mean in the terms and conditions for your project for example is that where that needs to be linked back to where can it be just like on your website you know i don't know the answer to that i don't it's it's funny because the way that cc0 really contemplated working would have been like let's say a software which is you know the by far the most juice in this entire area has been in the open a source software community and the idea there would be that when you publish your source code you could put the cc0 symbol and sort of you know just state at the top that this is subject to x license and cc0 is one of the menu of licenses there's other ones out there there's the mit license which functions very similarly there's the agpl license which functions very similarly in terms of making these things open source making them available to the public with an art project i can imagine a few different ways of implementing that i think one way has just been you know publishing a license on a website it could be making an announcement but although if the announcement says there are terms coming soon then i would say that's probably means that you have to wait until the terms come out to see what really is is binding um but i think there's a few ways to skin the cat there in order to make uh to make them i don't want to say enforceable but in order to implement the artist's desire to relinquish their copyright interest in the in the artwork and i'll just i just wanted to add because yes we haven't actually done a lot of case law involving nfts at this point this issue hasn't been fully vetted all the way through but i'm gonna take the the younger listeners all the way back to my day back when we had this little thing called napster right and a lot of these issues have been dealt with in emerging technologies in the past so yeah you have a cc0 license cc0 you know license i'll put license in air quotes because really it's a waiver of rights the ability to waive copyrights has been known for a long time there's a lot of law out there about it right it's an issue that came up in the napster case and and the the ninth circuit has decided this issue repeatedly you can ign you can waive your copyrights if you acknowledge their existence and you have an a a actual intent by the creator to surrender those rights that's all you need so we have all these fancy things out there cc0 and where we're going to put all this stuff but at the end of the day the core concept that we're dealing with here the ability of a creator to surrender their copyrights has existed and and has been litigated in other fields repeatedly so let's talk about that's if you want to wave your copyrights all together but we also see in the cases of like a board apes or what moon birds had maybe originally which is the idea of transferring a copyright in some capacity can you speak to the different models for that and also like can a can a copyright be just fully transferred or are we only seeing what we all recently learned about i think because of the moon birds case which is that like you're granted a particular license that gives you the right to use this copyright but you don't have full control over it so let's let's start with the first one can you transfer all of all of your copyrights to somebody else the answer is clearly yes it happens all the time people sign agreements all the time if for example if you get married right and you pay your wedding photographer a substantial sum of money you'll get back in return uh an assignment of all the copyright now you'll also come across photographers like that where you pay a substantially lower amount of money and all you get is a license to the photographs and they own the copyright but again this happens all the time this is not new to nfts you can absolutely assign away all or some portion of because like jeremy we're saying it's like a bundle of sticks i can break off little pieces but i can do all none or anywhere in between um in terms of assigning away my copyrights so yes that is absolutely something you could do and incredibly what was the other part of your question so this will get us into the let's start talking about some specific cases we're starting to see here so the question here is broadly speaking or maybe with some of these big projects like board api club are we seeing projects actually sign away all of the copyright rights or what we seeing them do is give the holders a license that says that that individual holder can you know has like commercial rights over the copyright but they don't actually own it entirely themselves yeah so what one just before we get to the specific application uh i think it's helpful to clarify a little bit about what it means to you know transfer a copyright versus those individual sticks that you know daniel was just referring to um one is the the the idea is that um in order to assign the entire copyright to transfer the entire copyright one of the challenges or potential challenges and the remaster folks could would be probably good good people to talk about this is that in order to transfer an entire copyright the copyright act has a rule that requires the author to sign an instrument agreeing to the transfer itself and so how that works in conjunction with blockchain transactions is a very interesting question i don't know that you know that's just i'll just raise that as a question right it's not you're not going to have the artist signing a piece of paper necessarily but you are going to have tokens that are associated with certain rights being transferred and mediated by smart contracts on the blockchain how do those two requirements work together the writing requirement of the copyright act and the transfer requirements of uh of the of the copyright so um that's that's one two i would say the way that these licenses could work in theory you could have a situation where the artist or the author of these of these of these works is transferring the copyright as a whole so that they no longer have any interest in it whatsoever but if you have a situation where an artist says i give you the right to use my artwork but it's subject to certain strings right there's certain restrictions there's certain strings attached whether they call it a license or they call it a transfer and daniel you tell me if you agree with this that's a license if the artist is continuing to hold on to certain rights it's probably in the nature of a license not in the nature of a transfer now when you say i'm giving somebody the rights to do something with that piece of art there's really lots of ways to skin that cat the most important of which one of the most important which is is that a non-exclusive right or is that an exclusive right right which that means is non-exclusive would mean yeah i'm granting you the rights to do that but i'm also keeping the rights to do that and i reserve the right to grant to lots of other people the right to make uses of that artwork and a non-exclusive licensee somebody who gets the right to use something but not the only person they don't have a monopoly on it that person has very limited rights of enforcement in fact under the copyright act that person cannot sue someone else for using the copyright even if they think they're doing it without permission only the copyright owner can do that now contrast that with a license where it's an exclusive license and says only you can use this then that person has the monopoly and they do have the right to sue other people so whether it's the transfer of copyright non-exclusive license exclusive license is really important i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that we are seeing primarily non-exclusive licenses here in this space and again to use sort of the seminal example because they were the first quote unquote to like give these ip rights to their holders board a yacht club that would be a non-exclusive license correct daniel i'm i'm opting out of answering i know jeremy's recusing himself so i'll throw it to you daniel you can take that one it's it's a good question because right the board ap yacht club said that they they sold all their all their rights and you were the exclusive owner but when you actually read the terms on their website the terms read as a license because it says so long as you are in com you know compliance with these terms keep in mind when i sell if i give my rights away if i sell my rights to somebody whether it's intellectual property or tangible property um they're gone that's it right i give if i sell you my car i don't get to come back later on and say hey um i don't carly you're not using my car the right way it's your property um there's something called three morale which is you know moral rights which again if you sell away all of your if you give away all your rights in a copyright you give everything away so the idea that the terms of board ape yacht club have this provision in there that you know so long as you are subject to yours it's subject to your continued compliance with these terms well wait a second then did you did i get all of the rights or why is it suddenly subject to what you're what you're saying here is board the the you know the team has sort of spoken about this like you have these full rights but when you actually read the contract we have the language here it says commercial use subject to your continued compliance with these terms hugo labs grants you an unlimited worldwide license to use copy and display the purchased art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the art so that line subject to your continued compliance would suggest this is not like a complete complete you have them forever and always kind of a rights and and this will get us to then the something we'll get to later which is the the other enforceability challenges here which is also how do these rights transfer from one seller to another you know as you go down the chain of people who buy apes and and then sell them to to other people because it sounds like there's some complications around all of that as well without sort of spilling it now is that right that it gets a little dicey it can and just to make it let's see more confusing let's make it even more confusing here for a moment right um those board terms and conditions the part that you just read carly when you go two paragraphs up it starts off with you own the nft okay so now i've got a document that um it starts off by saying i own it and then two paragraphs later says subject to my continued compliance i'm not sure what exactly that is supposed to be it it has language that is that is it is uh suggestive of both a full assignment and a license and say this is not meant as like some sort of full throttle attack on on yougo labs like i think we can all understand this project launched a year ago in a very in this space that was like wide open i'm sure they did not anticipate i can't we can't see what you're showing max but he's showing something they're a hat your bassy hat yeah yeah you know this was in you know early days you know early territory this is not to say that yuga is is trying to be nefarious or bad here just these are complicated issues that we're now dealing with in real time as this space has grown well beyond anybody expected and to their credit i mean they totally disrupted the norm right the norm before yuga was creator crypto punks keeps everything right and so you know with disruption uh comes reverberations right and people usually don't get it right the first time and they took a giant leap in my opinion at least uh for the entire nft community and the creative community to reverse what copyright and rights imbued to an owner of your work have versus centuries of uh art law so but the license is kind of bad so let's keep talking about it daniel well here's i i really want to clarify something that's that's so core and fundamental that we haven't we haven't done and and it's it's really really really important and that's distinguishing between what a non-fungible token is and what a piece of art is and these are different things and part of the confusion with that language that daniel was talking about is that it is true that you own the non-fungible token that is sort of undebatable because how do i know that you own it because hugo labs once they release that into the wild they can't control or freeze or seize or do anything it is out of their hands you own it it gets stolen they cannot get that nft back any more than anyone else unless you have the seed phrase associated with the wallet that is recorded on the blockchain as owning that thing only the owner of that seed phrase only that is the only person that can control it so that is like you know when sometimes you say possession is nine tenths of the law it's something we say when it comes to a non-fungible token possession is ten tens of the law there is no you know you can have a court ordering someone to send back an nft until you're blue in the face they cannot do it unless you have that seed phrase but what's different is that in a non-fungible token what makes it non-fungible is that it has an association through the records on the in the smart contract it says this token number you know 4156 is associated right with this particular piece of art okay that it has a link to it it's not even a hyperlink it's like it could be a hashtag value it could be a uri to a file that's sitting on ipfs and there's the piece of art that is different than the non-fungible token itself i know i'm stating very obvious things to people who understand it but when we get in these these discussions about licenses about ownership about what you get it is so critical to understand that it's in it is absolutely indisputable that you do own the non-fungible token that's associated with your ape and maybe that's kind of what it's saying but what are your rights with respect to that artwork well that might be a feature of the language in a license agreement or in the terms and so it's just really important that and how whether those things are separable and whether you can decouple them these are all could really interesting questions that may depend on the license and how that all plays out i appreciate that that clarification and i i want to take us to something we were talking about a little bit earlier which is um you know defending your copyright or defending your trademark and and the fact that a copyright is conferred to you automatically upon the creation of a work for example and you don't have to opt into that in fact you have to opt out of that one of the things we've heard from the proof team on a couple of occasions is like the legal expense of having to defend you know this copyright and that that being part of the reason that they decided to make it cc0 is that it takes that legal burden off of them and if there's some confusion around this question and i've seen some debates on it on twitter which is you're not actually legally obligated to go after every copyright violator or not legally obligated i should phrase it like this if you don't go after a copyright violator that doesn't put you in a position to lose your copyright correct but that that can be a situation in a trademark case where if you don't go after trademark violators you could actually lose your trademark can you provide some clarity on on that particular situation yeah so trademark unlike other types of intellectual property trademark law requires enforcement you have to protect your brand um if you don't protect your brand you potentially lose your brand because of imitators out there and it winds up doing what's called diluting your brand so suddenly my trademark is no longer a source identifier of of my goods or services is the technical language for it um you do not necessarily have to be as vigilant with copyright because copyrights again being different than trademarks and service marks um they exist on their own the work of art is the work of art if somebody makes a copy well i was gonna say a copy of the mona lisa but the trademark the copyrights in the mona lisa are long gone but um you know let's take let's take modern modern properties right so if somebody creates a uh fan art of captain america for example uh disney or marvel whoever owns the copyright to captain america at this point in time doesn't lose their copyright because they allow the fan art or the fan fiction to continue to exist it's actually a very large part of the value of those properties is the community and you don't see the big aaa brand owners going out there with a club and whacking everybody who who creates a drawing of one of the characters and they know where to find them because they're online they're on forms it's very easy to engage in that kind of activity but they choose not to because there's more value to the the aaa brand owners and allowing some of that activity to occur and they can do so without running the risk of losing their copyrights overall it's actually an art to this and it's something uh that's talked about a lot in fact at the international trademark association's conference i think was about five or six years ago they had the uh the general counsel of dc comics uh as the keynote speaker talking about this very subject so it is not something that you have to constantly uh take out every single infringer and in fact there are some business cases to allowing limited uh limited what would technically be infringing uses because there is value add to the project yeah so that's daniel's spot on about the the law on this um i think it's a good time though you know i think your question cues up uh something that's really important in my mind to understand about the value proposition of non-fungible tokens and the art and the content and the media that's associated with these non-fungible token projects i've i've talked about i sort of have i don't know i call it a thesis where i talk i can i call non-fungible tokens the three-layer copyright cake okay and i think this is a really good way to understand a little bit about what's going on here with the decisions between doing things like cc0 granting owners rights or something like where the owners or the creators keep all the rights themselves or they give it to a dow i believe that these are all different ways of playing with what i call the three-layer copyright cake here's what i mean by that default rules of copyright under the copyright act they recognize two layers like the old school way of doing things two layers of a copyright there's the there's the material object right and then there's the intellectual property rights in the material object okay what do i mean by that you're a painter you make a painting and then you go and you sell the the physical painting in the in the marketplace the owner the the person who bought the collector that bought that physical work of art they own that physical piece they own the material object the artist cannot assert rights over that material object it's theirs to sell there's something called the first sale doctrine they can go and resell it no problem but the artist retains all of those bundle of stick rights that owner of the physical piece cannot go out and license that artwork for use in a commercial right just as much as if you buy a copy of dune you cannot take that book dune and then make a commercial use of it because you own the physical book even if it's an old book of dune you do not get any of those rights right so material object versus ip in the material object one of the reasons that non-fungible tokens in my mind are revolutionary and different from what was before because we've added a new layer to that three-layer copyright cake we've added a token layer that did not exist before and what does that token layer do it describes ownership of the work that's different than the material object it's different from the intellectual property it's just a token that ascribes ownership that is associated that's the official record of who owns the work but it ain't the material object i mean these are all digital and i know that i have an mfer and i didn't forgot any material object of my mfr and i know i didn't get any ip rights because that's a cc0 project so what in the world did i get when people were offering me five eth for my mfr they were they wanted the token rights it's a third layer of that of that copyright cake and a lot of what's going on here is about where is the value gonna come from these nfts is it gonna come from the intellectual property exploitation of the artwork under like a traditional model which deals with sort of exclusivity and licensing and giving some people permission and not others is it going to come from that token layer where it's like you know what the more that this piece of art is out there in the world the more that it's mimified the more that it's like a cultural significance that's going to raise the value is it something in between or is it something else and so to me it's i think one of the decisions that's made by moon birds is like weighing sort of where where do we fit in that value proposition do we want to be more like this category of ip or are we more like this other one that's dealing more with tokens and more about this sort of being out there in the world and so it's a different it's not just a different world view it's a different way of thinking about where are we going to get the value from these non-fungible tokens yeah i think i think it's a great point i mean fundamentally you know these things should should be have like collectible and cultural significance and all these projects are just taking different approaches to how to create that cultural significance but it is that token layer that should cultural significance be reached should should a crew in value in the way that a collectible of a marvel character does i think is is the point you're making which is uh spot-on and a good reminder um just if i can cut real quick carly just keep in mind in a cc zero situation you do limit the ability to you know where that value can be created because there are no you've given away all the copyrights in the underlying artwork or whatever it is you're displaying you know and and that can be it's look at it this way right that's akin to when something goes comes into the public domain off of copyright we just saw winnie the pooh the a mill not the disney version but the original book come into the public domain because it's been long enough now that it's public domain and one of the first things somebody did was create a movie called winnie the pooh blood and honey and there's nothing that anybody can do to stop that that's just you're now going to have a slasher flick with winnie the pooh and piglet murdering people but how many great sherlock holmes uh you know series do we have let's not get in let's not get a dog if you want to get really complicated let's talk about argument that is that is our the bet that the cc0 folks are making is that actually like what you're gaining is the ability for anybody to now come and and create value out of your cc zero work and and definitely trade offs on both sides and hey look we're all talking about winnie the pooh now you know and winnie the pooh has not made disney money for a long time and now now maybe you know they'll they'll be able to sell some more merch because it's in the public conversation that's the bet at least but i fully understand your point as well yeah um you know we're going back and forth about all of these different ways to use your assets but the way that you can use your assets is very limited based on the logic that's defined in these standard you know erc 721 protocols and all of the definitions of how people can use these assets are written in legal text whether it's cc0 whether it's you know various types of different cop copyright whether it's more nuanced the issue is that there's been no way to actively have a nuanced approach to interact with community members to allow them to have certain permissions over some things no permissions over other things and it's caused chaos and it's why you know where the space started was if you do anything with these assets i will sue you well that's relatively simple because it's very restrictive and you have a lot of enforceability yes you limit the utility but you still have some enforceability the counterpoint to that is we want to empower the community give away all of this utility but now we're limiting a lot of our enforceability and what i mean by that is you you know do whatever you want with these assets we're never going to sue you and it's a function of not having necessary infrastructure to actually tie the legal system to this web 3 environment because it goes back to what jeremy was saying which is you know yes there's this copy right layer cake but what actually is an nft it's it's a record of ownership ownership on the blockchain you know of a specific token but what is that actually what is that token actually associated to it's associated to various images various rights but where are all of these constituent components of that nft actually held a lot of them are held in centralized you know ipfs's decentralized storage but a lot of them are you know also held on aws or all of these other components and where it becomes more complex is when you have an asset that exists on the blockchain and then you have definitions of how you want people to utilize that asset but there's no communication layer to influence how people can interact with that asset you're left with you know i mean what exactly is going on in the space right now which is we're just going to continue to test things out and see who gets sued and then eventually precedent will be set and then we'll start building projects based on the precedent that is already set as opposed to just having infrastructure that supports the intended use from the get-go that can still evolve over time immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9000

what we'll talk about here in in a few minutes because i think it's okay it is i know you you you max has their strong feelings about this and it's it's great because it's bringing an important issue to light um again talking in some of these specific terms now so there's a lawsuit right now uh between hugo labs and ryder rips who has been saying all sorts of things publicly about yugo labs and then actually copied the entire board ape collection to create this board ape yacht club rr version of the collection et cetera et cetera yuga is suing ryder and co over use of their trademark which is again an important distinction so overuse of the board apiac club name and their logo and and those kinds of marks not actually for infringing on the copyright of the ape collection and i would imagine there's a couple reasons they're doing this but first and foremost is because they have said these individual apes are owned by individual people and you have the rights to them as we're unpacking what all this means could could yuga labs sue ryder rips over the individual pieces of artwork themselves based on the current license yes very interesting but of course the holders themselves also can sue rider rips over the individual collections because they also have rights over that collection yeah that's where it gets really complicated right um and again not to not to not to harp on their on their uh terms and conditions too much but this is also a great ad for why you need to have an attorney help you through these things you know jeremy mentioned a little while ago you know there's a difference between the nft and the artwork itself now absolutely i agree with that the problem is some of the language in these terms and conditions reads when you purchase an nft you own the underlying board ape comma the art capital a comma completely period what does that mean right it sounds like i own it sounds like i own the entire thing um i i don't know because it's not clear in the document so um look when you cut your question carly about is you know who can you know can you bring a lawsuit the answer is well as long as you can have a tolerable claim and whatever it is 300 or 350 to file a lawsuit you can file a lawsuit um what's the answer uh that's to be seen i think this goes back though right carly to who if you filed copyright if you did not file copyright to my understanding and and please correct me if i'm mistaken i don't believe bordapa's filed copyright for the individual apes i know they've filed trademark for the brand and uh logos and terms and phrases that we we've talked about earlier um and so there's an interesting issue of how do you acquire copyright and who could acquire copyright the apes were minted uh based on an algorithm uh with no there was creativity associated with the creation of the algorithm and the traits associated with it but the actual generation of the artwork itself was purely without any human interference or action and so there is this issue uh is generative artwork classified within the human purview to receive copyright protection and property law 101 says i can only sell you what i have so it begs the question is did yuga have copyright in the artwork to then transfer to the underlying board ape owners um and uh versus what the lawsuit is focused on is on the use of the trademark logo the use of the boardig name uh et cetera so i'll i'll do one better alex just one quickly um imagine let's just assume for example that board ape or not even board a but any one of these projects actually did have copyright and they were actually able to impart copyright to these you know actual nft purchasers and someone started the business started working through a lot of these things they realized someone actually infringed upon their copyright and they went through a lawsuit process what happens when those terms are actually changed as a lot of the initial terms and conditions have certain clauses that say you know with respect to our own yada yada yada like we have we retain the right to actually change we reserve the right to amend oh i'll let you jump in here garlic because i know you're you're the one i was gonna say i just wanted to get clear on this for people right because um you're raising this generative art question which is another really interesting big rabbit hole we could go down and that feels like something that is you know a dark shadow maybe over the entire industry but let's assume that that yeah that generative art and and that you know hugo labs did have the copyright for this initially because they contracted out to artists and then they and in that contract they said they get all the ip and so they have that copyright you've raised the second question of did they file for copyright and i think this is where folks might start getting really confused because they're like well i thought copyright i know you said at the beginning here jeremy like well you can get additional rights if you file for copyright but the understanding is that at the creation of this unique creative work that copyright existed for them to to enforce and then they gave the rights to individuals to enforce that as well so are you saying now that they would have had to additionally file for copyright in order to sue ryder over these individual pieces yeah so let me let me just say uh a few things one put all this aside it is just absolute black letter not black letter supreme court law they actually came out with a decision called the fourth estate decision it came out a couple years ago that was just super clear in order to file a lawsuit for copyright infringement you need to have obtained a copyright registration from the copyright office or a denial of a copyright registration from the copyright office before you can file a lawsuit so that is just super clear so even though you wait wait yeah let me cut in here because does that mean that individual holders if they wanted to sue over copyright infringement of the ape that they hold they would need to be filing for a copyright so again let's use the right language because it has to be specific you don't file for a copyright you file for a copyright registration okay right so it's the copyright you own that no one can take that away from you as well but to sue you need a copyright registration in order to sue you need a copyright registration and by the way just let me just let me just i promise i'm gonna answer this if let's say that hugo labs let's assume you let's say hugo labs owns the copyright okay that means that they can file for the copyright registration and if you if you are an exclusive licensee of somebody's copyright an exclusive licensee you also have the right to file for copyright registration but you would list yougo labs as the copyright owner and you would list yourself as an exclusive licensee and then you as the exclusive licensee would have the ability to sue for a copyright infringer i i do have more to say but i want to stop there and see okay yes so let me let me pau so okay so already we've identified there's a challenge which is it's like not entirely clear if you're the exclusive licensee as a as an ape holder for example now additionally you're saying in order to sue you would need to get a copyright registration so if jimmy wants to sue ryder specifically because ryder is using jimmy's ape specifically jimmy would need to get a copyright registration for his ape which knowing jimmy like i said an ore i said an ore or if or a denial if the copyright office says for whatever reason we're not going to give you a copyright registration that's also enough to go to court and say i own this copyright i should have gotten a copyright registration i can say okay okay cool but the the key piece there being there's work that he needs to do labor that he needs to do on his end before he can file a lawsuit so then this gets to if i file a copyright registration so that i can sue ryder for using my ape you know whatever in a derivative work how does it work if i want to sell this ape like if i now as an individual own that copyright registration does that transfer with the ape to the next person who buys it and then wants to sue somebody for it or do they have to re-register and my head's gonna explode depends on the terms of the sale welcome to the disconnect of hyper liquidity and reactive litigation yeah so yeah look there's what you're talking about here are dual registration systems so at the copyright office the copyright office has its own registry right and it doesn't really tap in there's no api between the uh copyright office registration system and the ethereum blockchain they haven't built that technology quite yet so remastered if you want if you want the next project yeah i don't even know [Music] jeremy when one when one exclusive license when an exclusive license passes from party a to party b in theory there's the copyright office has a system where you record a statement of transfer with the copyright office and so if the license were to transfer from one party the next like in theory there's a system to be able to do that i i need i need circles in the background yeah go ahead 17 that requires it to be in writing just well the trend the transfer of uh an exclusive license or uh of the an assignment of copyright speed okay we're going to go where max wants us to go after this one final sort of quite specific question and where max wants us to go is going to get into all of this because again this is now this broader very murky area that we're getting into around all of this the last very specific question i have for y'all is this tweet which i have pasted in our chat here but i'm gonna read it out it's from this the crypto funks uh you know twitter or crypto funks project which is in and of itself obviously controversial in all number of ways related to things we're talking about but they had this tweet and they said ip rights granted from purchasing or minting an nft are a hundred percent fake crypto funds are verified on openc why do you think the dmca didn't work and this is in reference to the fact that larval ads had previously dmca was like the term for they tried to get crypto funks delisted from open c claiming it was infringing on their their copyright so crypto funks is saying larval labs failed to get us de-listed from openc and that's because they don't actually own these ip writes and then the tweet goes on larva labs and you go labs themselves don't own the rights to the 10k individual images how could they possibly transfer them to you this strikes me it's just wrong on like a number of levels because they did at least originally happen two things it's also saying two things break this down uh against each other us and tell me if this makes any sense to y'all and if this is correct in any way yeah that yes i i i want to do an answer because i think i can't answer this um but i i really need to say i feel like a politician going back to a point here but i do need to go back to a point carly and here's the point there's an idea that judges have and for some reason i have this analogy first called judicial restraint which is when you're making a decision what a judge will often do is find the path of least resistance and say what is the easiest way what is the narrowest decision i can make in order to accomplish the decision i need to make and to make this determination if so the supreme court for example if the supreme court can avoid having to get into thorny issues of constitutional interpretation and there's a much easier way to dispose of a case they're going to do that and by the way that same principle of finding the narrowest path of least resistance is a mantra of effective litigators okay of which i am one a proud one and often i will choose causes of action not based on whether they have merit and not based on whether i have rights and not based on anything it's just what's the laser beam where this person has no good defense okay and so just because you know a party has a copyright claim doesn't mean that they necessarily want to assert it if they have a slam dunk trademark claim right so i just want to make that clear that just because somebody didn't assert a right is not any kind of acknowledgement admission that they don't have the right that they don't think they could win it just means well if i have a slam dunk way to get rid of this thing where the other person has no good defense in my opinion i might go that route and that's where undeniably writer rips fails right like the use of the logo the use of the name the use of the brand and the use of the phrase are clear unequivocal trademark infringements and clear violations of the trademark filings by yuga you could get into the semantics of the general generative work otherwise but i mean the laser beam has been shot i don't know how it survives to answer this question they're dealing with a lot the crypto funks issue is is mashing together a bunch of different concepts one is the idea that the dmca is any arbiter of rights is a complete fallacy okay dmca stands for the digital millennium copyright act and what we're dealing with here is alex has very rightly talked about title 17 and what we're talking about in title 17 is section 512 of title 17. that's the digital millennium copyright act and that is what sets forth the very famous notice and take down procedure that governs copyright on the internet and the way that procedure works is somebody says if somebody puts something up online that they think is infringing the copyright owner a person that claims of the copyright owner comes forward and says um hey service provider that's hosting this thing that's my copyright i want you to take that down the service provider then goes back to the poster and says hey poster i just received this notice what do you think and that poster has the right to put in a counter notification and say disagree it's fair use they don't own the rights i disagree with it and then it goes back the burden then shifts back to the original person that sent the notice to either file a lawsuit right or the service provider has the right to put it back online so what you're saying is like in this case it could be a scenario where larval labs was basically like we're not gonna this isn't worth us going to court over so we're not gonna file that response which allows it to go back onto openc even if larva labs had a proper original claim and all that all that means is that that the larva labs or you know at that point larval labs wouldn't have a claim against openc for for secondary copyright liability this isn't about this this whole thing is this is that's why this is this is one of the 10 reasons that this post is misguided and one of those reasons is this is about open seas liability as a platform as an intermediary as a place it's like because they don't want to be liable for infringing larval labs copy right we're just a platform but as long as they follow the safe harbor the procedures of the dmca they're in the clear and so if larval labs decided not to sue then like that's all that means okay well let's put some specifics just let's put some specifics on it there are reasons why you wouldn't follow through on the dmca procedure if you're going to file the lawsuit you have to file it in the district where the the platform is located you might not want to sue them there you might say you know what i'll let it go back up and i'm going to sue the infringer in a different location where i i'm it's closer to my home it's close to my office closer to my client i like the rules better any number of reasons why you might make that strong teaching or you pull it into federal court for interstate commerce but that's specific well no it's always okay it's always in federal court but where do you sell your rights to the labs right for the sake of uh timeliness i'm gonna move on from just that and just say part two of this answer is it also doesn't seem correct that larva and yuga themselves don't or didn't ever own the right to the 10k individual images clearly that's not true with a couple of asterisks which is that we don't actually know what the contract looked like between yugo labs and the artists they contracted so you know if that was weird sloppy language there's a chance but assuming all of that is buttoned up that part of this tweet is like patently untrue as well well yeah i think that tweets trying to get out it may be um i'm reading two in between the lines here but it could be begging the question is generative art subject for copyright that strikes me as way more advanced than this tweet is trying to get at i think you're giving them way too much credit right i'm not trying to give them credit i mean yeah yeah you could also say with the name as crypto funks it could be subject uh to parody uh as oh well that's what they claim this is a you know they're very they this is a whole long dispute between larva and crypto funks and crypto funks is very openly saying we're satirical we're parody et cetera um but that doesn't necess that doesn't change the fact that they owned this art originally and therefore have the rights to to confer the images to you or transfer the images to you okay final part of this oh go ahead go ahead garlic well i was just going to move us on in the last 10 minutes here and talk about these enforceability broader enforceability challenges that we've really been talking about throughout this episode jeremy you want to try and unless i i i wanted to i wanted to just talk about generative art generally generative art generally for a moment in terms of ip ownership because this is a critical question that by the way has little to nothing to do with non-fungible tokens and nothing to do with blockchain it has to do with digital art it has to do with the use of computers and um and artificial intelligence potentially and where the line is in terms of a human gaining copyright ownership over a work that uses a computer and this is a debate and an issue that has been going on since the 1960s at at least okay and i'm going to refer there was alex was uh talking about this earlier today there was just a decision by the copyright review board at the copyright office that said that a piece of art that was generated pretty much entirely by a computer without human intervention the copyright office said you know what we're not going to give a copyright to uh we're not going to give a copyright registration to that piece of art so this is a fascinating topic and i i want us to i want to bring you guys back on to go down this rabbit hole because the thing that it feels like the human wrote the code and that's the part of the craft of generative art if you're talking about like an art block scenario for example is is the writing of that maybe maybe the funny thing is the human's going to have a copyright in the code but right now they don't then have a right copyright in what's created by the code and the output in the output but here's here's what that review board decision quoted a uh quoted a publication from the 1960s um that when they were deciding how to deal with this issue back in the 1960s and i still think that that's the right test okay and the test is are you using the computer as a tool like who's doing the work is the computer doing the creative work or or is a human using the computer as a tool to create the work there's no seems to be no question that if i'm a digital artist and i'm using adobe adobe photoshop adobe illustrator and i'm using that very complex piece of computer software that i'm going to own the ultimate output of my work even though i'm using this very sophisticated piece of technology no way adobe is going to be able to claim that they own the output right but there's a line between that situation and a situation like they have i think at the copyright office now that's now by the way in federal court they filed a lawsuit about that which is the computer's kind of doing all the work and there's not much input from the human and so with generative art i think that when the raw materials are created by humans the elements the traits the base layers and there's real human creativity and all they're using is a piece of software to do some selection and arrangement i think that's more like adobe photoshop i think that all the creative juice all the creative juice of of apes punks a lot of these projects is coming from human beings and the fact that they're using uh a an algorithm that does some selection and arrangement maybe maybe selection arrangements something that could be debated but to me all that is is just adobe photoshop in a different form yeah i mean at what point if i have if i write an algorithm that says okay i drew my basic outline and now my algorithm is going to select the background the type of eyes whether it has an earring just some basic things and i've drawn all those options right let's say i've drawn the eight different types of eyes and i go computer throw you know roll the dice and throw one of the eyes that i drew on this on this piece of art how you know that does seem to be quantifiably different from me having just written a computer program that says create everything from scratch of course we want to make things even more confusing you know when adobe photoshop has ai-based tools when i go oh erase this person in the background of my photo that's using some level of ai and computer input so now i'm going to create a real mess here for all of us but that's a different we'll do a whole episode on this because that you know the the my emotional response is to want to defend you know tyler hobbs in this conversation as much as i can but i recognize uh this is a longer discussion for for a different time this i want to just close with these broader enforceability concerns that max has been raising throughout this episode and has raised previously and i want to put forward to a quote that i heard recently a guy named josh creamer who's setting up a protocol called be copy he said buying an nft is like buying a piece of paper with the address of the moma on it it doesn't mean you own the art at the moma i might be quite slightly misquoting him but that's the the general concept and he's of course referring to the fact that when you buy an nft you're buying a smart contract that in 90 whatever percent of cases points to a piece of art that is probably hosted on ipfs or you know you know hopefully aws hopefully ipfs and hopefully pinned by arweave you know etc etc but that the actual art itself is not in the smart contract and is not on the blockchain i would love to get your reaction to that as it pertains to just all of these kind of open questions about um what you really are own what you can transfer you know et cetera et cetera again you know this is one of those areas where people think that we've we've created this again i'm not saying the technology isn't amazing but like somehow we've just got completely off the reservation here people own artwork that they have stored in a different physical location all the time it's called freeports i mean there's any number of movies that involve we're gonna break into the safe where the artist kept this is different though right because if you're saying what you purchased was the smart contract and it points to something and the legal the legal tie between that is not in the smart contract anywhere well if i buy it well it could be if i buy a contract that says hey i'm transferring you to you ownership of this item just because i don't take physical possession of the item doesn't mean i don't own it we do that all the time and all sorts of other both real and into intellectual property okay fair enough but this is getting the it's getting at max that this is where you'll come in like it's getting at this question of like a lot of these legal rights are not actually conferred in the smart contract itself and they live in a terms and condition that live on the the project's website and i really think that's what he's trying to get at and it's the problem that i know he's trying to solve max it's the problem you and alex here are trying to solve which is how do we actually start embedding these legal rights into the smart contracts themselves so that there isn't this vagueness and max do you want to uh on that queue chime in with your thoughts yeah well there's i mean so just just initially talking i think i briefly briefly touched on it earlier you know the blockchain is this fantastic place for distributed ownership and it handles this concept of provenance of ownership of a token which points to some sort of asset extremely well so the concept of possession that jeremy was alluding to you know if i own this asset there's a you go to ether scan and you see a seamless record of every single transaction the purchase amount how this asset transfers from one or i should say how this token transfers from one holder to the next where there are some issues is where the actual asset is stored and the argument i've been trying to make is that ownership of a token is handled beautifully by the blockchain but all these other constituent components of what is represented by that asset or by that token whether it's an asset an image file it's really some sort of permission because if you know every single person that owns an nft every everyone else has access to the exact same image file but the issues around the legality of of how that file is actually stored how that file is actually transferred there's there's not um there's not much precedent for so the argument that i'm making is i guess from a value prop perspective which is yes possession on the blockchain is handled beautifully but the legal terms which define what you can or cannot do with your asset are held in these legal contracts so if i own a house and the blockchain basically says i own this house you know it's located at this specific place i purchased it for this amount but i can't actually utilize my house because the legal contract is subjectively held by you know alex and he's now able to change the permissions of me interacting with my asset subjectively willy-nilly whenever he wants what is the real value that i am imparting by owning this asset so once again it's asset ownership of the asset and permissions and rights associated to utilizing that asset and those two need to be intertwined in a distributed fashion in a decentralized fashion for web 3 to actually come into itself because if you have people buying assets to gain access to all of this utility that they're supposed to have you know as defined in the terms and conditions which are yes they're they're held on uh you know people's websites aw aws some of them are held on ipfs some of them you actually see a link in the metadata of the nft but i mean this sort of brings up a whole slew of enforceability in relation to transferring assets and the ascent the actual signature and awareness of buyers purchasing these assets but fundamentally if i'm buying something those legal terms should be should be defined at the time of sale i don't want you know i buy an asset i don't want alex to change the floors of my house because he's decided to at some later point in time that's not that's not property right so what you're you're getting at here is something that i want to push on this at the point of purchase piece which is something max you've brought up to me before which is okay there are these terms and conditions hopefully that live on the website for one of these assets for example you know the ugolabs website will have their terms and conditions for board apes but when i go to open c and i go to buy a board ape i'm at no point asked to interact with those terms and conditions i'm at no point asked to accept those terms and conditions as i would do when i get when i download itunes or any of the many times in our lives when we obviously have to sign tncs and what are the legal implications of that so i want to bring in you know jeremy and daniel and alex to kind of provide that legal perspective on like are we bound by none of these terms and conditions as buyers because we're never forced to actually look at these terms and conditions definitely not just i'll provide that uh simple answer we're definitely not bound by the terms and conditions but but the importance you definitely there are a nexus to being bound by the terms and conditions to those downstream buyers and there's well settled case law specifically for software so we are bound by the terms and conditions well think about it this way you can only if i buy something from you carly you can only sell me what you have so if you have some kind of limitation that you acquired when your original purchase you can't sell me something greater than what you have and so you know that's that's all you've got left to give to me and the question is what is that i i i so one i think there's i think there's an important sort of um higher level framework to talk about here and here's what i mean um one concept of nfts and terms and licenses is you have mothership which is issuing the project and then you have buyer a and buyer b right you have the buyer a who bought it at mint and then buyer b buys it on the secondary market one i one concept is you know the terms are it's kind of easy to establish privity meaning like a contractual relationship between buyer a who bought it at mint and and the and the issuer right the question is what about when it goes to b what i mean by framework is is a transferring rights or or licenses from a to b or is it the case that once a transfers their token to b their rights with a are sort of cut off and a new relationship is is or could be formed between directly between the mothership the issuer and b and there's not really i understand that they're sell the token from a to b but what about the license and the terms my my opinion just my own personal jeremy's opinion is better in this world to establish the relationship directly each time anew afresh between a and the mothership and b and the mother what what the question is though well it was easy at mint to create that privity of contract it was easy to create a click through you're presented there's a checkout like you you presented with the terms at the mint you agree to them you sign off no problem now often that doesn't happen but you're saying it would be easy to do that project you just need to start adding that when they meant it totally yeah totally murakami did it with their last um flower sale i will there are some issues to that as well but but fundamentally that that is something that remaster is squarely focused on something well i'm going to say that no i but the problem is what about the secondary what about the secondary sale yeah secondary sale yeah you could put maybe a link in the open c terms or you could do you know but but those are once those nfts are out in the wild you know you don't have to go through a secondary marketplace you could do a direct transfer so how do you possibly enforce that and that's where there's two things i would say one we need a we need a platform we need a solution that helps you know be able to create privity during those secondary sales situations and i think that's part of what i understand remastered to be doing the other thing i would say though is that if there's a license that's part of those terms right if part of what those terms are is you have the rights to go make commercial use let's say of this artwork or this this pfp and somebody down the line goes and takes advantage of that license i think it would be difficult for them to argue i'm not bound by the terms of this license because if they're taking advantage kind of what's good for the goose is good for the gander and if you're going to take advantage of ip rights or other privileges or benefits that flow from the license i don't think a judge in court is going to be like oh i never read the terms i don't know what they say you can't enforce them against me that by the way those are two that i wouldn't want to rely on that if i'm representing a brand and i'm representing a client i don't love that solution i think it's very imperfect that's why i think it is absolutely critical that we have infrastructure that allows there to be like definitive absolute unassailable privity in these situations for lots of different reasons but just as a legal nerd principle i'd say that they're in that situation there may be an argument well let's just assume jeremy that because because i i actually do understand that argument like you've clearly read you know the actual terms in order to be able to exercise some of these components of what are defined in the actual term so logically you would assume that that person understood and agreed to those terms but so let's just assume for the sake that that is enforceable now you have an nft owner exercising some of these terms because the logic of transferability is determined on the blockchain and there is no input of the actual legal intent in association to how that how that that digital asset should transact on the blockchain you now have this issue where someone could have the actual license because they had the legal enforceability the permission to do so and then as the blockchain is completely unaware of those permissions or those encumbrances of that asset now sell that asset to a downstream buyer and that downstream buyer is a not in privity with any of the initial people because of some of the enforceabilities that we spoke about but also doesn't understand that his nft is coming with certain encumbrances certain liens certain whatever it is associated to that asset so when you go to buy a house i don't bring up these housing allergies a lot but you go to buy a house you do a title check you make sure there are no additional claims associated to your house so you have this concept of title which is defined in contracts defined in course in decentralized entities and possession blockchain handles possession beautifully we all know that we all understand that but it becomes a very very murky situation i mean look at what happened with seth green and board ape um you know his asset was stolen and the the fisher ended up selling the asset to uh some downstream buyer who was completely unknown unaware of the of the issue so he is actually a good faith purchaser he purchased the asset in good faith and you know unbeknownst to him that it was actually stolen so there are issues in order for the space to grow into itself in order to actually scale beyond just what is happening right now which is pure liquidity because there's a real significant lack of enforceability and there are real issues in relation to how you actually retroactively enforce certain components when you can sell an asset a hundred thousand times in a week even if you had privity of all of those downstream buyers if there's no logic associated to the actual nft and the legal intent of that asset you could have a hundred thousand valid signatures associated to an asset transaction how do you litigate that a hundred thousand people who should have never purchased an asset to begin with so i unfortunately have to cut off this conversation though i promise you we will do a part two because we have not really gotten into the solutions here how can we because good teaser actually solve this issue is this an issue that's going to be solved at the platform level like an open c level or is it something that we can really solve at the smart contract level at a protocol level where do the solves come in so that'll be a lovely teaser for part two of this conversation but i just want to say i appreciate you all so much for coming on unpacking these very thorny complicated issues raising these very thorny complicated issues that do impact all of us who are in this space and who are in this space relying on these the utility pieces of of our assets including things like our rights so thank you all so much for joining i'm sorry to cut it short and uh thank you all next the authorization layer that's what remastered okay [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode
