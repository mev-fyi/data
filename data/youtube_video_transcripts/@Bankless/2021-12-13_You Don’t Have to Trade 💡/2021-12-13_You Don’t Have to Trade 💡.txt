people think when they come into this space that they just need to be a traitor so many people ask me like oh you're you're in crypto so you trade right like no no i'm i podcast i don't trade yeah it's so very very so true davidson you don't have to be a trader you don't it's like when you enter an rpg right it's like choose your character class you're gonna be the barbarian the warlock the necromancer oh are you gonna be the traitor are you gonna be the holder are you gonna be the builder are you gonna be the settler you get to pick and you don't have to pick the character class of the trader so many people default to that and it's actually like one of the hardest character classes to play i think one of the least rewarding in my opinion
