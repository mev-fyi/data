i'm just excited about next year i'm excited about 2022. excited about crypto bullish crypto david you believe that i'm bullish crypto yeah hey bankless nation it's friday morning happy new year to you well it's almost new year i guess it's uh new year's eve day that david and i are recording this uh and uh it's roll-up time david well actually i stole your thunder what time is it david oh it's roll-up time ryan thanks for stop following that one to me yeah i know it's time to roll up the whole entire year uh actually we already did that but this is going to be the last roll-up of 2021. we are covering the last two weeks so there's a lot to cram in but also it's one of those times of the year where there's kind of quiet so it might actually just be the same kind of length same rollup covering two weeks but about the same amount of stuff hopefully and hopefully we can get this done in a reasonable amount of time we were really really good at it last time we'll see if we can do it again so some of that stuff we're going to cover is shopify they just opened up their platform to nfts that's really cool it's also been like airdrop week for the past week and a half everyone's dropping coins uh you know i guess right before the the new year i don't i don't know why but we'll talk about some of those airdrops that are coming also the biggest protocol merger ever was just approved this week uh two big d5 protocols teaming up we've also got like old brands like radio shack they are entering the d5 space and uh yeah yeah good question we'll get into that and also jack dorsey versus web three a tesla on twitter i'm gonna talk about that too so a lot of things going on in the holidays as well and once again we will roll this up for you and talk about each of those with uh some additional things um before we do david let's talk a little bit about cash flow cash flow all right yeah so cash flow is like this defy otc desk uh what is an otc desk david and what does this protocol do yeah an otc desk is if you have a big trade if you're a trading firm or just you want something just to have your price be optimized an otc desk is where you go you throw them a bunch of money and then they get you back your trade back to you at an optimized price cash flow is that but as a defy app otc d5 so they work with they work with you to automatically get you the best price on your trade as well as things like mev resistance front running resistance and just a number of other things to make sure that you get the best price when you make your swap so you can check them out at app.hashflow.com that's pretty cool for whales too and rumor is they are issuing a token as well we'll get to that a little bit further in the roll-up uh all right david well let's talk about bitcoin as we get into the markets the markets this week for bitcoin and uh david why don't you give us like the the two weeks we usually do uh just one week but what's uh the the two weeks highs and lows look like yeah two week we started this uh two weeks ago at 48 000 we are currently at 47 300. so over two weeks we're down 700 with bitcoin hit a low of 46 000 hit a high of 52 000 overall down three percent over the two weeks just down three percent it felt like it was down more maybe that was because of uh either price has been down and it feels like a lot more what's uh the last two weeks been for ether yeah two weeks ago ether started at four thousand dollars hit a low of three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars a little bit surprising uh how low that got um it's it's high during that time period was four thousand one hundred fifty we are currently at three thousand seven hundred and fifty so overall down six percent over the two week period um my take on this is this is just low liquidity shenanigans uh this is the the end of the year all the traders and and market makers and all institutions that place bids and asks on on exchanges just you know they take a break too uh and so just the the markets are very very low liquidity in a low liquid uh state towards the end of the year and so this is a ripe opportunity for whales to play some whale games that i suspect that that's kind of what's going on here i don't really treat these numbers it's real i'm gonna wait until the first week of january to uh to actually re reaffirm the actual what the real prices are i feel like retail's taking some time off too like retail isn't really uh bidding these things up either they're just kind of letting it happen so maybe that's uh what's going on as well um but i'm i'm kind of glad that we're not ending the year in euphoria territory to be honest like i feel like this tees us up for next year and i'm anticipating a big year next year bullish going into 2022 how about you oh absolutely and you have the the one month chart pulled up on on ether right now and it's a bad one-month chart yeah that is bad actually starting the month at four thousand seven hundred dollars ending the month at three thousand seven hundred dollars so down a thousand dollars on the free month looks okay though three month looks great yeah so it's uh starting the three month at three thousand two hundred dollars hitting the high of four thousand eight hundred dollars and ending at three thousand seven hundred dollars uh just a a crab crab two months slightly up three months bearish one month overall just like a quieter market than what we have been used to so i think that's setting us up for a fantastic january well we're looking at let's look at the year 730 dollars at the start of um this year and uh now we're three thousand seven hundred so not not a bad way to uh to finish it um but also not euphoric right like things didn't get crazy last year so maybe we'll serve uh save some the craziness for next year how about the ratio what's that doing yeah ratio also down down with the market as well is down to 0.086 uh so kind of broke through that .08 number but still overall in a satisfying place if you uh believe in the flipping hmm do you believe in the flipping sir oh yeah definitely a core believer in the flipping founder of the flipping belief uh how about the bed index all right this is a third a third a third d5 bitcoin and ether uh we must be down on the two weeks uh we are down 18 on the one month the last two weeks have been flat or ish i think we're down at roughly six dollars from 141 to 135 where we are now okay there we go uh let's talk about decentralized exchanges though while we're on markets david because if you aggregate this and look over the year this has been an incredible year for decentralized exchanges over one trillion dollars in trading volume activity in 2021 absolutely phenomenal you can see this chart this is kind of the compilation uh you see a lot of uniswap here um from v2 and and v1 also sushi swap curve um there they're about 14 others kind of a long tail of dexa's uniswap by far the most dominant but what an incredible year for decentralized exchanges i remember not too long ago people said that decentralized exchanges would never take off right it's like because you couldn't host an order book on ethereum it was too slow um and that wasn't that long ago that was like you know 2017-2018 0x was trying to make it in that world and really just couldn't and now decentralized exchanges like they're just taken for granted but this is something that has uh totally burst onto the scene and what an incredible year one trillion in trading volume yeah dex is breaking through coinbase's volume numbers on a 24-hour or even a weekly basis is now like kind of feels like normal next volume numbers don't make big headlines anymore people are just assuming that they are the things that just carry us into the future when it comes to markets yeah so i mean the next milestones to breaker it's like nasdaq right yeah it's like wake me up when dexes are bigger than the nasdaq and and um you know uh new york stock exchange i'm not gonna call that okay i got my predictions but that's not one of them yet um not for 2022. uh let's talk about urine finance so this is the why the yfi token the protocol behind the yfi token it had a pretty good week despite d5 collectively being down soared over 85 percent one week and the reason is token economic changes okay governance put together a few ways to juice the wi-fi token or to uh deliver more value to to token holders one of those ideas that went forward through governance is the ability to stake yfi tokens in exchange for xyfi tokens and then holders would receive additional wi-fi and urine would buy that wi-fi in the open market so it's almost like an open market operation in exchange for a staking wi-fi they also are considering implementing a model that's based on curve finance where the more you wi-fi you lock up the um the greater rewards that you get in in wi-fi tokens as well there are a number of other things but i think the big takeaway here is like um this is sort of what we anticipated every every token protocol is very much incented through its government process to start capturing the value that's accrued by its protocol by its token and sometimes this happens during bear markets this will also happen during during bull markets but every defy token is going to do this this is why i'm not worried about token value capture long term as long as it's governed by individuals with a profit incentive and they all are uh what are your thoughts on this david yeah there's this inevitable friction behind the value that a protocol offers to the ecosystem and then the actual valuation of the token on the secondary markets those things those things are separate things and the field the domain of knowledge that we are calling tokenomics is about how do we get those things more aligned how do we get those things to overlap rather than be separate and urine has really struggled with this throughout 2021 where i think it's more or less been flat versus the dollar and then absolutely got smashed versus eth in 2021 just because the tokenomics were a point of contention as people people would consider urine a very valuable protocol offering a very valuable service and the value of the token would could not capture that value and so naturally as ether has like you know 5x and urine has stayed stayed flat why api is 8 flat there's a growing incentive for the for everyone to figure out like all right how do we more closely align the value of the protocol with the value of the token so this is an attempt at that there's a little bit of like pumpamentals or ponzinomics in here but kind of that's that's what tokenomics are how do we align the value of the protocol with the value of the token on the secondary market and these changes created an 85 percent wi-fi price increase and so the market so far seems to agree that these are good changes yeah absolutely i do think other tokens are going to do this as well so uh this is the this is the final form the final state of all d5 tokens uh guys we will be back with the releases of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbetrom you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many d5 applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemixv2 and to get involved in governance all right guys we are back with the releases of the week let's start with this one shopify plus nfts shopify massive e-commerce protocol platform plus nfts the ability to sell nfts just spin up a shopify store and sell your own nfts that is coming that is now here what do you think about this david yeah on their page they say mint and sell your own branded nfts with shopify and shopify payments right from your store join the nft beta program today so shopify already out of the box has like half a half of an nft platform ready to go all that's missing are the actual nfts and seems like that's what's here today now uh and so shopify already a digital ecommerce store like integrating digital products into your digital ecommerce store seems pretty trivial as far as things go uh and so it seems like they're they're diving head first into nfts the url for this is shopify.com nft uh so relatively easy if you wanna go check that out yeah it's it's super cool there's so many wins for existing like web 2 platforms in the nft movement and this is just another win and this provides another fiat on ram directly to nfts so it serves consumers as well bullish that great to see shopify diving in i mean they're absolutely massive and they've grown like crazy recently uh david let's talk about the browser game so opera is doing a big move here what are they up to opera the browser of course yeah opera is integrating polygon polygon applications and the matic token are integrated directly into the browser coming in q1 so like in two days um uh well q1 starts in in two days i don't know if it coming in two days sometime in q1 and they say get ready to benefit from the fast scalable nofi environment of polygon and access over 3000 apps on the polygon network so polygon integrated right into opera which is a pretty interesting choice because you know polygon isn't everything about crypto there's stuff elsewhere but opera has decided to not integrate ethereum not integrate you know arbitrary optimism just only select polygon for now um pretty interesting choice um but uh definitely makes sense because you know you got to have something scaled in there uh so but congrats to the polygon team and and also really awesome to see opera moving forward into the web3 world and i wonder what this integration will look like i know it's it's particularly aimed at their their mobile device and i know opera has a wallet as well so i wonder if this is just like a seamless browser to adapt to defy app sort of experience inside of the inside of your mobile browser and if so like that's awesome that is uh that is super bullish i've been looking for like more seamless integration between crypto native applications and the browser like right now we're doing it through extensions and third parties but like what if it was completely integrated if it was just there's there's no need it there's no a fundamental need for it to be like a whole separate application inside of a browser like it could be part of a browser and i wonder if this is what opera is pushing towards love to see chrome firefox the other browsers uh follow suit but they seem a little sleepy compared to opera opera is like hungry for market share right absolutely let's talk about this david uh clarity dao this is a new coordination and information management tool for dallas lots of dow infrastructure being built out these days this is a way for dao contributors to solve the access control problem so it's the ability to i think you know segment cert access to certain things within a dao to an ethereum username so if there's some piece of content on a web page or maybe there's there's a discord server and only certain white listed dow participants should have access to it i think this provides a way to provide access control and and segment that access to particular ethereum username so it's sort of a sign in with ethereum type of application here specifically targeted at dals yeah it sounds like it's a google g suite like uh some admin management tool uh with you know permissions and lets you access different parts of the drive but instead of the drive now it's the dow um makes sense yeah it makes sense and uh good to see that stuff being built out um parachains also officially launched on the polka dot network david what is uh what is this about yeah paratrains are polka dots big that's their big thing that's their big innovation kind of some sort of hybrid between uh sharding and roll-ups but built inside of polka dot it's been the the flagship uh feature of polkadot since uh since inception uh and now it's finally here so congrats to polkadot five pair chains went live i think of these sort of as rollups what's interesting about these is um you actually have to the pair chains actually have to bid for a slot they're not just like you can't uh permissionlessly just start using polka dot you actually have to bid in dot tokens for one of these slots and so these first five pair chains that that successfully bid they went live all told it cost about 99 million dots i believe that was garnered by these five projects during the auction period that's 2.4 billion dollars not sure all of the details how that works but it's definitely a different and interesting mechanism as compared to ethereum roll-ups um david what's this bitmex is announcing a token okay i thought bit max was the anti-token what are they doing here yeah for those that came into crypto in 2021 you might not be familiar with with bitmex it has a pretty long track record bitmex is a centralized exchange for uh margin and leveraged trading it's it's kind of been known to be like the casino uh just like where people just go a hundred x long on bitcoin and inevitably get wrecked or not or maybe or they get riches it was like david it was like the d-gen playground before d5 became the d-gen playground yeah yeah that's exactly right yeah before before d5 and then also before binding smart chain kind of took over the casino thing um but yeah bitcoin it was famously bitcoin only for the longest time arthur hayes uh was like on on the run from i think the cftc or the arthur hayes the founder of bit max there's a long back story um ever since uh bit mex ended up getting um i'm not sure like charges from the cftc or some three-letter agency they've kind of taken a new uh turn new turn and what was formerly a very like bitcoin centered ecosystem is now issuing a token which like previously was blasphemous coming from uh the the leaders behind bitmex but now bitmex has a token it's basically a loyalty token um some sort of like kind of like airline miles but specifically for the bit max exchange uh so the bmx token is out and live the interesting thing is like why not right i mean like why not issue a token and and see what happens i guess uh that that's their play on it and i think they're they're trying to revive some retail interest right so give some retail users a reason to continue using bitmex and compete against the ftx's of the world and the finances of the world who've really taken center stage over the last couple years and leapfrogged bitmex uh let's talk about this so hashflow is issuing a token as well we were talking about hashflow earlier in the uh introduction that's that otc d5 protocol what are they up to here david yeah they're issuing a token so if you have traded on cash flow or contributed to the community and early on uh do you own a hashbot nft for example uh then you might have the hft token uh and so that's the cash flows governance token and will be able to free to claim uh towards the end of january uh and so stay tuned if you are a hashful ecosystem participant you might have a token coming your way at the end of the month there you go uh more fiat on ramps to arbitrarium this one from huobi who is a centralized exchange now they are allowing deposits and withdrawals for eth directly to and from arbitrariums kind of cool what are your thoughts here yeah knocking them down we need more more and more and more i this is good news and i want 50 more news items like this over the next like month it's coming though in 2022 right like including coinbase that's the big one i've been waiting for yep coinbase about coinbase q1 2022. okay is that a prediction is that official david hoffman's addiction that's enough god the last time i did this i did not end well certified fresh yes david officials david hoffman prediction coinbase uh on and off ramps onto an ethereum layer two in q1 2022. there you have it folks he took the bait we got him now i'm texting him i'm texting brian right now he's like brian please please brian tweet outstanding okay raises this week alexis ohanian and polygon they're investing a cool 200 million dollars in decentralized social media alexis ohanian the co-founder of reddit of course venture capitalists he's coming on bank list a couple weeks we're going to ask him about this but uh what's up with this news what's going on yeah there's a lot of just excitement and energy around decentralized social media platforms while the details on what that means and what that is is still fuzzy uh regardless people are still working on them ave is working on this polygon is working on this um i mean it would be huge for any ecosystem to be like the thing that figured out decentralized social media so there's obviously a lot of reward there for whoever can crack that nut uh and it makes sense for alexis ohanian to be right there he's the guy that created reddit um which is the most you know kind of like it's reddit itself isn't decentralized but it kind of looks and feels like it right with all the subreddits uh and so it's really really cool 200 million dollars in the war chest to build out some sort of decentralized social media and in a time where we kind of really need it right now ryan we're going to talk a little bit more about that later yeah absolutely have you seen any decentralized social media that uh that you've liked so far like i've tried big clout a little bit and it's just been kind of meh you know i mean i don't even know what like decentralized social media what does that mean like what does the decentralization how does that impact the social media aspect nature of it yeah i don't know i just it's always been my gut that it's not going to look like the social media platforms of the past it's not going to get instagram but decentralized that's not going to be exactly it's got to be something different i i do think that there's something here but you can't just slap decentralization on the thing and call it uh decentralized social media so we'll see what they have in mind but it's good to see the innovation um talk about this figment they reach the unicorn status wow everyone's a unicorn these days with a 110 million dollar series c figment is a staking services provider they've got some big investors in the round here including binance what i think is interesting here is david there are there are a number of um probably a couple dozen or so staking service providers figment is one of the larger one there's there's chorus one there's a number of others one called staked was just acquired by kraken we'll talk a little bit about that but interesting to see these just pure staking as a service companies uh accruing such massive valuations so quickly what are your thoughts yeah it's just being a unicorn is just not the same this this day and age not not after we printed like a bajillion dollars in 2020. uh this is going to be a huge story it already is a huge story but even bigger going into 2022 is staking proof of stake staking uh it was felt like uh 2021 was the year of staking anticipation 2022 is the year of actual staking and seeking services being coming into their full production ready environment because of all the changes that are also coming in to production ready staking uh and so uh just some of the evaluations on figment stakes and all these other protocols um starting to make a lot of sense well this this wouldn't have happened in my opinion without like alt layer one season completely taking off right it's like because um many of these networks they're semi-active in eth2 staking but not really their bread and butter is like the cosmos ecosystems the solana ecosystems of the world all of those uh alternative layer ones the ecosystems that the individual has a hard time staking on yeah weird how companies to start to feel that niche huh kinda right and uh you're gonna take on that when it comes to news when we talk about steak but we'll save that for the new section uh b protocol they just did a raise 2.2 million dollars what's d b protocol david yeah b protocol came out of uh the black tuesday was black tuesday black thursday black thursday last thursday yeah when uh the crypto markets got cut in half by like 50 55 such a distant memory yeah that's right you remember that yeah ryan we were recording uh bankless podcast number two that day yeah yeah we stopped the podcast and we're like oh my god eath gas fees are like 1200 or something right and everyone's getting what's happening yeah so what happened on that day was maker dow had zero die liquidations as in people would pay zero die to bid on the collateral because gas congestion was so high uh no one no one other no one else's bids on underwater maker vaults uh were were going through because gas was so high and also by the way that was novel for the time like gas fees had started to creep up but gas feeds were still not a thing back in february of 2020 like gas on ethereum was still relatively cheap at that point uh so having gas congestion was uh very new to ethereum and turns out that created an unprecedented scenario with regards to liquidations uh as what happened with uh maker dow so like maker dow got had eight million dollars of collateral that was purchased for zero die which is a problem uh and so b protocol is a solution for this it is basically like a protector around your faults your compound position your maker position and it when you deposit into maker or compound through b protocol it gives you a like a wrapper of protection it gives b protocol the right to liquidate you before anyone else and so b protocol is a dow that is going to liquidate you at from the most favorable rates without gas fees and you can take part in the liquidation or to have your your positions be protected by b protocol uh really just a great effort here as well uh disclaimer ryan and i are in this angel investment round very cool all right david let's talk about jobs hey it's a new year just about anyway it's time to consider a job in crypto a new job new job new year new job new outlook on life uh you've been listening to bank list for a long time how about getting a job in crypto um hey no regrets for me man i jumped  ship full-time in 2017 my corporate job uh and it's been absolutely awesome i had no idea what i was going to do next and uh in crypto you just kind of figure it out right like you meet the community you figure out your niche and you go develop it growing industry tons going on here are some of the jobs this week uh first a senior software engineer i'm gilded a founding full stack engineer a founding full stack engineer that's awesome utopia labs senior ios engineer senior back-end engineer at smart d5 community ecosystem lead dydx bitwise still has some positions open nft specialists smart contract platforms and web 3 research analysts crypto research analyst governance specialist as well at bitwise ahead of growth at dex guru check that out for you marketing types technical lead draftly blockchain developer you got to be specialized in rush rush rust at um solytics as well and we could go on a ton of different jobs for you you can check those out bankless.pallet.xyz grab a job in crypto this year grab a drop in crypto ryan shall we get to the airdrops because there was a lot of them news time airdrops time yeah let's hit them there's like there's like five or six or maybe seven david but we're gonna hit like the three that are good ones yeah yeah the three that are you know kind of worth claiming maybe uh why don't you start with this one sos token so here's the headline open dow's sos token hits a 250 million dollar market cap despite unclear goals and security risks unclear goals and security risk man does that not just sound like the start of the very beginning of a total air drop sounds about par for the course yeah what's your white paper unclear goals and security risks the sos token is basically open c but decentralized but a dow is what they are claiming to be so if you ever bought sold nfts bought nfts on on openc you might have an sos token airdrop to you i had my sos token i think i got like .6 ethers worth of sos tokens um haven't done anything with them there you go who knows uh maybe maybe selling for either one of them that just means david hasn't had time to sell yet how about uh this next air job because that's you know one of three that we're gonna highlight what's this one yeah this is from giveth giveth has been around ethereum for a really long time if anyone has listened to the layer zero with griff green he talked about giveth uh if you have participated in the giveth economy you might have an airdrop you can check that out at dot g-i-v-e-t-h dot io um giveth is uh something that's been uh trying to spread out money and wealth into the different corners of the world both with giving grants and uh trying to spin up the giving economy uh and so yeah definitely check out that layer zero with graffiti especially if you want to like get a front row seats for the dao and what happened there um and then after that we talked about giveth this is a responsibility token guys a valueless responsibility token so the power to vote uh a cool claim process too i went through and i claimed and you can claim on x die so cost no gas in order to do that so you can plug in your ether address and check to see if see if you are a potential recipient uh why don't you do this last one too david yeah this one is gas dow have you spent more than one thousand five hundred and fifty nine dollars on gas you might recognize that number you can go claim your gas tokens if you have spent more than one five five nine dollars on gas um what it does and why it exists absolutely no clue um but you can claim a proportional amount of gas tokens to how much you have spent on gas um yeah i'm i'm selling that one 15 5 9 though like those are rookie numbers man how much how much gas have you spent oh my god a lot it also depends right it's like on what value like right is it the value of the snapshot what dollar value because if you spent you know some ethon gas a couple years ago that that it was pennies at the time yeah spent pennies at the time that could amount to like dollars you know hundreds of dollars even uh today so that's a pain have you ever plugged one of your addresses into like yeah how much gas have i spent i don't like to do that too much yeah i never do that i still want to know this is i don't want to know uh let's talk about this ethereum news test net is out the test net for the merge the long-awaited merge fork uh kinsugi is the test net and uh this is a post from the ethereum dot org website from tim baco as well um this is just another step towards getting the merge uh into production on mainnet hopefully coming in the first half of next year we'll have to see though uh any thoughts on this yeah this is where we do mark mock merges mock merges we also talked about this with vitalik buterin on the podcast that's coming out on monday uh all about the future of the ethereum roadmap and more uh so stay tuned for that yeah that was a good podcast man we just recorded that earlier today um yeah good stuff in that podcast make sure you check that out um dave this was huge too this happened uh during the holidays well it didn't happen during the holidays but the news came out during the holidays of a critical polygon bug that put 24 billion dollars in matic tokens at risk basically all the matic tokens like not quite but like 92 percent or something like this uh what happened here yeah there was a an exploit in the token contract i think uh this is kind of hard for me to parse the parks i'm not a developer but the token itself had an exploit which is now patched there is nothing left at risk all all fallout has already happened uh uh black hat attackers did manage to to hack uh get away with eight hundred thousand dollars i believe uh worth of matic tokens but uh in contrast to the 24 billion that was at stake that's basically nothing um two two white hackers were paid out many millions of dollars i think 3.3 million dollars for the white hacker that discovered the bug and then helped patch it um and so this is now in the rear view mirror it's unfortunate that happened in the first place also very nice that we are paying white hackers millions of dollars to discover these things that's right yeah what was the reward here this was huge right it's like 3.4 3.3 million dollars yeah yeah in magic tokens yeah uh and so yeah real real close call with the with the whole matic thing right right that happened in the last couple weeks yeah and this was um this all happened and was resolved on like i think december 5th or something but news just came out this week they like they quietly like patched that and then issued the news uh a few weeks later um taking care of that i mean it goes to show you like uh there can be zero day bugs in some of this stuff yeah even with um thousands and hundreds of thousands of of users and billions in in value even with billion dollar networks yep let's talk about this this is probably the biggest uh protocol merger being proposed in history and it was just passed by governance rari capital and fey protocol token holders approving a mil multi-billion dollar defy merger what's happening yeah on the surface this kind of seems like what is a borrowing and lending protocol which is rari why are they being acquired by or merging with a a stable coin protocol which is fey uh on the surface doesn't make much sense from uh i haven't unpacked this myself but the people that i listen to in this ecosystem are very very bullish on this partnership there's a bunch of aligned incentives here uh and this has also been adopted overwhelmingly by both sides there was a a it was basically on both faye and rory had like 90 to one or or yeah 90 to 1 approval uh with regards to the token votes for saying yeah everyone's a big fan of this there was some criticism about this how hasty this was from some community members that was definitely a critique but overall i think this is going to be a great alignment and sentence for over the long term i actually want to hear the story here um i think we should get faye and somebody from faye and somebody from rari on the podcast to just like discuss like why this is happening and what the benefits are for both both parties at least somebody who can dissect this for me because i haven't quite followed it but um it seems like it could be a very big deal and maybe a harbinger of things to come more of these protocol type mergers in the future that was a formal request by the way for all the listeners out there jay from rory and somebody from faye come on bankless we'll host you guys and talk about this um consensus it's collaborating with mastercard on a new ethereum scaling solution they're built using consensus roll-ups what is this david so this is the old consensus quorum which used to be a side chain i believe they might now be folding it into a roll up this this quorum was previously sold to jb morgan jp morgan and then bought back by consensus from jp morgan and now is i think consensus is now positioning it as a stablecoin payments protocol that's a little bit something a little bit closer to um ibm's hyperledger than it is to an open public permissionless blockchain which is i think probably the right foundation for something like cbdc where you know permission gets controlled by private public partnership uh and there's actually somebody to call if something goes wrong uh but uh consensus moving forward with uh you know uh institutional stablecoin cbdc stuff yeah it's cool that mastercard is involved here too it's like visa has a massive play in crypto and mastercard has some catching up to do and i've started to see them trying to catch up in the back half of 2021 and i expect they'll they'll continue to ramp it up um david let's talk some meme stocks man well i guess maybe not meme stocks but like meme tokens or old brands becoming tokens radio shack is pivoting to d5 apparently so radio shack uh two guys bought it in 2020 and i assume they just purchased it for like nostalgia reasons for for the name obviously there are no radio shack stores that i'm aware of anymore at least you know all all the malls i've seen no longer have radio shacks but i feel like this pivot to d5 is sort of a an asking to become a meme stock right it's kind of like following um gamestop following uh amc some of these older brands that have some retail nostalgia and pivoting into a new and interesting space maybe that's just the skeptical take maybe there's something really here i guess their plan is to provide a bridge between defy and um larger corporations the world's corporations but it also seems very uh vague to me what here what's your take on this i think this is just a bunch of hot air do you remember in 2017 when um the arizona ice tea company added blockchain to their name formally and then the stock price went up right stock price like doubled like overnight in the middle of the ico mania i think that's this is that's something closer to what's happening with with radio shack some people just bought the defunct radio shack brand slapped defy on it and now they are just dancing it around radio shack d5 radio shack defy and now people like you and me are talking about it i think that's what's going on yeah probably so i mean that's that's that worries me a little bit because uh that was a top signal in 2017 so but you know like top signals are different every single time in the market but here's another one a dow wants to buy blockbuster and turn it into a decentralized film streaming service is this more of the same yeah same kind of energy uh i mean they just want to make a they would want to buy the blockbuster brand and have it turn into some sort of dow related streaming service um again i think this is just a headline and i will wait for this to turn into something real before i expend any more brain power on it but aren't memes real david not without fundamentals ryan good answer sir uh let's talk about this speaking of memes so a meme made it onto jeopardy constitution style is not a meme that's not a meme i mean you don't think it was a meme is tons of meme energy behind that we're gonna we're gonna form a dow to buy the constitution nothing's more memey behind that they were actually able to raise some money so i guess maybe or fundamentally maybe there's something there there's maybe some fundamentals there anyway the jeopardy question from alex trubek was billionaire hedge fund ceo ken griffin outbid a group of crypto enthusiasts and paid 43 million for a copy of the seminal american document the answer of course is what is constitution dao well actually no the answer is what is the constitution of the united states of america that's absolutely not actually a part of this that's right bummer okay i misread the answer hoping it was constitution dao yeah it was just um [Music] sorry alex you're back i'm sorry my apologies sir uh all right moving on let's talk about paris hilton getting on the eth leaderboard yeah so there's a there's a website uh that tracks the most followed uh twitter handles that have dot youth following them and paris hilton is now up there as well a few other ones came in uh uh who was it oh yeah shaq shaq and paris hilton are palace hilton's coming in at number one at 16.8 million followers so paris hilton dot eth on twitter shaka.eth at 15.5 million we also have trace songs that's new to me oh he's got a board ape uh 13.8 million uh and then coming in fifth is our friend vitalik metallic is number five yeah unseated big time coming in at a mere 3 million followers look i mean he's going to be booted out of the top 10 before long it won't it won't take much uh mainstream is coming to uh youth domains david i'm i'm sure you're somewhere around here right yeah you're right you're on here you're on here we're all in here i think uh not for long we're not going to be on the front page for a long time we have a hundred thousand followers yeah we're up there somewhere there you go we're somewhere but you know it's cool to see mainstream i guess joining the the ether club um mainstream's also joining board apes so board apes just flipped crypto punks i believe this is briefly or has it been persistent i don't know i haven't really uh paid attention but that that was a flipping that some nft holders were predicting for quite some time and it actually happened david i know you're a crypto punk holder so what's your take on this yeah the uh this is the regards to the floor the floor price so the floor price of board apes is at 59 uh east right now uh and i'm pulling up the cred the crypto punks floor pla uh four ply oh my gosh floor price which is clocking in at 65.88 so crypto punks have reclaimed the higher for price um but i i i brought this in the predictions uh article that we haven't released yet uh two weeks ago that i did say that board apes are probably gonna flip punks just because they're i think they're they have so much more surface area they're newer it's hard they have the momentum uh they're just kind of in pulp culture so i mean board apes one of the big stories of 2021 is definitely the board apes are they doing different things versus um crypto punks like are they picked crypto books are like the bitcoin of nfts they don't do anything and like okay there was a theory that like you know bitcoin actually needs to pay for security and crypto punks don't and so like crypto punks can work where bitcoin is like the fat the fat crypto punk thesis exactly yeah yeah yeah we'll see how well that plays out into 2021 but crypto bonds are definitely more of a crypto native ethereum native type of nft and the board apes are have reached into new horizons and board apes are still building right like they're still doing things they're adding utility to the board apes and that nevertheless yeah that's interesting uh snoop dogg got in as well david so he just aped and this is from his main account not his uh not his medici account uh looks like he's got four i know yeah one actual board ape two mutant board apes and then a boarded kennel club as well oh man that's crazy you know what i'm waiting for though this is this this graph right here david uh speaking of flippings look at this yeah so first the apes past the kryptopunks and then long term real long term this might be like years in the making the turtles come to dominate i'm pretty sure that's like at the end of this year that had that green spike is like for tomorrow ryan no no no this is a dot dot dot you know who knows that timeline just kind of like this could take thousands of years david you know turtles move at the speed of turtles that's how it goes turtles at the speed of turtles adidas they just sold 22 million dollars in nfts that's crazy man so what are they doing here yeah they sold 30 000 nfts at point 2 east each and they all sold out which is nuts made they made 22 million dollars they also did this right uh they they got into the nft influencers they bought a board ape uh put on an adidas jacket on their board put it as their profile picture started doing and did nfts right and so look what happens when you do nfts right as a company you get 22 million dollars in revenue it's crazy they've got to be so happy about that and other brands have got to be following um i wonder who the buyers of these things are do you think this is more mainstream or do you think this is like i can't this can't be the traditional crypto and i thought it'd be mainstream even though like 750 dollars for an adidas nft like mainstreamed ready to cough that up that was kind of confusing that's sort of surprising but yeah good for them success success by the way uh the weekend is releasing an nft as well on tom brady's platform his platform called autograph this is a blinding lights single that is inspiring seven nfts that are gonna be auctioned on open c so now we have mainstream artists entering the fray as well that's been a story that uh has been continuing to develop over the course of the year nfts are for everyone and we're just gonna see you two celebrity more more celebrities all throughout 2022 so get used to it get used to it um should we get used to facebook being called meta i'm finding that hard to get used to okay but like let's call them meta here's the facebook cto promising deep compatibility between what meta is doing in the metaverse and blockchain um i guess they're bullish web 3 at least that's what they're saying what do you think about this yeah deep compatibility is not uh what i want it to be which is built on top of compatibility implies two things coming together where the metaverse significantly needs to be built on top of a decentralized protocol so nice try meta not not a fan but i mean they're gonna you know they they have to actually actually onboard crypto assets crypto monies nfts anyway so i mean this isn't anything i surprised this messaging is expected do you think they still think that they can become like a blockchain killer do you think they think they are the metaverse or what do you what's what do you think they're trying to do here they are probably at the very least trying to become people's first metaverse like hey you want to get into the metaverse start with facebook um they i think they know they can't capture the whole entire thing because that's antithetical um but if they can cat like it's just it's just a fight for mindshare it's funny because it's something i'm still not worried about at all like i still think they don't have a shot at uh competing against like the property rights and you know strong settlement guarantees of crypto networks and they will have to provide deep compatibility with them in order to execute on their strategy so i'm not worried about facebook long term uh and its threat on web3 let's talk about jack he's got a different perspective on web3 jack dorsey the former ceo of twitter he of course stepped down a few weeks ago that was a big story when we talked about it but uh he's pretty anti-web three it seems like what what's this meme that we're looking at david jack dorsey's been anti everything that's not bitcoin basically from as long as i can remember everything in crypto yeah everything in crypto is not bitcoin jack's not a fan of it uh and uh he's explained some of his reasoning why but it boils down to the same old arguments that he thinks that nothing other than bitcoins actually decentralized and everything else is just a cash grab so he retweeted a a comic that has a pipe just flowing water into the mouth of silicon valley vcs meanwhile there's a very famished looking retail investor that is under a small small small hole in the pipe just getting some drops just as few drops uh and so all the value of web3 what jack is claiming is he's retweeted this with a with a 100 emoji he's claiming that web3 is just putting all the value into silicon valley vcs and implying that you know web 3 is just this vc created you know way to make a bunch of money just overall very like cynical and skeptical on the the fact of the idea of web 3 at all um i have my opinions on this uh jack follows this up and and says you don't own quote web3 the vcs and their lps do it will never escape their incentives it's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label know what you're getting into uh so wow some pretty harsh words coming out of jack dorsey founder of twitter about about the whole entire concept of web 3. uh i've got my thoughts ryan what do you think well yeah i mean i i think harsh and wrong right so like the idea that vcs are the owners of of web 3s i think this is particular to um to some protocols right some uh d5 protocols maybe governance protocols you could say vcs own uh some of those but um you know at its core something like ethereum which is actually depicted in this meme is not vc owned it's really interesting that there were no vcs as part of the original um sale of ethereum like for one here's belashi saying ethereum raised zero dollars from vcs as kind of a comment on this and i mean that's true also vcs do not control ethereum i mean like if you think vcs control ethereum then you have to apply those same rules to up to bitcoin and say like whales and vcs control bitcoin but like they don't they don't control ethereum they don't control bitcoin so the entire assertion is uh is false maybe he's like focusing on some sliver or some subset of web3 that like we have criticized as well as being kind of overly whale or vc owned you know the binance chains of the world you make the case for that you make the case for some like d5 protocols you could make the case maybe for some elements of um you know alternative layer ones but i think it's unfair to categorize all of web 3 as being completely owned by uh by vcs what's your take apparently if you were following the story very very in depth that there that um jack was really going after uh a16z and address and horowitz specifically apparently has a bone to pick with them uh i think that's kind of what's going on under the hood makes more sense but overall there's been a ton of investment a tunnel a ton of deal flow into a ton of web 3 platforms web 3 protocols that are happening right now so maybe this critique is more about 2021 web3 and not like maybe the foundations of it you know how ethereum didn't raise any money from vcs maybe he's talking about more about the app that have raised money recently um but there's still some some big big things that we need to parse apart here first off the comic of all this value flowing into vc's mouth and then the retail just only getting droplets we have to remember where we came from because before web 3 it was absolutely nothing into retail it would oh it would go straight into vcs and you would never even hear about it so the fact that we are even complaining about this just tells you how much web3 actually has moved the needle retail didn't even have an option or even knowledge about how to complain about not having deal flow from early stage startups now that we actually have a taste of a taste of it because of web 3 now we actually put up a fight about like hey don't give all the money to vcs you got to give something retail too so first off there's that like the overton window has already shifted to the point where we are allowed to complain about this in the first place did you see the second one by the there's goddamn airdrops what are airdrops except for giving tokens and value towards users the uniswap airdrop the ens airdrop the gitcoin airdrop all the airdrops every single airdrop you've ever gotten you didn't even have to invest you just had to use it you did the vcs had to invest money the users just had to use it for free and so there's a great meme of somebody crying with wiping their their tears with 100 bills and the caption is me with my ens airdrop after jack said web3 only makes money for vcs to me like this is one of those things that like it's actually so incredibly the opposite of what jack is saying that is kind of dumbfounding it's like it's go he somehow jack went full circle and said like web 3 is all about giving money to vcs it's literally the opposite it is literally about how much how can we make our users wealthy that is what web 3 is yeah i agree with that there's also another comment from blaji he says i respect everything you built talking to jack but i also disagree here twitter started as a protocol the free speech wing of the free speech party then corporate and political incentives led to de-platforming and censorship web 3 offers the possibility not a guarantee of something better turning twitter into a protocol something that uh unfortunately jack was not able to accomplish during his tenure at twitter um he says he follows up of course i don't believe twitter set out to bait and switch developers or promise free speech get people to invest using their profiles then censor them but that is where the incentives landed upon web 3's smart contracts may prove more durable than web 2's social contracts this is what i also fundamentally don't understand about jack's take is web3 offers a solution to the things that jack um you know claims are his values which is you know values of of free speech and minimization of censorship resistance so i don't know it's ongoing back and forth between jack dorsey and uh the web 3 and crypto community um i guess my invitation would be this to to jack is like i think the community wants a longer conversation about this with you jack like do you are you rejecting the vc definition of web3 or are you rejecting the entire premise of web3 like that's a question that i think we have do you see bitcoin as web3 i mean the way you and i define web3 david it's kind of synonymous with crypto and so if you say you hate web3 then do you also hate bitcoin also ethereum is like very close to bitcoin from a values perspective right it's like vitalik has called it moderate bitcoin values and i really feel like that's the case so why the hate for ethereum all of the time that's the discussion we want to have with jack dorsey uh of you know on the bankless podcast dms are open man so uh you know come on let's talk about it let's hash it out uh ray dalio someone else we want to get on the podcast i've been listening to a lot of ray dalio podcasts actually over the past week or so break um but apparently he says crypto should be part of a diversified portfolio this is new in 2021 he wasn't saying this in previous years this is new for ray dalio of course uh billionaire hedge fund investor fantastic insights on long-term macro trends have a lot of respect for him now he's coming around to crypto it seems any thoughts here yeah i think i would classify ray dalio in 2020 and 2021 is cautiously optimistic and now in 20 or at the end of 2021 i would call ray dalio decently well convinced uh listening to him on the lex friedman podcast and also in this article right here he talks about how bitcoin has stood the test of time uh and so this is one of uh you know our biggest advantages in the crypto industry we have time on our side uh if you don't invest in crypto in the first zero through five years totally fine five to ten years totally fine but 10 to 20 years like now you're gonna have to start to actually account for like hey it's been here for a while like it's not going away uh and ray dalio is i think he's calling it good at 12 years of crypto he's like okay 12 years of crypto like it's here to stay and now it should be a part of your portfolio and so i think that's a perfectly pragmatic and reasonable uh conclusion do you know david on the podcast i was listening to he's actually talked about nfts too yeah issuing his own entities purchasing nfts it's really funny how um how all of this provides surface area to like get getting people uh on the crypto train right because it's one thing to just stick around for 12 years but it's also one thing to also as an ecosystem be exponentially growing for 12 exactly exactly and garnering more attention i mean it's always part of the conversation everyone wants to talk about it um so this is the story we're talking about in releases a little bit alluded to this crypto exchange kraken that is a crypto bank crypto exchange they just acquired staking startup staked so staked like figment which is one billion one billion dollar unicorn type valuation status is a staking services provider uh and they were just acquired by a crypto bank what's interesting about this story david is like um so i spent some time in the in the staking game actually i was one of the with figment and staked one of the original validators on the cosmos network back in the day and one of the things i saw happening is because like cosmos and many of these other protocols operate almost like a delegated proof-of-stake type of network so individuals really don't run their own nodes run their own staking nodes in these types of networks they generally they stake them with a third party someone you trust right and so one thing that i observed in my day is kind of staking as part of these networks is like um they were all becoming sort of like whale staking service providers they had to in order to um make their margins and like do do the best in the game and so in that kind of game the thing i i saw was like the the bigger fish would just snap up the the smaller fish and then you get a smaller and smaller pool of staking service companies uh like you know over time and this is finally what's happening right it's like i i was pretty certain at that time that all the staking service companies would eventually you either go public or you're acquired by a crypto bank of some form or another and to me that is such a um it's it's just it's a very big centralization vector for this entire space because now essentially all you're doing is is you are staking directly with kraken you're kind of back to square one so like the coin base of the world they're smart they're going to grow their business they're going to acquire other staking service providers too and they have in the past they've acquired bison trails for instance and incorporated that into their their staking service provider so the protocol itself i feel like is incented and basically pushes in the direction of more centralization with fewer and fewer staking parties and we're seeing this with stake here i i don't fault staked for this right it's like and obviously this is a good play for kraken like so i understand why everyone's doing it it's just back to the descent fundamental decentralization of of so-called layer 1 protocols there has to be some resistance against this or you'll end up with just a very small set of staking you know service providers that everyone's using and then like what's the point there's a huge line between being able to stake on computers that you naturally find in people's homes and any other type of staking because any other type of staking just more and more tilts towards centralization especially delegated proof of stake delegated proof of stake and actual proof of stake are completely different beasts uh and that's all i will say about that yep uh all right let's keep moving uh a16z they just put out a poll voters prefer candidates that support web three nice we titled this poll americans want policy makers to play an active role in supporting the next generation of the internet this is from a a survey of individuals in the u.s one in five people in the u.s own cryptocurrency the survey finds 35 of those between 18 and 34 a key demographic um kind of cool i guess more support for the idea that uh voters will vote in candidates who support web3 crypto the word crypto has always had this negative connotation like it scares my boomer parents like ooh crypto like weird stuff's happening web 3 is the perfect rebrand for cryptocurrency it's exactly it just fits right in people understand it they they kind of understand that there's an evolution of all the negative stuff that's happening with facebook causing like civil wars and how we're moving into a digital future with nfts and web3 like it's just enough to get people's heads wrapped around it and turns out it's a huge hit with people it just pulls well um so shout out to a future podcast episode that's coming with erica rhodes running to unseat brad sherman uh the guy that was making fun of about crypto and mongoose coins and congress and all that stuff we're having her on state of the nation sometime in january we're going to talk about her being a web 3 candidate if she likes the web 3 branding and if she's trying to lean into that so also if you are in the california 30th district which is northwest of la erica rhodes might be your representative and if that's true uh we need you to vote for her uh so we're we're going to talk about that on the state of the nation so stay tuned for the next couple weeks uh when that comes out all right guys we will be right back with the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible matcha

get all of your defy apps all in one space all right guys we are back with the hot ticks of the week uh let's start with this first one from hugh carp he's the founder of nexus mutual a insurance protocol so not surprised with this take not valuing decentralization is like being uninsured he says most of the time it's fine and then it's not what does he mean i i think that's just a great way to illustrate the value of decentralization decentralization pr is this invisible shield of protection that you're not supposed to notice you're not supposed to notice a decentralization uh and it's there for you regardless of whether uh you're thinking about it or not um yeah i think it's a great take yeah it's it's it's there for you and then like most of the time it's fine and then it's not in what cases does it become not fine oh so many so many different cases well it depends on also depends on the severity of the centralization um i mean if you have all your money with a bank and then the bank goes under boom you're you're effed um if you are on a centralized blockchain and the blockchain halts and you need to get your money out ouch decentralization just protects you against uh not only just like uh accidental bugs in code but also just from from centralized control uh you know bank banks you know you actually don't own your own money when you put your money in a bank they they give you ious uh and so you have to trust that and so there are so many different attack factors that are just completely mitigated with decentralization and so without decentralization you're kind of at risk to all of them you know i always worry about here this maybe this is a point about insurance too is humans are really notoriously bad at um quantifying risk and assessing risk particularly over longer term time horizons and i think this is why we have such a hard time quantifying the value of decentralization is because like you know if everything is going okay and the banks aren't stealing from you and you know binance isn't halting the chain and you know the hedge fund isn't calling um he isn't calling robin hood to halt stock trades right reverse trades then it all works very seamlessly and all and it all seems fine but it's those it's those it's those edge cases when you really need decentralization that's that's the value but human beings are really bad at quantifying this and taking that risk into account so i don't know if we'll ever get out of that cycle but it doesn't just provide a defense to the individual i guess i would say it's like it's a defense to the entire system like it's a public good for the entire system kind of like similar to privacy what's the value of privacy it's like the value is aggregated it's a public good for everyone in society it's not just um for one individual um yeah so i don't know hopefully hopefully humans have the ability to quantify that a little bit better this is uh leighton with the tweet quantifying some things though quantifying hacks why don't you take this david yeah not only quantifying hacks but also comparing the size of hacks to bank overdraft fees in 2020 so in 2021 crypto lost 7.7 billion dollars in crypto hacks and scams but in 2020 we uh 12.4 billion dollars was lost in bank overdraft fees so all of these hacks that we're just like you know in an uproar about and all these exploits that people get money and they get frustrated crypto or bank overdraft fees were almost twice that amount in 2020 and so leighton finishes off saying all the scammers and hackers in the world still can't rob people as well as banks can nice nice and spicy nice job leighton i love that by the way like over bank overdraft fees is just one of the the ways banks steal your money right this is one product from that yeah it's just one of many let's see this tweet um this is a quote from vitalik from a recent interview what's uh this quote yeah he says i think the big difference between bitcoin and ethereum is that bitcoin is a platform where the value of the ecosystem comes from the value of the currency and in ethereum the value of the currency comes from the value of the ecosystem uh and this is something that i've said in a different capacity i always like to say um the bitcoin blockchain is meant to serve btc the asset whereas in ethereum the ether the currency is meant to serve ethereum the blockchain or ethereum the economy ether the currency is a means to an end to provide the strongest security to ethereum possible so that ethereum can host as many things as possible securely bitcoin the blockchain is a blockchain that the whole entire point of it is to do one purpose which is to allow for 21 million bitcoins to be sent from wallet to wallet and that's the whole thing and so there's just different priorities in these things and so you can go ahead and choose your ecosystem with whatever values that you resonate with do you resonate with the hard cap or do you value a platform that has free and public security for all applications or you can do both but that's kind of the main differences between these two ecosystems the the interesting thing about that too is like the ether the asset scales as well with ethereum the economy whereas you know you know bitcoin not so much bitcoin to me is a bit more like gold and uh ether and ethereum to me is is a bit more like um weaves analogy of a a nation-state crypto nation state it's a bit more like the united states right not a fiat currency because this currency um is you know scarce and deflationary and cannot be changed in ultrasound cannot be changed by a central government but it scales in the way you know the us's s p 500 scales according to like the uh the value and the growth of gdp the value and growth of the economy so it's it's a different way to value these assets as well um let's talk about this uh take this is our last one of the week from uh daniel daniel daniel got hits yeah daniel daniel got hit says the twitter handle people say crypto is too risky for me me being dependent on a single employer for all of my income and not being able to access my retirement funds until my 65 until i'm 65 is too risky for me good point i love what you're thinking i love this and this reminds me of a quote from um uh nick uh naseem teleps book uh anti-fragile where he compares two people with different jobs one of them is a barber and the other one is like a white collar office worker the barber has very unstable volatile income some sometimes five people come into his shop every single day so sometimes zero people come into his shop his income is volatile but over the long term his his job security is stable because hair grows whereas the white collar worker his income is very very stable it's a cool 60 000 a year promised by his salary that he's going to get it no matter what but his job security is very unstable because he might just get axed at any moment of any moment uh and so this is this is about leaning into towards volatility as a way to actually grow stronger and more and more robust as as an individual and so if you work in crypto a highly volatile highly rapid uh environment you actually gain job security because you learn how to live in a volatile world and this the skills that you come out with and the connections that you come out with the opportunity cost of being in crypto is just immense and so there's just different kinds of risk out there like what kind of risk do you want do you want the risk of crypto volatility in the assets or do you want the risk of absolutely getting left behind in your corporate drop this is why i have such a hard time answering the question of like is crypto a risky asset because i honestly in my heart of hearts i don't think it's a risky asset i don't okay it's a volatile asset but volatility people complete those things way too much and in fact like uh finance textbooks conflate those things this is what finance people are taught that volatility equals risk like the one in the same but um that's not actually true right it's like crypto is far less risky than it first appears even though price fluctuates and it's far more volatile and i think the things in our everyday life that we we don't quantify right like um you know inflation for instance or um you know collapse of the central bank digital currency or a job loss or my job just basically and the skills that i have um like losing all value in the economy because the economy converts to to some new form and becomes more digital and enters the metaverse that sort of thing like the risks of those those things aren't quantified by the average individual when they're just following the path that everyone else takes so uh yeah way less risky than people think ryan what do you think is going to be here in 100 years what's more likely um ethereum or the u.s dollar see that's 100 years that's so easy to answer for me it's definitely ethereum yeah right it's like even even in its relatively nascent form yeah it's still ethereum 100 yeah like 100 and i guess that's why i'm betting the way i'm betting and you're betting the way you're betting but um a lot of people don't realize that david what are you excited about this week man uh i'm actually i got something else other than being excited not to say i'm not excited but uh i'm reading this book called humankind it's the case that humans are inherently good uh and it's just a very feel good book to read by the way so if anyone is feeling like down or they just need something to pick them up read this book called humankind it's the case that that humans are very are just inherently good and ryan while i was reading this book they were talking about uh how humans uh uh uh succeeded where um what's the neanderthals didn't uh and one of the reasons why they said that while our brain powers were about the same the main difference between the neanderthal brain and the the human brain is that our brains are all connected better as in we're very very social creatures so my question to you ryan is this isn't true at all but i'm just going to say that it is for for hyperbole sake what do you think the very first consensus mechanism that humanity ever had what do you think that was uh i would probably say language would be my guess but you know there's probably stuff before that but the big one that comes to mind is definitely language so the you going even earlier than that the main difference in the evolutionary paths of neanderthals versus humans is humans developed whites of eyes and neanderthals had very very big black eyes and so they didn't really have whites of the eyes and the whites of human eyes allows me to look at you and see what you're looking at and so my node can check out your node and see what your node is that's why yeah and so like oh what's ryan's looking over there why is he looking over there i'm going to go look over there and all of a sudden like a group of people can all come to consensus about where other people's attention is so the humans have been social creatures from day one and that's been our main competitive advantage because we've been able to sync up with each other we've all been on the same protocols and so whites of the eyes the og uh consensus mechanism that's wild i guess this is why also humans developed a fantastic facial recognition software right it's like we're very like how much of communication is non-verbal like 90 95 it's like tone intonation but like also body language facial expression that's all nonverbal i guess that's uh baked into our dna so learning learning that run was what i have been excited about ryan what are you excited that's cool man well look i'm just excited about next year i'm excited about 2022 i'm excited about bank list we've got a killer lineup of podcasts um starting the first one of the year with uh vitalik um a number of others in in q1 super excited about that excited about crypto i'm bullish crypto david you believe that i'm bullish crypto yeah but like a lot's going on okay like roll-ups still haven't had their moment so that's all ahead of us um if you're emerge hasn't happened yet that's still ahead of us been waiting for that for years right i know both of us have nfts are just starting okay well maybe they'll have a bear market in between but there'll be new use cases for nfts unlocked we're just tapping into this thing called daos and figuring out how that works so i 2022 i'm i'm going in there i'm going i'm i'm bullish i'm bullish both from a price perspective but i'm also bullish you know chris dixon-style bullish in the podcast he's like hey i look at the builder cycles i don't care about the price cycles i look at the builder cycles i'm seeing more builders more talent entering the space than ever so it's like being simultaneously bullish on price of these assets and mainstream attention and also bullish on the building that's getting done in this space it's a really cool unique time for crypto that um i don't think we've ever seen before 2021 was a breakout year in a lot of ways but uh i'm just as bullish if not more so going to 2022. i'm just as bullish right there with you my man all right two bulls on the bankless podcast bullish from day one can't go wrong there all
