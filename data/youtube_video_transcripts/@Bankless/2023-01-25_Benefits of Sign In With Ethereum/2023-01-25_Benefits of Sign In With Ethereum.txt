the first benefit is ux if wallets can identify the exact format they're expecting for a sign in message if this is just the standard across all apps and wallets can just recognize this format and it literally looks like a login button that's a much nicer user experience for people the second thing is security if the wallet can inspect the data inside that message to be signed we can add guarantees if example.org wants you to sign in the wallet can identify that message structure and make sure that we're being served this by example.org proper over a secured connection it's called domain binding the wallet will just give you a big red flag like if you go to a website with a bad certificate
