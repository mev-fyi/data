bankless Nation another state of the nation for you the first one of the Year our first live stream of the year as well our nft Securities David you have been obsessed with this topic for the last couple of weeks and wanting to do a show on it um I was a little hesitant at first maybe we'll get into a little bit why uh but uh what are we going to cover today and what's what's the topic yeah I've been going down the Securities Law rabbit hole which is actually a place where I started my crypto Journey a lot of people don't really know this Ryan but uh my first foray into crypto was first with an Ico advisory company and that company ground to a halt because we realized that everything we were doing was a security and so the way I got through the 2018 bear Market was working inside of the world of security tokens and so going back down the security token Rabbit Hole has been extremely interesting and I think that there are a ton of lessons that we as an industry need to learn about why do Securities Law exist what is this word security why do we have the SEC and why does our guest Brian think that all nfts are securities and also why might that not be that be such a bad thing these are all fantastic questions yeah I'm actually super bullish on this episode because I think we we get to kind of the base principles of why Securities laws exist in the first place and that's really where we're going to start the conversation and build up also David I want to tell our bankless listeners about our friends and sponsors at osmosis so uh I know you're familiar with osmosis what it is it's been a long time one of my New Year's resolutions David was to uh try new things in 2023. one of those new things is to give more time to the cosmos ecosystem in particular Cosmos defy I feel like after the dust has settled from 2022 there are kind of two ecosystems that are uh really still thriving and still building I mean there are some others so forgive me if I ignore you but one is ethereum of course which we talk about a lot the other is Cosmos osmosis is kind of a defy hub for Cosmos it's sort of a little bit of uniswap a little bit of decks a little bit of exchange there's also the ability to stake do some other things on here so David what I went into did was I spun up a Kepler wallet as kind of the metamask of Cosmos and I went and I played around on osmosis transferred some atoms tokens over to uh the cosmo to the osmosis chain and I did some swapping I got to tell you the ux is pretty awesome and pretty interesting so this is the invitation to you bankless listener to go try some new things in 2023 and go give the osmosis ecosystem app chain ecosystem a world if you know what D5 looks like on ethereum you should also know what it looks like in other ecosystems too and uh this is a great way to go test that and do that I think David we got a link in the show notes to that so people can uh can click that link spin up a wallet and get started right yeah I believe we all have extra time this bear Market to do something so if you want to something to explore definitely explore the cosmos ecosystem in the place to get that started that start that exploration is of course going to be osmosis it's like the unit swap of Cosmos and liquidity is where all Journeys begin in the world of crypto so David um why are you taking us down the Securities Rabbit Hole today all right because I I'll tell you I have some reservations about it which is even just the word the title of this episode our nft security I find myself getting a little a little triggered by that yeah the Security's word is triggering for many many people out there isn't it yeah why is that and why why did you want to cover it with um with our guests here today sure yeah I think the reason why the word Securities triggers people is because it invokes uh feelings of the SEC and Gary Gensler and obviously it kind of should because that's what the SEC is they that what is the SEC it regulates Securities but Securities Ryan were a thing before the SEC was before we had the federal SEC we had these things called Blue Sky laws which are state state laws around Securities but the concept of a security exists outside of the SEC and we often talk about speed running the history of money and Finance on Bank lists sometimes we expand that to speed running human coordination and these story of Securities and security regulation is a part of the story of human coordination humans coordinate better when we can collectively manage our own human greed when it comes to our financial assets and and so this is where Securities comes from and so understanding the spirit of Securities laws is something that we definitely need to do in order to be informed about how to build crypto and so Brian Our Guest is bringing a unique perspective about the world of nfts and securities and if you think he is a Gary Gensler shill who wants to openly invite the SEC into all of our crypto assets you would be egregiously missing the important lesson that we are going to talk to today and so that Ryan is my preamble to the rest of this show and that by the way guys is what made me very excited about this episode including some white papers that Brian uh created I read one of those papers coming into this definitely a first principles thinker so you want to stay tuned for this episode also we're going to get right to the sponsors but before we do I want to give a special shout out to our strategic sponsor which is Kraken Kraken is here for the same reason

West I'll see you in the Discord foreign we are here with our guest Brian fry and Brian came on to my my attention when William peaster who writes for the metaversal newsletter out of bank list forwarded me an article in coindesk uh that Brian wrote uh and that that article was uh titled every all nfts are roughly titled all nfts are security and that's great that's a great thing and a very thought-provoking uh article uh triggering David triggering yes and uh Brian is also a law professor at the University of Kentucky and today we are going to unpack that article are all nfts Securities and what does that really mean and why does Brian think that we should be bullish on the fact that all nfts are securities Brian welcome to the show hi nice to talk to all of you glad to be here big fan so Brian you you opened your coin desk article with this pretty spicy opener uh and I'll read a quote here everyone in the nft market is terrified that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC will decide that nfts are securities and regulate them they should get over it of course nfts are securities that's what makes them so powerful and promising rather than avoid SEC regulation the NFC industry should embrace this categorization it's inevitable and desirable especially once the SEC understands how the nft markets work it's likely to regulate it with a light touch so that spawns Brian for me three questions first I want to ask why do you think nfts are mostly Securities second I want to ask why should we think that that's good and third I want to ask why do you think well the SEC will only regulate it with a light touch but let's start with that very first question what do you mean when you say of course nfts are securities why of course yeah yeah well I think this is a really important uh ontological question right in the sense that when we asked the question are nft securities or is anything uh security I actually think that's the wrong Framing and it was something that struck me when I first became interested in the nft market uh in in 2021 right like a lot of people I saw the big people sale I've been interested in art and art law for a long time and I was like wow something's happening and I want to try to understand what it is and and one of the things I noticed immediately when I started engaging in the kind of nft web 3 ecosystem is that everyone was kind of terrified of the idea that what they were doing was a security or might be perceived by the SEC as a form of security trading and a lot of the discourse was sort of around well how do we describe what we're doing how do we characterize what we're doing how do we structure what we're doing in such a way that it won't be a security and therefore be regulated by the SEC and I hate to see it for better for worse I'm a former Securities lawyer right I worked at Sullivan and Cromwell uh Wall Street Law Firm from 2007 to to 2010 you know I worked for Goldman Sachs I did Securities Law you know related litigation work primarily but also some IPOs and that kind of stuff and I was like oh no right like this entire discourse is so confused right because the SEC isn't in the business of deciding really whether or not things are in our security our Securities in in the way that I think a lot of the people kind of in the ecosystem think think it is the SEC is in the business deciding what it thinks it needs to regulate and what it thinks it doesn't right so we say that there's a test for whether or not something is a security right the the the Supreme Court in the very famous case called uh Howie right established the criteria for what would constitute an investment contract but sort of the broadest definition of uh of a security under the United States Securities laws but the reality is that the Howie test is so broad that that any investment can be uh security if you just kind of look at it right because all the Howie test says is that something is an investment contract an investment is a security if it constitutes an investment of money in a common Enterprise with the expectation of profit to be devised derived from their efforts of others well that's that's any investment right that's literally any investment whatsoever right so when you ask this question is it a security that's the wrong question right the real question is always is it the kind of thing yes the SEC thinks it should be regulating is it the kind of thing that the SEC thinks is within his wheelhouse and is therefore the proper subject of of of Federal Regulation in the way that at the SEC does things right so what I want to try to convey to people really more than anything else is like stop trying to use the Law's magic words the law is magic words is a crazy way to think about what's taking place right you need to think about what your goals are what do you want what do you want the SEC to do what do you want the regulatory environment to look like what's going to be beneficial for the ecosystem what's going to help it Thrive as opposed to destroying it and rather than be hostile to or try to avoid this regulatory atmosphere how do you explain to the regulator what you're doing and how the regulator can add value to the ecosystem instead of destroying it because at the end of the day that's at least theoretically what the SEC is for right the idea is that the purpose of Securities regulation is to make the Securities Market work more efficiently right I mean that's the that's the primary Mandate of the SEC is to create and maintain healthy Capital markets right they're supposed to be making the market better right so it seems to me the goal ought to be how do we explain to the SEC what this Market needs if anything and what kind of value it can add okay so I want to park on this Brian this is uh so interesting and this is fired up I'm fired up I'm I'm very excited okay I like to have this discussion because I I gotta admit at first if my first reading of the article I was a little triggered our nft Securities like this word is kind of a dirty word to me it's my comment to David was like stop using the word Securities that's their word and what I meant was like it's the nation-state word and it means a certain set of things it means you have to file with Edgar and you have to do 10K filings and you have to do all of these things with respect to structure and it's more imposition it's about a group of regulators unelected bureaucrats telling us all these things we can't do with the technology they don't even understand all right and by the way Ryan if I can quickly go down why are we talking about this it's because a couple weeks ago oh yeah I talked about I said on the bank list weekly roll up that board Apes our Securities and like Ryan got a quizzical look on his face I bring up the quizzical I'll try and pull it up as once I'm done talking but uh like Ryan got a quizzical look on his face and usually Ryan and I agree on well almost everything and so that was like it's very rare for me and Ryan to have a disagreement and then like we send out the weekly roll up onto uh in to send out on the podcast feed on the YouTube and then the board Apes got extremely triggered that like David Hoffman from banklist is saying board apes or security and how dare he and what does that mean my face yeah this is this was Ryan's face here's Ryan reaction to David saying board yesterday well I didn't quite understand right because Securities laws are confusing and part of it is exactly what Brian was just saying is like the crypto world's reaction to the word security is that we all the fun get sucked out of the room uh we have to like we can't trade our assets on uniswap we have to go on to a regulated exchange and like all the fun leaves but Brian here is saying about the important stuff exactly just fun it's just like it's all the stuff that makes crypto crypto right so that that that's my quizzical face reading that article and also hearing what David said by the way then I then I read your longer kind of take on this the nfts in the cloud economy totally changed my mind but also um I I want to get to the meat of the because this is the the conversation I really wanted to have with any crypto lawyer or any SEC uh Securities lawyer or God anyone any regular anybody would have this conversation is I think the Howie test sucks Howie test sucks it sucks it and no one says this everyone is to your point everyone is trying Brian to say like oh here's how our particular token doesn't like the Howie test doesn't apply to it it doesn't it's only three out of the four prongs and all of this but like so here's why it sucks to me here's the definition of how we test you said it earlier I'll repeat an investment of money in a common Enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others I used to do pogs in grade school pogs don't pass the Howie test all right we gambled those things for money magic the Gathering cards don't pass the Howie test uh Pokemon cards don't pass the Howie test but but the important thing to remember is what's missing from the Howie test explicitly missing is the most important factor the fifth Shadow Factor as my good friend at UNLV Ben Edwards described it to me does it look like a security or rather is it the kind of thing is it the kind of thing that the SEC wants to regulate and the SEC doesn't want to regulate pox yeah CC doesn't want to regulate Magic the Gathering cards yes are you sure are you sure about that Brian I'm pretty confident although you know you never know you never know with Gary but uh but I'm pretty confident that uh POG regulation is and and I actually I and I I can I can verify that from personal experience right so my entree into the nft market was a little weird right so at the end of 2019 I published an article right so I've been I've been thinking about this problem for a long time right I went to Art School the before I went to law school right then as many artists do I ended up becoming a Securities lawyer Cromwell Goldman Sachs right and the entire time I was so confused because the more I learned about Securities the more kind of thought structurally about the Securities Law the more I thought to myself gee whiz you know concept art and conceptual art in particular sure looks a hell of a lot like a security right after all when you're buying conceptual art what do you end up buying you you get a certificate that says you own like like a Picasso or a Monet that's what you mean by you own it you own an edition of a concept right it's it's almost like you're you're you're just buying like a bearer Bond of some kind or Securities stock certificate right it always kind of bothered me I was always really confused I was kind of working through the problem and trying to think about how I would put this into kind of legal scholarship language but it never kind of worked right because artists were always like why are you talking about Securities and securities Securities lawyers will look and be like I try to explain conceptual art to them and they'd be like why would anyone buy something like that that's stupid it doesn't have yeah right so there was this there was a kind of Disconnect and I realized that what I needed to do was to debate the project right so rather than just write an article about it I had to make it real right so what I did was I created a Lara view article in the form of a prospectus for the sale of a work conceptual art and the article was titled SEC no action letter request and it proposed to sell a work of conceptual art titled SEC no action letter request which consisted of sending the SEC a no action letter request proposing to sell a work of conceptual art titled no action letter request in an addition of 100 for ten thousand dollars per addition I would recruit other law professors to market the work conceptual art on my behalf and use proceeds from the sale to promote the virtual you know future sales wait I found this thing this is it right of of the working question exactly so so I I did this as a law review article initially and I actually sent the SEC a no action letter request which they uh declined to respond to I did ultimately um a friend of mine ultimately managed to send um get them to respond to a foia request so they did send me a a a a PDF of like 40 pages of documents all of which were entirely redacted so I didn't get any actual information but they saw it but they saw it they definitely were talking about this but the point is I explained to them why what I was doing and so I sent them a no action letter requests and in the National literature request I explained to them why the article or rather why the work in conceptual art I was proposing to sell satisfied all the factors this is hilarious and therefore they should should prohibit me from selling it to to the public um a friend of mine actually described it as the first SEC action letter request he he'd ever seen because I was basically like come at me bro right you are a troublemaker assistant this is so funny this is so funny trolling them over and over again and it was hilarious because uh Matt Levine ended up picking up on it and running two separate discussions about the project in his money stuff column um and Levine's response as well as a response from several other people was sort of like I say everything's a security but I'm not sure I really mean it and this has to be wrong but I don't know why and essentially they just said well it's not really a security because it's a joke and no one would really buy it I was like well that's a totally unsatisfying right that's not a real reason right that's not a real reason people want to buy it for it to be glimmer and it'll be bad scammer but I'm still violating the Securities laws if I try to sell people something that's a Security even if no one wants to buy it so I was like this is this is a a meaningless response but whatever anyway I then kind of set it aside for a little bit but then when the nft market blew up I was like holy crap holy crap like this is like how it matters economically it matters so what did I do the first thing I well actually you know when I started fooling around with the nft market the first thing I did was create an nft titled SEC no action letter request uh and I just put it on openc and kind of left it there and I I was fooling around just joking I didn't really think that much of it but then uh a uh and a pretty prominent nft collector Named Sam Hart uh out of the blue one night made me an offer of half an eighth to to buy the nft for me and I was like I didn't even know how much an eth was so I looked up I was like holy crap that's like 500 I was like man you can buy all the nothing you want from me I will sell you more nothing than you could possibly imagine right but that was sort of my transition into kind of thinking about the Dynamics and the economics of the NFC Market what I realized was all of a sudden I could take that SEC no action letter request project which had been kind of not fully realized because I couldn't actually there wasn't a market for me to sell it in effectively and I could put it on the nft market and sell it and all of a sudden I was like oh yeah you said this wasn't a security because no one was interested in buying it guess what I just made twenty thousand dollars selling it okay Brian can you just uh for listeners that didn't follow that thought process and don't really understand the the Catch-22 that you're placing the SEC in can you just like walk us through and explain like I'm five fashion what what you just did with the no action letter nft exactly exactly exactly so basically the way the SEC is a very kind of unique Federal agency it's a really old right I mean it was formed back in 1934 when federal agencies were actually kind of not that common and most of them were were relatively small so it has a lot of kind of its own unique history and structure and the reality is that the primary way the SEC works is by having conversations with the people at regulates it's a very kind of um kind of retail agency in a weird ways which in a lot of ways and Matt Levine I think really talks about this in a really kind of rich and deep and useful way it's kind of a problem I think for the crypto industry because the SEC isn't isn't in the business of and isn't used to making kind of generally applicable rules right it doesn't it doesn't do things that way it responds to specific questions from the people it's regulating and so one of its primary ways of going about kind of Securities Law rulemaking is through the process of what's known as no action letter requests so if you want to issue uh security right well one thing you can do is just go through the entire registration process but that's really burdensome and expensive et cetera et cetera and it doesn't cover all Securities offerings right some kinds of Investments you might offer are the kind of things the SEC has decided it doesn't want to be in the business of regulating even though it could if it wanted to you could have wanted to it just doesn't want to it doesn't want to regulate those kind of things so what you do is you write up a letter to the SEC explaining what you're proposing to do and saying hey SEC this is what I like this is the uh this is the investment opportunity that I'd like to provide if I do this thing and don't regulate it are you gonna prosecute me right and they read it they think about it they might have a conversation with you about it and then ultimately they either say yeah if you do this without registering that's going to be a violation of Securities laws and we're going to bring in action against you or they say nope that looks kosher go ahead right go ahead and make that off this is like a black box after you know months and years of like it's very hard to get this right well I mean they happen all the time if you go on the SEC website they're they're published they're available right and there's a lot of caveats around it right they say oh well you know we're responding only to this particular proposal you're making and future proposals might not be binding but are they mandated Brian to respond to every every kind of request well no no okay but they no no they don't have to do anything they don't have to do anything if they don't want to in fact they don't even like in my case they didn't even have to explain to me why they refused to respond in fact the only the only thing they didn't redact in the documents they produced in response to my foyer request was somebody some unidentified person from the SEC who I with reasons believed to be someone in like their general counsel's office referring to my um arguments as fanciful which I so so what you did was you basically created this uh request for for a no action from the SCC and you wrote this whole entire article on on like why this actually isn't a security and you got them to read it you think no no I I wrote I wrote an entire article explaining why what I was proposing to do by virtue of sound like a conceptual art was in fact the kind of thing the SEC said it was in the business of regulating and essentially what I told them was I want to engage in Securities fraud by selling this work the conceptual art and I want you to tell me I'm not allowed to do it right right so so Brian was testing the limits of the black box here yes in a facetious joking fashion and so he made this NFC the entire project was trolling this yes right but but to prove a point yes and so then and so then when I did it with the nft so initially it was like a a kind of analog uh conceptual art project and incidentally um I'm still I I diluted the offering as much as possible so um the uh the work of Concepts actually I think I initially sold it in an edition of 50 but I ended up selling 200 or selling giving away 200 editions because I wanted to get it and I wanted to do as much fraud I wanted to do as much crime as I as I possibly is possibly good um I still I think I still have some floating around if anyone wants one they can just drop me an e drop me an email or a note or something at all you are the issuer yeah okay okay so when I did when I did the nft I sent the SEC a second no action letter request explaining why the nft project was also the sale of an unregistered security but I explained to them that I had sent them a previous no action letter request to which they had declined to respond and I just was gonna I was gonna take their refusal to respond as acknowledgment that it was fine for me to do what I was doing even though I strongly disagree with them and believed myself to be engaging in Securities okay so so that is by the way uh awesome that's awesome that's a that's a that that is the right way to troll uh ladies and gentlemen um so we established that the Howie test it just is a bad fit for this design and you said the fifth prong the Howie test is actually does the SEC want to regulate it or not and that's the hidden thing that I feel like no one ever talks about but that is the truth of what's going on here which is interesting but but let me still um talk about the other the other part that still sticks in my mind so then Brian why call them Securities right so like the title of your article was why nfts uh are securities and that's a good thing that sort of thing back to my my you know crypto brain I'm trying to I'm trying to understand that why are we using their word isn't there a better word for this isn't it like assets sure that's what but like isn't Securities yeah the reason I like it is that we invented Securities because they were a really good tool for maximizing the value of capital or maximizing people's ability to use Capital to productive ends or rather maybe you can just think of it as like a way of ensuring that Capital flowed more more efficient okay now that's a story I don't think there's an innovation crypto people haven't heard that story Brian which is why I think we just I don't I don't know much about Securities Law before the birth of the SEC or or even the concept of Securities why it's important can you can you tell that story because like to me SEC Securities uh they're one and the same but there is a deeper purpose for these assets in this this class of assets can you tell us what that is yeah so security is long predated the SEC I mean as you mentioned before right there was Securities regulation on the state level via Blue Sky laws before the SEC was created in 1934 but Securities predated Blue Sky laws as well right Securities were an innovation a financial Innovation that people invented in order to facilitate the investment and distribution of capital right I mean Securities are just a fancy way of saying how do we figure out how do and enable people to invest in something that they believe is going to be more valuable in the future in other words how can they use their money in in productive ways how can they how can they facilitate an investment and I think the the problem is that we always thought too narrow about it right we we thought about Securities only as a way of investing in companies investing in businesses owning owning a piece of the capital flows for example of of a business but I think that our Market has developed in a much broader richer and and deeper way where we I think can think about it more more comprehensively right so the project I'm working on right now is kind of thinking about what if anything the nft market shows us about the nature of the markets and specifically a particular Market in in creativity right so the kind of the big picture point is we've had a Innovation Securities market for a long time we just couldn't see it right the Art Market has always been a Securities market right when you invest in a work of art what you're really investing in is the belief that a particular artist that their brand is going to be more valuable in the future than it is than it is now right you you you're investing in your belief in the future commercial Goodwill associated with an artist or like you're investing in their cloud right you're investing in the belief that this that this brand is going to have more clout in the future than it does now the problem is we couldn't see it as a Securities Market because the objects got that way right it was the dirty canvas and the lumpy Rock right that we thought people were investing money in when they bought something in the Art Market but that was always false right but they were always really investing in was just a catalog resume interview you're saying you're saying right if somebody buys a Picasso right early stages of Picasso's career they're not it's not actually about the art the True Value becomes with everything that Picasso paints posts that time you're investing in questions what you're buying is a security interest is Fame right the object right the the dirty piece of cloth or the lumpy rock is just a physical token that represents ownership of a ledger entry on Picasso's and clearly that does selling a Picasso doesn't have to happen in a sec regulated exchange also does not need to file 10K reports and quarterly earnings reports uh does not have to you know show fully audited financials clearly everyone would say of course Brian also is not a quote unquote security TM of the type that the SEC has because the factor the SEC has never been on it and regulating the Art Market why is that because that's not what the SEC was created for right right the SEC was created for a purpose which was to make the financial markets work in a more regular more predictable and like less vulnerable to fraud fashion the SEC was not designed to regulate the Art Market right which is again why I think it's so important to realize that when we say is it a security we're asking the wrong question the question is is it the kind of thing that the SEC believes it has the expertise to regulate but that hurts too because now we need to get into Gary gensler's brain I want to come back to that but I know David is itching to show a diagram he uh he put together yeah and this conversation really kind of goes to the heart of what I really want to impress upon the nft industry but really the whole entire industry of people cohort of people who invest in assets you want your asset to have security like properties because that is bullish if you take away the security-like properties away from your asset it is not bullish that like there is a fundamental like association with security like properties and being a bullish investable asset that has growth potential and so whether I'm investing in Tesla because I think the Tesla Supercar Network and sales is going to grow or I'm investing in my favorite nft artist Nate Mohler it's because I both believe those things are going to grow and that's bullish on it I'm bullish on it and I'm in bullish on the security-like properties and so Ryan like you you say and many of the board Apes when I accidentally triggered the board ape community that got triggered by this like capital S Securities TM word but what Brian's saying and what we're talking about is that Securities as a concept predated the SEC and I'm saying we need to plant our flag in the ground and take back that word and so I've created this word called sparkly Securities or Securities that have a cute cat associated with them and so I was working this morning on this uh graphic that we are showing on screen which shows some various spectrums that I think are all more or less the same spectrum and so working from top to bottom you see on the left side the cftc logo and on the right side you see the SEC logo cftc is responsible for regulating Commodities the SEC is responsible for regulating Securities TM or what Brian is saying Securities that the it thinks that it should have jurisdiction over and then in the middle we have Securities which are like cute cat jpegs and board apes and crypto punks and Pokemon cards and I also want to keep on and I'm claiming that these are actually on the same Spectrum Commodities on the very far left and securities on the very far right and then I assets that you want to invest in because you're bullish on them yes exactly right and not not to say that being a Commodities not as bullish but I'm what I will say is that being having a higher threshold for bullishness probably means you have security like properties now there's this very important aspect which we haven't talked about yet which is called material non-public information and this is a a spectrum that I will put on the decentralization to centralization Spectrum and so like things like gold coffee wheat Bitcoin are very very very commodity like a perhaps 100 Commodities there is zero material non-public information about these things as in there are zero privileged parties there are zero coordinated centralized entities that know something about gold that the generalized public does not know because everyone knows everything about gold and Bitcoin and coffee now that is not true for highly regulated Securities TM things like Tesla Amazon Apple registered compliant Securities there are a centralized coordinated team that does have material non-public information that the public does not know and that is what makes the SEC say hey perhaps we should regulate that and this is the same Spectrum as the decentralization to centralization Spectrum where on the left side on the commodity side I have assets produced by nature and on the right side the centralized side I have assets produced by humans if a human produces an asset likely it's probably starting off as a security whether it's a sparkly security or a heavily compliant Securities TM security we'll have to go with facts and circumstances but I think this is the spectrum that I really want to drive the point home when I say board apes are securities or all defy tokens are securities or apps or Securities I mean they're sparkly Securities as in and espec and this is also where the role of dows come in where decentralized autonomous infra organ organizations take what would otherwise have been material non-public information and then they make them public and all of a sudden that moves maker token uni token Ave token away from the Securities TM end of the spectrum closer to the middle to the left side they have on-chain cash flows there is no audited report from you know one of the big four accounting firms when all of the cash flows are on chain right it's already it's already there for you so it's already material Public materially public exactly exactly and so Brian I want to pause and just kind of get your take on this graphic that we have on screen and my rant for the last five minutes yeah yeah I mean I think there's a lot to that right I mean I think it's you know it's a complicated um ecosystem with a lot of moving parts so I think this is one useful way or potentially useful way of thinking about how to kind of schematize it I might also distinguish between like consumption goods and and investment Goods in a way I might also observe that in a lot of ways part of the struggle that the SEC I think is is really wrestling with is understanding what its real purpose and Mission is in a world where most of the Securities disclosures that they require are irrelevant to the overwhelming majority of investors I mean in a lot of ways right the existence of something like the fraud on the market concept is actually I think deeply corrosive to the mission of the SEC because it implies that invest most investors all investors really all retail investors aren't really paying attention to these disclosures anyway they're just relying on on market prices and in reality I think that the overwhelming majority of retail investment is driven by perception of brand Equity rather than anything that has anything to do with the fundamentals of particular companies right people are investing in Tesla because they believe that well maybe they don't know but I mean people believe that believed that Tesla or Apple or Google or whatever was going to be cooler in the future than it was today they were looking at the balance sheets right they weren't looking at the prospectus they were thinking about the brand they were thinking about brand equity and where it was going to go in in the future and my sense is that in reality the the people who are really investing on the basis of kind of information about the sort of the actual financials of different companies they aren't doing it in the public markets they're doing it they're doing it privately right private Equity is where the real the real gains are when it comes to to investment right so I I for me in a lot of ways it's almost like a kind of crisis of purpose or the SEC like what are they what are they there for what value is SEC regulation adding other than kind of keeping out players who insiders don't don't like anymore but for me they're really the important thing to realize and I and I really like you know you're kind of sparkly Securities analogy in a lot of ways because what I think this ought to drive home to people is to realize that the reason that we invented Securities in the first place was in order to give businesses companies access to Capital markets right the ability to in effect get money that they could use in order to run their business and generate more money but historically authors artists anyone you know individuals didn't have that same kind of access to the capital markets because there wasn't a tool you could use to Shell to sell shares in in your Enterprise as it were now the Art Market was a very limited version of that but the Art Market is largely controlled by insiders right I mean there's a word for people who invest money in the Art Market without being an Insider that word is sucker [Laughter] right because the only people who ever are going to make money in the conventional Art Market are the people who are running the market itself the exciting thing about the nft market and decentralization is that it took control away from the Insiders and gave it to the kind of general public or anyone who was participating in the market in other words what became valuable and popular depended on what nft investors in the aggregate actually liked as opposed to what in Market insiders were deciding was was going to be possible uh was going to be uh was going to be uh popular and and I think that like that for me is what's really cool right is the idea that all of a sudden individuals authors creators innovators could have access to the capital markets in this new and totally previously on a kind of unavailable way well okay that excites me too and by the way that was in your your your your paper that I hope we come back to after copyright uh opponing nfts in the cloud economy which is absolutely marvelous he came out without a year ago and I just finally saw it this morning but um here's a question I have for both of you with respect to sparkly Securities we live in a meme world where words matter and we have narrative battles all the time why are you guys trying to fight the fight of Securities this word okay like call them Capital assets another word for the sparkly Securities is Collectibles like I understand the point that that you're making in fact I didn't earlier that was the quizzical face that we saw earlier in the show I didn't now I understand what you mean by this sparkly Securities um but is this the fight we want to have do we want to start claiming nfts and crypto assets as Securities because the minute you do I'm just picturing Gary Gensler popping his head did you call me because here I am it's a security three times yeah exactly like imagine or take this imagine somebody's sound Clips this conversation that we're having David Hoffman nfts are securities David Hoffman clip plays it in front of uh you know meeting in Congress or something like this do you know what I mean like right this is a hard narrative battle guys like I get the I get the underlying point but do we want to use this word or is there a better word out there and then this is exactly why I wanted wanted to do this episode in this show and go down Ryan the Securities rabbit hole and this is why I've been like reading books about the 1929 stock market crash which is where we got the SEC in the first place because understanding this battle I think is crucial for the crypto industry to move forward and to move forward at all and so there I'll I'll make the claim that if we we like I said at the intro of the show uh we often say on Bank list that we are speed running the history of money and finance and sometimes we extend that to the speedrunning the history of human coordination insecurities insecurities laws are a part of that story of human coordination if you re-roll the dice of humanity we will come up with Securities Law 100 of the time somehow some way and so there's this resistance to the SEC in the crypto World perhaps rightfully so because the Gary genslers of the world have not done us a service at all but there's there's there's two strategies that I see here Ryan where we fight the SEC in the courts and we move that line of what is a sparkly security to a security TM closer and closer away to equities on the traditional stock market and further and further away from our nfts and our sparkly Securities and we that is a trench warfare very costly lawyer versus lawyer fight but we just do our best to push that line the strategy that Brian is doing with his uh his no action nft is the opposite where they say okay Gary everything's in a a security Jiu Jitsu exactly it's like okay come regulate my Pokemon cards Gary do you really want to do that and so it's a little bit like yeah Gary everything's a everything's a security Now go off right yeah and so by the way Gary Come on the podcast and so like what do we want to do and this is what I why I wanted to make this show Rhymes because I that is the question that only the entire crypto industry can answer as a collective but first we actually need to be educated about Securities in the first place okay I get I get it so you the play here is rather than saying no gear no SEC these things these crypto assets aren't Securities you guys are saying hey the definition that you're using the Howie test everything's a freaking security right and are you sure you want this right my question to you though is what if Gary sorry Gary what if the SEC looks back at you you know eyes unblinking and says yeah that's what we want we do want that thing and you know why I didn't care about pogs if I'm the SEC or Magic the Gathering cards is because it's a tiny freaking Market it's a bunch of kids playing this is not a tiny Market we're talking about billions of dollars in assets that now fall outside of my purview I'm your comment from earlier and uh in your post Brian was like uh you know is this a thing the fifth prong is this a thing that the SEC you wants to to regulate they want to regulate big things big markets they don't care necessarily about small markets and pogs and little Collectibles but if it's billions of dollars and it's International yeah they're gonna want a piece of that and so my my my future that's right but the thing is the thing is you can't scare off the SEC right you got to start the conversation with them you gotta help them understand what's going on and understand what they can and should be doing that's going to be productive instead of destructive and I think the only way to start that conversation is to kind of provoke them into understanding the nature of what they're looking at because the problem is I volunteer the SEC is a really old agency that's really used to doing things in its own way and is really used to interacting only with its client companies right the SEC is used to dealing with Goldman Sachs and with JP Morgan and with Chase Manhattan and whatever it's not used to dealing with D5 people and artists and crypto enthusiasts it doesn't know what to do with them and it doesn't understand what they're doing or why they're doing it and so I think that you know you have to I mean I agree right when the SDC sees a big market and people engaging in high value transactions when it sees something like you know FTX collapsing right it says to itself oh crap we got to do something about this right uh we don't really understand it but it's got to be in our wheelhouse because this is the kind of thing that looks like what and also let's remember the people ask them like legislators where were you sleep at the wheel like this is when Hester purse came on that on our podcast who I think is a good faith regulator uh you know commissioner of the SEC as well is she was just like yeah the problem is when things go wrong they point to us to come take care of it right and so they're mad at us if nft Market goes up above a whole bunch of retail is hurt and then they people come back to the SEC and why aren't you there yeah no 100 100 and this you know you know I don't know that I necessarily went about it in the best or most productive way necessarily although I did find it very personally amusing right but I mean my whole point was to try to say to them hey you should be getting out ahead of this yeah right you should be thinking about what you're in the business of doing as a regulator you should be thinking harder about what you can do well how you can use the regulatory Powers you have in a way that's going to benefit the market and actually fulfill your regulatory mandate instead of just bullshitting all the time and like that's what I'm really disappointed about right like look I'm not for or against regulation I'm agnostic right I think good regulation is something that we should be happy about right I mean the the whole idea behind the SEC was to make the markets work better right and on some level at least sometimes the government can do that right I mean it's in a position to create rules that ultimately can solve market failures and make things work more efficiently but The Regulators have to take their job seriously they have to think about what they're doing they have to understand the market they're regulating and also Brian they need to actually care because from our perspective Gary Gensler is a Gary Gensler maximalist who wants to promote Gary Gensler to the top of the power hierarchy so if we're going to ask this of our Regulators we need them to actually care about their jobs which maybe is a hard thing to ask I I couldn't agree more but I mean like look this this is the disappointment for me like look I am like on some level I'm a troll but on another level like look I'm a Whopper I'm a fully promoted law professor at a state law school right who's sending them law review articles explaining things to them and they just are like blowing me off and pretending like I don't exist I think that's really weird and kind of unfortunate and I think it's sort of a shame that they don't take their job seriously enough to ask like what is this person telling us and what are we missing what why don't we call these things Collectibles is that not encompassing enough yeah and the only reason I say that is that there's no there's no Keck there's no Collectibles exchange uh commission right and so that's Uncharted Territory and so maybe we could like I mean I I think I think there's a mix right and I I think some some nft projects ultimately really are fundamentally collectibles on some level I think you might also kind of think about the market for for Devlin Goods like like luxury goods as sort of like sitting in between the the two sort of polls as well but it seems to me right that they're really kind of promising exciting aspect of the nft one like I think nfts ultimately can be used for a lot of different things I'm describing one market that I see as being like promising and having a lot of potential and what I see the potential as being as is giving creators access to Capital markets to enable people to invest in their project in the hope of making a profit in other words enabling speculation in their project because the reality is most creators are risk averse and lacking in capital right so historically historically creators have had to sell in effect sell shares in their product at a huge discount to the value because they had to sell to a publisher right and there's only a few Publishers the Publishers all the capital and the Publishers can can buy it for next to nothing yeah well almost there being but like but think about it right you're an author you go to a publisher they don't know in advance what's going to be popular and honestly They Don't Really Care right it doesn't matter to them whether or not you're successful all they care about is that they publish a bunch of stuff some of it ends up being popular and they make money by selling whatever it turns out people yeah you're saying the reason collectibles in the fit is because it's it's disingenuous it's not actually true it's some of these things aren't Collectibles they truly are like investments in they they do the four prongs of the Howie test just not the fifth and that is a that is the truth of the matter and so you're kind of like it's like yes let's call it what it is that's exactly right so like and I think the art Market's a great example of that right because again people think of the Art Market as a market for objects but it's not right the object itself is not valuable the only thing that's valuable in the Art Market as an investment Market in art is the attribution right because in the absence of the attribution the the art object the physical token is worthless right as soon as that relationship to the artist is severed as soon as you don't have the brand connection the object is is just a consumption it's just decoration it's not it's not an investment good anymore so what you're what you're buying is a share in the artist career that's what you've always been buying and that's what's so cool about it it's just we couldn't see it because the object got in the way the cool thing about the nft market is it got rid of the physical token and all of a sudden we could see how the market actually worked right yeah and some people are like I'll right click save that and the nft owners are like please do the more you talk about me the more you pump my project the happier I am nothing could be better than you reproducing the work and like for me again as a copyright scholar this is really exciting right because the problem is we've sort of we've internalized this artificial scarcity right but we got to remember copyright was always just a tool for Innovation policy and the reason we invented copyright was to enable Publishers to invest in the production and distribution of works of authorship copies of works of authorship with some degree of financial certainty right in other words it reduced the risk for Publishers it was never about authors right it was always about Publishers producing copies well copyright was a pretty decent solution a pretty decent way of reducing transactions costs when publication and distribution were expensive but guess what publication and distribution the marginal cost is zero now we get everything digitally the marginal cost is nothing we don't need it anymore right this is uh this is getting into your article which I definitely want to want to get into and I think that'll be the theme for the second half of the show we've got a little bit over but just to tease what we're going to talk about in the second half of the show is exactly what you're getting into and there's something very deep that both Ryan and I really really resonated with your article and it was something very uh close to the metal of what crypto is here to do which is replace uh ad hoc kind of Patchwork laws that are doing something but not really fulfilling their intended uh service and then replacing them with a market so I think that is going to be what we talk about in the second half of the show but first we have to talk about some of these fantastic Bank list tools from our sponsors uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling Arboretum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to Arbiter Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop to plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and banklist Nation we are back to conclude this conversation of Securities who knew Securities were so much fun uh but actually we want to turn sparkly they're so sparkly uh but we want to turn the conversation actually to copyright law which is similar but different uh and uh Ryan I passed you Brian's article about copyright law this morning and you like me you thought it was a one of the more fantastic pieces of literature we've ever read in the crypto space so Brian I'm wondering if you can kind of summarize the nature of your article we need to start with a primer about like what is copyright law why is it why is the format of copyright law incomplete or could be better like why is it broken and then how do you think uh nfts might actually fix this because you kind of just like summarize your article for us for sure for sure so I think the big picture point to take away about copyright law is it copper well I was always a policy tool designed to solve certain kinds of market failures right so we created copyright because Publishers needed to be able to invest with some kind of security or expectations about the future in the production and distribution of Works copies of works of authorship because it was expensive right printing copies was expensive Distributing copies was expensive knowing how many sales you'd have what involved a lot of uncertainty copyright was a way of minimizing competition in the production and distribution of works of authorship in a way that made it more economically feasible for producers for for Publishers to do that and and we use that tool because we value the production and distribution over we like to consume consumers like works of authorship we enjoy consuming them and in the absence of copyright our presumption was we would get less of that than we expected and what we're doing here Brian is this is um a nation-state enforced a tool that we're doing in order to incent that outcome of authors producing more work and of course and of course copyright didn't exist until the printing press did didn't exist before the printing press okay so new technology brought on the the need for copyright which was you know ultimately enshrined in kind of nation-state tools which is the law um as always as the cost of reproducing works of authorship decreased it became a viable business model and copyright was developed actually privately right I mean copyright was created by the stationers company in London initially it was industry self-regulation right it wasn't enshrined into law until hundreds of years after the the stationers company in in effect the guild kind of quasi-private uh quasi-governmental agency created it in the first place its members effectively agreeing that that form of competition regulation would facilitate their ability to engage in their business practices my point in the paper is that look copyright was a policy tool that fit the technology of the day and fit a lot of the technology for better and for worse for hundreds of years afterwards right but when the technology changed it stopped being a valuable policy tool right because copyright was designed for a world in which publication and distribution costs were high but publication distribution distribution costs are now zero the marginal cost of reproducing or Distributing a work of authorship is nothing right we live in a digital world where we have abundance and we don't need that kind of artificial limitation on the distribution of copies anymore what scarce is clout right and so we need to be thinking about is how do we manage the market in Cloud because that's where we're really leaving the money on the table right so like I think one kind of really easy and approachable angle is to think about it this way right so everyone's heard the Kardashians right but the Kardashians as the Kardashian Kim Kardashian couldn't exist as a business proposition without social media right she needed social media in order to create her brand and sell the brand in the various ways that that she was able to sell the problem is problem I mean Kim Kardashian's doing just fine but you know what Kim Kardashian is only internalizing a tiny fraction of the social value that she's generating right think about how many people are talking about Kim Kardashian right now right she's generating massive massive social value but so much of it is just left on the table right she can't internalize it she has no way of monetizing it she has to do it by proxy right by doing endorsements by selling products by you know whatever advertisements you you name it right what's exciting to me right or potentially really exciting to me about the nft marketplace is that it enables people with clout to sell the clout directly right to sell the social value to speculators who want to invest in their future social value and it gives them a huge Market that didn't exist before right but think about it in a copyright Market when an author was selling works the Publishers there's only a limited number of Publishers the Publishers don't want to buy that much stuff the Publishers don't necessarily like competing with each other that much authors are in a bad place right they don't have any Market power right but in an nft marketplace right where you're selling to a broad investment a huge number of speculators all of whom are competing for the ability to invest in in your project all of a sudden the market power can shift right if you've got Cloud you can sell a lot more and make a lot you can claim a much bigger percentage of the potential future value of whatever it is so this is back to First principles which is why I really love the way you think is basically copyright was put together for a purpose which was a public policy purpose to incent the production of Art and artist material and you know written form in in in all sorts of different forms right it was meant to incentivize human culture yes and human is a human uh public good human coordination mechanism in order to do that you make the proposition that because of nfts and this kind of ownership economy you call it kind of this Cloud economy we may not even need copyright any longer because this is the scarce thing in its purest form in an internet weight of native World by the way bankless listeners will know we've already compared the birth of the internet to basically gutenberg's printing press it is that transformational of the Technologies just happened within our lifetimes within the last 30 years so it's that big I guess our laws are going to have to change obviously they will have to change obviously we'll have to coordinate differently and what you're saying is you'd go as far as to say is basically this is um this is another business model for artists to solve that coordination problem to solve that tragedy that comes what if we lived in a world where no artist was incented in order to to create their art wouldn't that be but what I think is especially crazy about it is it at the business model that's been around for hundreds of years right it's just the Art Market it's just the Art Market but applied to everything and nfts what I think is like to like one thing I noticed when I first started getting really interested in the nft web stream space is people constantly would say to me oh but it's no different like you could do that without nfts you don't need it I'm like yeah that's true you can do a lot of things with the spreadsheet right the point is the nft marketplace right the nft technology reduced the transactions costs just enough that all of a sudden that latent demand exploded right and so whatever I was seeing here Brian is and what and what you've like woken me up to is that we have two different Technologies here we have uh the proliferation of human culture technology and and you're making the point that as soon as we got to the internet uh the pro the cost of proliferating art dropped to zero which is bullish but then we needed some ad hoc kind of copyright law to really allow that to be expressed and so we created that but now what I'm seeing here is not now we have this printing press technology which is the internet but now we also have the printing press of assets which is ethereum nfts tokens and these two technologies really really resonate and like they Vibe with each other really really well to the point where we can totally circumvent the whole like laws aspect of this and still get the original purpose done which is to incentivize the creation of human art and culture because we have an equally Pro proliferatable medium of value capture which are nfts that's right that's right if you just think about the premise of copyright the reason it's such a bad fit for our new technology becomes obvious because the premise of copyright is artificial scarcity but we don't need artificial scarcity in the world of perfect abundance right works of authorship are natural public goods they aren't diminished by consumption you don't use them up as many people can consume them as can get a copy all copyright is doing is imposing artificial costs on consumption and the only justification kind of policy justification that still exists for copyright is to encourage the production of the works in the first place but copyright's always been a terrible way of encouraging the production of works and it never really benefited artists all that much because the overwhelming majority of artists get no benefit from copyright whatsoever because no one's interested in consuming what they produce right the only people who benefit from copyright are successful awareness right and you only get successful down the line when you're selling a lot when you're selling a lot of stuff the the cool kind of concept for me is is this idea that we can encourage people to consume as much as possible right and that's good for artists because the more people consume your work the more your clout will grow the more your Fame will grow and that clout that's where the real value is so this is not limited copies this requires people to um flip the model on their heads too right so like so okay so uh in order for this stick to come to pass to artists will have to take it upon themselves because I think artists mostly think in a copyright world still the the older school and this might come about it this might take a generation to to fully come about where you get a new generator of artists in the old generation kind of dies out but like the model is flipped rather than like it's don't download my song um you know without paying me royalty the model is flipped to download all my songs because I have an nft and the more popular this thing becomes but you know what but you know what some artists get it right so I understand I have a friend in England he's a musician goes by the name Simon in delicate he's been an indie rock musician for a long time um but always kind of you know struggling as any indie rock musician would to like make money selling copies of his works when I got interested in nfts I proposed to him that we kind of rethink the model right so he created a he wrote an album called Arcadia Park which was a soundtrack for an imaginary theme park and what he did was sell an nft collection that were Perpetual admission tickets to Arcadia Park and he sold them for I think like 0.1 each or something like that like 50 tickets something like that and his proposition was as soon as I sell all 50 of these tickets I'm going to put the album in the public domain because that's as much money as I need to make in order to make that project like viable for me as a Creator he sold the nft collection in less than 15 minutes and he put the work in the public domain and so now anyone can use it in any way they want to and it's not controlled artificially limited by copyright at all and I think that that's really the kind of future that I want to see for Creative production because he made more money in 15 minutes with that album than he'd made in years and years and years on all of his previous albums combined it's like the reason why this like really resonates with with me and I'm sure Ryan too is like we're kind of public goods Maxis that's really what I see cryptos here to do is to help scale public goods and I'm and this is why I think this episode in this conversation is really really resonating with me and I'm sure a bunch of the bankless nation is that this is now a conversation and we've figured out a technology to increase the supply of public domain culture knowledge and knowledge is a public good culture is a public good it benefits all of us and we've found a way to resonate to and to scale that out if we just can find a way for the nation-state to understand this and to make their laws catch up to where we are with technology it's also David it's just so we've solved the public goods problem in a better way so we get more public goods right we get more artists benefiting we get more culture we get more art we get more of these things it's also now that you look at it like this it is a native technology for the Internet isn't it like the internet was missing this like so so go think of all the dmca takedowns of things right copyright infringement on YouTube Boom it's gone or like do you remember the earlier days of like you know Napster and all these file sharings of you know selling uh yeah or not selling but downloading MP3s right and all of kind of the like no information wants to be free information wants to be free so why don't we just go with the gravity of the internet free all of the information and charge for the clout charge for the authenticity what is that cloud charge that's in the form of a token called nft and that's the model for the internet for artists for art that solves our our coordination problem in a much more seamless internet native way and which is what Brian is saying is actually resonant with what the investable case for these things are in the first place and I think the secret sauce for me is speculation speculation is is really really important people want to be able to speculate on what's going to be valuable in in the future and I I think that introducing speculation to the creative economy introducing speculation to the creative economy from the perspective of the consumer is actually I think an incredibly like Monumental shift you can speculate in the Future Fame of whatever you think is cool can I just read a quote because so we'll have to have you back on Brian because there's a whole other conversation if people will doubt what you just said which is they'll be like but no Brian speculation is bad we've people get hurt we've seen all sorts of things that's separate conversation let's park that for now I want to connect this copyright conversation to the Securities conversation we're having earlier there was a quote from your um uh your article by the way we'll share all of these links in the show notes guys so you have these um but uh you said this the nft market is really a Securities Market with authors as the companies and works as particular categories of shares we read that again because I think it's really interesting the nft market is really a Securities Market with authors as the companies and works as as particular categories of shares that is the connection Point here between uh you know security sparkly Securities as we talked about uh and nfts and that by the way guys is the justification for why Brian can write an article that says nfts are securities and that's a good thing okay so you mean sparkly security that's the thing I didn't get and you probably won't get until you read some of these things that we've been talking about or listen to this episode in more detail um and that's what this is really all about and you probably heard Dave and I get so excited about this and like talking over each other that sort of thing is because guys this is look we're starting 2023 it's like why are we here crypto why are we here we forgot why we were here last year didn't we uh we're not all these wild abuse chases uh why we're here is to solve public goods problems to solve Court human coordination problems without necessarily using the non-in internet native tools of the nation-state right these are opt-in tools uh and so that's what the crypto technology is it's a Freedom technology helping us coordinate better and after all isn't that what humans are here to do coordinate better isn't that what civilization is it's better coordinating this is a technology level up for all of us on the social layer at a level that is so profound and I think in In the Heat of 2022 and looking at SPF and and three hours Capital all these things people lose sight of that because they're so distracted by the scammers and shenanigans going on and they lose sight of why we're here but this exactly is pinpoint why we're here Brian that's why we're so excited to have you on actually talk about Securities uh you know not TM but sparkly securities yeah no this is great I really enjoy I really enjoyed I'd be delighted to come back anytime and I got a bunch of nft and web3 related papers as well as copyrights what's your next what's your next prank though buddy the next prank I love your trolls it's a great I don't want to spoil it but um okay I I do have it I I I'm a big proponent of plagiarism so I have I have another plate I have a pledge of tea paper coming out that's awesome we need more uh troublemakers in in the crypto industry of the good kind that Brian is not the SBF kind those are the bad troublemakers we wanted not yeah not not only am I a plagiarist but I'm also a plagiarism apologist so uh I I created with the help of some people at Creative Commons a plagiarism tool so all of my uh all the articles I write are available for anyone to appropriate as their own if they want to be the author of them all right well let me ask you this because you're a law professor right Brian so if I was in your classes is plagiarism uh legal for me can I turn in a paper that's plagiarized I encourage my students okay all right I need to hear more about this this is cool anyway we should probably close it here David uh Brian thank you so much for coming on this is exactly my pleasure the show I wanted to to produce and so thank you for writing your article and thank you for coming on and talking about this I think I hope a lot of the bank list Nation can uh walk away from this with a newfound appreciation for sparkly Securities and also where that line is between uh Securities TM and SEC nation state regulated security so Brian thank you coming for coming on and helping us tell that story my pleasure thanks for having me it was a great pleasure gotta end it here guys uh of course David is very sorry to all the board uh yacht club members but hopefully clarified this episode what he actually meant uh we'll include some links in the show notes including an action item read the article after copyright poning nfts in the cloud economy that Brian wrote um I'm a little rusty here but let me see if I can get out the dress and disclaimers David eth is risky all of crypto is risky so is D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us in 2023
