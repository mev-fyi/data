foreign ation on the Pod today we are talking about a more Cooperative Cooperative web 3. so basically what is the intersection of co-ops and mutualism with web3 technology so there's a really amazing paper that was just written on this topic and we've got some of the authors on the paper so uh George Oates who is at the Flickr Foundation Maxwell Cantera contributor at Bitcoin Sarah Hubbard who is um a public purpose fellow at Harvard's Belford Center uh for ethics and so basically these are three authors that worked on a paper called towards a more Cooperative web 3 and we are talking about co-ops and dials on this episode I think a really important subject as we try to figure out what Dallas are um is discussing how what the Cooperative movement and Dallas have in common so uh the values of mutualism the values of stakeholders over shareholders could be an important theme here and this paper in which this design space is explored I think is really an important foundational piece for exploring what more Cooperative Dallas looks like so um George and Maxwell and Sarah are on the Pod but I just want to give a shout out to the other authors uh avni Patel Thompson Ethan Nguyen George Oates Jad esper Legion uh Maxwell Canter more shed Manon I'm I'm doing my best with your names I hope I'm pronouncing them okay filamon Hawks Sarah Hubbard Scott Moore Stephen de Lovix Trevor uh scholes and qz hum are all authors on this paper so a broad swath of web 3 people have worked on this paper and we've just got George and Maxwell and Sarah here to talk about a more Cooperative web three I think it's one of my favorite episodes that we've done so far and you're really gonna enjoy it without further Ado let's get into co-ops and web 3. enjoy it working in web3 is

let's start off with a round of intros Maxwell you want to go first yeah definitely great to be here thanks for having us Kevin uh my name is Maxwell currently a full-time contribute there at the kikuendau uh in the public goods funding workstream where I'm focused mostly on kind of operations and supporting public goods funding yeah sounds good uh my name is Sarah Hufford I'm a product manager but I'm spending the year doing some academic fellowships where I am focused on researching Dows and web 3 policy great go ahead George thanks thanks happy to be here um my name is George Oates um I'm a designer software designer um but I'm um the newly minted director of the 501c3 Flickr Foundation uh flicker.org happy to be here great great so uh the paper has many co-writers and um I'll make sure that they'll get they get linked and credited in the show notes and into the show bumper as well um I really want to dive in on this paper that y'all published entitled towards a more Cooperative web three so why did you publish the paper and you know what what is the what is the subject of the paper yeah I'll give a bit of a review so a shout out to Jad esper because he really helped bring this whole group of different people together and organized a bunch of the discussions and uh all the co-authoring together but um basically it's a group of people who are all really interested in Dows and cooperatives and moving towards a more Cooperative web three uh and in general the paper it's a focuses on three main things so the first is we start off with this brief history of cooperatives and the decentralized web and how Dows have a very analogous ethos and then second we kind of go into okay now what can Dows learn from cooperatives and the Very like Rich history of cooperatives in the collective movement and then vice versa how can cooperatives benefit from a lot of what dowels are building and experimenting with uh and then yeah lastly and mostly just this call to action that web3 should lean into more of this Cooperative approach uh and potential for positive impact and that there's probably a lot of common solutions to be built for both of these groups mm-hmm yeah so I'm wondering if we can just take a step back and Define what a what a Cooperative is I think most of our listeners are are familiar with web3 but um when it comes to Cooperative maybe listeners aren't familiar with the Cooperative movement and what a modern Cooperative looks like maybe we could spend some time there yeah and general cooperatives have this very rich history I think in general I mean I'm not an expert in the space and the paper in general gathered an entire group of people with different backgrounds some who were experts in working with cooperatives um but my understanding is a lot of them emerged after the Industrial Revolution so mostly in the 1700s 1800s and in general it they have this ethos of like they're member owned and member operated um and so I think for people who are more Dow native crypto native you can uh see how that's analogous and like reflected in a lot of the ethos of dows today as well and and in general there's a lot of pretty popular cooperatives that are still working in practice today uh even in the United States there's ones like Landa Lakes there's ones like at the Green Bay Packers even right I mean there's a ton of really interesting examples of pretty big names and groups that are still around today that are cooperatives and I guess I'd also add in general they're kind of born out of like economic need and Injustice and necessity so when they're maybe trying to compete with you know huge corporate monopolies or when a community needs to support themselves uh people will band together and form these kind of collective groups right yeah I I was going to say but I think I might add to that as well Sarah is this uh idea that a co-ops kind of optimize for stakeholders or shareholders and I think it's it's this notion that co-ops are kind of owned by people who are impacted by them we kind of for this paper were particularly interested in platform cooperatives and this idea of platform cooperatives emerged kind of as an alternative to Big Tech domination where there's all these platforms that people use every day that kind of far reach their lives but very often these Tech platforms are owned by these kind of monarchs and these like run sticking platforms that don't actually generate any value for the people who create value on these platforms the users that extract value from users and co-ops and particular platform cooperatives is one alternative to that which we think shares a lot of similarities with dials and can like be greatly benefited from a lot of the crypto technologies that we said that our good time thinking about yeah so it seems like cooperatives are kind of a reaction to when you have a corporation you have a fiduciary duty to your shareholders to maximize value to them and that means that as a management team you extract from everyone else and with cooperatives um this is an alternative that allows you to focus on all stakeholders instead of just shareholders and that can be powerful when literally what you're building as a network and everyone on Earth is uh is is affected by by what you're doing putting stakeholders before shareholders um I can also see it being a competitive advantage in a network-based world where you need to assimilate information from the edges instead of just give orders hop top down um cooperatives aren't like it feels like they're in Innovation on a moral Vector because you're putting stakeholders over shareholders but in a networked world they're almost an innovation on an economic Vector like a competitive advantage to to have a networked Cooperative so um I I think I think that that's really uh elegant and I'm wondering you know what are the most promising web3 platform cooperatives or Trends in web3 uh that that you think um resemble uh The Cooperative movement where does web three filter in here yeah I think the way that we have kind of thought about this paper is mostly with Dao's decentralized autonomous organizations I think the past few years we've seen a lot of dials play out we've seen Dallas coordinate around tokens we've seen does coordinate around platforms and build things and fun things together I think we are often there's a lot of ways in which we see crypto being able to possibly impact the co-op movement I think there's a long history of folks like Trevor Schultz and Nathan Schneider and Austin Roby who have written and thought a lot about this work in the past and it seems like there's a few key ways in which crypto can possibly impact co-ops one of them the more exciting one of my eyes is this idea boosts dropping capital I think we've seen Davos coordinate around tokens which is an extremely effective model for being able to create a token and coordinate around it I think very often co-ops struggle with capital formation and being able to leverage tokenomics and being able to create Community currencies in a way where everyone within the co-op would own these tokens collectively I think is beginning to be explored vastly within Dows but largely kind of not really touched upon into kind of off-chain offline co-op world and I think to me that feels like a very exciting future step in Innovation and what it means to actually co-own things together in the way that is enabled and cryptographically secure um I was just going to say that that sort of came up in the paper didn't it where [Music] um um we touched on the subjects of accountability and sort of equity within within Dells and how distinct that is from operating the more traditional cooperatives and when I say traditional I basically just mean sort of offline you know where there's humans in some form of work a Cooperative let's say where they all hang out at the same building or whatever you know doing the job um but I I like the idea that you might be able to sort of insert Capital into a Cooperative digital environment um but you it's challenging with online Commons as well as off or online cooperatives as well as off to make sure that that sort of capital is distributed equally and managed equitably um yeah totally I I think it's it's a little bit easier said than done and I think what would be just phenomenal to see would be much more experimentation around what it means for these collapsing communities to watch out because I think and that land at least we've seen lots of positive examples examples where things kind of have run awry and I think we've learned that there's a lot of complexities around launching tokens and managing treasuries I think some doubt tooling has allowed us to be able to have more transparency when it comes to funds you know everyone kind of votes on Shane everyone can see the votes and then that can be executed on chain I think that you know painting with the broad rusher I think that could largely be applicable to instances of cooperatives where transparency is like a key issue um but yeah I think another issue is just kind of volatility and you don't really want your community token to be volatile and I think it's just now beginning to kind of come around this turning point in web 3 of you know maturity and seeing a lot of these models play out and I think you know down the line I'm very excited for the experimentation we'll hopefully see around these Community tokens uh that eventually hopefully becomes non-volatile and these communities can really deal ownership and also reliability right now because I think right now in some ways lots of crypto tokens and governance tokens aren't as reliable um as we think they should be I think I can also add building off of that things that I guess co-ops can maybe learn from Dows and like benefit from Dows a lot and some of the experimentation in this space like you mentioned Capital Access and transparency I think also this like very uh like Fast setup right like you can really quickly spin up an organization that has members from all over the world and that offers like a really interesting kind of scale and governance uh mechanisms that Dao's kind of naturally have and are experimenting with so there may be some really interesting tools and lessons that cooperatives can use or leverage from what dowels are doing um I'd also add there's like a policy component to it as well so one uh thing that some dolls have been trying to experiment with is this Colorado limited Cooperative associations right I don't know Kevin if you're super familiar with that but there's you know Dows that are now kind of using this Cooperative law in Colorado as basically a legal rapper and that's also really interesting and then affords them the ability to do things like you know engage with real world assets and limit liability and all sorts of different things like this so that's maybe another really interesting kind of crossover that's been experimented with in right now yeah if you're watching on a video you might have seen my deer in the headlights look because I'm in Colorado and hoping it wasn't uh gonna get asked to speak about the Colorado Co-op law but we're gonna have John power fromopolis who's one of the innovators behind that on the podcast soon and we're going to talk about uh the Colorado Co-op law I think it's really interesting so um you know I guess this is really interesting to me because it feels like in web 3 every time we turn around we see another pump and dump or multi-level marketing or like even outright Ponzi schemes and and just to think about using web 3 for more regenerative means for more mutualistic means uh it to me is really exciting because we can take co-ops and we can make them web scale Network co-ops Global co-ops with global ownership and so um I guess you know I I just wonder how do we build a different future for web three what what would you call a mutualistic web 3 yeah I think this idea of a mutualistic web 3 is something that we were all very excited by and United by as we kind of work through this paper we are all pretty inspired by the D web movement which predates web 3 which is essentially kind of the movement of take back the web which is a you know kind of promoting these alternatives to massive platforms peer-to-peer sharing controlling your own data and being able to publish and access no information um and we we think that yeah the d-web movement in many ways that Spirit has carried up to web 3 but there's also been lots of contamination as you mentioned Kevin with a lot of these pump and dubs and Ponzi schemes and capital you know very rapid Capital formation kind of going awry I think we we see the idea of mutualists with web 3 kind of being an extension of the t-web movement uh but mostly kind of like a current iteration of that whereby web3 is able to embrace acknowledged and kind of manifest a lot more caring values between people within the space I think you know we all like to think of web Theory as kind of multiplayer mode and I think this idea of mutualistic web Theory kind of Embraces that the idea that we're all here with each other and for each other and trying to build display world together and we hope that you know through some of these values through the Cooperative movement and through some of the d-web values that we can Embrace this mutualistic web 3 and create a better world together essentially I think how we might operationalize it but Sarah George anything you want to add to that kind of working definition I guess I'd add in in the paper too we talk a lot about both you know what we just spoke on which is okay how can cooperatives benefit from someone what a Dows are doing and this is like how can Dows benefit and learn from history and like there's a really rich history of cooperatives and of collective movements and collective intelligence and so uh really this is like a call to action to lean into that because I I agree I think you do see a lot of like signal and noise in the space right there's like obviously concerns and a lot of noise around okay well we don't want the tools we're building in web3 to uh basically end up like replicating the inequities of web 2 or like replicating plutocracy or having these you know huge controlling interests in each of these dowels right um but then what makes us excited and where we think we can head towards is uh you know leaning into the kind of better parts of what Dows offer and what we can learn from in the past uh to kind of get to this uh ideal mutualist kind of web do you think you want to ask George yeah there's one there's one platform that I've seen which I was really impressed by called open Collective um it's it was set up to kind of bear the heavy weight of starting up a kind of um off-chain charitable organization I'm not sure if I'm using off chain correctly there but you know it's it's basically a platform where um the open Collective group itself can manage all the kind of back office and financial Administration that you need when you're trying to be a little charitable group of some kind um so just that in itself I thought was a very sort of generous position um but also the way they've designed the open Collective platform itself you can have funders or recipients of funding um actual cash moves around the system as well so it's not sort of um it's perhaps a little bit more accessible in that respect just because you can sort of see the money as it were but also the um it has sort of collective bargaining and voting kind of baked into the software as well which I think is also really cool so if if I choose to donate some of my money to a program or a project in the system I can actually see how my money is being spent um and it's that doesn't happen very often I think at least in my experience where as a donor unless I'm donating a lot of money I'm not really sure where where my donation then ends up so there's a series of really healthy um um and restorative economic practices that have been established it at the code level by this platform um open Collective so I think we could all learn from that just the sort of level of transparency and also the type of support that that organization gives to little groups trying to do cool stuff I think in general the more really powerful examples we have like that of how uh you know the tech in web 3 can help power real world things that are impacting people's everyday lives like it makes a uh I guess it's easier to communicate with you know uh the general public and with anyone really to to help kind of them understand the value of what is happening in this space and the potential that it has and I think there's a couple of organizations that really highlight those really compelling use cases and obviously the more of those we have the better yeah I think there's this whole Trend around Exit exit to community that open Collective went through uh they started off centralized and now they're um in the process of exiting the founders to the community which makes them into a platform Co-op and one of the things that that I'm that I'm interested in is so platform cooperativism has the two components to it there's the platform which is you have like a network-based uh with network effects these these organizations will grow exponentially because their Network effects grow so how do you get it off the ground but also how do you set it towards a trajectory trajectory that's mutualistic over the long term and exit to community is that is that mechanism through which open Collective was able to do that grow their Network effects but also um move towards a more mutualistic Cooperative model over time instead of like selling to Google or ipoing or something like that so it feels like that being a more well-trodden path is really important for building communities and trust but um there's a lot of hairy questions around governance and how you build communities and trust and and things in there and you know I'm I'm wondering if that's where we want to go next how do we build communities and Trust how do you how do you do governance in a platform Cooperative uh environment we we uh we wrote the paper together as a fairly large group and you know we'd meet each month and sort of discuss the themes of the day together and one of the themes that kept coming up at least for me was this sort of opposition between exponentially scaling and trust and and even mutualism for that matter you know so easy for computers to sort of accelerate and get faster and better and you know bigger and stuff but it's really hard for humans to do that um and so you know there's a certain point where a human group just breaks because people stop knowing each other and you know like if you imagine all the friends in your Social Circle it's probably not that many as popular as you are but you can have thousands and mean you know tens of thousands and even millions of people in peoples in the people in these Dales another thing that we talked about quite a bit in the paper is how sometimes it's not always technology problems it always comes back to be like people problems at the end of the day uh and so we did talk a lot and how actually that was a very area that could use some common Solutions right like Dows don't necessarily have to reinvent the wheel in some regards like there have been groups of a huge amount of collective people coming together trying to govern themselves trying to uh you know figure out Direction and goals and projects and you know coordinating at a really large scale and how we could kind of learn from some of what they've done uh whether that's you know lessons in like communication and scaling and like polycentric governance so yeah I think there's there's a lot of interesting things to learn and yet at the same time I think a lot of the problems that Dows and co-ops have will kind of require some kind of common Solutions which is like trust is a common problem amongst all of those when you're trying to deal with human coordination at a large scale yeah completely I I think a a not ideal reading of the paper would be that web3 will solve all of the co-op problems that exist in the world I think that just like isn't isn't true and I think really the the goal of of this work is to try and highlight the ways in which yeah as you said sir we can like learn from the history that that was kind of the history of co-ops and co-ops and kind of learn about some of the new technology that might be able to enhance the work that they've done over the past number of decades and centuries I think when it comes to building trust it is such a difficult thing to do in communities but I think it's fundamentally like a very human thing and I think governance is tricky and as George is saying there's like some cases where inequity makes sense governance wise in the early stages like one person on vote early on is a good way to like get nothing done and I think issues that co-ops have had at scale is you know you kind of start to have this community problem of like every decision requires a committee and then every committee needs a bunch of subcommittees and I think there are ways that at like kind of democracy and that and that form can end up being slow and I think what we've seen with dials is that there is some Credence in some situations to kind of building stuff very quickly and breaking things along the way and sometimes that's a good way to kind of emerge and see what works best but yeah all of these different sorts of governance models have so many different trade-offs and I think there's just a giant need in my eyes for more case studies on things like Constitution data things like uh all these sorts of experiments that have happened over the past few years in crypto yeah I want to sort of repeat what you said about this Tech not being a Panacea so basically the culture and the human issues are not going to be solved by the technology it feels like it's even harder with platform cooperatives because if you have a global base of users stakeholders then you don't have the inherent trust that comes from being a local business in the same Community where you have these repeat interactions in positive some games um I think a lot of our trust issues across the internet come from the uh cultural and time zone uh challenges that come from being across the world from each other um you know not not to mention the sort of like phishing scams and like you know things that happen across the global web um because we don't have trust across the web so it actually feels like platform co-ops or higher stakes and managing the culture and the people is a big part of it and the tech is not a Panacea um so just wanted to to double click on that issue that's a that's a that's a great point Maxwell and Sarah uh next question uh how do we codify these values so we can program our values into our money with web3 uh at least in theory like but like how do we codify uh the the values that we're talking about in the paper into the organizations that we're building in web3 yeah I I think there's there's a few different approaches that we can take to kind of codifying these values I think the classic uh tried and true method is kind of creating a Manifesto I think in a lot of dials we we've seen this kind of work well of everyone collectively authors a Manifesto or kind of this foundational piece of um this foundational paper or a statement about why we're all here together I think we've seen that work well in terms of more technical components to codifying values uh I I am still so optimistic about the ways in which we'll be able to codify values into our currencies with crypto I think we've begun to see this with governance tokens for coordination amongst members of an organization but I think we've still barely begun to scratch the iceberg in terms of what's possible with codifying values I think experiments that we'd love to see happen kind of building off this paper are around what would they look like the kind of codified Cooperative values or for example the Rochdale principles of kind of open membership and control and trade and participation education into our tokens and what would that look like if these tokens kind of uphiled those values that we have versus kind of being the ends of speculation I think there's a lot of opportunity I think it is kind of at this point still a blank canvas in terms of what it looks like to codify values but it's there's a lot of possibility what do you think Sarah I think another I've mentioned in our discussions were a kind of vice versa of how do we have maybe even some existing cooperatives who already have like a group of people who have really strong values and principles and are working on something together and how can we have them maybe experiment or try some of these tools to help enable what they're doing better uh and so that was like kind of another route that we took as well and like in general that would look like how do we make some of the tools we use today much more accessible so right now I think you need like a fair amount of technical literacy and like navigating this whole Suite of different Dow tools uh and so you know somehow making these tools more accessible will help like adoption especially by these existing organizations um and I think one quote that reminds me of is like it's that one that's like the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed uh and so trying to figure out there's already groups that have these values and how can we help support them as well yeah I think that's such a great Point Sarah and I think something I think about as well when it comes to adoption of kind of regenerative crypto economics is that a lot of people in the world and organizations who stand the most to benefit from some of these Technologies I just don't have like their privilege of spare time to like invest to like learn how to use like a crypto tool or like learn how to set up a wallet I think a lot of these these folks are so busy doing work on the ground that matters that uh it's just they don't have kind of the bandwidth to like learn how to be literate in crypto and web 3 and I think you know a lot of things encryptos kind of boil down to like the issue of identity and ux and I think this is a great example of you know hopefully I think in the next few years we'll have a few leaps and what the ux for crypto is like and we'll be able to have these tools be available to everyone who doesn't need to like basically you know do the equivalent of like 100 hours of research to like become obliterate and that they can just kind of pick it up and then use these tools to to build um yeah things are specific to them it feels like um you know with with corporations we've had 200 or 300 years of evolution with what the corporate Forum looks like since the East India Corporation all the way to today when there's a playbook for companies and there's an ecosystem of SAS providers for them and with Dallas it's been like three or five years I mean a little bit more than that if you include maker doubt and just it's going to be a process of maturation so that we can speed run the history of finance and and see what works and what doesn't and then hopefully it'll be more accessible for anyone to create a platform Co-op uh down the line once once the Trailblazers have figured out what works and unfortunately what doesn't work one of the things that I thought was most uh was most fascinating about the paper was this idea of Eleanor ostrom's eight design principles for managing the commons and how they map to platform co-ops so could you tell us a little bit about how we take Austin's eight principles for managing the commons and how those apply to platform co-ops yeah I can certainly give it a go um was a 20th century theorist and she actually won the Nobel Prize for economics for her work on the commons as a concept in an economic structure um and into her research she proposed well let me back up and perhaps Define what Commons means briefly so back in the day when there were sort of landlords and peasants and people who sort of looked after animals and uh needed land to run the animals on uh the concept of a Commons a physical space came into being where um in a in a small group of humans they'd have a space that could be shared amongst that group of humans in a common way um common land and though that common land was managed by that group of people and you might have heard of a paper called The Tragedy of the commons which was written by a biologist in 1968 and basically this tragedy of the commons paper declared that the commons will always fall apart because eventually somebody will take a part of that Commons for themselves and unfortunately that paper's kind of impregnated everybody's opinions about The Commons since the 60s but Eleanor Rostrum who came came into the research World in sort of uh 80s 90s naughties she kind of turned that on its head and said actually no the commons needs to be managed by a group of independent humans who are all independent actors and they can negotiate with each other quite healthily and amiably about the management of their shared resource so she did all kinds of really interesting study in the Physical Realm about folks who um you know they might have managed the same fishing spot or a bridge that ran over a lake or you know they these were local community groups where everybody knew each other and she actually studied a whole bunch of these different groups ethnographically to try to find out the sorts of principles the sort of design principles that these groups operated under in order to maintain Harmony and you know shared management of the shared resource so today on the internet you do have these Concepts that call themselves The Commons but they're really missing that essential second piece which is management by the people who use the shared resource so in digital land you know for example in Flickr which I'm working with there's this thing called The Commons but basically it's just a bunch of free and legal to use imagery um that's not actually managed by any of the institutions who put stuff into it anyway um so in our paper that's linked to about this article we do list um eleanorstrom's eight design principles and I'll just I'll just read a couple of them really quickly so you can get a feel for them um you need boundaries not only about the commons itself but also the group that runs it um you need to be able to make Collective choices and those choices and the Dynamics to make those choices need to be arranged and sort of written out and agreed to and also refreshed periodically you need to also make sure that there's some way to resolve conflict if that happens within the group um so that's just three principles that are examples of the ostrom's 8 design principles and she sort of um universalized these these based on meeting a whole bunch of folks who are running comments and what we tried to do in the paper was map them to um a very old set of principles that were started by a group called the rushdale collective in England um over a century ago I think it was um but this was a sort of a worker Collective that ended up sort of providing all kinds of resources for the group itself but they actually so this group had a independent set of principles that did map pretty well onto austrum's Commons ideas and what we tried to do in the paper is say um what we're missing is the additional sort of contextualization of things like this principles like this in the Dow environment and the web3 environment you know so we were sort of saying in the paper you know what can we take from these two sets of principles and apply now really actively in the Dow space so for example you know of all the dowels that we've been chatting about um and all the project examples can we point easily to them having a compact conflict resolution mechanism um and my my guess would be probably not but that's a very that's a very sort of central um need for human groups isn't it because if there's no way to sort of sort out what's going wrong um the group will just fall apart no that was that was amazing George I I think thank you for that history um I I think it's the the through line as well with some of the web 3 components here I think is when we think about platforms and especially decentralized platforms and protocols we can think of them as the comments for example I think there's an argument who made that something like uniswap is a comment something like lens stir for example as a Commons these kind of open and permissionless platforms and protocols and I think there's a lot of learning that you know dial contributors and people who build platforms and protocols uh can learn from the awesome principles I know I could claim we were inspired by the ocean principles and we were thinking about our governance structures but I think it's been mainly aspirational I think there's so much opportunity for builders in this space to reflect on the Rochdale principles on The Offspring principles and think about what does it mean to codify these values and these principles and what does it mean to actually put them into practice I think we've seen some small examples but as you highlight George it's yeah there's still a long way to go and I think it's going to be an awesome journey to see different organizations experiment with ways that these values can be embedded from the outstand and the foundation and one area we started with was just even recommending that Dows like look and learn from these principles especially when as a group they come together to design and write their own Constitution or you know set of sets of principles for the organization to live by uh and then that helps at least on a you know social way help add some structure and guidance for the group agree I think it's it's um it's going to be tricky to map those principles onto Technologies I think digital Tech contemporary Technologies I think because you know it's so very simple for a talented um Team or talented engineer to spring up a piece of software that you know can take input and can have you know lots of people using it very quickly and for them there's also alongside that the expectation that somebody out there will fund it um which is sort of the opposite of the rushdale principles in particular where for example it's expected that every member in the collective will also participate economically um and actually I think that's sort of that's almost uh insurmountable um based on the sort of mentality that we've grown over the last 20 30 years of the internet to sort of you know oh I'll just make a great piece of tech and then somebody's gonna buy it that kind of stuff it's really it's really different so I think we've got to be careful that um trust amongst humans doesn't scale like technology does in fact it's just you know if you scale things too quickly in a human group it will disintegrate so I think when folks are starting stuff um with a good heart and lots of Hope um before you reach out for a big watch of investment it that's the time to look at these sorts of principles to really think about how you can structure the work that you're doing and the group that you're trying to make to make sure that every member of the group is aware that it's a member of the group and how the group's supposed to be working and that step's really hard to do well in Tech because you sort of have to greet everybody and that's also hard to do in Tech you know it's very sort of depersonalized in some ways but you you all probably know examples where it doesn't feel like that yeah that's a really an autonomous is literally in the name which is a bit you know a bit of a giveaway yeah I think that's a really great Point as well George I I think to double click on on something you said it's really hard to retroactively integrate these principles not that it's like too late if you're already big to like think about these principles but I think the optimal way to integrate these principles is from to outset like from the very beginning with like the core group of people to really think about building these out having these all present and building these principles in a way that will hopefully scale but they don't need to scale at the beginning you can't really often integrate these principles when things are at the at scale I think that's when it gets choppy when you know double standards things like that begin to emerge um so as much as possible I think concretely and tactically we might offer the advice to really begin with these principles from the outset hmm amazing I think Eleanor ostrom's work has been so foundational and I think that what you're doing here is foundational for a Cooperative web 3 movement so I've really enjoyed the conversation but unfortunately we are running out of time so um maybe let's let's let's end by asking is there anything that I didn't ask that that you want to say uh and we can just go clockwise on my screen maybe Sarah then Maxwell then George of the comments and with on an optimistic note I think that they're and there is again like so much that Dows can learn from this history of cooperatives and this whole Collective action kind of movement and so much that cooperatives can potentially learn and benefit from what Dows are doing uh and I think we should be really excited and optimistic about the future that we can create with these new tools and uh with all the learnings of the history behind us and arming us to you know build a more cooperative and Collective organization um and I think in the end my My Hope and my vision for the future is really that what Dows are doing and what cooperatives are also doing and by bolstering these kind of two groups up we can actually genuinely have more equitably owned and governed organizations in the future uh and so that makes me optimistic for what we're building yeah I am optimistic for the exact same reasons I think my last statement here would be uh to please if you're building an organization or thinking about creating a platform uh please read the Austin principles and the Rossville principles and think about how you'll integrate them from the outset I think something that web3 has lacked in my opinion is just like an equity mindset thinking about the ways in which we can build better systems for each other I think sometimes we get caught up in coordination games and forget about the bigger picture um and I think as long as we turn to these principles and try and let them guide us I think we'll all go in the right direction and I'm optimistic that we'll see lots of amazing and beautiful experimentation in this direction going forward yeah it doesn't have to be one thing or the other you know it doesn't have to be you know a giant crypto web 3 situation that everybody has to learn how to use and similarly it doesn't just have to be you know a green piece of Park that you can go and run your dog on but you the skill will come when you can take what's happened in history the things that have worked really well in history and keep them in the mix and you know groups of humans are really good at governing themselves and have been for centuries now you know so we don't have to chuckle that out and that's why these principles might be good sort of Spurs for everybody thinking about how they can make a more social technology um but yeah don't Chuck out everything that's happened before because some of it really works well um but figure out how you can apply it to what you're doing so your tool is more social and more caring and more human well um I really enjoyed reading the paper we'll have a link to the paper in the show notes definitely recommend that everyone check that out and uh Sarah Maxwell George thank you so much for giving a little taste of the paper I think that um it's a really important one so encourage all the listeners to go check it out thank you peace and love y'all take care thanks
