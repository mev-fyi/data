paypal is planning a stablecoin maybe now this is leaked news so paypal didn't come out and say it but somebody was like digging into the code and found references to paypal that it would be backed by the us dollar but how big would that be if paypal issued and launched their own staplecoin i wonder what that would look like and how that would change the conversation about stable coins in the united states pretty bullish from my perspective i mean i guess the competition isn't all that crazy there's really only usdc and i guess also paxos i'm not considering tether as part of the conversation because it's offshore uh sure i guess there could be more competition in the stablecoin space we'll see how paypal uses its influence to penetrate its own stablecoin into the defry markets
