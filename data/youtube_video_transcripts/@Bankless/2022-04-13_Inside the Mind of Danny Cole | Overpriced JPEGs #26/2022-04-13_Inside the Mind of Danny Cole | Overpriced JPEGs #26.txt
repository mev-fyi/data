i am so excited to talk to danny i'm sure everyone who's listening is familiar with danny as the co-founder of the creature world project and the artist behind it all um i've admired danny for quite a while now and admired his work for quite a while i'm a creature holder it's on my twitter page so i really wanted to get inside danny's brain or i should say i'm sitting here with him still i would like to get inside danny's brain so that is what we were going to do here today right before we get started here's a word from our sponsors wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into

mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 somebody was complaining not complaining was levying a fair criticism of the april out i've heard a couple different criticisms of it but one of it was like why did why wasn't distribution of apecoin tied to how long you've been holding aboard ape like so uh i mean i'll tell you exactly why they wouldn't take that into account because if you were taking into account how long somebody had held an ape for that would be an incentive um [Music] against market movement which is something that benefits them so it would be them stabbing themselves in the leg if they took that into account so great point part of the reason i bring this up is kevin rose is launching moon birds like the latest in his proof collective thing have you followed this i know you're like basically do art so i don't know how much your heads up to the rest of the i'm not going to let you know if i know this or not but i suggest that you explain it for the viewers they've only done one twitter space about it but you know kevin rose host of proof major both defy and nft podcaster and and investor and uh he's launching mood birds and for this is a mechanism they're putting into place which is that the longer you hold there's gonna be a staking mechanism they're calling nesting because it's bird um the more you'll be rewarded they're like yeah that goes counter to the us getting secondary sail piece but it also is fewer flipping like it instills the community that we want to have so it's like what are you trying to you know optimize for there's something really really odd here that is like in the mix what products outside of this space do we buy and then ask like what is this going to give me now it's like usually we're buying things and it's like you get what you purchase but as soon as it became the standard in the nft space and i'm not saying that like this is entirely wrong and i definitely like um you know i like to make products that just keep on giving but it's it's it's odd to be in an ecosystem where every product is expected to keep on giving and not only that but more and more a standard has become not only should should my my product keep on giving to me but actually it should pay me i should be paid to buy this thing you know it's like yeah i would love to buy a money printer too like is that legal am i allowed to buy that that would be great um it's it's really um it's hidden it's hit and unsustainable oh my goodness and i'm hearing this now from from founders over and over again like the when utility meme is like a very lived reality for founders and it's completely unsustainable like nothing is enough anymore i'll give an intro to this podcast at some point but let's just go with this so how do you feel like it's evolved do you feel like when you launched creature there was that same level of pressure or when you launched creature when you were first getting into nfts did you feel like you could launch something with art sort of for the sake of the fact that it was art the spaces developed and evolved a lot when we launched creature world um there had been sort of a number of og projects that had come out and the majority of them we're not through the lens of this is art um a lot of them were much more adjacent to technology to cryptocurrency to finance um and yet we were still referring to a lot of it as art and i'm not here to define what is art but from just like a general consumer standpoint a lot of it wasn't things that people would have looked at and been like i understand this to be art so when creature world came in and was like we are making an art project um that was that was different it got people very excited i really feel like we were embraced with quite open arms for that um yet at the same time the market that we were engaging with despite having experience buying products and engaging with products that feel so much like ours for a lot of people is their first uh interaction with art and it actually it set us up for some um very unique trials and tribulations um when people grow accustomed to i'm engaging with an nft what do i expect out of an nft and so much of what i preach is there is no singular this is an nft in the same way that there is no singular this is a physical good um you know you don't hear people being like i'm yeah i'm into physical items i like physical items you know it's like that can mean a whole lot of things what kind of physical items are you into it could be an infinite amount of things but obviously everything is really closely tied together when it comes to nfts because the space is so young the technology is so young we really have to work with each other and and and build off of each other's advancements etc so a whole lot of people who are doing a whole lot of different things are united by the technology that is powering all of these very very different missions and what we wind up is with this early culture of this is an nft this is an nft and nft is about tokenomics if you talk to one person an nft is about dows if you talk to another person no an nft is a digital product where your ownership of it is digital too and nft is a unique indivisible item on a blockchain um you know whatever an nft is whatever you make as an nft but because of how tied together we we've all sort of defined an nft in this very nascent stage of what this is but like to your point we don't ask what's a physical item i think about it all the time in the context of this podcast which i have an nft podcast but that'll be absurd at some point because nfts are in the sports world they're in the music world they're in the uh you know entertainment like they're they span all these industries and it's already happening but it's nascent enough that i can actually cover all of that but at a certain point that will no longer be the case you know absolutely that's what you're getting at 100 um but the interesting thing about watching this space develop is because right now there is a space around nfts it's not around what are these specific products there's a space around nfts um anything that is done in one area of nfts is kind of um encompassing of like now this is a part of nfts as a whole so watching this space develop there is there is nothing quite as exciting as holy [ __ ] i just got rich for a lot of people for and and and that is you know the biggest news stories about anything to do with nfts um so when you have first people are like trying to wrap their heads around you know what does it mean for me to own this jpeg what does it mean for me to own this is it about bragging rights is it about investing and then people come with an answer because everybody wants to have an answer because an answer is validity that what i have is valuable what's the answer utility my image has utility okay well what's the utility and some of the some of the earliest answers to that are well this image is valuable because it's tied to this other thing that i know is valuable it is my access to this thing that we all know is valuable so my image as access pass must be valuable does that mean your image is valuable or does that mean that this other thing is valuable your image is just a key to something valuable you have a really expensive key that you've decorated in a very odd seemingly not connected way okay but people kind of take it um a step further of like you know we are going to do this we're going to do that be it you know dao's tokens um until in comparison all of these products that are really so so different from each other it can feel like well this thing that i bought that is in the same format as you know an art piece for example is actually a money printer how come my other thing isn't a money printer and it's um that's that's one part of the development of the space that i have seen but it's not something that i don't understand first of all and um and i'm a human being i am i have the same vulnerabilities as anyone else where i'll see board apes but out of apecoin i'm like i wish i had an ape right now real nice beer dropped a hundred grand i feel really good exactly but it's just very it's all very indicative of uh what are these early days of nfts and it's yeah it's this very interesting moment of like there actually is a thing of nfts and we have not lived during a time period you know i'm not here to talk about history i don't know much but it's not like there's been a time period that i know of like wow like we're uniting around in the early days of physical products you know that's that's been around it's it's a it's a it's a new frontier right now that's small enough for it to be um very interconnected and what does the future hold well assuming that that enough people see use cases for the underlying technology which i do and i i believe if i see value in something i'm not i'm not any different than you i'm not any different than you but you know that there are other people that are going to see value i think that the biggest the biggest shift ahead in the trajectory of of nfts is in the form of almost normalization is in the form of more and more products being created as nfts that aren't intended to exist as not being marketed as an nft it's just the technology is existing there in the background and you may or may not even be real like aware that you were interacting with a blockchain if i had to learn all of the things that i had to learn to engage with nfts in order to be on an iphone it would be much less less likely that i would wind up owning an iphone um yeah you got your start were you on super rare was that like i know you before you launched creature world you had been in this space observing it sort of as a participant sort of as a as an observer for for a little while at that point right i i um i was first introduced to nfts in 2020 my introduction to nfts set me on a very unique trajectory um the first thing that i wanted to know when i heard about nfts was essentially why are people valuing this why are people spending money on images as an artist wasn't that somewhat intuitive for you well my first interest was not how can i do this it seemed pretty straightforward how can i do this you'd do it i was just like i want to understand what the appeal is for the people that are purchasing this so i reached out to this guy who i was able to track down as being like a really big collector of nft artworks and i came with the question why do you buy this stuff and instead of answering that question which in the moment could have been frustrating but it wasn't what he did is he told me one after another about these different art pieces that he had and what he loved about them and i walked away that night understanding this is not digital ownership this is ownership this is no different than anything else that that i that i buy um and as i tried to explain this to some people i used an analogy initially really focusing on um you know this is pre any real focus on utility stuff like that you know um i explained to people my favorite record that i own is tapestry by carol king i have some contenders that follow it but like you know best-selling album of all time at one point really yep as it should be dethroned by thriller i believe or it dethrone thriller whatever it is shout out carol king and uh you know my favorite record i own is tapestry by carol king i do not own a record player and this record lives in a metal crate that i found in my father's childhood basement i don't even have it on display i own it and it means so much to me that i have it and that was my initial understanding of nfts it was not that this is much that this is as much about bragging rights as people wanted to say as much as about having a way to engage deeper with a product and have it be yours so that was my initial understanding and the more that i got into it the more i saw potential for that unique relationship that you can have with something that's yours where it's different because it's yours that doesn't have to be some invisible thing that doesn't have to be solely an emotional thing there is this world of potential that kind of swept over me where i have my eyes open wide and i'm like whoa we can make art that does very different things in a painting we can make art that you are able to engage with very differently than a painting and that was really appealing to me because guess who doesn't really like paintings it's me i don't really like painting really no totally um and that's not to say you know i and i like i like a lot of my paintings yeah i do and there are paintings that i've seen that i've loved but with my my relationship with a lot of the visual artwork that i've seen is like i wanna i wanna fall asleep i'm bored i'm bored what do i do i look at it cool now i've looked at it what next you know how do i engage with you but i find an album and it's this like fully immersive experience it's it comes over me it's incredible and there's so many experiences there's so there's so many forms of creative output that really compel you so much let me you're making this point that i think is really interesting around this the stagnant nature of paintings and i think that's what you when you say you don't like paintings it sounds like that's it's sort of coming from that so i want to ask you there was a moment in creature world uh where i think you were i'm not gonna get the language exactly right you can tell me but it was like i've solved nfts or like you know like i've sort of figured out how to explain why this is something yeah absolutely i think people maybe were confused yeah by it uh but i think it cuts it it speaks this heart of suddenly art basically is no longer stagnant yeah absolutely can you articulate like i stand by every single thing i said and and and but i just like to joke around and things get like you know things can get lost in chance did you get backlash for people like what you was that a thing oh my god i would if i had to guess how many people told me to kill myself i mean i shouldn't act so shocked i know what the internet is but it's still so mind-boggling i had to guess how many people wrote to me and said you're a piece of [ __ ] you should go kill yourself um like some variation of that it's in the thousands like it was crazy so okay let's walk people through this so you you were sort of you put out i think a letter on twitter and and again there it was sort of on this theme of like i've solved nfts which i don't know i didn't say that you didn't say that but but you can tell me the exact language yeah but but for me as somebody who hadn't even met you before but had like you know i'm in the creature world community like have a sense of you i was like you know you're you like it felt very danny cole you know and i feel like the vast majority of people were able to read that and be like that's interesting but you have a subset of people so was it after that letter or after you announced what it was that people were really coming after okay so let's let's give some content let's give context um so what i said was the majority of people in the world do not understand why should i own an nft why why should i own this why is this an nft you know and um and that this real gap in understanding is from this place exactly what i'm talking about of i don't understand how me owning this will allow me to experience it any differently outside of financially and pair that with the majority of the world not being investors not actually being interested in even being an investor because they're not qualified and understand that you know people are like it's not that people don't understand what an nft is people do people get it they understand what an nft is they're just like why in the world would i ever want to own this i think that's such a good point because we're like most people don't understand it and i think it's like no they get it they just don't get why why it's interesting they don't get why they should want it yeah and part of that is you know we're talking about i have this art piece i have this art piece and i love this art piece and people are like haha i just screenshotted the art piece it's mine now too and you had to pay money for it and people's big argument was well i can sell it yeah it's like i don't give a [ __ ] if you can sell it like i just saw the art piece you know so what is an answer to that you know what is an answer to no no my relationship with this art piece not with this security not with this this financial vehicle my relationship with this art piece is different my experience of this art piece is different because it is mine well i don't i don't i i i really disagree with this idea of assigning utility to things assigning utility to things like it's you know it screams this thing that i have doesn't matter so i don't inherently have the utility therefore i must say i'm going to attach something to it that that i know that you see value in it's like cool your thing is worthless like it's an overpriced jpeg exactly exactly um i sincerely care about the art that i'm making i care about the creatures i care about the creature world and as an artist my goal is to bring people into that world of the artwork i want people to sorry no no i want people to be able to like get lost in something so what you did and because i think what you did is really cool and there's actually a profound point here that i think may have gotten lost to folks in the hullabaloo of both this space and and people backlashing or whatever a lot of people understand it now okay i think i think people do too um but i think it's worth saying for people who who weren't following along at the time which was basically these various journeys that the the creatures could go on and it was you know on you on your desktop wherever and then depending on how that played out the creature itself evolved and the art evolved and there were mouths and and and the look of the creature changed to your point now suddenly you have a piece of art that is evolving with you as a person and is evolving with your based on your experiences that's something that a painting on the wall can't do um and it's to your point it's fundamental within the piece you're not assigning certain value to it it's it's sort of happening naturally with naturally not probably the right word because you're you're doing it but um i think that's really cool do you have anything you want to say on that did i articulate that properly how would you describe it in a very like straightforward way i have an art piece i'm able to go inside of the world within my art piece we made these 3d immersive environments where people could enter the creature world from the perspective of their creature and you land in the creature world you know this world inside of your artwork and you go on an adventure and the big thing is that there were many outcomes to the adventure that you go on and based on which path you took your art piece would update and become this more deliberate reflection of you yeah now to me the place that that comes from is i think a lot of artists have this experience of discovery through the act of creation i know i initially considered painting to be this experience of the first time i met myself that makes you want to cry it's like i i felt like i never had a way to embrace myself to have a conversation with myself and then through the through the act of creation all of a sudden i'm like i'm having a conversation with me i'm learning who i am and that's helping me to love myself well i had the opportunity as a result of this technology to put other people in those shoes and say well you have an art piece that is magical you have an art piece that is magical and as you go and exist as your creature your artwork is going to be this reflection of you because you chose to engage with it yeah and um so it's like you know why why own this why should i own this art piece how is it any different if i own it well look what i can do i i'm making it you can become a co-creator in the art what i love about it too it's for the same reason that i i really like space doodles and found that interesting because we speak a lot about digital identity in this space and nfts as a reflection of digital identity but i think what what you're doing what you did there what space doodles did are starting to show the mechanisms by which these can become identities that are as dynamic as we are as people right like one ape is is a silly way to you know demonstrate our digital identity and i get excited about this kind of stuff because it it reminds me that we're in the very early stages of playing with what all this will become down the line um and that pushing of the lines i think is really interesting yeah there's there's honestly so so many things to delve into here one thing i would love to touch on is what was the reaction to the release of the creature's journey and why and there's not one there's not one reaction and there's not one answer why um overall initially there was um let me ask this when did creatures come out creatures in uh august august 2021 and from day one you you were like there's a journey and you had it planned early i'm sure things are evolving but like you had some plans for the journey that the creature world and the creature holders and creatures would be going on that was august of this project so when you talk about the reactions would love to to like kind of ground people and where in the timeline you're talking about as you're talking about those reactions sure absolutely um i mean there's so many factors that i'm not going to be able to touch on every single one um but one component of reactions was a result of the space that we're operating in which is when you tell people i have something amazing i have something amazing that we're going to do and when a lot of other people that are doing very different things that you are grouped with their version of something amazing is um i'm gonna pay you yeah i'm gonna make you a lot of money um what we have here is something um a little bit less tangible a little bit harder perhaps a lot bit harder to grasp and then what we also have here is sincerely i'm not saying that um you know first of its kinds are better but trying ground that hasn't really been tried um and what we had here was an experiment a successful experiment is something is an experiment that you actually just execute and collect data from so to me it's you know the most amazing success um i learned so much about how i could accomplish immersing people in a journey of discovery better for just trying something and i'm going to try something again and again and again and every single time i'm going to look in the mirror and i'm going to be like i hate you i hate you why don't you put me through this i'm going to be like i hate you now let's try it and um there was a very interesting component of the mix that um and again i'm not touching on everything and but but but i'm touching on the things that i that i care the most about one thing that i really um felt firsthand was getting things is very fun it's very exciting change is very scary yeah so why do you say getting things if you give me a gift yep you're like if you're like danny i got you a new car i'm like damn that's so sick now imagine you come over and you're like danny it's your birthday you know what i got you i completely remodeled your cars interior and exterior i'm like what the [ __ ] like i don't know if i'm ready for that like i i feel like i got to know my car as it is yeah um but so what are you tying this to it sounded like almost you had the experience of getting a thing and then we're in the experience of having to change so i thought it was funny to make a really big deal out of the first change of the creatures as a result of your journey being as simple as the expression of its mouth and going so over the top on that um typing it out posting memes being like like we had horse-drawn carriages now we have the tesla oh yeah this was the creature what's it gonna be now like being like this is the single greatest innovation of artwork that has ever happened for it to be the change of a mouth um because it really wasn't about and that is funny yeah no i thought it was hilarious that is very funny a lot of people didn't you know but like also i'm gonna do it again yeah you know so well how much of this too is it is you know i think about the journey of creatures you launch in august i think it was very shortly after launch that garyvee started talking about your project yeah it was like day two the day and i'm sure that was awesome and you're glad for it but that probably did attract people to your community that like they weren't attracted for it based on what you had been saying or you know what you had been kind of putting out in the world they were attracted because they were like oh my god gary v is going to make me money i want to go buy this thing it'll make me money sometimes you enter a room for one reason and then you discover your real purpose for being there people are not set in stone in what they appreciate in um what they're looking for out of something um and we are all united in our humanity in you know we we are all emotional beings that's all we're here for to experience emotion um so sure some people came into creature world and were like i want an investment and for some people that priority was so high up on the list that they were like i don't i think i want to put my money into a ponzi scheme because i know that if i'm early to a ponzi it's going to be really profitable yeah and um power to them yeah but there are you know i think there are a lot of people that came into creatures that might have come in initially and been like i want i want what i think an nft is gonna be and then they learned what creatures were and they were like wow this is a different experience yeah and yeah i love creature world i will say like as somebody who also isn't like a painting person and has never been like i'm much more of an auditory i love music sort of probably less visual creature world was the first project for me where i was like oh like i get this art thing you know like i was like it made me feel something and i just interviewed few who i think i mentioned new fellowships mentioned that i just interviewed him and it's i have a similar feeling with with fewer's work like both of you produce work where i'm like it makes me get why people buy art and i hold creatures and i'm you know a big fan so um i love that you know i'm not surprised that other people kind of like me have had that experience of being like i'm here because i like this feeling and it's um it is a different kind of project and you're you're pushing the boundaries in in a whole bunch of ways technically as well which we've always tried to get into and we'll we'll yeah we'll get into all that um thank you so much ferocious is here to change the world like um and it's you know an honor to be spoken about in the same breath as people that i look at as like like you're you're gonna save somebody's life you know like that's the way that i look at felocious um but i want to quickly finish one point about change and then i'm like and then i'm super excited to to delve into so much else um you know so i make this whole big deal out of something amazing is about to happen and for the results of it to really be like the only different thing that you're going to walk away with is that your creature's mouth is different but that's not really the product the product is the way that you're engaging with art it's you know the path of engagement with art well the way art is engaging with you i think that's what it is it changes it to make it a two-way street as opposed to one way 100 100 um so i do it i i do the product that i made and um 20 seconds before the journey closes and every change is set in stone i changed my creature back to the original creature change is scary and i and i recognize that there is that component of this isn't an easy way to learn it puts you through these like the uncertainty of like you know you encounter an art piece and it feels like this must be the way it is for a reason even though in actuality the assembly of all of these art pieces was done by a random algorithm but i look at them and i'm like it was this way when i saw it and that's how it's supposed to be and for me to come in and change that i know how human i am and human we use in this language as synonymous with imperfect you know the human touch is imperfection and i'm like do i want to take something that when i found it it was perfect and turn it into this unknown of is this how it should be and it's amazing that some people have the certainty of saying this is how it should be i'm not one of those people well what's so interesting about hearing that you didn't change you ultimately kept the creature the way it was is even that though to me speaks to why nfts using the broad sense of it are valuable because we get attached to them right like that what that also demonstrates is an attachment you had to this work of art right like the way you have an attachment to tapestry you know and to your record um and all of that i'm finding that now like i got into this as a curiosity and and not like oh i'm a you know an and v friend was my first nft that of course went way up in value very quickly which is a very fast way to get very interested in something to the point you made um yeah me too man i i was so close well we won't keep going it was so close getting a gift go and then my money was getting locked up in coinbase i haven't really told this story before anyway but uh the point being like now i'm somebody who's like attached to my nfts and can't sell i can't sell ones even when they go up because i'm like but i love them um that's really cool for me it's it's it's really important to make a product for people where the the reward the benefit of of having it is actually the experience of having it not um the experience of calling the right moment to get rid of it exiting it um and it's um it's an interesting place to be when as a result of market demand the entry to a lot of this is so you know like exponentially higher than what these items were sold for and how that has to be taken into account now of like um you know you're gonna have to change and correct course based on the understanding that there are people buying this stuff for a lot more money now so let's take it back where did you grow up i grew up i'm afraid that people i'm afraid of people on the internet because um when i i when i put out creature world somebody recorded my voice on a twitter space and fed it to one of those algorithms that allows you to like make it sound like somebody's saying anything and then tracked down my grandmother and uh and called her using my voice and said that i was in a lot of trouble and that i had hit somebody with my car and that she could not call my mom and i needed twenty thousand dollars immediately and please don't tell anyone and also that i'm in the hospital right now and my grandma was like holy [ __ ] she's crying she doesn't know what to do and she calls my aunt not my mom and she's like i just got this call from danny and i don't know what to do and she's like i guess i have to like rush to the bank and like try to like get him some money to help and my aunt calls me and she's like and i answer it because i don't really like i don't know i my phone is ringing all the time but it's very rare that i get a call from my aunt and i answered and i'm like hey what's up and she's like where are you right now it's like i'm like working and she was like so you're not like in the hospital or anything i was like no like and i found out what happened and i was like damn people are crazy um so yeah i mean if you don't want to share details you don't share anything let me just say like that's insane yeah how like how are you doing like how do you feel on a day-to-day level well so i'll answer that okay but i i'll tell you i grew up in a really small town with a population of like 5 000 people okay um can you give us a state are you comfortable giving us yeah i grew up in a really small town in new jersey a population of like five thousand people um and um did you go back ever very rarely very very rarely um i'll tell you a few stories that really are everything that anybody needs to know when i was very young my mother would play guitar she would play guitar and i would stomp around like a little dinosaur and make up stories in real time to go along with the music um i went to preschool in what i now know to be the basement of a church which i didn't at the time know i just thought it was like preschool you know yeah that's where i show up every day they walk me here and hear him yeah exactly and the preschool activities that they had for us were we could play with shaving cream we learned how to cook and we could finger paint and i what cooking are they having are you doing it for there was this there was this lady named granny and she was the oldest teacher in all of new jersey and she she taught us how to cook i didn't retain any of those skins um but so i would finger paint and i started finger painting this character like a self-portrait and i was lucky enough that that drawing that picture became muscle memory to me at such a young age that when you get older and you perhaps lose some of the wonder of being a kid stomping like a t-rex telling your stories you know when that feeling subsides and you learn a little bit more about what the world is which my mother tried so hard to make sure i would learn at the latest age possible um there was something that i had also learned which was the muscle memory of drawing this picture and i kept on doing it and i kept on doing it and that is the creature that is the creature that's the same thing that i draw today um you said that the first time you painted it helped you understand yourself or put you in touch with yourself was that as young as preschool were you okay because the thing is i i i didn't think of that as painting um that muscle memory of drawing this being kept me in touch with this amazement this divinity of of the world that we're all born with of anything that you see is just filled with possibility and even though my relationship with it continued on throughout the years in this form of muscle memory in this form of just drawing this picture without really giving any thought to it it was this tie it was my only tie where i was holding on to something and when i went and said i'm you know i'm going to try to make a painting i was 17. wow five years ago yeah i mean you're 45 but yeah you know i look phenomenally young for my age because i follow all of gary vee's instagram post advice um there's you know actually i'll i'll out myself for a second they're they're they're and then this is gonna whatever i'll go back to this but um a friend of mine runs this uh you have to have her on she runs this thing mad realities oh yeah the like the reality show oh my god yeah i would love to but she's actually like a genius yeah she's probably the like probably the smartest person in the space like genuinely wow but um recent nyu grad right probably yeah okay um so i see like gary posted this video and it was about like stay-at-home dads but he was like um he was like you don't know how many men i'm starting to talk to in dms that want to be stay-at-home dads but the beginning of the video is him just being like you don't know how many men i'm starting to talk to and i'm like this is yeah i was like this is a perfect promo for mad realities like this is so on point so i sent it to her i'm like like just this clip like you don't know how many men i'm starting to talk to i'm like this is perfect for promo and um and they put it up but in the bottom right corner it's very clear that the profile it was captured from is mine [Laughter] shout out garyvee so but so i st you know i i'm i'm holding on to it by the way you can maintain that motion the entire time you're talking that story i'm like he's just staying tethered to his childhood put it down a little bit um know when i went to make my first painting i was in a really tough place um and i found myself there all the time like like the reality is that a lot of mornings i get in the shower and i just say to myself i'm like you know you can't possibly just keep doing this every day you know you can't possibly like but then i find myself in the shower again the next day i'm like i made it another day you know where it's like um i'm no stranger to feeling the world for all that there is to be felt you know um but so i was in a really i was in a really hard place and and i decided i wanted to make a painting because i wanted to get lost in something and all those years you know i had held on to that tether i had held on to this thing not even thinking that i was holding on to something and i go to draw the only thing that i've ever drawn and as i pull that in closer and closer and closer i find myself in that place of wonder and there are so many different ways to describe this it this feeling um somebody that i trust a lot told me that we are born into divinity and that we are conditioned out of it do you believe in god i don't i wish i did i might who knows yeah i might decide to one day because it seems better maybe i do what is god i don't know i i believe that there is so much that we don't understand and i don't want to embarrass myself by acting like i have it figured out but and with that maybe what we don't understand is god and and and and we just you know we use a lot of different names but i pulled myself to this place of whatever that wonder and divinity that we're born with such a close connection to at such an early age i found myself there because of this great miracle this great mistake that i had developed a muscle memory that could take me back there

points that i was so much thinking about the now not about what's ahead the next you know um but when i did think about it i was like i want to be a rock star or something like that do you play an instrument yeah i can play a lot of instruments actually you strike me as someone who you've got that kind of mad genius talent thing where it's like i just picked it up and what do you mean it's hard yeah i mean well so the first instrument that i learned was drums and then anything else like drums and mathematics are the same you know the construction of a beat is math um and from there because i learned drums so young i must have been five years old um so many other things that i approached in my life i was like this is really just drums this is really just math this is um so that's not how it works for most people though i feel like that's not like a normal thing that it's like well of course now i can play the guitar it's just math yeah well i guess think of it this way um with drums there is a sense of this is where i'm supposed to hit yeah and at this time and perhaps there are nine drums on a you know i don't know what kids people are rocking with i guess an average kid is actually one two three four five um but then you know you got the symbols so it adds up and i was really big on like oh like let me add a cowbell let me add a wood block until there's more and more places for me to hit you pick up a guitar and it's like okay there's just more drums there's just more drums and and it's still the same hitting on a rhythm so i did find it like somewhat approachable and easy to pick up new instruments um so you always want to be artistic like you were clearly always artistic not that that would have been a question but even if you did think about your future it would have been in the arts in in some form uh a personal question which you can decline to answer or we can cut or i don't know if you've said it publicly did you graduate from high school i did okay and i didn't want to go to my graduation because i had already started doing my art stuff while i was in high school and i had you know i i had gone on tour to coachella and like it was directed you were on tour in what capacity i was um i was directing creative directing for and doing the artwork for portugal the man um and they were headlining coachella so we got to like share that moment and uh so i had you know the creatures like so big at coachella and and then i'm doing my first show in new york while i'm still in high school i'm not living in new york um and i was just like yeah i'm not like i i was gonna go to college because i thought that's what you're supposed to do they tell you you know you you you finish high school you go to college and then you get that piece of paper that says you're ready to do whatever you're trying to do and i realized like wait i'm i'm already doing it yeah like it sounds like i'm gonna have to stop doing what i'm already doing for somebody to tell me that i'm allowed to totally so i was like i'm not going to college i'm going to move to new york and and why did i want to move to new york because i was just like that's where the people are you know i wanna i want people you're in the town and five you're like you're you're closest city is in some ways new york probably right you're in the town of five thousand like get me out get me to where the people are i'm like what's happening i'm like if i have something i want to be experienced by people i have to go where people exist um but um it came time for high school graduation and i was like i'm not gonna go and my mom was like my mom was my teacher in high school were you homeschooled or she just was a teacher at the local school it's a funny question um yeah she was a teacher at the school okay my mom was my teacher and the funny thing is i my home was also my father's business so i would go home to my mom to my i would go home to dad's business and go to school to mom's business i liked it um but um you know it gave me a lot of opportunity to to learn from my creators you know but um so i told my mom i was like yeah i don't want to go to graduation and she was like danny for me for me she considered it to be her greatest achievement of her life that i graduated high school um and she was like just let me have this moment of people knowing that you graduated um and and the headmaster of my school you know is like my father and him are like around each other at graduation and you know they're like shaking hands i guess and he's like you know we're we're really going to miss stan and my dad's like really how are you were you a troublemaker i got in a lot of trouble any stories you can share publicly i don't wanna but like maybe i don't know i mean they're all so funny but like um it's maybe for another day but um but yeah it was funny my dad was like really yeah it was like for the entertainment you caught me you got charlie's gone i'm so ready for him to go wait so let me just um timeline set here so you're 17 and you make your first painting 17 would be a junior in high school nah it's also a senior night you were a senior in high school you made your own idea okay but like i'm just trying to get to the point that you start painting and you're touring coachella it must have been within essentially a year of each other yeah so that's so wild so um can you just fill in those gaps a little bit i can well as a matter of fact i was fair that's what you want um yeah you know i i started painting because i was so lonely like that's like where i was at i was so lonely um and i needed something somewhere to get lost in um and i found that place i found that place the second time i made a painting it was this very spiritual experience and it's funny i like never use the word spiritual honestly like is this cringe who knows looking at conor my spiritual yogi my vegan spiritual yogi um hitting my dying jewel for a second yeah we're getting deep here you know you gotta it's really dying it's so sad um so i um i needed to get lost in something because um with my eyes open looking around me um i just couldn't bear the way that i felt you know just what life felt like um so i start i started painting you know first with just the intent to get like lost i guess um and um [Music] all of a sudden this place that felt and looked so happy to me it was becoming real right in front of me and because i could see it i was like this is real and as i would make these paintings i'm like going on this journey inside of my mind maybe it's not my mind i don't know maybe it's real but i um i'm finding myself somewhere else somewhere that feels much better and at a certain point i was like i found something amazing and if anybody else was feeling this right now we would look at each other in our eyes and and and there would be this moment of did you just feel that did you just see that this is amazing but i would have these amazing moments on my bedroom floor and i'd look around me and there would be nobody nobody there you know and i was like that you know i i i need this to be real what is reality which camera what is reality well reality is whatever we agree upon it's it's reality reality is shared um and i was like i want other people to experience these pictures and i understood here is my picture and there are people in the world i gotta bring my picture to those people one by one by one i gotta do it um and i could tell you a whole story of every way that i went about doing that but everything is summed up by this there was something i wanted people to see and i asked where are they and i brought it to them yeah i mean you could call it that um or you could call it talking you could call it having a conversation you could call it um spreading your wings um and most people that i reached out to and i said hey i have something amazing do you see it like do you see it too like would you show this to anybody most people never answered like maybe 99 but um all i all i wanted was one and i got a few um i got a few people that answered me and said i see it uh and let's do something one of those people took me under his wing and said i'm going to help you throw your first show and taught me this amazing lesson it's the most important lesson maybe it's not maybe there are more important lessons one of the most important lessons i've ever learned which is it's definitely the most important lesson for somebody that wants to do something i feel like we're taught you got to get your foot in the door you got to get your foot in the door and then you got to be let in and what this dude taught me was look through the door what's happening on the other side of that door you can do that those people don't have a different brain than you what are artists trying to do as far as i can see knowing nothing what are artists trying to do they're trying to show in a gallery what does a gallery do put a painting on a wall and they invite some people to come see it to come experience it i don't know about you but i actually know how to use a hammer i'm familiar with nail hammer dynamics and i actually also know how to write down an address with a date and time and i know how to hand that to some people and that's what we did nicole thank you so much i agree you know uh and we did it and without the context of this world telling us you can't you can't you can't that would not be miraculous whatsoever yeah but it's something that so many people myself included at some points in time could not fathom that you can just do it but we did and i was like oh my god you're telling me anything that i want to do i can just be like and we're gonna do it and we can figure that out and that's what happened um and with portugal the man uh you know they did the same thing and i you know it's and i know i know it's it's on purpose because um i do it too now where john the singer was like you know you're gonna have to make all this stuff and i was like i don't know how to make all this stuff uh so if you could give me any uh you know any people to assist me obviously and he said no you'll figure it out and you did like way better way better yeah absolutely thank god that that um thank god i learned those lessons um and the real lesson here is like truly anything is possible if you want it to be and there is you know there's so much more that could be elaborated on that but genuinely firmly against any argument that somebody could make against me anything is possible have you read the book no that's an indication that you're not a big reader okay well i was only going to raise it because it's a book called the war of art and i i mentioned it i'm reading it and i mentioned it to to fuocious and they were like oh my god like he was like i literally like i read that book at 14. i love that book it's like why i'm the artist that i am today so i was like wondering if this was had made its rounds in like genius artist circles and i'm the last uh person to find it but um it sounds like no when i was in fifth grade i was in english class and they had us reading this book where these kids like snuck into a museum in the middle of the night and oh it's i know the book because i also read it in fifth grade and i can't remember the name of it and and the brother and sister are like eating some chocolate bar that they found and the sister scared like oh you can't eat that i remember reading some passage and i know what passage it was but i won't bore you i thought to myself i cannot [ __ ] believe that they have me doing this i will never do this again and i never read a book again all of high school all of middle school i did not buy a single book for school i did not read a page i was like i'm not doing this again and i didn't and i stuck to it i did actually wind up i can see why your mom was so excited i wound up reading one book though um in recent years and it was because and my friend was like it's just like the creatures there's this one part that's just like the creatures and i read it and i was like yeah it really is just like creatures i like this um and um i'm not gonna say the name of the book because i don't want to encourage reading okay what's so funny to me about that is like for me the getting lost in another world thing is books you know like that is such a sanctuary to me so that's hilarious about that yeah no you're so right but very much but for me i'm like i want us to get lost in other worlds together well and that's you know to bring i guess background to to creatures and as the the world evolves i mean that must be something that feels so exciting to you about the metaverse and about what is the metaverse yeah well you know i heard a verse real i heard a really interesting i don't know what you want to say definition of the metaverse that's probably overstating it but um i think it's the ceo of every realm um metaverse investing company anyhow she made the point that right now if i like go on to whatever aritzia's website to go shopping for clothes and my best friend is also on ritzy's website shopping for clothes like i don't know that but that the metaverse in the future will be that everything's sort of interactive and to we're like if i'm shopping for clothes with ritzy and my best friend also happens to be there like i'll be aware of that because we'll be connected well only if i'm there too you know so the point being like you know and i'm you know optionality in that i guess right we all want our privacy to some extent but like that connectivity um right now again talking about one-way two-way streets right now the internet is very much like i go to it and i'm alone there and that those barriers will be broken down i thought that was a really interesting way to put it um i i really genuinely like the direction of um of this idea of like the metaverse actually seeming to highlight what it seems that this idea of a metaverse is highlighting more so interpersonal connection digitally instead of being like i'm speaking to everyone and i'm hearing from everyone um i like i like the direction of like that one-on-one connectivity um it's cool to me where are you seeing that in the because i feel like the metaverse is sort of everyone yeah i mean well it's just the idea that like if we're going to kind of pull a lot of what it means to live in this world and replicate that digitally i like that i can sit down and have a conversation with you um i go on twitter i have a conversation with you it's for everybody you know um you know i um i think you're describing private chats though and you could say that 100 i understand but um but i um i like the idea of more of the time that we spend online highlighting our interpersonal connectivity more um as like you know i i'm maybe i'm seeing the metaverse version of you but um i'm seeing you also there's like quite literally not a metaverse like the metaverse does not exist and um well if you just define it as the point of the point of time when we start spending more of our time digitally than irl then we're all in the metaverse is that i mean is that what it's being defined as though well it depends on who you ask i mean it's become one of these words that means different things to different people and i think ultimately i don't think that'll always be true i think ultimately that we will have a clearer picture of like what we consider the metaverse yeah i mean i like saying it like as a joke like is creature world intended as a metaverse i mean the word world would lend itself very well to a creature metaverse creature world wants to exist and and creature world is excited to approach any way to actualize itself um but it's not specifically intending to be a metaverse okay so this is so interesting because of course you're speaking about creature world as if it's an abstraction separate from you and you are not its creator which i understand the divinity like it sort of arises from you i'm sure there's lots of different very interesting ways you could articulate that but it actually gets to something that i think is so fascinating about you and i want to like put this observation about you out there and just see what your response is which is folks who maybe heard you on twitter spaces heard at moments as an interview encountered you like you have this ethereal like quality that's very um kind of divine like kind of out there almost kind of disconnected from like the world you know like you're in your own universe and yet and i think that's a beautiful thing about you i should say and yet you're obviously very successful at a pretty young age which means you're like you're ambitious and i don't think you're cut throats i think you're kind but like to be successful like this at such a young age like you're you're sitting there writing the emails or whatever it was like you're how do you balance this or i i don't know that it's that they're uh they're competing but i think that's very interesting that balance of sort of like i'm in another world's but also like i'm here and i'm [ __ ] killing it well you know i'm definitely not cut through it okay but let me tie that to the point you just made which is you're describing creature world as if it's something separate from you yeah and and that's kind of ethereal and kind of another university but like yeah you're making it happen and you've got a lot of fans and you've and you know you're gonna drive the thing in the direction it goes in yeah it's that sort of reconciliation you know like um it's funny i i literally said to connor yesterday i was like they need to know that we're like self-aware when we were putting out this entertainment when you're putting on putting out this like announcement um for like some stuff that's coming and i was just like let's make clear like that we understand how big or not big of a deal this is so they know like because i'm like i think people don't think that i'm self-aware that's what i'm getting at is like you almost give that impression but i know you really probably like you can't get to where you are right now in life without being self-aware i mean maybe you can but i i don't think so i think you're very bright you know and you know what's going on in the world thank you um the art pieces that i've made that i would be most proud to share i struggle to feel proud of as the creator of um because i feel like i cannot take credit um i think a lot of people have that experience of like you know i'm just a sponge and i'm noticing something that i really really care about and it is my responsibility as a human being to try to elevate that because i understand that if this made me feel good you know this will make my neighbor feel good this will make my sister feel good um we owe each other we owe each other so much um i i've heard people say like the things that you're saying right now and i kind of just like don't even i just like i kind of brush it off because i'm like they don't realize but they're literally just like me you know like um and in what sense like we all have our fantasy like i you know i like fantasy worlds or what are you describing um how different can you and i really be well in the scheme of the world yeah for sure of when i tell you i'm anxious you know what that means oh yeah when i tell you this is the happiest i've ever been i wanted to cry you know you know what that means our human experience is as close to identical you know in terms of like what we are capable of experiencing i'm just like i really just i feel like all of us have our amazing um unique differences that allow everyone to be this well of knowledge that you have the opportunity to learn from but the things that make us similar are greater yeah in my opinion and it might be also the level i i think of your authenticity right like you're feels like you're very just like yourself and not everyone we're all in different stages of being able to be ourselves you know um so that's something perhaps okay i'm going to turn this back to creature world so we've established we don't know what the metaverse is therefore creature world may or may not be gearing itself up to be a metaverse we've talked about the members is just like what no like the metaverse is a buzzword sure okay oh we can agree with that but and we can still think though that there are interesting ideas that are worth talking about that require the word metaverse to have the conversation like what like a conversation about will we end up in ready player one i think that's an interesting conversation do we end up in a world where we're all like sid in oculuses or some other brand and like to have that conversation without using the word metaverse are we there right now is it yeah are we well that's don't take it there danny i'm trying to talk about creature world try to talk about your art okay uh creature world lab i'm gonna miss that i'm mixing that up cause i'm on my notes in front of me creature world we call it yuga labs um i am cosmo de medici um conor is the head of creature world is it a lot of connor's the head of creature labs creature labs okay so um tell me what creature labs is and yeah let's you know what let's just let's just talk let's let me run you through uh let me run let me run through a few things really concisely creature world started about five years ago with this idea that an amazing magical world could be made real and that it could be a place for people to escape to together and it could be a place where we could see each other so clearly you know with these sort of avatars of our souls as the creatures even when it started from this place of paintings it was these really open-ended paintings that had so much thoughtful consideration of let me put this in a place where i'll be able to see myself in it you'll be able to see yourself in it this is a bridge this is a connector we will be seeing each other i throw my first show and there's this amazing lesson of i can do this i can do this there's also this amazing lesson if i don't want to do this you know um damn this is so [ __ ] boring putting paintings on a wall is this really if the goal is to make a world real and to have us all be able to go there is this the most effective way to go about that and the answer was glaring no so the next show that i threw was this real immersive experience and then the next one more and more and i could get into the details of what these shows were and they were everything from painting scenes from a story and telling the story live collaborating with chefs to make meals where the ingredients were designed to solicit a physical reaction that would carry you further into the story each dish corresponding with another chapter to writing plays and performing these plays inside of an art installation while the audience is also inside of an art installation of the creature world 2 with live musical scoring from four bands and every intermission is a rock and roll concert you know through all these different ways to say hey how can how can we bring this world to life how can we make this real defining reality as being this shared experience kovid comes kobit comes and i'm like everything that i have planned everything that i have been figuring out how to do i can't do it anymore what am i gonna do and there was this massive need for connectivity when the only tools that we had to connect were digital and perhaps covet made that come now but let's zoom out you know that's the direction that we've been moving in so we asked ourselves how can we create art where it's home is these screens these screens this telltale sign of separation degrees of separation between us how can we use this to get even closer not only compensating for the separation but actually getting closer than we even are oftentimes sitting in front of one another and there comes creature world self-titled because it's the first thing that deserved to be self-titled um you know the beatles put out the beatles it wasn't their first album we call it the white album um it deserved to be called the beatles you know um i don't know i like abby road and sergeant pepper's better but shut up debate that another time yeah no that's interesting continue i'm loving what you're doing here we come and we say well how can we grab all of the tools available and create things that will unite us with what we see as being why we're here that is to feel to discover to connect with one another to empathize to see and to be seen and as a result of the new potential created by all of this very new actively unraveling technology around web 3 we got to say well we're going to make some first of its kind art pieces that have the ability to take all of this connectivity that has been explored through art and say well what does it look like to take that to new levels or perhaps just experiment because it's not really for me to decide what is a level up i am i know it's level up to me so you know there's the initial creature world collection and the initial crucial world collection you know we spoke about or maybe this is going to be out of order so there's there's the ability to enter that world inside of your art and have your engagement with your art actually respond to you in what your art is in your art evolving to become more like you you know to answer you um then we have creature labs and it's all the same thing it really is all the same thing but it's helpful to organize sometimes and creature labs is literally a laboratory of creating new ways for us to participate with the things that we think matter so much the most recent thing that we did with creature labs um was called the traveling creature and the traveling creature follows this story of a spirit that was born in the middle of the woods and a spirit's only way to exist and adventure and travel is through living beings so when a spirit is born it enters the heart of a living being and as we go about our days and interact with one another the spirit will travel from me to you to whoever you interact with to them to them and um and here we have the story of a spirit that was born in the middle of the woods entirely alone and had no way to travel which was its destiny to travel so time goes by and it you know it is it's unable to to fulfill its destiny so this energy is building up and it's just growing and getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until this spirit is as tall as the treetops and this creature in a nearby village looks out in the distance and it sees something odd peeking out from the treetops and it goes closer to inspect and it starts walking into the woods that this creature and the spirit meet and the spirit grabs the creature and flows into it and all of a sudden the spirit has a way to travel and the creature screams and it runs back it runs back to the village and you know this is the start of of the spirit being able to travel fulfill its destiny it's the traveling creature because you know what the spirit's a creature too it's complicated so we we took the spirit from that story and we made it into a token and you know it's it's easy to get lost in these technological terms you know i believe that the best products are the ones where you're so immersed in the product you don't really care is this a token is this what is this you know it's a spirit that's what it is you know and um so we have this spirit and um i perhaps i start out with the spirit when i send it to you because you know the idea is that the spirit would continue to be passed on from person to person creature to creature i've seen my eye when i send it to you there is this really meaningful gesture and connection of us engaging with one another i give you the spirit that memory of that interaction between us is immortalized we made it so when i send you the spirit it generates a new art piece of my creature and your creature together automatically and it gives it to me to remember when i reached out to you and now you have the spirit and you give the spirit to andrew yang and that interaction between you and andrew yang exists forever now and it deserves you know these little interactions that we have each other with each other deserve that level of care you know that because they are so meaningful and we're immortalizing them by making it so these new art pieces are being created as a result of as a result of our interactions with one another what we wound up with was in six days like almost 2 500 of these art pieces being created um and now we took the traveling creatures back home we're giving them a moment to rest and then we're gonna send them back out again when i send you the traveling creature the art piece that's created is my creature with its blue and desert yellow and its cloud suit and its hearts on its cheeks and all of its glory actually floating in a way that it's compelled towards your creature which is equally compelled towards mine with all the features that make your creature yours and every time this spirit is passed around it's this chain that's created from one person to the next person to the next person to the next person these new pieces are being created it is it is a progression of the current artwork that you have and acknowledgement of the connectivity with everybody else that's on this journey with us and a reason for us to unite with one another that's the traveling creature so that's awesome i thought i didn't participate in i have i i what the [ __ ] i was tracking traveling creature and it's been such a crazy week so i like wanted to i so but here's what i was gonna say i reached out to my chat on discord called creature crew which we formed when you did the playground hell yeah and so what i was gonna say is the pedestrian version or like i don't know if that's the right way to say it but like danny would say this in a very like beautiful way and what i would just say is like it's a community building exercise which is like but in in it's not it's not but i was going to say in in the realest way possible like so to tell you my experience with playground i'll bring it to traveling creature uh you did you did a thing where you airdropped everybody who held a creature a different piece of what turned out to be a creature playground and there was like a mushroom and there was like a swing set and you know whatever it was six or seven pieces and then what you were supposed to do as the individual was to uh group up with everybody who had the piece you didn't have so that you have a complete set for this playground and you had to give all of the individual pieces you'd give your piece to one person within that group of call it seven people and then if one person had them they could log in and basically say we have all the pieces and then in return you would get your um you get your playground what was so cool about this and again this will get me to traveling creature was and to your point about people having this market mindset you've got creature this very hot project you've got gary vee has talked about it shaq i don't know if shaq at that point had his creature or not i think he did it was right around the same time because it was like a shack in my creature playground group was in my group okay classic um and so there was this question of like this thing i was just airdropped does this have value and you just want me to send this to what was for in most cases certainly in my case like a stranger like i just have to trust this stranger with this piece of thing that i was airdropped that might have value and it was so cool and we all were on our discord group we named a creature crew right and like i was one being like all right i know it's like not this space to do this but like i'm not going to send you my thing if we're all just like a non like who are you you know and then like i talked about i'd work for andrew and they're like oh my god we love yang and then like you know we kind of came this little group that we were talking and hanging out and of course we all sent our um our things and got our playgrounds back and it was another moment was like oh my god this is exactly what danny is intending and so so many pieces have been connecting up for me as you've been talking and as you you set out this whole story in some ways saying like it was how can we make these screens you know the a tool for connection as opposed to this thing separating us all now that we're uncovered and you can't do your immersive experiences i was hearkening to oh my gosh that's exactly what happened for me with this playground thing i was like this is so cool i'm meeting these people and they like yang and you know and we're having this connective experience because you forced that you know in this very cool way so now i'll fast forward so when the traveling creature was happening it's been a really busy week for me i was like you know tracking what was happening but i hadn't done probably all the things i needed to do and so i popped back into creature crew which every so often comes sparks back to life somebody sends something in there and i was like are you guys doing traveling creature like you know i want the creature if one of you guys gets the traveling creature like you know my eat address is open basically to like be scented and i'll send it to one of you um so i i i totally know you're like it's not a community building exercise that sounds like you know we're doing free fall exercises at like our corporate retreat but it's like it's a really cool way to build a community and you know force in the best sense people to interact and connect with one another it's art serving its purpose yeah i really i love hearing that story from you i am it's it it hurts a little bit that um with all of the financial incentives within the nft space um that you have to compete with financial incentives um what you know it's just such incredibly different things that are being made but the same area of our brain the same amount of uh of attention you know that we have is uh it has to be delegated i've been plotting and planning and making the things that i think will be the most exciting a win for me a win for me is that whatever we make is so exciting that i'm excited about it yeah and that and that that everybody is very excited about it you know excitement is a great motivator so i'm gonna circle it back i brought up this book the war of art which is what prompted me to learn that you don't read um i'm illiterate yeah i can't read um and i think you would enjoy it should you ever decide to venture into a book again it's short it's like you know the the pages will have like half whatever you're not going to read it got it um but what's so interesting it's it's basically and now this is going to be the second time on a second podcast that i'm explaining this to people and it's kind of a weird book to explain so i apologize to the listeners but essentially it's like this writer's journey with what he calls resistance which he very much treats as distinct from himself and abstract from himself which is like all of the urges that i think most creators deal with that like to not produce the procrastination the fear that won't be perfect whatever they actually are he personifies in this character of resistance then he personifies this character of the muse which was sort of reminding me of things you were saying because the muse just comes right and the point of the book essentially is that if you just do the work and you show up every day to enforce yourself to do it and be kind of disciplined about your art the muse will come the inspiration will come whatever you have to force it in it and what this gets me to is i'm curious you seem like somebody who just produces and just like prolifically produces and i think you may be one of those unicorns but i'm curious about your artistic process are there days where you're like i don't want to do this but i have to because this is now my job and what i do is produce art or for you is it always just like it's inspiration no no not those days um really yeah you always just want to produce and create well i i remember there was a time when i had you know i'd started off with the creature and i thought to myself did i just trap myself i'm i have to do the creature forever now this is [ __ ] so i said you know what as scary as the sleep is i'm going to separate myself from this commitment to the creature and i'm going to make what i really want to make let me find out what that is turns out it was the creature it's important that i'm making what i want to make and the answer that really is it's the creature but i just needed to know that that was really what i wanted to be doing um and there are times when i'm like wow there's so much pressure um i was that what i asked about pressure i know i remembered but um you just said the word you're like i'm gonna give her a little reminder um wow there's so much pressure this and that any reason for me to be like i need to take a step back when i take a step back and say okay danny it's time it's time to take care of yourself what do you want to do it's making things it's making it's making things i um and it's important to have those moments of like all right i'm done what do i want to be doing and it's for me it's always the same thing it's always like i i want to be moving i want to be making um it's what makes me happy you know there's a very interesting thing that is and i realized it was interesting from the reaction of this reporter when i said it to her okay the article's not out yet so maybe you should have published it faster um there is a first of its kind impact on mental health that um i think i'm getting one of the first windows into that in some way shape or form is going to become really widespread for me as a creator i am in one of these unique first positions where in real time anything i say or do will affect the market price of creatures and anything i don't say will affect the market price of creatures morale anything it's real time response and it's an understanding that if i am not living up to expectation the people that that will hurt the most are the people that have shown the most care to me yeah that's so that is interesting yeah and it's now more real-time and responsive yes than it's ever been able to be before because the comms are ceos of fortune 500 companies not even just fortune 500 public companies if i'm a ceo of a public company you saw this when elon musk went on to joe rogan and smoked weed and tesla's share price does something right but it's you're right that it's not as quick it's not as responsive it's not the same it's people who have typically spent like decades kind of getting themselves to that position you're an artist who's been thrust into this and that's wild and i and i speculate that in some way shape or form this experience that i have is going to um be shared by just the average person well and here's also why this is going to grow because the beauty of crypto is the is the creator empowerment piece and we talk about sometimes like the tokenization of everything and and creators now in a in a greater way than ever before are able to have financial success and tokenize their work or their career not just physical you know not just artists the flip side of that is exactly what you're describing which is if they've tokenized something of their work they have a whole body of people that they're beholden to or who expect something from them beyond just that quid pro quo i went from being thrust into adulthood moving to new york being like damn i don't know if i can take care of myself in the moment it's like well i guess financially i can take care of myself now i got to take care of thousands and thousands of people um that's um you know if they're i don't know a greater motivator to um to be like all right you know let's step up to the plate and um i'm happy it's me in this position because i really do care a lot of people don't you know um and i i i hope that people are looking out for themselves i hope that people are taking care of themselves this ties into this question about the pressure and the the feeling of the outside world wants you to do one thing or expects one thing and how do you stay true to what your sense of a true north is what what's the what's the metaphor is it it was it was it it wasn't um oh henry ford henry ford said if i asked the people what they wanted they would have said faster horses yeah oh i love this for so many reasons i'll tell you but that's beautiful yeah um i would i want is to serve to the best of my ability um so i'm pretty comfortable with that um i am up for this you know and um i'm not i'm not going anywhere and there's this very weird thing in um in the nft space specifically where it seems like people have to make this promise of like i'm going to continue this forever i'm going to continue this forever like most of these people and most of these projects are not going to continue forever and and i think that it's really honestly better if people said like yo this is the start this is the journey this is the end um i totally agree i've said this in the podcast before i've asked guests who have projects like doesn't the foreverness like don't you feel that there's this foreverness pressure that's being put on you and doesn't that scare you because when i get asked why don't you do an nft draw for your podcast i'm like i'm not ready for that commitment at all like you know because i'm not ready to commit i love doing the show i want to do the show or some version of this kind of forever as far as i know right now but like that's i agree it's too much pressure we're putting on people but hear me out are you ready yeah forever is not actually that long forever is not that long how much how old am i really gonna get you know like um and it's a lot less scary when you think about the scope of something like 80 years it's not scary anything about dying [Laughter] exactly um you know it's a lot less scary when you think about the scope of like you know if anything thinking about how long i have to live i'm like that's not that much time i'm i really i gotta move fast if i want to fit in all the things that i'm trying to do in this life and some of the biggest things that i want to do i'm afraid i'm not going to get to do during this lifetime you know what are some of those big things i genuinely want to go to another planet that is like filled with life um a new form new forms of life that i'm not familiar with yet plant life animal life maybe something different um and i want to just discover and i and i i'm afraid that i won't be able to do that and that makes me sad you know um come on elon we're rooting for you bud but at some point somebody will be able to yeah um i hope for some reasons i hope that comes now um i also understand the great filter theory i understand that discovering alien life could actually be really bad for us whatever [ __ ] it you know i want them aliens yeah yeah but um for somebody like me where the rest of my life is undeniably tied to creature world at a certain point we can end the experiences related to this collection of ten thousand artworks and anything i do the rest of my life will continue to to contribute to it totally that's not the case for a lot of things there are cases i you know i'll say it i'm impressed with you labs and i think that you labs is doing really cool things that will do really good things for board apes you know um i'm not here to talk down on any projects i'm only talking about positives you know like the exceptions are all of the other ones yeah how much of the next journeys that creatures will go on through creature labs or elsewhere do you have plans do you have thought out can you share anything there's a lot um what i really want to be able to maintain is whatever people think we're going to do i don't want to do it um because that sounds so [ __ ] boring then you're giving them the faster horses yeah and you know and i i'm a human being i give in sometimes and i i'm like okay you guys want more clarity let's give you more clarity you know this is a framework and it's like as soon as we establish that framework i'm like all right now let's break it yeah i loved and i've said on this podcast before and other projects have sort of done this since but you were the first project that i saw do it where you were like what was it did you have a road map no you had no road map right no you were like no and then also this was it it was the no road map and then people were like when rarity tools and you're like we're not [ __ ] doing rarity tools and i love that we were the first we were the first yeah give us our flowers so i think you were right and i yeah certainly for me that and i was like yes i love that and that was one of the reasons i wanted to buy in because i was like i clearly you had a vision and for me it was so not about like do i love this or i love that i've happened to love what you've done but it was like i want to support somebody with a specific vision like you could just tell you're going to be here for the long haul like you you had a place you wanted to go with this and i want to support anybody who like has that and you being like no to rarity tools no road map at a time when it felt like that was everything yeah i was so into that thank you i really appreciate that no i definitely what i'll tell you the future of creature world is going to be is just like continuously coming out of left field um and there's a level of trust that you have to establish and in order to be able to do that and it's not it's never a linear path where for some people when we put out the creatures journey and that was this art experience and people were more desiring um a tangible independently valuable asset um they were like trust is broken and for a lot of other people it was like i trust you like this i trust i trust that this is like literally just different yeah and um and that is what we will continue to be building yeah um there are like i could i could give you insights to some of the stuff that's coming um but um you know but [ __ ] you barley yeah it's like would you why how can you be excited when you know what's gonna happen um you know it's like i am [Music] i'll give you an idea that we didn't start building that i feel really tied to that i that i'm going to make at some point okay um and it's artwork that destroys itself oh yeah you thought change was hard wait till it self-destructs um but we haven't that's not what we're focused on right now oh okay well because it's like i wouldn't i'm not gonna tell you what we're doing right now fair enough fair enough um very cool i'm gonna make a cartoon show also so let me ask you that we talk about the metaverse put that word aside yeah like is that something that appeals to the idea of and it would seem like it would if you want to get creature world everywhere like that style of distribution shows movies etc a show a show okay specifically yeah well well you don't watch either i guess right so how would you even know what a show is i have in my life watched some television i've been grudgingly been entertained before and felt pleasurable mom was like don't watch tv okay and i was like okay and and my sister was you know me and my sister responded very differently to things my mom was like don't watch tv my sister was like i'm really into tv yeah i was like okay i'm not watching tv my mom was like don't eat junk food you got to eat healthy and i was like all right i'm eating healthy i do to this day my sister was like i like junk food but you know we all had the things we chose to listen to because my mom was also like don't sneak out and do drugs and i was like not that one you know um but um you don't do drugs now do you feel like drugs were part of your artistic development no no it was just an escape no i was never i was never addicted to drugs or anything like that yeah um no i just uh all respect to people that enjoy drugs i i you know i think that drugs are a powerful thing i personally with what i am looking to find in my life um i think that it's more likely that i'm going to find it in in places that are more catered to me i think it's more likely that i'm going to um find what i'm looking for through shared experience through dance through meditation through creation um maybe even through shocking myself going and saying i'm gonna shoot a gun you know like i'm you know yeah okay last question does your headmaster know how successful you are now do people from your hometown know what you're doing i have no idea i have no idea would that feel satisfying no no no i you're a better human than i am yeah i am i have only i only have gratitude you know you can still have gratitude and still be like hey you thought i you know you were glad to see me gone well look where i am now no no no because like had one moment of my life been different i wouldn't be here yeah but that's again i think those are compatible ideas you can feel grateful and be like awesome and also like look i made it is this making it i guess you tell me i feel like you've made it no no no not at all um i'm like i've taken the first step um yeah no this is like this is like patting myself on the back for doing the first problem on my homework being like i did my homework it's like no like um yeah i um i don't know what anybody thinks i i i don't know what i think you know i'm just following where i feel compelled and trusting that that that feeling is probably wiser than me hmm danny cole thank you so much thanks for coming on this is a pleasure like i just so love getting to know you as somebody who admired you from afar and admired your work and the project and now getting a glimpse
