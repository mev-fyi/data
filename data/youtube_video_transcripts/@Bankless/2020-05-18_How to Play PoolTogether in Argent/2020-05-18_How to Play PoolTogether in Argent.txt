all right so it's finally here you can play pull together on the new argent wallet so in order to play uh you're just going to click the button at the very bottom of the screen that says invest then choose whether you want to play die or usdc the die pool is the larger one that has a larger weekly prize the usdc pool is the one that is awarded daily so it's a much smaller prize so i'm going to choose die and then just click the orange button that says buy investment and then you can decide how much you ultimately want to play so in my case i'll i'll buy a hundred tickets with a hundred die and once you click invest that's it it is uh one click no transaction fees and it should settle in about 30 seconds or less those tickets are transferable and remain in your argent wallet so if you did want to give tickets away to a friend you can just send it to their ethereum wallet and then you'll notice on the wallet dashboard or like your listing of tokens click on the finances tab and this is where you can see your pull together tickets show up and there they are that's it
