somebody who says hey I have my money on coinbase or Gemini I would just like to take self-custody of your assets like where do you start with that first of all you want to make sure it's a reputable account like a coinbase maybe a kraken I'd put there and then you kind of have to weigh it David because you have to weigh the risk of one of these exchanges going under versus your relative's risk of losing their own keys if they mess up a setup and this is really important I actually don't love going through the process of teaching friends and family unless they are kind of coming to the table with their knowledge and their learnings and they're asking you more specific questions right because if you got to do the work for them then they weren't really ready to hold on to their own keys and self-custody you kind of have to just like hey you can leave it on Exchange until you're ready to move it off and then I'm happy to give you some help or pointers or that sort of thing but like making them do it themselves is kind of a key because that's like an acid test of are you ready or not
