e thing is interesting we have the number two currency that's going from proof of work to proof of stake now whether or not that's a good thing it's irrelevant but the structural fact is there's less issuance of it it's the only currency that's of this size that's doing this switch i love this trade because that can be wrong on the fed and still make money in my opinion on ethereum because the structural flows are dramatically changing in such a way that it gives i think the price enough upside to overcome possibly a negative macro environment and that's the only trade that i see right now with that sort of setup and it's a one-time thing so you love this trade because you can be wrong on the fed you can be wrong on ethereum even winning like another competitor could blow past it in the future but it doesn't matter because this is a structural change it's a one-time event and the flows are fundamentally changing and that's kind of like guaranteed as long as the merge is successful and so this trade is like a no-brainer yes
