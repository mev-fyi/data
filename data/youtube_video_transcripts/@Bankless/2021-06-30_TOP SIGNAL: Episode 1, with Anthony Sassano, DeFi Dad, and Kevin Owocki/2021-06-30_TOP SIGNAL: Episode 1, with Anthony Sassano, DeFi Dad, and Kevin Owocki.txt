all right ladies and gentlemen of crypto twitter the bankless nation and the wider crypto industry welcome to top signal the crypto show that brings you the same guests and personalities that you all know from the podcast and videos that you listen to but instead of information data and analysis top signal is entertainment comedy and live [ __ ] posting keeping up with crypto is work and top signal is not that the only rule that we have at top signal is that there is no fact checking everything you hear on this show by the guests or the hosts is in a superposition of a ship post a psyops a factual statement and perhaps the world's best alpha no one knows because we don't check i'm david hoffman i'm here with my buddy michael wong and we're help we're here to help serve you crypto comfort food and we got a great show lined up for you guys today along with some great guests but before we get to the guest michael wong how you doing today man what's up everybody what's up bankwest nation and welcome to top signal that's a that was super energetic dude you got a lot of energy tonight um i want to tell everybody about what top signal is going to be about it's a variety show from the get go i want you to understand the format we're doing different stuff every day today we have a patch of guests i think are going to be perfect for everybody everybody loves these dudes um i just got to meet them for the first time nobody's ever met in real life i don't think um but yeah we're gonna we're gonna run into it if you think about jimmy fallon if you think about um the forgot the dude's name uh lots of different sketches uh let's get into it dave yeah so so there's we got we got some games that we're going to play and so this is going to be with some orchestration there's a there's some good things going on in the background some some plans some gimmicks there's some skits that we've got um and first i think the there's a good question as to what we should start with is what the hell is top signal um mike what what the hell is top signal you know i think it's a it's an intersection of uh a [ __ ] it's an intersection of trying to give give crypto a place um to kind of relax and kind of unload i know we i know there's different places people enjoy doing that online but this is going to be the living room uh for some of your favorite crypto personalities and you know kind of like how on jimmy fallon if uh if a movie star comes on there he's not talking about the movie to the end they're doing a bunch of different things we're going to be doing that stuff with listen expect us to do stuff like we're trying to bring on a police sketch artist right a veteran police sketch artist 25 years in the force um and we're trying to draw like are some of our of our favorite anon account identities based on their tweets trying to run stuff like that give your crypto a place uh to do things that they haven't done before you know i mean there's no rules no fact checking i'm not looking anything up dude things we're saying are hot takes invest on it if you want to but you know what i mean like don't do that we're just we're just shooting this [ __ ] something that is a new out of the top signal show is that this is actually a zoom webinar that we are in we got the bankless dow in the audience in the fans and when it comes time to call on the audience it's the bankless dow that we will be calling upon so if you are in the youtube troll box and if you want to be a part participant in the audience make sure you go to the bankless dow discord click on the zoom webinar link because we got a bunch of people in the in the in the webinar attendees and those are the people that if we ever choose to engage with the audience those are who we are calling upon michael long any last things before we get to the show why why why do you think you can host a crypto comedy show dave i have no clue dude i have i have this youtube account that a lot of people subscribe to and i know how to stream stuff and i really think that there is a a world where a world of content that has not really been breached yet and actually the uh the original inspiration came from uh for thompson came out of my friday live streams with anthony suzano who is one of the guests you're gonna bring them on in a second but uh just the different vibes that you get when you have this unscripted uh live stream uh is pretty fun and i kind of want to bring those vibes uh with a little bit more intent uh with uh some some crypto comedy what about you mike mike what makes you think you can host a crypto comedy show listen nobody knows who i am that you're watching this you're like who's this dude what is he what's he going to talk about um that's the point right you don't need to know that's top signal for you right um i've been i've been in this game as long as david has been um his path has has taken his own path and thankfully he's taken me along i'm uh i'm the person that works at culture uncle i am the culture chief at bank let's get that for for a title on my linkedin um thank you and i got this cool shirt as a payment um so i we thought one day while we were in a pool in san diego while crypto was literally having um you know hey let's let's let's let's make a show where we can shoot the [ __ ] and talk about some crazy things and be a top signal if we want to that is the through line isn't it all right guys enough enough talking about top signal on top signal we're going to go ahead and get right into the show we got a great show lined up for you guys but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible rockpool here we go alcomix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcemix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's l c h e m i x dot f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alcoholics v2 and to get involved in governance when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets well um i wasn't lying guys i wasn't lying i brought the hitters today i brought the hitters today for our first episode of top signal i'd like to introduce you to everybody i'd like to introduce everybody to them uh first up on this graphic made by logan craig is mr kevin owaki he is here pictured or he was in quadratic lands um he is the inventor and founder of get coin everybody knows this gentleman here um hello kevin owaki hey hey thanks for having me that's his voice right there and defy dad this is defy dad everybody pictured uh just just by himself no kid here in this as seen in his profile picture uh we allegedly dad all of our fathers though all of our fathers in some sort of way he's taught everybody something if you know a little trick on metamask you probably came from those fellas thank you for coming d5 we appreciate that yeah thanks for having me guys i'm uh before we started i i mentioned i'm i'm on a vacation but it looks like i've been kicked out of the house and i live in my parents basement so this is this is the state of the market we're in right now bear market it could be a vacation home if crypto goes up but if crypto goes down this could be the home home a kicking spot though feels like psyops to me he's buying right now guys okay last but not least you might not recognize him without his beard uh we couldn't find a good jpeg to put on the on the on the on the graphic without the beard but here he is anthony cesano in the pixel flesh thanks for coming sir all the way um digitally from across the ocean yeah i just woke up 20 minutes ago so i saw your disc we saw you online on discord moments ago we appreciate it yes yeah woke up for just for this so i hope you guys uh i hope you guys feel special about that there you go well you know what um let's jump right into a game first and foremost each of you are gonna get out just to get a little bit of color right we're gonna introduce you to some of these uh me and david are gonna pitch each of you in ico two of them from 2017 one of them is real one of them's not so you know i i forgot that i was supposed to do this with each guest as i was introducing them so here we're doing it in a in in reverse order but let's let's start with kevin milwaukee david won't you show uh or pitch kevin owaki um these two icos and let's see if you can determine which one is real and the background on this is that mike and i actually mike hired me at my first crypto job for an ico advisory agency and so we got exposure to some really quality terrible icos we had over a hundred ico websites in my how many announcement posts on bitcoin talking how much to get special accounts on bitcoin talk this is why you're hosting a podcast called the top signal dude if i had any experience in it it's just top signals go ahead dave all right so we got fire token and we got carbon so fire token let's start we'll start with fire token fire token is an ico for a gated forum community that would use token voting to generate a wisdom of the crowd evaluation service for other icos users would stake the token in correspondence to how legitimate the ico was positive people you would build up your reputation with positive voting history and you would be able to show a resume of positively reviewed icos and the reviews would be instantiated and verified by the blockchain so that's fire token carbon let's carbon this ico would you have any questions yeah i mean it's it's like a ponzi scheme on top of a ponzi scheme which makes me think if it's gonna exist anywhere it's crypto um quite a stupid yeah i yeah i don't know i gotta hear carbon compared to them carbon this ico would give you membership access to an online blockchain enabled e-commerce store owning a token would allow you to to own a share of the revenue going through the blockchain all product reviews would be verified with the blockchain and all sales would be an immutable record to carbon's propriety blockchain technology it's scary how real they both sound i was good i was going to say all the icos used the word blockchain a million times in their pictures back in the day yeah it's like when what was the food company that changed their name to be like long island blockchain yeah finance is so weird like that um am i allowed to google no hell no i don't think either of these would show up no fact checking on the show i i googled both of them and i found both of them already so i don't i don't know what like are they one [Laughter] everything is just either going all the way the [ __ ] up or all the way the [ __ ] down right now um i think fire tokens got to be the real one just because it seems like something someone would try to do with a prediction mark is like using ico to predict an ico so i think that's the real one if i had a ding sound a sound effect which we will in the future i would be playing it because kevin owens that is the correct answer nice job good job that's also why i gave it to you for a token voting with some sort of reputation system it felt right to give that one to you look at the intention we have with our guests look at that look at that wow one one for one you guys going to beat that sass kevin walkey's got one point congrats he's on the board okay who's next i think this is going to anthony cesano allow me to pitch you spot token or pet community all right spot token um here's my notes owning an allotted amount of spot tokens would enable oh yeah it would enable a user to be able to claim parking spots around the world so this is kind of tokenizing the your real estate that you have ownership over as a renter or as an owner spot stakers can earn spot from renters and the treasury for maintaining listed parking spots like people's driveway on the marketplace so that's how that's how spots generated and people that stake spot um can own or be have the ability to list a parking spot on the spot marketplace uh pet community um this is from a company that makes and wants to make a smart pet caller a community shared pet data on the blockchain a decentralized database for pet health data derived from smart callers and manual user entry so they're other also people just putting in my dog difficult over here meant to provide a global resource to builders owners and health care providers constantly updated resources the pet token coordinates and incentivizes activities on the pet community blockchain all right anthony sasana do you have any questions about either of these blockchains projects um spot token sounds less real than uh than pet community that's real yeah well they both sound like that could have been real that's the problem right of 2017 what's real it's just a white paper and a website i mean like i mean like you know actually kind of like uh not completely made up but obviously like most of them were made up or like something that you pulled from 2017. um but uh i don't know like i don't know it it sounds like it's it's less real because of the fact that uh uh you said staking um and staking wasn't really a thing in 2017. um as big as it is now right it was like masternodes and stuff like that uh so i don't know it's this is tough this is so tough uh i don't want to lose i don't want i don't want kevin to have one up for me uh damn uh i think i think spot's poking the fake one though okay yeah spa token is a fake one oh yeah squad token was mine was michael wong's brainchild we thought we thought it was we thought it was a hot play in 2018 but we didn't do anything with it it was just it was just on lived on discord all right all right all right nice you said that's a pressure on this one uh go ahead dave all right so first one is health sapiens health sapiens is an ico that will take care of your blockchain-based healthcare records management system so you could never lose access to your healthcare records you would use the health sapience blockchain to upload and store your healthcare records in an immutable fashion and you would use the health sapience token as an incentivization tool to facilitate coordination between doctors and and other care providers as well as your own health care records you could also sell your health care data to a any buyer of the data and you would receive health sapien tokens for people who wanted to access your health data in order to run research experiments or whatever whatever whatever people do with healthcare data that is health sapiens fast pass now do you have any questions about health sapiens before we move on no i'm literally i'm just listening to the language because there's like language i've recognized that it's not real because it's like 2021 language that we all use that that yeah so we'll see here maybe i'll i'll get this right or wrong but yeah tell me about fastpass fastpass fastpass is for the world of autonomous driving cars who need to pass other cars and you would use the fast pass token in order to pay other cars to move aside so that you could drive through the the cars and so it was literally a fast pass and you would load up your car with a the fast pass tokens and the autonomous driving vehicle would just send fast pass tokens to other autonomous vehicles in order for them to part and allow you to fast pass fast pass join the ico now it's scary how real they sound like i i think fastpass is the fake one because i want to remember that 2017 like there wasn't a lot of talk about using tokens with um like basically like uh internet of things uh so i think that's the slip up there in it but it sounded real i think fastpass is the fake one fastpass was my brainchild that i never decided to ico in 2017. so correct sapiens is the real ico that actually happened there we go i brought the haters i told you guys i would bring the haters i gave them layups though with that that was nice good job good job guys well done in the experimental show we would have some applause sounds here guys you know come on we're bootstrapping it we're bootstrapping it okay hey i think we're ready for our first event that was just a little warm up little layup oh um me crypto fantasy drafts all right michael fancy i have to explain the rules for the audience okay folks so um if this is similar to any sort of uh draft if you're familiar with a major league sports draft especially if you're familiar with a with a fantasy leaks draft but if you're not um we're going to be each of us on all five of us are going to be picking a team okay uh a roster of three team members um and and we're not gonna be drafting any football players or anything we're gonna be drafting today the topic is to draft our favorite anonymous crypto twitter accounts um when you when you do this and you make your choice for you know first pick in the first round um you need to make your case to the top signal uh audience all you know 22 of us watching this right now and then also um to the other participants on the panel okay um we're not voting though nobody here is gonna say yo that's not right don't choose that there we can neg you but you know the crypto we're gonna post this on as a crypto twitter uh poll and uh we'll let everybody else decide there okay so we're gonna be drafting teams it's also in a snake format so uh one two three four five and then five four three two one in the second round and then again on the third round one two three four five fourth round back any questions any questions uh did you say it has to be uh an anonymous account or connection yeah so this is account great great opportunity to define the rules okay we what what's anonymous who's anonymous here right if they have a podcast and they've shown their face like who's anonymous if we do we know their voice i think it should be someone we i have i'm gonna only choose people i don't know what they look like um yeah i'll try i'll try my best on that but you can you can make the argument for somebody that's on the edge if you want to make the argument for it like you can do that it's part of the game now that makes sense yeah i got you there there could be some on the edge that are like uh they're they're co-founders of a of a popular protocol but they're less like in the media so yeah makes sense okay yeah i hear you're going with that uh should we get started i think anybody else have any questions okay um i have a format here let me let me start populating this so oh especially fire also crap well anyways how many who how do we want to do the order dave can you dictate it to me uh yeah why don't we start with uh because on the stream we have kevin o'walkie to the far left we have d5 dad in the middle then we have anthony cesano on the right and then we have you right above anthony and then me to the left and so i think we that should be the order so i think we should start with kevin milwaukee followed up by a defy dad okay so kevin milwaukee first pick who's it gonna be don't don't ruin your first pick it's important oh man um i feel like i got a ringer because i got the first draft but i'm gonna take banteg bandhag all right all right from wi-fi yeah why banter you got you gotta you gotta you gotta convince us that it's the right pitch i just i respect the ship i mean uh working for wi-fi i mean it's [ __ ] [ __ ] since been shipping he's like andre's like not right-hand person like this i don't know i just think that ben tag is is crushing it i don't know how to pronounce their their handle banteg ben tag i knew that's right but uh yeah but yeah they're just crushing it they're shipping so much for for urine and they rescue other protocols like i've seen that yeah of course that's gonna be my first pick he's gonna rescue me if anything ever bads happens to be in the blockchain all right pretty compelling future collab bitcoin banter collab top signal baby i hope they're not listening because if so i've just had like a total a total stand for fantastic they're probably not listening it's okay nobody's listening it's okay okay okay first round overall off the table off the table all right anthony sedano who's your pick oh it's dad right or you said oh no excuse me it's it's dad it's if i dad sorry apologies is the way i listed it stupid mine might be on the edge here so he he kind of maintains a pseudo-anonymous um identity but obviously like i know him from working at zapper dude yeah he goes by kryptono milk i'm not going to say his first name because he actually does try to maintain like a private identity yeah but he is he's a co-founder and he's basically cto of zapper this this guy he just he builds everything and he's he's he's got that like personality where you're like hey man can you like build a rocket ship and he's like oh yeah it's fine like i'll just do it over the weekend so yeah i would nominate him even though i'm probably a little biased just working with him yeah a little bit what what what value are we getting from his twitter though let's take a look did i spell it right here so he he does he does comment but he tends to be like he's in the bantic category like you know he's like one of those few people who has coded smart contracts where more than a billion dollars has moved through it so yeah that's that's kryptono milk is his uh i get that right yep yeah yeah you got it nope you have to work on that url real quick let me find it for you all right let's let's pain pain sorry we'll move on all right and uh no no ian ban tag michael wong just just the g all right thank you sir all right sass you're up baby uh i mean for my first pick i'm gonna pick tetra node this guy is the the ultimate eighth chad he sets bottoms he saves us from the depths of hell with the eighth price uh if i had to pick anyone to be on my squad uh anyone anonymous it would be tetranode for sure i mean i don't know how many people follow him but he is hilarious uh i'm assuming it's a heat because like he's one of the ones that are like like truly anonymous so i'm just assuming here at tahee and no one i don't think anyone really knows who he is but um yeah he's just hilarious on twitter he's like a pure 8th maxie and i mean he he's not a lot either he actually is like has like a nine figure net worth i think uh from what i what i've seen like i'm pretty sure you can see it on chain so yeah that's my that's my first pick solid solid first pick i think that's kind of a mic drop pick if you don't if you ask me but i won't show my opponent too hard all right michael wang you're up wow it's it's it's it's in in the style of tetranode um the guy i don't watch excuse me i don't want to assume the gender of this account um i am so appreciative of anti-pro synthesis and yeah anti prosynthesis anti-presence yeah listen listen thank you for lifting everybody up with your retweets we need to see that you you gave me some followers they needed to see that i appreciate you anti-pro-synthesis thank you for your chadness as seth said um you show us the things i want to see in my inside of my little echo chamber that is my that's my timeline so thank you so much for that anti-protein synthesis if you're an eath person you love their retweets thank you so much yeah you can call him antipro for sure that's how that's how everyone knows you know him anti-pro wow well he's on my team now so i don't know i'm not on anti-pro like basis with him yet but all right all right you guys ready for mine it's got to go with djinn spartan who else man who else yeah he's single-handed i am surprised no one said that single-handedly ended in the first round somehow you hate him and you love him all at the same time he's definitely one of the inspirations for for the the line of superposition between psyops or the best alpha you've ever seen he's a creative twitter account where like he if you follow his tweets you really have to think about his tweets like oh am i getting psyoped or am i getting alpha like i don't really know and he teaches you like through through that form he teaches you how to navigate crypto twitter also he got in at synthetics and well under a dollar and meamed it straight to seven dollars and then even didn't even go far enough um yeah uh deegen's partner degens barne good team member thanks djan for being on my team yes i appreciate that oh [ __ ] i get two oh okay and yeah okay hey wait wait wait that's just that concludes the first round okay so first pick overall kevin walkey man uh defy dad chose uh zapper co-founder crypto no milk i i screwed up i can see the the trend of this i was like hm i want to like build the future of deep fight i choose kryptono milk no i got you no that was dope dope for that but yeah no that was you could have got that third round probably yeah it's all right my i know account could beat up your ain't on account yeah we got tetranode from sas anti-pro for me and uh david chose g uh go ahead and pick the first pick of the second round david i'm gonna have to go with oh gosh i just lost it um take some time take your time i guess i'll go with uh loom dart i'm gonna go with loom dart because we're talking about crypto twitter personalities like what the hell he's a couch slurping the the dip with laser eyes and it's loom dart like he's a crypto twitter personality like who else is what else does he do other than be a crypto twitter personality so it's true i saw what he looked like in real life though so like it kind of kills it for me you know i mean i saw his he had an admin reveal once and yeah i mean everyone knows what he looks like now i think there's pictures of him everywhere now he was anal for a lot longer than you that he's been known for so i think it counts and that's my pick and on crypto or loom dart okay pump it loom dart all right we like that this is gonna be semi-controversial um potentially uh we'll see what people have to say about it but if you were around last defy summer um you know this person uh you appreciate this person um and for all the work that they did for us that summer i'm gonna have to say um [Music] blue kirby blue kirby oh god i thought you're about to say andre you're about to get in a fight could have been so many different he's anonymous or not no it's not i would not say andre i want to say blue kirby for uh specifically yippee from price i bought to price i sold that summer thank you so much for that um they also rocked in the end but anyway he did rug he did yeah so it sounds like you you're picking him because you got out before he rugged you man the people who are gonna vote for me they they know what they know what kind of value to derive from i also just respect the hust dude respect the hus from someone hello you know you know you know why so respect the hus i respect the hustler um but do not respect the rug all right go ahead dad or is it is it uh i think it's me now yeah it's me me yeah easy next pick chain-link god the link chat god this guy i mean if you're going into war against anyone that's saying anything remotely bad about chain link this is the guy that you want and he's my favorite follower because i don't need to follow anyone else to get the chain link alpha if i want to know what's going on i just follow chain link god and not only on chain link but he knows a lot about ethereum and a lot about just like a lot of other stuff happening uh and generally i view him as like the the kind of like my my maxi mirror where like i would be considered an eighth maxie here's a link maxie and he just goes to to fight for link like i would go to fight for for eighth so yeah he's my second pick he's a great representation of the community i love the guy too um i'm gonna go with mine's pretty easy i was gonna pick kasu i mean he's just brilliant um yeah that was hot yeah well he's one of those people too who he maintained an anonymous persona and he just he's just smarter than most people in our community and everyone yeah yeah and i wouldn't say that about most people just have like uh you know an expertise that they focus on and they become better and better at whatever they do but he is just scary good at everything and uh yeah i would definitely credit him with some of the the growth of the crypto industry as a whole over the last few years but he definitely was one of the few brave bitcoiners who saw the light with what was going on with ethereum and i mean he's you know he's really become one of like the best educators uh of ethereum and d5 now so thank you yeah deep into the second round hashu got wow that was a snipe no that was a mistake yes he should have been like first or second pick yeah it's knife good yeah makes up for your first your first round pick you know what's it's funny thing about hasu is that like i totally agree with you he's an amazing pick but for some reason in my mind he doesn't strike me as like the anon crew right like i think of the anon is like the meme accounts i mean does the house he work at like paradigm or something i think no no he's independent but he helps out um i think like with writing blog posts and research for that yeah okay i thought he was a researcher a paradigm i mean heteronode will talk about like the wealth that he has and he's one of the few people i actually believe most people i think are full of [ __ ] but he he's just yeah he's like a whale beyond a whale at this point i i'm i'm imagining he's still at nine figures while you know prices are where they're at so could be one of our first trillionaires anonymous trillionaire he slurps the dipperino my friend i slurping it up where did that meme come from uh dude on ct like where all these beautifully [ __ ] memes come from that's a new one too i haven't seen it more than like three days ago yeah yeah it's kind of fresh it's that's this is why bear markets i mean bear market down markets are good because the memes are just so much better shared coke is better than shared hope wow nice one nice wow that's that's the kind of content you're getting on top signal folks let's round out the second round kevin owaki inverse brah you fell back yeah yeah i keep people keep on tagging him in my mentions and i don't know what he is like i keep saying things and people just keep tagging inverse bra what is that ah this that's that's it that's the joke like after you see it the joke's already over exactly good pick so let's run let me let me recap david chose loom dart for the first pick of the second round i chose blue kirby you know why chainlin god the summoner hassu so deep into the second round good great pick and inverse bra i think that is squarely a great second round pick to round it out um yeah if you see him in your mention someone's dissing you go ahead and and they can they could also be dissing themselves trying to inverse brought somebody so that happens um all right so let's round out your team here sir uh who's the last pick in the third round or your first pick in the first okay i'm gonna start what i'm gonna hope is the precedent by just having a total [ __ ] post for my third pick because it's the third pick passion pick passion pick passion pick and this one this one only has 150 followers so i'm going weird and esoteric with it wow it's called uh it's called it's called it's called zuko googling and it's just a twitter account of like do you guys know uh no zuko z-o-o-k-o is the founder of z cash and he's like this famous like privacy nerd and like uh and and like carnivore so it's all just like things he would be be googling like zero knowledge meat distribution like just stupid stuff like that only 150 followers i feel like i'll have pumped it if he gets up to 160 tonight zuko googling way too good okay mr dad it's funny because i had this like ongoing list here but i was thinking about like like drafting people that would like ensure that defy ethereum crypto like is successful and i've realized i i was failing at what the task is here so um the most one of the most obvious picks uh which oddly enough is here on um is this this is called up only again that's the name of the show no no this is the other one the other one the other one whatever the other one is um no man i would pick kobe i think he's uh he's actually done all of this i don't know if we could choose that so this is where the group's like yo i don't think that's anon no he cannot uh he's pioneered he's pioneered so much crypto content stuff you know we should let him on just for that yeah you're right he was he was kind of i mean he was i don't know if he was ever right no i don't know if he ever was like he had the other account his other account and he'd been on my max kaiser's show back in like the really early days um because he was actually one of the founders like he was like oh wow yeah there's a there's a video clip of him going on to max kaiser's show and talking about it so i don't know if he was ever actually an on okay we respect your work wow yeah i didn't realize um you know but i'll throw in uh our friend uh the investor i think no you know we know his name is nft portfolio i'm pretty sure that's going to zero but after this portfolio there's literally just one rule bro they're anonymous that's the only rule are these like people that i just don't know the name of everyone can also just not wait you don't know you don't know dc investor's name this is your truth yeah i don't it's after it's halftop he had it on his twitter for like ages what looks like do i still need to pick one yeah you still need to pick you're still up dude you can go in with you can go in with two but like my boy tetra nerd i got one i'll just i'll stick with my legit list of like builders and educators i love scoopy dribbles i was going to say nice i think he's he's a really good one and uh just if you haven't learned about alchemix i personally do not hold any alcx bags but i just love the way that alchemix works with self pain loans so check that out nice also our sponsor thank you for that [Laughter] he just posted something like the other day was like i like sex or sex is great and i texted dave i was like i love our sponsors man like this is the best hop signal sponsors in the game we appreciate it thank you very much all right sass with your last pick for the third round yeah so if you're going into a yield farm and you've got tetranode and chain link god backing you up they're going to suck out all the yields uh they're you know they're going to bring the whale power you're going to need someone to check that those smart contracts are safe so my boy samsung is my third pick it's like sam aynon his name is in his twitter account that's not no no no he no one knows who he is even on parrot even on paradigm site his picture is like his anime picture it's not uh no one no one knows who he is like out of us i assume paradigm probably does but he's he's anand for sure uh sam's son sam cz son is his twitter i just figured that was his name i mean it could be his name but like no one do you know who he is yeah are you sure are you sure about that are you sure that's it yeah it's his name it says cezanne he's maybe he's the ceo of binance and he's been psyopsing us this whole time wow that's a long time s-s-u-n-s-u-n okay i was yeah thank you i don't obviously don't know this dude but uh you don't know samsung wow yeah you never been rugged before [Laughter] you know that futurama episode where the the line is like uh if god is talking to bender and he's like well if you do things right people won't know that you've done anything at all that's that's sam yeah yeah he's the you up guy like if you get a telegram message from sam and you you're like a founder of a day five protocol and he said oh white hats have energy oh you're getting up immediately okay uh it's my turn i'm feeling i'm feeling i was gonna pick scooby here i did not think dad was gonna pick that especially with the with the third bullet in the chamber um you're running out of guesses huh no i have i have one like to fall back on and i just okay i'm gonna use it first episode um i'm gonna call out i'm a sandwich you don't know this person maybe defy dad does i'm a sandwich i'm a sandwich is a dev on zapper and i appreciate you because one day i bought red doge on polygon and it wasn't showing up and i tweeted at you and you may and you literally dm like let me do that real quick thank you for doing that this is the power of zapper these dudes like that or people like that i'm a sandwich he's he's a really good one he's so responsive like he's one of the few devs that's like always in our support and just yeah uh he he is he's one of the best good good pick and he's literally ac no i'm a sandwich isn't on his twitter account it's actually a sandwich yeah he's a sandwich so all right dave let's round out this game all right he's been with with us through 2017 he went through the 2018-2019 bear market with us he feels a little bit like comfort food on twitter you got to go with the wolf of ethereum luca oh good pick yeah wolf of ethereum yeah he's definitely like the eighth maxi's ape maxi yeah mm-hmm yeah the anti-pros like cousin i would say probably yeah he's got he's got these uh l-y-x token bags that he really shills but other than that full-blown ethmaxy left and right man and that's my lineup good game good game folks that was our first crypto draft gg we're gonna let i'm gonna screenshot this i'm gonna fix it up we'll let crypto twitter decide later on um dave did we run into the next one should we just do it let's keep on going man let's keep on doing it all right we're powered right through around the horn so um take a breath everybody we just finished draft um good job everybody and all the participants around the horn we're gonna get hot takes on a number of topics um just like if you've seen the espn show a lot like that i'm to moderate um everybody else sas d5 dad kevin and david i'm going to show a prompt on the screen um and everybody's going to have 30 seconds to respond to that prompt um and so it's going to go in order of i guess we're going to go in this order since i wrote it this way sas defy dad david and kevin and then just keep going around um and uh yeah so again i'll have a prompt on the screen we're going to play the thing for 30 seconds you guys are going to have hot takes you can respond to each other's takes um trying to be polarizing that's kind of the point of the game here um you don't have to be and whoever we're all going to decide the dow chat is in the decide inside of the chat who should win the round and we're going gonna right here i'll add a point to your score and whoever wins at the end gets to show whatever they want at the end of the of the game for 30 seconds whatever you want could be non-crypto related if you want it to be before we get started i would like to say that googling zuko apparently has gotten over 10 followers in the last few minutes according to daniel thanks daniel pop signal baby that's the top no effect sponsors that's the top signal effect baby all right um i don't know that i want to run i'm just going to do the timer on my phone but let's start um first question to sas you have 30 seconds how long will the d5 or sorry will the nft bear market last uh i mean i don't even know if it's it's like a bear market there's still a lot of stuff going on in the nft space but in terms of like what happened during i guess like the real mania with nfts it's come down a lot but i think that the nft kind of like bull market whatever you want to call it was a consequence of everyone making a lot of money so it was going to last until people make a lot of money again from you know a d5 assets whatever other crypto assets then they're going to come back and feel all rich and they're going to like ape into all these random nfts they've got no idea what they're doing but they're like i'm going to buy this because this is cool and then that's when we're going to get another nf table market so yeah nice okay what do you have to say to that do you find that yeah i don't think that nfts are in the type of bear market that you know the uh the rest of the crypto market is used to experiencing so the nft market i mean was always less liquid i think it's still like exponentially more liquid than it was a few years ago so you know it's it's gonna be another blip like you're gonna look back and look at the the dip and say jesus like you know that was such a um that was we we didn't appreciate like how early we were with nfts that being said though i have little to no exposure to nft you're done your time's done [Laughter] well uh i don't know if you guys know this but um nfts stand for non-fungible tokens uh that means that they're all different from each other and so i think that there's gonna be some nfts that the bear market lasts forever until the heat death of the universe they will go to zero and they will be bad but if you have a brand of following and you know how to engage them and you do a good job of telling stories creating luscious entropy with your art then you're going to see an nft bull market very very soon my friends oh nice my friend i'm david wrap it up for us what's with all these goddamn bulls on this show dude the nf the nfts are going down man like the nft market is it bottoms i'm gonna tell this is the alpha for the show it bottoms the moment i buy my first crypto punk and then it's going up but until then like the nft show is over like dump your bags like sell it all uh and and then i'm gonna get my first crypto punk yeah hot what does the chat have to say right now it's blowing up but what what's the opposite of pump it loom dart like dump it david [Laughter] i didn't say it was bullish i just said that i don't think that you know it's in like a traditional bear market like everyone thinks it is i think i think heat death of the universe is pretty bearish obviously david is just like a bear in bulls clothing because he wants uh to get crypto punk so allegedly in the future i'm gonna be giving points just to everybody at different times not just at the end around that would be a perfect example i'm gonna give the point here to kevin i like what you said about um both sides of the coin there's still so much opportunity for people if they really have an audience of nfts too it's not just a free man's game next the news mark cuban regrets not doing the math on titan crypto investment as team denies rugpul so you know we love mark cuban on the banks podcast the gentleman days after he posted a a bullish blog post about yield farming and liquidity pools gets rubbed himself uh what do you have to say to that let's start with this one let's start with uh let's start with kevin sorry mark who [Laughter] wow you you the rest of your team mike kevin just gave 10 seconds to that joke what if i just let it sit for the rest of the time um i think i think if you're a [ __ ] billionaire like you could afford to get rugged wants to learn like the rest of us get rugged with like i don't know i got rugby like a thousand dollars and that's how i learned he's a billionaire and he got rocked a million dollars like it's all proportional okay what do you have to say uh d5 dad is that how much he lost a million does anyone i don't think anyone knows but oh i just made that i just made that up i'm just assuming yeah no it was a million million he lost a million dollars my answer is easy mark cuban who is an investor in zapper i have no comment i mean i i i would presume to know what mark was thinking but i respect whatever decisions he makes and what mistakes he makes and i yield the rest of my time to the next excellent answer let's go david on this one let's wrap it up after you oh mark cuban we want you on the show eventually but uh congratulations on getting your your cherry popped in in the world of defy you're you're just got the battle scars like us to like the rest of us the uh the calling for regulation controversial move sir like that's re read the room read the room that you're in like no like no no no no like take responsibility for your rug pulse sir um and i yield my two seconds yes do you have anything to say about uh the mark cuban um the last part of what david just said there i mean getting rugged indeed is a right of passage you haven't been rugged you haven't done d5 uh so yeah it doesn't matter how much you've been rugged for i guess like it's proportional uh for sure but also yeah calling for regulation hilarious like that's just like the typical thing that people do right they go into something that they didn't really know about they get rugged and money get you know lose money and they're like oh we need to regulate everything well this is how we get shitty financial regulations mark cuban i hope you're listening to me we don't want this right okay someone some someone should really do something about how bad my decision making is someone else should do something about it though yeah but only when you lose my if you make if you make money it's all on you if you lose money well then it's the government yeah okay d5 died gets the points for that round no doubt about it this is their arbitrary i've got no idea what judging criteria even is here there's no one there's none kevin i'm so sorry i had to bring up this question why does paradigm invest in valueless governance tokens there's always hassle on that one that i don't even know what to say um 30 seconds though they really but they really really believe in um you know holding valueless governance tokens i mean who doesn't want to hold them they're not worth anything they don't do anything and everyone should have a valueless governance token in their life so i think that they're just you know trying to be like all of us trying to relate to us um so yeah they invest in in those to be on that level sas we're going to end it there you get the point for that one um [Laughter] we need to go any further thank you for wearing that one for us um let's go to the next one this is cool jay-z puts a crypto nfc oh sorry crypto punk nfc as his twitter profile picture nft um well i don't think they need to add that last part but uh and i think shortly after this he was on a on a space twitter space with jack talking about nfts and music um let's see we should talk about this first david why don't you start us off this is this is this is the top signal man this is jay-z's got the crypto punks like it's time to sell like what more of a signal do you want like dump your bags this is the time that you get to dump on jay-z and you and you get to say like oh yeah i dumped on i dumped my crypto bag bag crypto punk bags on jay-z like i don't know what more of a signal that you like i can give you guys yield one time he's talking to specifically whoever has the blonde nfc the one with the gold necklace that one dump that one okay uh defy dad i've been worried about the same thing like is this like yet another top signal i i will say this is a reminder that nfts actually bring culture to ethereum and that's one of the things that really sets us apart from everyone like this is why so many musicians and artists and creatives are getting involved so my mind was blown it's probably one of the best tweets i've put out in the past year in terms of like impressions like whatever i was just i noticed it and was like holy [ __ ] he's got a you know he's got a crypto punk so drop down fight flex on the alpha drop thanks for that d5 dad uh kevin well i think it's nice that he has a crypto punk but why do i what i want to know is why doesn't he have an e s name mike dermatis like why can't you just why can't you just buy jay z.e and then hold it ransom until he tweets about you and then give it to him then like pretty standard playbook for mike why doesn't he have an ens name mike i yield my time okay sass um please give us 30 seconds on jay-z nft no i just want to make one edit to this title it should say jay-z's twitter intern changes his profile nft that's it i yield my time give me just give me the point wow i'm gonna give it to i gotta give that one to kevin i gotta give that one to kevin uh it's getting destroyed we're talking not on the board we're talking about culture here i loved his you pulled in the nest that was super strong it's that's that's the entity to have right now um okay this is a good one david maybe you can get this one uh and you'll start us off what's the most bullish unexpected thing that could happen to ethereum this year make it up make it up you got 30 seconds uh [ __ ] the federal reserve starts to uh tap into defy to get yield on their dollars and bond rates and bonds actually start pumping because the yield on the dollars are so strong because of defy and for some reason there's enough demand it triggers actually a demand loop because the federal reserve is getting yield in defy all of a sudden d5 is legitimized and the federal reserve actually fixes its balance sheet issues and bonds actually start appreciating and then bitcoin just drops to [ __ ] zero because everyone realizes we don't need it anymore wow straight bullet or [ __ ] just give him the point [Laughter] okay um does anybody want to go next i was i was just going to say that if el salvador um you know removes btc as legal tender and replaces it with ether's legal tender that's the most unexpected thing and the most bullish thing i would think happens right right after my my thing happens yeah exactly [Laughter] that's strong okay kevin owaki um i think every new technology is pushed forward by pornography and so i would like to see spank chain get a ton of adoption like replace pornhub but you're going to say you're going to do something to lead this effort kevin i'm still holding my spank bab my spank bag isn't that enough spanx was the only ico i actually invested in in 2017. there you go i dumped my bags so what's your name bro what are you talking about metronome bro on the plane oh that's right well no transactions man there's so many things that have already happened that i just never thought would and i i i actually continue to be blown away by the the billionaires that are chimed in who are like very vocal about ethereum being a potentially better investment or with more upside than than bitcoin and uh so i i don't i don't have to like imagine it like i think carl icahn having come out and i you know i was joking around earlier about mark cuban but like mark continues to be one of our best allies so you got to pump that to the mainstream and help people like start to dig into like why we're legit so yeah that's it i love the answer all right let's see what the chat has to say here anything chat any opinions on who gets the point there any you know who gets who it's who gets that one i mean i feel like we have to give a pity point to david yeah come on that was that was a that was at least an entertainment actually it was actually it was a creative answer yeah sorry all right all right yeah thanks guys good thanks all right yeah crowdsourced they've not been left behind all right here's the next one and the last one who is crypto person of the year who is crypto person of the year and let's start with uh start with that god man that's so hard oh i have too many too many people i want to call out there i i actually would would i kevin milwaukee i believe that we would still have been in a bear market if it weren't for bitcoin and and the quadratic funding and and just all the work that you guys did so it might be i'm you know i'm leaving out some other obvious folks but uh i cannot thank bitcoin enough so you you my man you are my person of the year nice kevin you made a proud dad god uh quadratic funding i have to say is not my idea we're just standing on the shoulders of giants but thanks that's very nice of you he quoted that from another podcast on the bankers podcast [Laughter] um kevin why don't you go next and you don't have to pick deep my dad um but if you don't it would be weird [Laughter] crypto crypto person of the year yeah other than defy dad oh man this is such a hard decision um i i guess it's not not this year but uh i've just really loved watching sushi swap and like the vampire attack and so xerox maki just for the reasons of like he's so horrible but like the fireworks were amazing so i guess that was that was in the last the last 12 months but maybe not in 2021 you always know me yeah yeah yeah i know me chef know me like what mark works yeah to clarify if anyone heard that that it's know me bad xerox we like xerox mackie yeah perfect all right all right chef know me then yeah yeah oh man this is like the hardest question ever but if i had to just think of something on top of my head that basically has caused like euphoria and divide and just like pure [ __ ] posting all the time and it's dj spider because he has managed to piss off absolutely everyone and then a nope out while sitting on massive bags that he dumped at the top so uh yeah it has to go to him for someone who's just like fun to i mean he's just if you just take him um non seriously just take him as a joke and a [ __ ] poster with a lot of actual alpha sprinkled in he's a fun fun guy cooper super choice there david if you don't pick the person i think you're gonna pick go ahead dude i i actually dm'd and michael to say make me go next because i knew i thought sassel was gonna rug me but he didn't but justin drake is the absolute crypto person of the year there's like a thousand people on twitter that have the bat signal uh ultrasound money emojis in their names the ultrasound money meme just skyrocketed into public consciousness it's the first successful meme that just like made it all the way to like cnbc it went from the bankless podcast to cnbc in like two months or even less like six weeks and it was older than that but like it wasn't it wasn't until the banquet podcast where the ultrasound money meme became what it was and yeah justin drake just completely changed the the game with the the narrative around ethereum crypto person of the year wow that's a great choice and it's i think the points got to go to david for that like that's uh that's a dope choice yeah i thought i thought i was just on the edge of my seat like ready for zazzle to say altered these points are going they're getting inflated all right david we're going to fight to the death for the ultimate championship oh sure do we need a title yeah what's the tiebreaker dave sass anybody have a tiger i wasn't ready for this oh you guys are the hardest i'm gonna rug you until you have to come with it i think yeah i think kevin just gets invited back for it for the death i think kevin gets the win i'll be like that guy one jeopardy who won several of them but like way less talented oh what's his name he won the most money but was like is not yeah or not like james yeah i know you're talking about okay can we pin can we pin uh kevin while he gets his gets his 30 seconds yeah sure all right uh go ahead and take 30 seconds to talk about whatever you want you have the spotlight on you go ahead kevin oh man i would have planned something if i had known i was going to get a 30 second monologue um open source is good let's rejoin all the degens public goods are good um grants around town he's still on if you haven't done it okay [ __ ] i should talk my own book fund open source on get coin grants until thursday night at midnight three two one nice all right i don't guys i don't have to show git coin grants because you all do it for me on twitter all the time so i've like forgotten i'm out of practice all right dave that wraps up the portion for our guest today i hope everybody enjoyed their time on the top signal show today um guest wise um and thank you for
