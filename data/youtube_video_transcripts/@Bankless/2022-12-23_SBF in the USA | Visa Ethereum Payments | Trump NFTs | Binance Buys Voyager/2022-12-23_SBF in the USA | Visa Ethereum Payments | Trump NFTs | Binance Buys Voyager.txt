SPF coming home extradited to the U.S prison wasn't so great for him so he wanted to you know work his way home uh Brian Armstrong makes a regulation proposal so that we wish that we had and also Visa steps into the ethereum frontier what does that mean Bagless Nation it is the Friday before the holidays David what time is it oh oh it's the bankless Friday weekly roll up Ryan where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor and we are almost at the finish line of 2022. thank the Lord so if you have not yet grabbed a morning coffee to enjoy the weekly news of crypto with us please do put some put some Baileys in this one because uh you know let's get festive today why not all the all the calls I've been having with people have been like they've been at their parents house or something like visiting family this week and uh and you are there too right so you're on west coast today I am freezing my absolute tail off in the bottom of my sister's house with a sleeping baby in the Next Room so this is a different kind of weekly roll up guys I I want you to know this level of dedication all right this is what David Hoffman does on his holiday while he's with family sleeping babies it's the crack of dawn there's no sun out and we're still getting a weekly roll up to you right before I take off myself all right David so what are we going to talk about this week what are the topics of course there are some SPF updates uh he is no longer right in the Bahamas he is in New York uh with hanging out with the FBI uh so that's just visiting family too yo just visiting temporarily uh or perhaps more permanent uh so we'll talk about all of the SPF drama Caroline Ellison apparently cooperating with the Fed so we'll talk about that too uh Brian Armstrong proposes crypto legislation that we wish we had uh so we'll unpack all of that and also Visa is taking a big step into the frontier of ethereum protocol development we'll talk about all of that and more one of the things as well that's going on this week is binance is talking about bailing out Voyager doing the thing that SBF promised to do but was never able to manage so that's an emerging story as well uh David we got our friends and sponsors Kraken to tell you guys about today um Kraken is a crypto platform that did not rug Us in 20 a22 there are a few crypto platforms that I recommend coming out of that crazy year that we just had to people and Kraken is one of those can you tell them why yeah Kraken is one of these few exchanges that are living and breathing the ethos of crypto to the best of their ability while also being a centralized exchange and that is why we are choosing to work with Kraken in 2023 as our strategic sponsor because right they use cryptography to empower individuals if these are words that I love uh and so that with with their proof of Reserve System they allow their users to verify their own liabilities inside of Kraken and just when we interviewed Jesse Powell I just he just exuded the crypto ethos that I know that you and I are all about and we still need centralized exchanges to go bankless that is many many people's first step and so we are working with Kraken in 2023 more closely to emphasize the best of what their product has to offer for the bankless world yeah I think look um when it comes to a centralized crypto platform if you're a custom of that platform you should have the ability to verify whether the crypto platform has your deposits and whether they're backed by real assets full stop and Kraken has a proof of Reserve System that they have rolled out to do that they've been doing proof of reserves for a long time you can find out more about that in the link in the show notes that's kraken.com David let's get to the markets man what's Bitcoin doing to us today uh it's going down uh it started at 17 000 for us exactly yeah okay we are feeling the Bitcoin yeah it is at 17 700 at the start of the week ending the week at 16 700 down about six percent on the week down six percent okay so yeah this is a little bit of a the timing of the measurement we just happened to start last week at a little bit of a high and now we're kind of back to like two weeks it's flat I mean but like 1600s that doesn't feel great does it no it doesn't mean we are below the 20 uh the 2017 all-time high a lot yeah how about youth that's also below the 20 18. yeah yeah what's what's Heath doing on the week down six percent on the week as well 1270 down to 1200 a little bit more than Bitcoin uh Bitcoin was a little bit less than six ethos a little bit more than six percent down on the week guys I don't think we're gonna get uh our bullish recovery our v-shaped recovery in 2022. I feel like that's a safe one to call huh David yeah people were getting down people were kind of bullish for a green December but December so far seems to be pretty weak and we're we're down on the year like if we look at the yeah okay well no actually so no what eth was like at the start of this year so December 23rd of last year I remember it being in like the 800s something like this so I I think we're up from that at least wow we're gonna look at the charts I know it seemed like a long time ago no no no no no you're you're skipping you're two years you're thinking in two years right now am I really yes you are yeah because each was four thousand dollars in December of last year guys the years are not blending together oh okay yeah yeah you got you got confused because we were recently talking about this when we were doing our ether bookcase or eth with the bulls that we recently did which I believe comes out Monday yeah it does yeah you were taking into your time frames sorry brother all right so we're up on the two-year though David That's the Silver Lining but look at the one year wow you're literally down only we were 4K last year at this time on eth um definitely down definitely come out here in complete denial of the bear Market yeah I basically was subconsciously for a minute there uh how about the Bitcoin ratio what's that looking like East Bitcoin ratio down one and a half percent we are down to 0.0718 uh we shaped off a nice two trillion dollars this year in terms of crypto market cap I believe uh and we are under a trillion dollars what's this number this week David yeah we are at roughly 900 billion in total market cap last week 837 billion is the total market cap this week oof nice a few trillion down um but I want to say to everyone listening to bankless and uh we know you guys have been with us through this uh mighty fall from from 4 000 all the way down to uh to 1200. uh congratulations to you because you have survived 2022. yeah it's almost over uh this is a market that as I just mentioned is 2 trillion down from the top in crypto that's uh that's a lot of zeros um down we've also suffered the worst inflation David in over 40 years and we had the death of one of the three largest crypto exchanges this year FDX just evaporated SPF is literally in jail right now and not just an exchange an algo stablecoin all of the biggest like lending platforms Celsius block fi Voyager the biggest hedge funds in crypto all evaporated last year and yet you you are still here you are still listening you survived and I think that is worthy of some holiday celebration congratulations for surviving 2022. you've definitely earned it yeah that's it's worth noting that like it was not easy to do that it was not easy to get through 2022 and this is one of the if you zoom out as to what crypto is going to do for society and for all markets all financial markets like holding on to your crypto assets from now into 20 years from now is not easy like people get whipped off by volatility they get enticed by leverage they play in the coin casino if you are still around congrats that was not a hard thing to do that took mental resolve that that's the thing when you say David it's not easy you're absolutely right it is not easy and yet David it is so so so simple it's simple it's not easy it's just like a whole bunch of things you don't do yeah yeah just hold how about that just hold rather than going margin rather than playing in kind of the coin casino rather than like aping into you the latest nft right you just hold for the long term and you would have uh been fine through this as long as you can bear like these kind of uh you know 70 to 80 percent downs from from all-time high but there is a silver lining here and that is Defy is rising look at this this is the decentralized exchange user growth across all chains and this starts in January of 2020 over two years uh look at this the number of Dex Traders over time on ethereum we're above 5 million now we're closing in on 7 million and that was basically nothing two years ago yeah on ethereum and we're also seeing this on polygon okay we have almost the same amount of uh total decentralized exchange Traders on polygon now uh binance smart chain Solana as well up optimism massively up and of course this is a layer two so we're seeing some maximism currently is is accelerating more than any of those previous charts it really is and uh let's talk about that a little bit more David this is a stat from Layer Two beat which tracks the progress of layer twos what are we looking at yeah specifically this uh framing that they use scaling Factor uh so in this graphic that we're looking at in the last 60 days the scaling factor of layer twos was 2.4 x as in 2.4 times the amount of ethereum layer 1 transactions happened on Layer Two and I really like this this new metric scaling factor I think that's going to be a metric that sticks around okay and so basically 2.4 x it says over the past 60 days there was 2.4 more transactions in the ethereum ecosystem thanks to layer twos so that is basically doubling the scalability of ethereum right yeah so uh 63 million transactions happened on the East layer one uh and 88 million transactions happened on layer twos cool uh yeah very cool um here's another stat for you too David on layer twos layer twos have actually flipped the ethereum base layer in terms of aggregate transactions per second and you can see that in the chart layer twos are in the green here and ever since October they've been above ethereum yeah in terms of transaction activity pretty impressive yeah I expect this to only continue into 2023 uh the FL the the the lappening also can apply here as well like can we when when can we get to 10x ethereum layer ones transactional activity probably sometime in 2023 I bet I definitely definitely think that's coming um and let's talk about some of the the old defy uh coins as well make your Dow recently experienced an increase in revenues and that's interesting imagine a D5 protocol generating Revenue maker Dow has done this fairly consistently uh especially in thanks to real world assets WRAS is is the acronym for that the real world asset category is expanding pretty quickly in maker what are we looking at here David yeah so this is a chart that shows the distribution of types of assets inside of makerdout and that blue section in the top right corner is the real world asset section which is now over 50 percent of all types of assets inside of maker Dow and you can if you click that chart right there you can see how much money that they are making speaking of charts that are going up and to the right this chart was basically nothing in January and April of this year and is now over 6600 million dollars of revenue from Real World assets going into the maker Dow Treasury uh and like this is a landscape that no other DFI app is going after and some people it don't like it because it's it's centralization risk it's real world risk that's a fair take fine uh but also just like think about being able to charge interest rates on the worlds like no other D5 app has that in their sites other than maker Dao and they're actually executing on this 600 million dollars in Revenue a year going into maker Dow by charging real companies real money I think that's bullish and these real world assets are things like treasury bonds um zero to one year maturity one to three year maturity so these are traditional Legacy uh assets that are being put into these D5 protocols there's also there's also real estate in there as well but much much less than that real estate tokenized real estate David who would have thought um let's talk about what you're doing during the bear Market I was thinking about this as we were preparing the the roll up for today um what to do during a bear Market I came up with four answers to this uh and I want to get your take on this David number one I think what what do you do during the bear Market invest in yourself and acquire skills this could not be more important this is a fantastic way and time to build Market marketable Talent things skills that you can sell to uh crypto companies that's number one number two start a side hustle in crypto so if you're not fully employed in crypto then then it's your full-time Hustle but uh if you're not this is a great time to begin experimenting I mean join uh various Dows for instance start a side hustle bankless started as a side hustle for both of us didn't it David um so even if you have a some sort of opportunity role in crypto you could still engage in side hustle it's a very side hustle friendly uh environment number three dollar cost average into the gems not Financial advice of course uh my take is 70 each that's what I'm doing and then 30 other dollar cost averaging in during the bear Mark is another thing to do and number four build your network and meet as many people as you can it's a fantastic time to meet more settlers like yourself more Builders this is the best like they're all of the all of the people who are here for kind of the short-term gains they're gone they're out of the space mostly and so there's a lot of signal in the space now and a lot of quality people and this is a time to begin building relationships build out your network get on Zoom calls with people get in people's DMS provide some value to them write articles uh publish publish posts uh you know contribute in some way to the ecosystem and build those relationships so these are my ideas for a bear Market what's your take on this David and um I'm curious what gems you're buying are you dollar cost averaging in yet and what are you looking at oh I'm always at dollar cost averaging in like that that button never turns off for sure yeah I'm looking at these at these one through four so I'm just like being taken back to the 2018 to 2020 bear Market because this is exactly this is exactly what what I did what you did yeah so I was kind of thinking about you doing this yeah exactly got in got out of physical therapy and into uh Consulting inside of the crypto space so that was my number and that was my number one uh starting a side hustle was my first podcast before before starting the bank list podcast which like was also developing skills for the bank list podcast uh of course was buying uh dollar cost averaging I did was definitely doing you could also call it dumping a paycheck uh every single two weeks same same uh but then and then number four like it's number four is where one through three get expressed so make yourself better acquire skills start a side hustle that you can talk to people about uh get skin in the game but then go out and meet people because it like Ryan said when you meet people in the bear Market it hits different than a bull market because if you meet people during a bull market like sometimes I'm like are you gonna be here in two years like I'm not sure I'm gonna like expend my time engaging with you and I don't know you're going to be here in two years when you meet people in a bear Market you don't have that query like every everyone understands like oh we are in it we are here together and so like it's just easier to build a network in that context honestly I think all four of these could be its own separate like a post or podcast that we talk about but but could you talk about number four for for a minute because I consider you very good at this build building a network and meeting as many people as you can and so what does this mean in crypto like networking right does this mean you're going to crypto conferences and handing out your business card um how do you act okay it's not that so how do you actually meet people and how do you find the right people to meet because um you know there's there's definitely an 80 20 rule with respect to some people like you want to find like kind of the you know the the 20 that would deliver 80 of the value uh you know to to including your network and get in relationship so how to even screen those people how do you find them what's your method it's a little bit about are you seeing the same people on a re-occurring basis and this works both inside of conferences in real life but also Twitter too uh you can build a network on Twitter is what it is for uh and so if you are showing up on Twitter and providing value on Twitter you will just naturally grow followers and then you'll also start to become first in Twitter you'll see other people engaging in your tweets and you can grow a network on Twitter and this is when Ryan said like don't be afraid to slip into someone's DMS grow a relationship that way so you know and and Twitter is just like the precursor to in real life conferences by the way uh and so when you are tweeting and stuff and you are are engaging with people and others you will see many of those people at conferences and then when you go to your second conference or your third conference or just meetups in general you'll start to see the same reoccurring cast of characters and you'd have to be social and you have to be able to go up and say hi uh yeah you can go into our Twitter DMS yeah I'm I'm going into our Twitter DMS and scrolling up and to actually track this when did we first start talking wow my first DM to you in December 1st 2018 I said to you I do not understand the resistance to ethereum on behalf of so many bidders bitcoiners it is utterly confusing to me wow we have not changed at all that was the first DM you sent me and then uh I said I've been trying to figure this out well as well at the core of the value systems appears so similar wow wow change tune whatsoever yeah and then back and forth um maximalism is blinding this is the beginning of a conversation we had where uh you know David just gotten my DMs and I was reading some of his work that he was posting on medium and then uh we just I mean from there it developed it took it took a while it took many months for us to start like working together in the newsletter and then eventually starting a podcast but that's where we started in in the depths of the bear Market in 2018. WoW 2018 what a throwback anyways just something to consider is uh optimizing for luck surface area which means putting yourself out there putting value out there like when you are investing in yourself and acquiring skills make sure you find a way to broadcast those skills so you can let people know that you're a useful person uh and then just start growing the relationships in ways that are create Serendipity um and that could be true on Twitter that can be true on sub stack that can be true in real life events such as casual meetups um but I would emphasize that in real life meetups do provide value that you kind of can't get in the metaverse because it's like if meeting for humans meet face to face Ryan I feel so attack right now um well let's talk about some of the gems piece of it right of course you know everyone listening knows we are bullish eth and you'll uh you'll find that out even more when our episode on Monday comes out there's some other gems in this market too um Ryan sulcus was recently on the backless podcast he called a bottom for defy I think there's some really interesting uh D D5 tokens out there again not Financial advice but um that's something that I'm looking at also even in the public markets David this is a tweet from uh from Matt Hogan about coinbase what's he saying here yeah so he he tweets out saying coinbase raised money in 2018 at an eight billion dollar valuation it is currently trading at a nine billion dollar valuation meanwhile revenues are up in that same time frame from 520 million to 3.3 billion users are up from 22 million to a hundred and one million and assets on the platform are up from 11 billion to a hundred and one billion so same valuation going back for four and a half years but meanwhile all the metrics are up about a 5x 5 to 6X sometimes a 10x on assets on the platform so like do the coinbase stock hit a low of 35 dollars when it opened up at like something like 450 dollars like coinbase stock is one of going to be like one of the most generational buys of all time It's gotta be uh not Financial life I don't own any because I don't own in stocks but whatever yeah I um I mean these numbers are pretty compelling to be honest my only question when I whenever I have some some money to all across average in is okay should I do this or should I go buy some more eth right right that's kind of the question because it's always they're certainly correlated um anyway uh there you go guys a lot of things you can do during the bear Market to keep busy David what do we have coming up next SPF coming home extradited to the US prison wasn't so great for him so he wanted to you know work his way home uh Brian Armstrong makes a regulation proposal so that we wish that we had and also Visa steps into the ethereum Frontier what does that mean all of this and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless the reality today is that five corporations control the

it sounds like the prison system in Bahamas left something to be desired we'll talk about that just um I guess getting into this again Jake travinsky had a fantastic summary he tweeted this out two months ago SBF was debating the future of crypto policy and nobody knew FDX was a sham one month ago SBF was apologizing for losing billions and everyone worried for losing billions and everyone worried he might get away with fraud today SPF is an FBI custody and his chief co-conspirators have pleaded guilty it's amazing how fast all this has unfolded Jake says it's very rare to see criminal prosecutions move so quickly that's the high level context look how fast all of that happened two months ago SPF was on this podcast debating crypto policy right and now he's in jail and uh in FBI custody so I don't know uh if this bodes well for uh other previous guests other guests please don't take that too seriously yeah just you know customer deposits it's fine look it's not it's honestly not that hard to um do well in crypto but just by playing long-term games but SBF was clearly not playing that so give us the stories it sounds like SPF was having a bad time in jail in the Bahamas what were the conditions like and what might have led to his uh extradition to the US so the the conditions of the Bahamian jail are not not crate um there are like buckets for example that are required for all inmates uh you can guess what those get used for uh there was oof this this report says cells were infested with rats maggots and insects uh I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that it was a miserable place to be and so it made it really easy for SPF to just like wave the white flag and say fine just extradite me to the United States if that's how it happened that kind of makes sense I don't really know if that's how that happened but that's what people are speculating as to the how bad the Bahamian prison was just like SPF was like fine extradite me uh yeah he's like I don't want to spend Christmas here yeah exactly yeah send me send me home to Mom and Dad uh so now he is in New York City uh so that was last night at the time of recording so Wednesday night Thursday morning he was flown from the Bahamas to New York City in custody of the FBI and that is where he currently resides so SPF wow looking unshaven and unkempt and definitely pretty sweaty uh being escorted off a plane in uh or excuse me that is a photo of him being escorted onto a plane in the Bahamas uh definitely a different climate he's entering in New York City yeah this time of year yeah for sure he's probably cold uh interesting is that alameda's Caroline Ellison and ftx's Gary wing and Wang have pled guilty to the Department of Justice fraud charges and also have settled with the SEC ncftc they've already settled apparently either that or looking to settle yeah so like they have been talking uh the SEC and also cftc has charged Ellison uh with Market manipulation of the price of ftet no surprises there uh but it looks like that they are moving faster than SPF is when it comes to uh going down the the prisoners dilemma uh rabbit yeah uh I you know you have to wonder what those private conversations were like but um I bet it was it was a lot of like full cooperation and I'm happy to rat SPF out and I have no loyalty to him I bet it was some of that maybe that's why this case is moving so fast yeah perhaps perhaps yeah what's also interesting is that now that this asset recovery program has uh started they're actually starting to find money uh so a new headline out of defiant says FTX finds one billion dollars of comp of inside of hundreds of company bank accounts with no less than 720 million dollars of cash so it's not like a liquid ftt tokens they found 720 million dollars of cash and hundreds of bank accounts hundreds of bank accounts this is this kind of feels like with me and my my multiple times I got the uniswap airdrop because I was too chaotic to own my own ethereum addresses so I just had like 20 couch cushions yeah deposits yeah yeah or if I could help with this uh guys if it was uh this is these were all D5 wallets but um okay but um so they're just like searching the couch cushions basically but yeah you know what's impressive hundreds of company of company bank accounts and have you ever seen those those pictures of the um the org structure of this FDX Empire and Alameda and all of the companies and sub companies and and joint ownership things it's an absolute mess it looks like I'm almost Blown Away by the complexity of this and how he was able to accomplish this yet that's almost like you know FDX has only been around for what like four years something like this yeah less it's like starting a new bank account like every couple of days every two to three days you're starting a new bank account form a new company so that's somebody's job like how do you even do all of this it's impressive at that level uh from a scam perspective a scam perspective anyways uh in addition to just finding their own money they uh have also engaged in clawbacks uh and so it's a article out of the Guardian says FTX intends to commence actions before the bankruptcy court to require the returns of such payments political donations with interest accruing from the date any action is commenced sharing an email address FTX repay ftx.us that recipients could use to voluntarily return money recipients are cautioned that making a payment or a donation to a third party including a charity in the amount of any payment received from an FTX contributor does not prevent FTX debtors from seeking recovery from the recipient or of any subsequent transferee they added in a statement basically saying hey uh we're coming for you hold on to that money because that's ours don't spend it don't politicians yeah the politicians the celebrities the Charities this means I guess Kevin O'Leary you'll have to give back his uh 15 million dollars does this do you think this means the uh he actually keeps it uh because that was actually a payment to him you think so that's that's different I don't know I don't actually I'd be interested in it like like donations I think I mean so they signed a contract with Kevin O'Leary I'm assuming he definitely should I kind of wonder about like you know uh Kobe and Ledger at up only if they'll be subject to this clawback too yeah I mean it's not a ton of no no because it's like a it's a contract that they signed with them for services yeah and they're performing the services and I I don't know I don't know either yeah what constitutes a clawback look definitely if you if you're Kevin O'Leary you should give the 15 minutes if you're a politician yeah you should definitely give them an impact that's a really bad look to just keep that money and spend it on campaign the the headline of this is FTX seeks the clawback donations to politicians and Charities do you know um I have uh I feel like I have closure on SPF at the end of 2022. yeah if he wasn't in jail if there wasn't prosecution ongoing like I would have felt like we were wounded in 2022 and the wound is still open it's still raw but now it feels like you know starting to scab over here yeah we can heal and so that feels really good going it's 2023. it was nice hearing Jake Stravinsky say wow it's surprising how fast this went because in the middle of it it was like why isn't he in jail yet it did not feel fat he's getting away we're watching him get away with it oh he's in jail just kidding thanks [Laughter] um all right well uh in the me in the meanwhile Brian Armstrong was actually uh putting together a regulatory proposal in his his post about this this kind of reminded me of the um the antithesis yes of spf's the inverse post on regulatory that that happened like two weeks ago or sorry two months ago I guess and this is a post from from Brian Armstrong uh I tweeted this out less than 60 days ago I read sbf's crypto regulatory proposal it was hot garbage and it turned out so was FTX uh the proposal we saw from Brian Armstrong was much more practical and saying here's the full post on uh coinbase what's the tldr of this what is uh Armstrong saying the title of this post is regulating crypto how do we move forward as an industry from here what is he saying about how we move forward David yeah there are three pillars that he puts into this uh into this proposal one is create regulatory Clarity for centralized actors no surprise there he names three further are centralized actors that he wants Clarity for stable coins exchanges and custodians and commodities Commodities and securities so making it more clear as to who can issue a stablecoin and how that can be structured he even uh gets a little tidbit as to like if you're a bank you can issue a stable coin and do fractional Reserve if you are going to be compliant in all the banking licenses exchanges and custodians of course you need uh more regulation there and then also Commodities and securities just need Clarity on what so commodity was a security things we've been asking for forever and so that's the first pillar and second pillar is enforce a Level Playing Field this is definitely a tip of the hat to how onshore United States exchanges felt super hamstrung to just the amazing like set of products that FTX was able to produce because they were not on Shore and so in order to be competitive our American Exchange and also keep American U.S money onshore we need our exchanges to be competitive so that's number two enforce a Level Playing Field and three let Innovation happen in decentralized crypto Brian Armstrong always keeping defy in mind and saying like hey we the whole point of crypto is to be like decentralized and do decentralized stuff so let that thing grow and regulate the centralized actors like coinbase appropriately uh these are three fantastic pillars they it it's it was so refreshing to read this thing it's like oh this makes just so much rational logical sense we don't even have to overthink this and thank you Brian for posting this yeah and I mean part of this was in the dccpa right definitely be part of kind of the exchange regulation it wasn't as much on on uh stable coins um but there was in the dccpa the legislation of which SBF was a proponent some language about Securities versus Commodities and some clarity there there was a little something I don't know if it went as far enough but the difference is with the dccpa is basically treated all of defy as if it was a centralized exchange and required similar levels of of compliance and registration even down to kind of like the front ends absolutely terrible piece of legislation that SBF seemed like he was crafting in order to like pull up the ladder on all of the Innovation that would come after him and install protections for FTX now um this is not what coinbase is saying at all not what Brian is saying at all and um you know I think he means it I I definitely I hope he means it but this at least is sensible right Let's Kick the Can down the road for defy it doesn't need this level of Regulation at this point in time the easy wins clearly here in the US from a regulatory perspective are stable coins let's do the thing where we get a Bitcoin ETF and it's actually a Bitcoin ETF let's finally here with complete Clarity from uh our regulators and lawmakers that eth is not a security like can we just do that I mean these are the easy low-hanging fruit stuff uh that where you can kind of Institute this and allow D5 to continue to flourish in in the U.S so uh it seems like a no-brainer to me it's of course not the perspective of um all lawmakers here but um yeah this is uh this is a refreshing take on things and yeah I think for certain like status lawmakers who are going to look at this thing and it's like but how do we surveil people and stuff like that and stuff that's like we're just not going to be able to come to terms with exactly and that's where I'm happy to fight the battles but this meme of like oh people in crypto don't want any regulation no we just we don't want dumb regulations we don't want your regulation you don't want yes if you're gonna make regulation mean band D5 effectively then like no that's dumb don't do that David there's some cool stuff going on at Visa though stepping to the frontier what's this about yeah so global payment uh giant Visa signaled stronger it sustained interest in crypto releasing a paper outlining how the firm could one day collaborate with the ethereum network on automatic payments and so they released a document that a research document of sorts talking about account abstraction which is a 400 level ethereum topic crypto topic and how account and account instruction wallet could enable visa to set up automatic payments for monthly bills so inside of this article uh here's a quote many of us rely on automatic payments to pay monthly bills in a few simple steps we can set up reoccurring payments with a yoke local utility or subscription provider with blockchain technology potentially representing a new way to process payments in a distributed and programmable fashion could this everyday payment experience be replicated or even improved on the blockchain with the punchline Visa is exploring exactly that and so this is a technical piece where Visa outline lines how to write a smart contract app for a self-custodial wallet where that wall is maintained exclusively by the user and the user has the private key and the application allows a user to set up a programmable payment instructions to push funds from their self-custodial wallet to another wallet at reoccurring intervals without using the user's participation at each time basically an automation of what a lot of just Commerce is but Visa is exploring how to do this with self custody account abstracted while it's on ethereum and they are researching they are pushing the frontier here so this is super cool self-custed reoccurring payments is a fantastic use case and bypasses the banks completely how cool is that you know what else is cool David is this is actually a hackathon project that they've implemented and you know account abstraction is not yet available on ethereum in the mainnet but it is available right now in um a stockware and that in this darknet ecosystem and so they actually built this fully out on starknet using Argent as the wallet this is another example I think of like the ethereum mainnet will be sort of more conservative for a while and some of the Innovation like we already have account abstraction in starknet some of that will start to happen in layer twos is an incredibly bullish in terms of how we push push this industry forward using sort of layer twos as our Frontier for Innovation and technology and they could deploy this kind of thing on Layer Two even absent the ethereum mainnet supporting account abstraction super cool Amanda yeah great stuff great stuff all right coming up next the metrics behind the Trump nft drop I know you all wanted to hear exactly how many newbies bought Trump nfts now we were here for your Trump impression David and then I got I got none more of that so Ryan what do you think more than 50 new buyers or more than 50 of them are nft uh speculators ooh I'm gonna go with uh new buyers more than 50 I think this reached an entirely new audience all right we'll see held by it but others would be okay yeah other things as well Ren protocol is in trouble uh Ren the the bridge that puts assets on one train across to another chain we'll talk about that and also binance bailout not a binance uh not a bailout for binance but binance bailing somebody out who is getting bailed out by binance all of this and more right after we talked to some fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for your users sequence is a smart wallet and it's the easiest most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the web 3 world multi-change support nft display and users can buy sfts nfts and crypto directly with a credit or debit card for developers sequence is the Plug and Play platform for web 3 games and apps their apis let you bring nfts sfts and tokens into your game or application in a sequence relayer enables gasless transactions for your users sequins already Powers some of the best web3 games like skyweaver nft projects like cool cats and marketplaces like Nifty Swap and sequence is compatible with all the evm chains including ethereum polygon binance smart chain arbitrum optimism and Avalanche so go to sequence.xyz banklist to start building or speak with a sequence team today if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web for your world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network it was recently announced that Moon pay the on-ramp is now integrated directly into the uniswap front end so you can now buy tokens on uniswap directly through uniswap using moonpay that's got to be one of the fastest on-ramps into ethereum that I can think of direct to us straight into the coins you know you don't have to that's a that's a choice look there is great personal responsibility when it comes to to crypto because you can literally buy anything on uniswap and it's completely up to you but this is really cool this is a screenshot of of how it looks and you can see this is fully integrated into the uniswap app where you could just buy crypto directly from uniswap so stay the step in the process and not have to transfer through an exchange I wonder if we're ever gonna see uh PayPal there I would imagine so I mean there's probably all sorts of different on-ramps are a big deal like a big freaking deal um and um it's cool to see some of these larger companies getting the game there uh but David what's going on with Ren protocol first of all what is Ren protocols because it's been a while since um I've heard that name actually and last I recall it was like some sort of a uh cross chain asset Bridge of some sort so if I wanted my eth on um well if I wanted my Bitcoin on eth I could use Ren in order to get there somehow yeah that's exactly right yeah so Ren BTC is a token that you could buy on a unit swap however with this news I wouldn't suggest it in this present moment um but it was basically this think of this like a just like a mesh layer between many many many chains a very ambitious project it's like a measure layer between many chains that had its own token called Ren uh and ren was the asset that economically secured all of the cross-chain transfers of assets so it was like a bridge but a hyperlinked bridge across all the blockchains at least that's what the vision was um it was actually bought by Alameda back in February shortly after being bought by Alameda started supporting Solana uh because in hindsight now we know that we need to do everything we need to do to prop up the price of Seoul because that's what Sam was using as collateral but I digress anyways now that Alameda bought Ren and then is now defunct uh there's no more funding for Ren and so according to this article uh uh Alameda was contributing for 700 000 per quarter to keep the rent operation going and during a community call last month Wren revealed that it only had 16 160 000 left in funding only enough cash to get down to the end of the year uh and so uh there's probably further details about what this means if you are a holder of Ren tokens uh so click that link in the show notes to go dive down that red behold to see what you need to do but uh the ren 1.0 network is shutting down and they they are saying that compatibility between run 1.0 and 2.0 cannot be guaranteed so if you are a holder of ran 1.0 assets you should probably do something uh by and something I mean like go back to uh import your ran tokens back to their native assets uh so uh definitely pay attention to that if you are a holder of any rent tokens I've never been a huge fan of this sort of bridging personally it's always forgotten like I'm glad that it's that it's there as an option but also like not glad because I think it provides a false sense of security because really the security of that ran Bitcoin on eth is kind of backed by the value of Ren the token itself yeah and it was always and the security of the protocol too which is also unknown yeah um I'm not particularly bullish these types of bridging Solutions much more bullish kind of layer twos and trustless bridges they seem to be a very seasonal thing because I remember this being a topic of conversation during the the height of the last bull market like during the last responsibility yeah interoperability it's always a meme and it seems to be like one of these things that gets a lot of funding during the bull markets and starts to work during the bull markets and then breaks during the bear market so every single time however I will say that rent actually did stick around throughout the last bear Market it has been around for two cycles um perhaps talking about yeah perhaps no longer let's talk about youth Global what's happening in 2023 like all around the world there's 18 different hackathons is that right yeah so many so many yeah so each Global released their big 2023 schedule so if you are a developer who is at hackathon at tendor here we go scaling ethereum in March 8th Global Tokyo in April at least Global Istanbul and May 8th Global Toronto in June Paris in July that's right after ECC New York in September I'll probably be there uh and then uh eth online in October and then eth Global at Devcon sometime in 2024 so if you are a hackathon attendor their schedule is out so mark your calendars for 2023. uh build Market that's what we're doing here we're building um Devcon has that location been announced yet David no no it has not okay uh we'll have to see I'm waited with baited breath all right let's talk about those Trump nfts baby uh Trump made did you know this I don't know about your 50 question earlier but I do know he made about 6.7 million on nfts last week and I also know David for Trump that means he ain't leaving he's here to stay Trump nft drop 2.0 coming very soon yeah I mean I should mention all of that money probably didn't go directly into Trump's pocket I'm sure this was some sort of Licensing deal where some third party was doing this on his behalf but you know he got a sizable cut using his likeness and the Trump brand and his face and his uh muscly chiseled body on some of these nfts that had to come with the cost so give us the stats what was what is the case is it it are a bunch of new nft users in these Trump nfts or are these the same old dgns that are now like aping into Trump nfts and dumping them yeah so zero X Sydney put together a fantastic thread detailing some of these metrics so about fifteen thousand point eight total holders and about 65 percent of that about 10 000 wallets only hold one card uh so that's a pretty good distribution I'd say uh yeah so like skipping down to uh let's go down to wait one second here the largest whale is is oh it's the team and they have a thousand cards I thought somebody bought a thousand the second largest holder has 329 cards all purchased from the secondary Market they didn't even mint it oh wow wow and like this per the particular person who bought 329 cars on the secondary uh has transactions in their wallet that goes back to 500 days ago both on polygon and on ethereum so this is Donald it was Donald Trump Jr the person that paid the for the highest sale uh was a whopping 37 eth and they owned 24 drum cards All Purpose from secondaries wow paid a total of 72 eth across the entire collection wow wow 84 000 yeah uh okay so doing okay about 9.7 000 holders do not hold any Matic or ether which means that they are likely a first-time nft purchaser that probably paid with a credit card so that is our Assumption of these are all first time crypto users 9.7 000 people bought one trump card and they don't have any ease or Matic in their wallet means they don't have any gas to pay to transfer those things so if you do the math 9.7 are crypto noobs 10 12.8 total minted The Collection so that brings us to a whopping 76 of new crypto users because of the Trump nft wow wow okay so what do we do here uh more private keys and more hands is net good thing right more benefits that's what we say that good yes couple people onboarded onboarding people to crypto um look at the floor price of these things right now it's uh 0.23 at the time 0.23 for 45 000 units is that is that really true 45 000 items yes yeah at point two three almost a quarter of an eighth what the absolute half dude that is insane um I don't think I've paid much attention to these things it's just it's basically pictures of trump uh that's 276 dollars for a floor nft and the minimum price was 100 so it does not appear to me like a lot of time went into these things it's just Trump no this is this is one picture of trump with different things photoshopped online there is only one photo of trump the the entire collection is just one Trump photo it's just one Trump photo and then he has different backgrounds different suits different bodies different hats but it's just one Trump photo look I am not a um nft Aficionado but um I might call this a low effort nft David I don't know your name 45 000 of them and it's a lot of quantity yeah I don't know about the quality though why I hope everyone knows and I guess getting onboarded into the polygon Network as a result I wonder how many of those users actually like learned how to use metamask through this for example it must have been a lot yeah oh this was funny did you see this tweet thread so this was a tweet thread because because there's one photo right so like where did they get all the bodies uh and so apparently there's these are all like shutter stock images that they just like pulled off the Shutterstock image and slapped it onto trumps and like edited it for a little bit and like there's so many examples of these of like where they got the tuxedo for Trump and then they just slapped it on there it's just the most on-brand thing I can think of for Trump just like one Trump photo like ten thousand like shutter stock stock images just slapped on there and they they for a friend crush on it they look pretty good and also I'm crushing it yeah I also like crushing it in terms of volume and sales um yeah amazing there yeah um all right which Trump is here so is Reddit of course Reddit they just launched another free nft collection they've been crushing it toward the end of this year um five days ago is called the recap 2022. this was free but already David has 1.3 million owners they call these not nfts in the Reddit ecosystem they call them digital Collectibles and the community is definitely collecting them 1.3 million owners of this thing this is all happening behind the scenes I think that's pretty amazing as well yeah and mainly I don't think I would say the majority of these people don't know that they're nfts uh because like there's no trading volume on these things they're not they're not getting like transferred around right um here is a uh graph from Hill Dobby and this is uh maybe a sobering graph of some of the nft market from 2022. um what are we looking at here yeah so this is wash trading on ethereum ethereum nft wash trading volume and there was basically zero off trading up until about I think like the start of this year maybe like January of 2022 and you know I mean you said sobering but also Ryan remember this is when uh looks rare launched and looks rare in incentivized trading based trading in general which created wash trading what is wash trading for people who don't have a crisp definition of that it's when you like buy and sell an nft immediately and so perhaps you do that from one wallet to another uh you do it to a friend you just you just do fake it's not a real trade you fake a trade why would you do this a whole number of reasons for for looks rare it's to uh to earn looks tokens because you were paid for volume on looks rare uh you can also do it to uh launder money if that's your Vibe don't suggest it uh you can also do it too uh due to tax locks officing as well um there's plenty of ways to there's plenty of reason to to wash an nft trade some legitimate some not legitimate um yeah anyway this graphic is showing a lot of the volume does it say 44 of the volume traded in all of 2022 was wash traded uh I mean yeah looks like it yeah it was definitely concentrated in the middle of the height of the Mania it's definitely come down now but watch trading is probably going to be a thing that is just I'm not gonna say plagues because again it's not inherently negative um but it's going to be a thing something that's like always going to be a part of the nft industry I love that you can see this all on chain though right and yeah this is a sort of a citizen journalist type uh Hill Dobby who's constantly coming up with these fantastic games uh doing analytics Master yeah yeah he's just crazy at this um Christy's down kind of bad from an nft perspective at least from those 2022 highs uh they their sales Christie's nft sales fell 96 in 2022 not unexpected um but when you look at these numbers David uh Art Auction House Christie sold 87 nfts for a total of 5.9 million in 2022 and that was down 96 percent compared to 2021 so um must have been hundreds of millions previously yeah 150 million in 2021 so a down year for Christie's from that perspective yeah I just don't think anyone's surprised by this and also Chrissy's continues to make uh Investments and efforts into building out uh like virtual auction houses for nfts for moving forward so I don't even though they're down I think they are still bullish look they're so psyched about the new growth like opportunity that they didn't previously have and now they we have digital art um let's talk about some more digital art that's coming a digital book collectible this is the last in a series of five we are calling the uh the Genesis collection where you can get an nft of five of our favorite bankless podcasts and this is the original collection there's only gonna be five of these the last one is getting issued tomorrow and the last one is another one of my favorite episodes of all time David what are we releasing tomorrow uh the fifth of five of the Genesis collection is of course none other than vitalik buterin who else could it be uh and we are going to tokenize episode 99 end the game which I think was a fantastic episode about the long-term uh philosophy of the ethereum road map uh and not just the technical details but why it is what it is so if you want to collect the ethereum roadmap as a podcast with vitalik buterin that is available at collectibles.banklist.com at noon eastern time on Friday tomorrow uh well today if you're listening to this tomorrow Friday sorry about it today it's today it's the 23rd of December 12 p.m Eastern thank you you can pick that up uh and uh previous ones have gone fast like the Drake one three blogs they're sold out in three blocks yeah um all right let's talk Bitcoin stuff and I guess the story around Bitcoin right now is a bunch of Bitcoin miners going bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy what's this one David yeah core scientific which one of the bigger Bitcoin miners out there has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection uh it's one of the largest public train mining firms still generating positive cash flow but just not enough to pay back the debts that it owes and so when Energy prices go up which energy prices are up big right now and also Bitcoin prices go down Ryan that is bad for the mining industry that is not what you want uh and so uh of course scientific estimated assets and liabilities is at between 1 and 10 billion dollars uh one billion dollars facets 10 billion dollars of liabilities uh and has between one and five thousand creditors per it's filing well here's the thing David is uh this always ends up leading to consolidation doesn't it yeah because who's going to buy these assets a a stronger healthier Bitcoin mining company that was able to weather this storm they're going to end up purchasing these assets and so the big fish get bigger and the kind of the smaller weak fish get weeded out and they die and then you get increasing consolidation um that's always been my take as well that like the the destruction of Bitcoin at the bottom of the bowl bottom of the bear always leads to consolidation when I gave this that take to bitcoiners that they say well actually the biggest fish dissolve and a lot of the cheaper fish smaller fish get to buy up discounted mining equipment so that was their retort to that I don't know that that practically happens just because the economies of scale and the risks to launching like injecting enough Capital to launch something like this they're so large these days in particular like you have to have a lot of capital in order to inject this it makes sense to me the Bitcoin um uh take on this is interesting about proof of work is that it's a free market anyone can enter um but actually I I find staking much more compelling from that perspective as a soul of stakers never going to have to go bankrupt and go out of business are they yeah you don't need to invest to get ahead of your competition you just put ether into your validator uh it's interesting and I think more more might be ahead uh as they weather this storm but let's talk about binance all right maybe binance is doing the thing that FDX could not which is actually purchasing Voyager and helping to bail out some of the Voyager depositors refresh us who is Voyager uh again and so and what is what's the story there and what's binance doing yeah Voyager is the digital currency exchange that gave a 660 million dollar unsecured loan to three arrows Capital who vaporized that loan uh and was unable to pay Voyager back which caused Voyager to go into bankruptcy uh and now binance us is now looking to acquire oh uh but no not before Alameda attempted to bail out Voyager so Alameda gave I think a voyager like a 250 million dollar line of revolving line of credit to maintain liquidity and then Alameda went bust uh and so here we are now binance us has uh won a 1.02 billion dollar bid to buy a voyager digital and all of their distress assets and so this is looking like this is going to happen uh so cool I guess this is uh some light at the end of the tunnel for anyone who had assets inside a voyager you might be able to get your money back as a result of this are we worried about this though is this like I mean I'm feeling a little bit of deja vu a big crypto Banker steps in not SPF this time it's CZ going and buying the assets um I just it feels kind of similar to a recent pattern but yeah it's easy different than SPF though is the request is it is it ridiculous for me to say like let's just give CZ the benefit of the doubt I don't know he made he made it through two Market Cycles uh and he's well he's he's doing the main character thing right now which is a little bit concerning but like I don't know he hasn't indicated anything that binance is completely uh like Finance is above board as far as I can tell that's the thing that's the the then statement is as far as we can tell and we don't know for sure but I guess the the other option for Voyager was what complete chapter 11 bankruptcy go bust your death so this has got to be at least better than that this is a Lifeline this is some hope uh so we'll see if uh binance and CZ can pull this off um this was a take David I saw this week so this is the Senate banking chairman says when asked about banning cryptocurrency maybe could be a good idea not too sure here's a quote from him maybe Banning it although Banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work some of the senator type conversation is uh absolutely maddening to me a message to Sherrod Brown um you said Banning it would be very difficult because it will go offshore let me give you another reason why it's going to be difficult it's going to be difficult because we will fight you the entire time these are our digital property rights Senator Brown These are important this is not only difficult because it will go offshore it's difficult because this is a breach of our constitutional rights to own these sorts of assets and to preserve our privacy um so I think also I got news for you Senator Brown it's already offshore if you ban it here you're just Banning your own citizens from accessing something that already exists it's not going to go offshore it's it's already it's on the internet bro I think some of this is posturing uh similar to like kind of I think some of this thing is just being uneducated about how this works maybe we'll ban crypto because I'm a regulator and I can do whatever the hell I want I'll just pay on that oh you like that I'll be on it no bro like it's not how it works yeah uh anyway this would obviously be challenged in court there'd be a lot of reasons why crypto is going to be difficult to ban including as he rightly points out that it'll be completely ineffective and counterproductive so um let's hope logic holds as we get into 2022 oh my God David all right jobs time this might be the last time we tell you in 2022 that you should get a job in crypto even now even during the bear Mark is a good time to work in crypto for companies that are hiring I'm going to read out the jobs and Bitcoin denominated salaries are at all-time highs right now Silver Lining I love it Alchemy is hiring a back-end engineer unit swap labs they need a senior front-end engineer diagram Ventures needs an associate for crypto Adventure creation Rabbit Hole business operations person diagram Ventures is uh continuing to hire two I guess crypto Venture creation Specialists maker Dow needs a legal counsel I could go on but I don't have to because these are posted on bankless.palot.com jobs and you can get a job in crypto and start 2023 off right all right David what do we got coming up next coming up next we got some hot takes from crypto Twitter and then Ron and I take some time to on Wells Fargo because you know it's the end of the year you got it you gotta punch them on the way out uh and then of course we got the meme of the week so all of that and more first though we have to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors so help you go bankless arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing

Which documents the penalties that Wells Fargo has accrued since 2012. in 2012 5.3 billion paid for mortgage abuses in 2013 1.9 billion paid for banking violations in 2018 2 billion was paid for toxic Securities abuses in 2020 3 billion was paid for fraud and in 2022 just recently 3.7 billion was paid for customer abuses these are all Collective penalties that Wells Fargo has paid and I was doing a little bit of a deep dive just to fact check this you know how many billions of dollars Wells Fargo has paid since 2000 in penalties right I bet we're in double digits here we are at 20 billion dollars of penalties wow paid by Wells Fargo since 2020. and I just really want to drive two more points since this wait since 2000. excuse me since 2000 since 2000. okay one it would the 20 220 billion dollars that they paid since 20 since 2000 it's just a fraction of the money that they made because they keep on doing it yeah so like they made more money that it's these are all slaps on the wrist so think about all of the Shady ways that they made money and how much money you think that they made when they only paid 20 billion dollars so that's the first point I want to drive home second point is you don't get caught the first time you do something and so like we actually don't know what they this is these are just the things that we know about these are the things that they've just been caught for and so like they were fined 3.7 billion dollars in 2022 for customer abuses I'm gonna go ahead and guess they've been abusing customers the whole time I'm gonna go ahead and guess that that's the goddamn business model of the goddamn company and it's just happened to be that in 2022. the the the nation state said hey you're doing things a little bit Shady pay us 3.7 billion dollars to continue and we'll keep and we'll just find you a few more billion dollars in a few we look good you Farm your customers yeah absolutely insane do you know what's um crazy about this too as I look at this rap sheet you know a 5.3 billion in 2012 1.9 billion 2013 2 billion 2018. I mean this is a repeat offender David yeah it's not like it's just they just change what they are calling their the offense mortgage abuses banking violations toxic security abuses fraud customer abuses those could all be the same thing how does this link to going bankless all right it's just like Banks suck we know from a ux perspective they're also um preying on their customers it seems like with kind of a rent seeking uh in many ways toxic business model um Bank list has always been about using less Banks over time by the way um somebody somebody over the weekend on Twitter tried to um tried to nail us and and get us with the gotcha which is basically like uh David and Ryan are you guys even bankless anyway or do you secretly have bank accounts do you think we don't have 82 year old landlord accepts ethereum no we don't we don't secretly have bank accounts we publicly have Banks we've talked about this forever yes we want to have less bank accounts over time and every year A Benchmark for me David since I've been on this crypto journey is like is my more of my net worth outside of banks than inside of banks number one and am I using uh crypto money systems more than I'm using my Wells Fargo account I like literally have a Wells Fargo account that I'm stuck with because I have to pay bills in real life all right and every single year that those two metrics have gone up in that I have been more bankless this year than I was in the previous year and that's what this journey is about um because uh look this is these predatory practices this kind of landlord rent-seeking middleman type of behavior that most of the time goes unchecked we can solve this at the protocol level how everybody owns their own money we don't require the banks to give us permission to withdraw money from an account we can have a smart contract wallet with a circle of social recovery a small set of uh friends and family that I trust helped me record you know recover my keys I can use defy rather than use the traditional banking system that's why we're on this journey so Wells Fargo Can't Screw us any longer nice rant that's great that's like it's really just a matter of just like my Wells Fargo account is like Gathering dust and you know how I know this is like I have to reset my password every time I log in because I can always forget it yeah I mean then I got a password manager no I don't have you have you actually gone in person to Wells Fargo this year I remember I remember I used to do that like this year no not this year uh our banks oh no I did because I needed to get quarters remember we used to do like bankless paychecks with like actual physical checks right yeah to like show up at Wells Fargo and like yeah yeah exactly yeah our um our our previous Bank by the way uh uh bankless the the company's entity was previously banked with um Bank of America and they sent us a Dear John Letter and kicked us out one day Community uh Credit Unions ironic that uh you know we actually were made bankless yeah um but anyway that's Wells Fargo continuing to uh be great be great be really good content for this podcast that's for sure so here's here's the associated meme with this is like uh so after Wells Fargo gets violated this pays violations here's my favorite SpongeBob Meme which is the SpongeBob looking at that rock and he goes like Oh when we see me running this is a esoteric SpongeBob Meme he's like he's like basically The Flash and he goes like I want to see me go and touch that rock want to see me do it again if you don't if you didn't get the SpongeBob me then you didn't get it I'm sorry but whatever bankless fans are going crazy right now they're wild with excitement um just a reminder this is for me I actually received a binance account deactivation notice um from an old binance account that uh that I had that uh I no longer used um this is what it looked like uh account deactivate deactivation notice thank you for your support of binance this is to inform you that your account has been flagged by a third-party compliance tool and we've taken a tough decision to terminate the service you may withdraw your funds and ask that you do it before uh December 27th they gave me like 10 days or something afterward your binance account will be permanently deactivated look this is just a PSA for us to remember that the um the crypto banks that we use they can provide a fantastic service are very important great crypto platforms um they can still deactivate your account what is the definition of of a bank is you it can deactivate your account yeah and so this is why we are such Advocates of of decentralized financial systems like ethereum an eth address can never be deactivated I'm never going to get an email or a message like that saying you can no longer access your private keys on ethereum right that just can't happen I have direct access to it and always will and so that is I think a distinction that a lot of people learned in 2022 uh and uh yeah just another reminder of it when I got this account notice from binance and then there's a you had a critique a critique Oriel Zengo who said okay but your ethereum wallet can be stolen fished lost tricked and malicious scams oh and your reply is exactly what I was going to say yes those are all things that you as an individual have control over as somebody that has like juggled 50 wallets over the last like five years never lost a single one never gotten fished never never been tricked in a malicious scam oh except for that one iota scam uh and I haven't even though and like I've never been stolen so like yes it can be those things but that's because I'm in control like stolen fish lost tricked and like that could happen to your Wells Fargo probably like they but that's their problem now what's your problem you're the only time I've actually like lost um sums of money in crypto it's actually been uh on um crypto Banks relating platforms really yeah yeah remember like I've lost a little bit in Celsius a little bit in Block five those are the only times I've actually lost Village so you can't lose your own money you'll just trust somebody else to lose it for you great all right man um it's been a year hasn't it David uh it's been a fun year it's good in so many ways 51 weekly roll-ups yeah I'm gonna do this 15 seconds I'm gonna do the 50 second next week but you're gonna be out yeah oh thank you thank you for doing that um but let's let's uh end with this then what do you bullish on and uh this could be this week this could be going into 2023 whatever you're bullish on right now oh I'm bullish on 2023. the whole entire year uh and not just not just in crypto although like when I'll say it again when prices are this low and when we're down this bad like it's kind of like up only uh hopefully like the upside is larger than the downside that's for sure yes but what I'm talking about in 2023 is a little bit just more like um 2022 was challenging for the crypto World also for bankless uh and you know I know you know this like team has grown bigly uh we're doing some really ambitious things uh and uh I've now I'm I'm at the point with my own personal life we're like oh I can't just like ape into 2023 without like a plan and so like I've got my calendar up I was like in this month I'm doing this and that month I'm doing that like I need to have this done by this month uh and so like I I'm just like leaning into the whole like structure thing and I encourage other bankless listeners to do something similar like if you for example were listening to the eth global hackathons and you want to go to some of those get a calendar put them on uh also put youth Denver on there and put like a CC on there like set up a goal a system of goals for 2023 uh because if you're going to win big in crypto it's good that's what it's going to take uh so Ryan I'm bullish on 2023 being like a planned structured year for all of the crypto industry for me personally for bankless and hopefully we can all just like plan the end of the bull market rather than just wait for it to happen 100 I'm so bullish on on having a plan going into 2023 well you know I'm a planner but like yeah that that's look that's how you um too many people I think in in um were just thrown by the seat of their pants and went wherever the wind I carried them in 2021 and 2022. they didn't have a Bedrock thesis for the space they didn't have a plan for the space they would a fomo into things uh and you know during the fun times they they would sell at the bottoms like that's that's a recipe for disaster you just get thrown around and tossed by the wind and you can never accomplish anything so yeah I'm I'm absolutely bullish on having a plan too um you know you know what outside belush on though David tell me I am bullish on 2023 being way smarter than 2022. 2022 was just dumb like it it almost uh and I don't want this to sound glib but I I think we have some separation on it where we could zoom out and and distance ourselves from it but 2022 really needed to happen yeah they absolutely needed to happen there's no way we could have a successful 2023 or 2024 without 2022 happening um crypto is now way smarter a lot of the tourists have left a lot of the corrupt fraudsters are out too um the shaky companies have been completely wrecked um much of this was justified some of it didn't it wasn't of course but but much of it was and we're coming out into 2023 way stronger way smarter um crypto didn't die once again the builders are still building and uh this is the the you know the underlying ever since we started this bankless podcast we started this this podcast because there's a recognition I think that you and I have that the world needs crypto more than ever and going into 2023 it's the same thing it's like the world needs crypto even more than when we started the podcast back in 2020 David yeah like it's become more critical more necessary and we are smarter we're uh better capitalized we have more builders in the space we have a clear road map and direction for where we're going so um that's that's what I'm excited about is we just got a lot smarter 2023 uh is going to be a fantastic year I think it could be one of the best years for for being in crypto I don't have the hopelessness that I had in 2018 right I'm like oh we'll get through this uh not a big deal and uh yeah I'm excited about it there was like a A vibe in about like 2019 I think where it was the Golden Age of building in ethereum it's really the golden age that like so many of us during the peak of the bull market were like man I really want some of those quiet times to come back that 2019 feels like 2023 it's like okay the Pain's behind us there's just building left and just signal and and progress that kind of feels like the the right is this David too stupid to map it is like uh 2019 is like 2023 right 2020 is going to be 2024 analogous and then we're gonna get another 2021 that's gonna be 2025. do you think it will like just play out pretty much exactly like that or close to that it's just another fractal pattern you asked if it's too stupid to do that I think yes and it's still going to be right I think so too like that if you were to ask my just you know gone to my head prediction on how this is played that's exactly what I would say I would say we'll have next year where we're building it's gonna be like 2019 or just yeah and it'll be 2023 will be just you know Builders there'll be some chop uh it'll be boring it'll be all sideways action we won't even get any big run-ups and then 2022 will hit and we'll have a glimmer it'll be something like that 2024. oh 2020. 24 will be the bull market but only in hindsight you won't know it in the moment in a small segment of people only the people who have stayed around will actually see the glimmers we won't get mainstream in 2024 it'll be like 2022 and then we'll have breakout in 2025. yeah and we'll get back to kind of mania craziness 2021 calm down it will all forget to sell it'll be great that that's what I would predict uh meme of the week remember they're looking at David how it started Sam bakeman freed playing with some magic cards sitting in front of six monitors in his gaming chair looking like uh you know a traitor God is how it started uh and now it's how it's going which is being escorted with you know unshaved unkempt sweaty shirt into a jail wow these two pitchers sum up the beginning of of this year and the end of this year the top of 2022 and the bottom of 2022. well um guys make this listeners on behalf of us to you I hope you enjoy some time with your family happy holidays David's going to be with you next week next Friday
