you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both

you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiren is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well all right bankless nation welcome back it's not only bitcoin that is in full beast mode full sense it's full send it's also ether that has gone full send as well david and i are here to talk about this david let's start with that number 524 thousand 288 eth right what is the significance of that number that is the number of ether that we needed it to have gotten deposited into the deposit contract last night uh and uh we absolutely blew that number out of the water we were talking a while ago a couple weeks ago i guesstimated like 85 chance probability that we'd make it you said 95 chance the fact that we exceeded that number by like 25 more either than what was needed this probably makes me think that the probability was even higher than 95 percent david i felt a little nervous i'm gonna be honest the uh the last uh probably maybe like three days before so because look when you put when you've got a reputation like we have david which is absolutely stellar and you put sparkly sparkly um like indisputed basically and you put percentages of 80 probability or like 95 probability right uh and you're wrong yeah it doesn't feel great right it's a scar and it looked like uh things weren't happening as quickly as we thought well you even when we had eric connor on it was funny because we had eric connor on we're talking about like uh patriotic duty to steak and this sort of thing and uh eric connor like leads ether i think and even he was like well guys it only makes state it only makes sense from like from a pragmatic investor perspective if you're making the returns but the funny thing about it was um eric eric's tweet like two days ago was basically like oh change of plans i've gone into staking like i'm doing this for real forget yield farmings and he stepped up as well in a big way and i think many in the ethereum community did and this is just the ethereum community delivering that's what makes me more bullish than the actual numbers here it's like the community came together collectively to go accomplish something and not only did it do it technically but it did it socially in getting this contract funded and now we have eth2 december 1st 2020 that is going to be the launch date for this new internet bond and it's super bullish yeah and you know what i think happened is like the deposits ticked up slowly right and if if it ticked up at the rate that it started to and if it continued that it was totally gonna miss we weren't gonna get there um but as that happened the spots to fill became more scarce right because if you're not in the deposit contract by the time the deadline hits then you are gotta wait in line right so i think all of a sudden people like saw that first it started going slowly and then it ticked up a little bit in speed still wasn't enough but then it just like burst because the fomo kicked in like fomo of being part of east 2 kicked in and it kicked in really really hard um so like i said in the in the intro to this to the show like just a massive vote of confidence to how strongly the community is rallying behind like the desires for eth2 like there's a lot of external fud coming like especially coming from like bitcoiners who are like do does the ethereum community even want ethereum too like how do the ethereum developers even know that like ethereum 2.0 is interesting to the ethereum community which to me is just like a total disconnect from reality but if there was any debate about what the ethereum community wants like look at the numbers like we want use too we want it we want it rolling we want you too absolutely all right so here's something else i think um that kind of combats the foot and is basically a a headwind going into the bull run for ethereum over the last i don't know three years this whole bear market the narrative has spread that eth2 will never ship it cannot ship eth is too slow every single ethereum killer so-called started with this premise that basically we can develop ethereum is a great idea but we can develop faster than ethereum we can do eth2 better and faster than ethereum can yes you know hundreds of million dollars of like projects were based on this entire obvious entire premise like yeah a billion dollar ico right that eth would would never ship would never be able to conquer defensive near like polka dot like how many do we want to list although they're still out there they're still out there so and then what happened it shipped it shipped and not only did it ship like i this is not the entire like eth2 vision the serenity vision but the hardest part like talk to you justin drake talk to danny ryan we've talked to talk to vitalik they will all tell you that this phase zero is the absolute hardest part to get right because this is the danny called it the heartbeat or like the brain of the operation this is the consensus layer right here and this is the launch of staking so when you get that right i'm not saying you know the next phases just fall into place magically it'll still take some time but this was the big thing for the eath community to overcome and we've overcome now it hasn't launched yet so december 1st is another milestone here but uh we've we've got a date now and now the smart contracts are in charge so that's what dictates what's going to happen next yeah the the eth2 will never ship like all of a sudden if you are still saying that like you have a so much responsibility to prove that statement like right now the default position is that youth 2 is shipping right and the market is starting to price that in right okay tell me about price david said we're gonna get there okay we can't talk about price yet because there's so many things to talk about as to why the price is doing the thing that it's doing right now one of them is just the removal of execution risk of ethereum 2.0 right like that's that's a huge thing so there's no way like people can can still be legitimately saying that eth2 will never ship uh unless you have some sort of crazy knowledge that the rest of us don't have yeah absolutely it's it's definitely going to start ship it's i mean it's it's already out there so they they can't say that like where do you want to start with this then david i want to start with this and so in 2017 the bull market had this underpinning of like dude we're going to be able to stake ether like in six months right in 2018 yeah it's coming in 2018. uh is that what you thought that's what i thought i was stacking my ether in order to prepare for staking uh and so i was two now yeah right and then and then it never came right and then like the bull market kind of ended the icos are not a very good mechanism to capture value over the long term they're very fleeting if icos stop making people money then people are going to leave and that's exactly what happened and staking didn't come in order to absorb that capital soon enough right like staking is coming like exactly in like seven days like we missed that mark by roughly three years like whoops um but the whole underpinning of the bull market was by the prospect of staking ethan getting a return and ether scarcity as a result of that and that that was happening towards the tail end of 2017 bull run like that was at the end of the bull run now staking is here really at the even before the bull run for 2020 is really getting started like to me the price action now is just a return to the norm a return to fair values bull markets always happen when we shoot above and beyond that but to me like staking is happening before retail rather than after retail but before people flood in not afters and so like the whole like genesis and development of ethereum too all of the energy and capital and attention that got devoted to ethereum killers back in 2017 and 2018 that's not going to exist that's just going to exist on to ethereum that capital and energy is going to be directed towards ethereum about the excitement of ethereum 2.0 and instead of trying to fund your average ethereum killer it's much more likely that that capital gets deployed to trying to build some sort of crazy awesome application on ethereum that's just a much more likely outcome in my eyes and we're already seeing it absorb capital you know i tweeted this out let me uh let me share this with you david because this is uh super cool i think so um one way to look at how much capital staking has absorbed is to look at sort of like we've called it the internet bond in the bond market and if you look at the domestic bond market of other nations and you like chart all of the nations and how much much in terms of bonds they've issued ether right now at launch will be somewhere between el salvador and venezuela in size so if you plot it on kind of nations it is number 145 with a 314 million dollar bond market actually just reran the numbers because the numbers in the deposit contract have gone up and ether price has gone up we are now at 390 million dollars in the cap of deposits you know what then we just passed st lucia and we're right behind the tree of bond market today baby working our way up the line we're trailing uzbekistan okay so now we're at uh 143. not too bad uh so this is what i mean of course the the non-sovereign bond market is absolutely massive we've estimated it like 57 trillion with a t inside and of course the big apex predator in the in the bond market is uh treasuries the old t bills that's that's number one but this is another interesting way of looking at the capital absorption of it and david there's another thing that wasn't present in 2017 and that is this d5 d5 it was just a just a glimmer i mean like you saw a hint of it i i i always argue that the 2017 icos were a form of d5 right it was permissionless fundraising primitive and it was very primitive in that sense of the word to you because um like there there wasn't sufficient alignment between investors and uh stakeholders right um that was just the start of d5 now we have a robust d5 ecosystem so what will that do do you think as a headwind going to the bull market yeah and in stark contrast to the 2017 ico mania like i said the capital going into ethereum that was the thing that pumped ether to 1400 that capital was fleeting people didn't give a flying about what ethereum was or about bankless values or about self-sovereign money management they saw ico's number go up and they wanted to play the game and when it became obvious that the game was like wrapping up and coming to a close and that people were making less money than they were making more money than people left right it was there was nothing sticky about ethereum right there's no reason to hold your capital there again maker dow wasn't uh created until december of 2017 and even in december of 2017 it had like a couple million dollars worth of ether in it defy as a term wasn't even coined until the middle of 2018 and then we kind of retroactively said that like okay well d5 kind of started with maker dow which means it started in basically the last two weeks of 2017 so we can call it started in 2018. ethereum hasn't had a place to deposit capital and have it be sticky in any bull market ever right ever and so like the whole and like uniswap has never seen a bull market and uniswap has as an application on ethereum is one of the applications that locks up the most amount of value same thing with maker doubt like right now there is 2.75 billion in maker dell there's 1.7 billion in compound 1.5 billion of a 1.3 billion in unit swap half a billion in balance or half a billion in synthetics 0.8 billion in in iron nexus is up there as well we had none of these things in 2017. now in in 2020 we have so many places for capital to come to ethereum and then stay there and get sticky inside of an amm or inside of some sort of collateralized lending position that when i see a dollar coming into ethereum i see like oh maybe 20 cents leaving in four years rather in 2017 i see a dollar coming in i see a dollar going out people aren't going to exit once they enter they're gonna leave basically an ecosystem right i mean even if you obviously there's going to be um a speculative type bubble absolutely many d5 tokens that's totally obvious but even if you invest in those things and then exit because the market gets over exuberant out of control um are you gonna exit into fiat in your wells fargo account right or are you gonna exit to a stable coin on crypto rails now that you know how to use all of this stuff and deposit it into some defy protocol and get like a three to four percent return versus your wells fargo account that's giving you nothing zero percent like the people in this bull run who come to d5 what you're saying to come to ethereum are actually going to stay after the dust settles because there's a reason to stay right like you you cross the bridge and there's a whole carnival here now you can like set up shop you can hang out like it's this is the frontier make a tent right so water's fine totally different than than 2017 and i think that's bullish too you know one thing that else is not uh is here in 2020 that wasn't here in the 2017 bull run bankless david it was bankless that's exactly right that's not what you're gonna say no that's exactly 100 what i was going to say there are two people that that people love to watch that shill all of these hi guys and tell people about how to live a bankless life and so they're going to come in and be like i'm interested about ethereum what's this unit swap thing where do i go to learn about it they're going to find bank lists and they're going to learn about living a bankless life and they're going to be compelled by that argument and then they're going to keep their capital in ethereum to base on that narrative as a bankless community we are creating a narrative here and a shared experience here and david and i when you see us on these things or when we're talking just the tip of the iceberg of the bankless community we have um bankless members in russia converting bankless content into russian and distributing that on like telegram we have uh bankless members in france spreading the message that way and they've created a whole kind of like david and i are just doing we are just one small part of this movement in trying to like propagate it but this movement didn't even exist in 2017 because d5 didn't exist in 2017 it was just associated with like icos and scam projects right and so we are planting a flag in the ground if you're watching this i hope like you are too to say we're not just speculating in this asset class that's part of it of course there's going to be upside opportunities but we're setting up shop here like this is we're settling here this is our home like we are claiming this vast open white space and creating a new economy here um that's what i intend to do for the next decade man so absolutely i i actually think that's one of the the getting a narrative across during a bull market is really important like that's actually why we started promoting the whole moloch thing so like we had we had attention and we wanted to direct that attention towards the concept of like human coordination failure i love that quote that you say so much right which is basically uh don't let me butcher it but you said the most bullish thing for bitcoin and ether is to be understood that's exactly right right and like that's the same is true of d5 in this this bankless movement and the theses that we have put out on the bankless program the protocol sync thesis the ether the triple point asset thesis um like the the concepts and ideas that we put out so far have been proven right and so so long as they continue to be proven right like i think that the bankless narrative will continue to be proven out and more people will be more people are compelled by theses that are proven right oh my god dude thank god that contract made it and we made it so so we went wrong our 95 percent prediction game that would have destroyed our entire reputation around this we've gone down to zero we would have gone and ended bankless all right uh stable coins we already talked about that's uh you know if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first community self-building project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in defy and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a

ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn dot finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people do we already talked about that's uh you know it's interesting like nick carter wrote an article for bankless uh where he argued the case this is back in december of last year that stable coins might actually be parasitic to ether and now it seems like and he was laying out the case so he didn't to be fair to nick he didn't totally subscribe to it at that time but we just talked to him and he laid out the opposite case that stable coins are in fact bullish for ether which is super interesting now we have almost 20 billion 20 billion plus 20 billion worth of stable coins on ethereum one transaction away from purchasing ether all all stable coins on ethereum are one transaction away from purchasing ether 20 billion pretty crazy pretty that's none of that existed in 2017 yeah um and as the global demand for dollars increases which it definitely is it's going to that's that need is going to be serviced by ethereum and so it's just got growing the tentacles yeah absolutely all right so uh there's also some additional alpha to be found in ethereum this is one of the points he raised to me we were talking about this episode what do you mean by that david yeah so i had a friend text me a college friend non-crypto and so i'm starting to get texts right which is kind of how we know like retail starting to arrive and uh he he expressed that his uh being bummed about how he missed the boat on bitcoin right he missed the party uh and i told him like well no you shouldn't think that because you haven't because the party's ahead of us however it doesn't matter that uh regardless retail people and people coming into this space after about hearing bitcoin ever you know for 12 years now up to 12 years now like they heard bitcoin back in 2013 they heard about it in 2015 2017 and they still haven't bought it so that cognitive dissonance about buying bitcoin now even though they've already known about this asset for like seven eight nine years and bitcoin is at this crazy high price tag of almost twenty thousand dollars there's going to be some cognitive dissonance there and this is always true about bull markets it's like people try and it's like well damn it i missed the boat on bitcoin i'm gonna buy this illiquid token that's going to pump 100x so i can like get up to where i would have been if i had bought bitcoin back at a thousand dollars and those financial opportunities are defy tokens on ethereum yes i i totally agree that is bullish the asset class now but i do have a worry about that to you david which is xrp price has been pumping yeah and so your friend unless he takes time to understand why bitcoin and eth are as valuable as they are and understand a little bit about capital assets and the defy ecosystem the ways we sort of define like define things that education path then they could be like like oh xrp is less than a dollar it seems like the next bitcoin and by the way this crypto youtuber uh who has like 10 thousand you know 100 000 followers like like subscribers says that xrp is going to be the next big thing and then that's my worry for retail like guys if you're listening to this don't let your friends who text you fall down these paths because those roads lead to uh to a lot of pain and destruction yeah and and there's also you know i think ripple and other companies that benefit from these type of trades like are definitely culpable and like they're they're definitely leading they're definitely they're not doing it on purpose but like they could be doing a better educational effort in making sure that the people that are purchasing their token are doing a more informed decision-making process which there's oh i definitely think ripple's doing it on purpose oh yeah but totally however so ripple like we you expressed this concern that ripple just pumped and litecoin also just pumped i actually don't think that's retail i think that there are is traders positioning themselves because that's what they think retail will buy and i don't actually think we know what retail will buy this time around uh i think that's an unknown quantity rather than a known quantity i actually agree with you there i don't think we've seen retail enter i think most of this has been institutions and people that were already bullish uh crypto doubling down on it um sorry to interject the people that i have had come in that are new are people that were around in 2017 and then fully exited and then those are the low hanging fruit coming back so that's that's maybe the people that are coming back that's who i'm getting the text messages from yeah right so like you kind of worry when you start to i mean it used to be when you start to hear from a taxi driver about an asset right then like the bubbles here that's what they used to say well for crypto sometimes it's getting text from a friend so far i've only gotten texts from people who joined crypto in 2017 and then became like dormant right and we're sleepy and now they're waking up right i haven't gotten texts from which i received a lot of these in 2017. the guy that is friends with the guy i know who heard that i know something about crypto and has this question about buying yeah yeah buying tron right when i get those texts that's when i start to be like okay right uh again that's just a heuristic but you know another thing i i i hear sometimes um this is more from the more like the the bitcoin only crowd but it's this um i'm not interested in eth until it's a globally adopted reserve asset everything's solved about scalability and defy runs the financial infrastructure for the world this goes to your point about you know that the text you received about some people they just are in this crypto paralysis of oh my god should i buy or not it's like so volatile what if i like they try to time their buys rather than just taking action and jumping in right and like they'll hear something about some risk to eth2 for example maybe not being able to pull it off or maybe maybe there's there's lots of concerns about eth2 and they wait and they wait until all of not only the risk has been boiled out of the asset class but all of the upside has been boiled out of the asset class too it's like my retort to that is like if you're waiting for ether and d5 to become the financial system for the world right and for like central banks to buy into it and issue all of their like you're waiting you're essentially waiting until ethan's 50k in price right like all the opportunity has been boiled out of it so people also don't understand this kind of risk reward dynamic of you just got to take action sometimes if you believe in it i'm sure you have friends like that yeah yeah totally and i mean i was like this back in in 2017 where like uh i came in in the middle of middle to late 2017. so like late to the show right like i was the retail club being dumped on it was the right of passage and i'm past that point now um and so i would always i would see people that that i met who's like who bought omg which was like the 2017 token at like at 20 cents and then it pumped all the way to 20 and so what i would do is i would like backtrack and be like well if i had deployed my capital at these prices i would have gotten this rich right but you only ever get the full upside of the exposure if you purchase it immediately right you have to be owning it all the way through and that's why like i've i'm i was totally okay suffering through a goddamn three-year-long bear market where i saw my ether holdings fall down to 82. because i know that if i sell i'm gonna have to buy in later in order to access the upside so why would i even sell now you have to hold the asset for the entire lifespan of its cycle in order to access the full upside of its potential right like that's that's why you bag hold during bear markets because you don't know when it starts to go up but you do want the full exposure of when it goes up and so when it finally does go up you finally feel validated that's kind of what i feel a little bit like right now when i when i watch the price of ether like bust through 500 and scream to 600 i feel a little bit like that like imagine if i had tried to time that like no i'm just i'm just gonna make sure i gain all of the exposure to it by just being a bag holder yeah absolutely and it's still we think probably early in the cycle but i mean to be honest it would have been way better for you to buy eth when it dropped below 100 right right just like in in march right so it that conviction is super important and it sort of separates the the tourists from the from from the believers and i think there have been a lot of people during the crypto winter and this has been a particularly grueling winter for ether right a lot of people left but a strong community stuck around and you know it's just it's fun to celebrate that um i think that you know there's some rewards there uh on that side of things david maybe we should end this with kind of um like super bowl case for ether i've got a few ideas on that sure um but where do you think like where do you think the market is taking us next we said before that this is 2016 right so it's a setup for next year which is 2017. i i still think that's largely directionally correct um what's your take what what's the next step of this bull market here so if i if i want to put on my maximally bullish hat which i usually put on every single morning i i would i would claim that this cycle is going to be a longer cycle than last time the and that's what we've seen with bitcoin these cycles get longer and drawn out and so saying like oh we're in 2016 and next year's 2017 well we need to fit an extra year or maybe even two years in that time frame somewhere because these cycles are getting longer and there are just when you recapture the institutional side of the world institutions are by definitions bureaucracies which have our big ships which have lots of money that pivot that ship really slowly uh and so i could imagine a very long slow drawn out bull market where capital just constantly just trickles into the space over and over and over two years right and so like i maybe maybe even longer right and so that's that's why i'm particularly particularly bullish on the the concept of ethereum 2.0 being in development in parallel to the ethereum one d5 chain because like that sentiment is that that two year two to three year long phase of getting ethereum 2.0 out the door i think it's going to run in parallel with a two to three year long bull market so i think 2017 as a year could be two years long for us uh and it's just a two year long just and this is something that i put out on the market monday yesterday and it's something i've been chewing a lot a lot on my head in my head recently is like the bull markets of this industry and why we're able to just like put it clear like bookends as to when bull markets happen and when they stop happening at least in hindsight the bull markets happen when the world around crypto turns its attention back to crypto and reprices the whole entire industry all in one go right yeah and so like it's it's a huge lagging effect like the last three years of crypto the the attention of the world has not been on crypto and so that's when prices bleed out and decline now the world is turning the attention back to crypto saying oh there's a lot more here than the last time i was paying attention to crypto i'm going to price things accordingly and that's when ether price goes from 200 to 600 in like in like two and a half months right like it happens really fast and right now is when the purview the eyes of the world are turning towards crypto and repricing this entire industry and i think it's going to to be a two year long like repricing event i actually agree with you on that i i do think we've used the uh the analogy of 2017 but it's probably the case that that 2017 is sort of an analogy that stretches maybe multiple years right um i guess i'll i'll i'll leave um with uh with these thoughts this was kind of my take on what what things could look like in that two-year time horizon and looking at it from uh how much eath supply is actually locked right so we've been talking a lot about kind of the demand side and these things are certainly triggers um but i also think what's coming in the next two years again not right away this is the first milestone of eth2 is a big change in the supply economics of ether as an asset so let's say you get 25 eth locked up by true believers who are in this for decades and they're here to stack way stack eth right and then you've got 20 locked in d5 well is that crazy at uh right now it's about six to seven percent ethel eat supply uh locked in d5 right and at the beginning of 2017 it was zero so could that double that's not crazy um as the uh institutions uh sort of come and as d5 projects um do well they might consider locking a portion of their capital into balance sheets these dowels are essentially a new type of um crypto capital formation tool they're like a a corporation so that could take up say 15 percent grayscale is already at two to three percent of all eth that's locked could that rise to five percent if you get three percent in staking and we're already at half a percent right now at the very start well all of that you add that up and you've got already 70 of each supply pretty much locked and then what's going to happen david is in 2020 when the proof of work chain merges with the proof of stake chain which is about to be launched you get annual eth issuance take going from 4.5 to something near zero right this will be less than one percent possibly it could even graduate to the negative territory where we're actually burning more eath than we are issuing and minting so what happens when you get demand but no supply that's a supply-side crisis and for a scarce asset like eath the only direction when that happens is up that i think is like a a two-year bull case or a three-year bull case for what could happen to eat the asset and if that's the case we're not going to be staying at 600 for very long it's uptake yeah this is the absolutely the right formula uh i would tweak these numbers a little bit i don't think it's actually i don't think you actually get to uh claim that there's never such thing as never sellers because there's literally a price for everything right and so like yeah i'm a never seller because i could never really reasonably see ether at like one million dollars per token but it's like well if you offer them one million dollars per ether they're probably gonna let me ask you this though david so um what happens though if your eth is going up in value right but also your ability to generate wealth on top of that eath goes up in value too right so the ability to rather than sell your eat why don't you just take like a very small portion of your supply and take out a loan right on it a collateralized loan on it or why don't you just put some of that eve david into defy or into staking and then instead of selling you can earn a nice five to ten percent return off that eath and you don't have to sell this is kind of back to the like the neo taking the pill right like when when this is all fully matured you won't have to sell your ether you know because it becomes part of the fabric of the uh the economy and of the financial system so i agree with you there's a price for everything of course but there might be there might be some number sellers out there at least a portion of your proceeds you might never sell because of this yeah i haven't considered defy has infrastructure to help support you not to have to sell your ether and be able to access liquidity from that in different mechanisms that that's that's an interesting take that's an interesting take that's pretty cool yeah okay so maybe we can generate like a cohort of like never sellers who like they still get the value out of their ether but they do it from like loans rather than rather than selling um yeah one thing that you did not and uh you i think you really priced down the supply of ether in staking i think you you said like three to five percent i think that's going to be something like 10 to 15 percent um i think that's going to be a lot higher than that yeah so uh these numbers play with these numbers as as you will these are all supply sinks i think for and then burn a  ton with eip1559 which is knit is going to be native right to you uh and we will see all right david i've gotten all the like my bullish feelings out on this podcast so i'm feeling like it's pretty complete anything else you want to say nope i think we should wrap this up this is uh as bullish episodes as they come all right guys uh risks and disclaimers of course we are bullish on these assets but this is not financial advice not at all ethan's risky so is crypto so is defy you could lose what you're putting in we're headed west though this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on episode 24 of state of the nation we are triumphant this week
