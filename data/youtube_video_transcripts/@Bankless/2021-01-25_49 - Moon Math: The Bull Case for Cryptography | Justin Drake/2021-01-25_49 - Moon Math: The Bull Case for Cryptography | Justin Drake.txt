[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is the type of episode we've not done on bankless before what makes this one so special you know i don't think anyone has done an episode like this uh justin drake who is a cryptographic researcher at the ef he loves cryptography and that is one of the harder subjects to do a podcast about especially when you know you're not you're generally non-technical and justin is extremely technical yet he did a fantastic job breaking down cryptography so we could help understand how it's going to fill some of the chinks in the armor that we have in this cryptocurrency industry right so the we use uniswap as like the the premier example of the the application that everyone knows and has probably engaged with yet there are a few trust bottlenecks for engaging with uniswap metamask is a truss bottleneck the front end of the website is a trust bottleneck and there's a number of other things that you are implicitly trusting when you use an application like uniswap that aren't anything to do with the uniswap the protocol itself but are still holes in the armor when it comes to trust and so what this episode was about was how we are just at the beginning of the crypto economic revolution we start off this episode defining crypto economics and justin says uh talks about how you know originally the cypherpunk vision was all about a cryptography enabled world yet that was super ambitious and perhaps never going to happen and therefore the integration of economic assurances or assumptions with cryptographic assurances or shromson's assumptions is really powerful and basically what this industry stands on and we have so much left untapped potential in the realm of cryptoeconomics that we have not yet applied to our daily interactions with the ethereum blockchain with the bitcoin blockchain so this is all about moon math what we can do with all of these crypto economic tools that we've developed yet we have not yet applied justin is really bullish on the future of cryptographic cryptoeconomic tools for helping improve the trustlessness of these systems that we use on a day-to-day basis really a fantastic episode i think one of my favorites yeah and you know part of the reason this is important guys is because bankless is all about um giving you mental models for how to think about crypto and ultimately how to guide what you do in crypto how you use it your investments how what you do in your kind of daily life using uh defy systems and i think there are kind of two schools of thought about crypto that guide investing paradigms one is sort of crypto is an economic movement uh an emphasis on the money bitcoiners tend to be more that side uh and the other is crypto is a a software uh it could evolve and change over time our episode recently david with chris dixon uh more expressed that mentality and you know what the truth is is it's both of those things it's not just a money and it's not just software it's software money you have to understand both sides of that coin in order to guide your investment decisions and have the correct mental models for this industry and this was a beautiful blend of i think those two things it really showed the the softwareness and the upgradability and the enhancement potential of the software compute layer of crypto without sacrificing the economics piece of it which is so important crypto economics it's both of these things together in this episode we talked about uh justin's heuristics his his rules of thumb for engaging with crypto economics he says that if cryptography doesn't do it doesn't solve the problem you can therefore rely on crypto economics or add in crypt crypt add in economic assurances on top of your cryptography but then he also says if you can do it with just cryptography you should do it with just cryptography and that resonates with the protocol sync thesis if we can relegate things to math we totally should that was one of my big takeaways we end the conversation this this marathon of a conversation over two hours long our longest episode yet we end this conversation with a thought experiment about how cryptography is changing and things in this industry need to change with it and justin believes in and apparently crypto the industry or the academic study of cryptography points in this direction that quantum computing will come to eventually break bitcoin the blockchain and ethereum the blockchain unless we can pivot and put in new uh new tools new security mechanisms that prevent quantum from computing from breaking these systems we talked about bitcoin's calcification and how it might not be able to pivot to a post-quantum world and in that world we could actually create a scenario where btc the asset separates from bitcoin the blockchain and uploads itself to the blockchain that does have these new uh new uh holes these security holes as a result of quantum computing patched which we think of course is going to be ethereum 2.0 that is a fascinating conversation imagine a decoupling of btc the asset from bitcoin to blockchain and then it exists entirely on a new blockchain that was a fancy fan as an absolutely fascinating part of the conversation as usual guys we have a full debrief where david and i go over our thoughts

recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com bankless nation we are super excited to have on justin drake who is a cryptographer he's a researcher at the ethereum foundation and to say he played a key role in the development of eth2 is probably an understatement he's been a key force behind us he's here to tell us all about how early we are in this crypto revolution the advances that are coming in cryptography that are about to change everything we think we know about cryptography crypto and this entire industry justin how are you doing today sir i am doing great guys thank you so much for having me you know what i've got to ask this before we get into the the moon math and the really fun stuff eth launched in 2020 wow how does that feel eth2 launch amazing um i mean i've spent three years of my life dedicated to this um and it was a great reward and seeing that we have you know three billion dollars um you know staking and that we basically haven't had uh issues so far is is pretty astounding so justin this is actually kind of a unique episode i think that's about to come out of the bankless podcast because this is the first episode where uh you actually pitched the episode to us and this is something that i would not have thought about to be able to or or the skills or the knowledge to produce this sort of conversation so i mean and i know that you are absolutely fired up to talk about what we are going to talk about maybe you could kind of give us the the to the tl dr the elevator pitch for what we are about to talk about and why you are so stoked about this conversation yeah for sure um i mean i was inspired by you because you had this this bullish ethereum um you know series and i'm just so bullish ethereum i don't want to you know reflect on why am i so bullish and you know one of the big reasons is that the fundamentals are so strong right the whole space is built on crypto economics which is you know part cryptography and part and game theory and incentives and you know the the crypto the cryptography part in particular we're at the very beginning there's so much room to grow and it's a story that i think will unfold over many years possibly even decades um and there's just so many reasons to believe that the the reality we live in today is very very primitive um and you know it might sound like um you know we're moving to to to to worlds you know when they describe trying to describe the future it might sound like sci-fi but i really do believe that we're moving towards that end goal so where does this conversation start uh one of the the lines that you put into the agenda was that uh you know with regards to cryptography and crypto economics we are just in the most primitive age the stone age where we have like you know the fire and the wheel but so much of the world's inventions are ahead of us where does this conversation start yeah um so i think um you know one interesting you know starting point i think is the the cyberpunk uh movement right so they had this amazing dream in the 80s which is can we try and rebuild all of society on really strong foundations and specifically cryptographic foundations and people back then were really fired up you know for ideological reasons in a similar way that some people today in the crypto space are really fired up um but to to a large extent um i think that dream kind of didn't pan out the way that people hoped and you know we had a few decades of of of silence there um and then you know we had we had a few clues you know things like like bittorrent um which uh basically allowed us to to um have really strong foundations in the sense that bittorrent to a large extent is just cryptography plus you know peer-to-peer networking and plus even a little bit of incentivization in the early days um and then we had uh you know satoshi's big breakthrough uh bitcoin which to me is kind of the the birth of crypto economics in in a really uh big way um and now we're um i guess we're we're reaching a point where um kind of this you know this this um point in the in the exponential curve where is the inflection point everything happened quite slowly but now we're going to see this explosion uh you know largely driven uh with ethereum where does that inflection point come from like what about the what's different about bitcoin and cryptoeconomics that we didn't have before why is why is there this cambrian explosion going on now yeah um [Music] i mean one of the the the big things i guess and it was the key innovation of the theorem is is programmability um so now we're in a position where ethereum can absorb all the innovation that we we need to absorb to solve all these these problems that we have so in the crypto space where you know we're starting from the foundation so we have to reinvent the whole stack uh we're reinventing the wheel to a large extent and so even though we have lots of superpowers such as you know decentralization and trustlessness and things like that like that we also have a lot of trade-offs um and you know this the superpowers are so awesome that we're happy to live with the trade-offs but oftentimes um in fact you know almost all the time i believe that these trade-offs that we have relative for example to to existing services like centralized exchanges in the context of decentralized trading i think we can basically fill in all the gaps um that we have today and be at least as good as centralized services in every single respect and in some so in some key respects this totally outshine them uh you know by by a fact of 10 or 100 x can we can we talk about this idea of crypto economics for a second in the context of of bitcoin because i just want to make sure that that's clear to all of our listeners right so um the the the cypherpunks were very much into cryptography and the revolution that it could bring self-sovereign money privacy all of these things but they were missing something they were missing the economics part that made bitcoin so special and that made satoshi's white paper so special i'm not necessarily sure that that's completely intuitive to people the sorts of things you can do when you blend not just cryptography but it's cryptography plus economics it's both of those two things together that was the major innovation and discovery of bitcoin can you talk about that for a minute yeah so um you know one metaphor that i have is that cryptography is this very powerful tool it's a very powerful building block like like the brick right you want to build a wall and you have you have the bricks but if you have bricks alone that's not going to work you need something to glue the bricks together you need the mortar and the the economic part kind of fills in the gap and glues everything together so that you have a coherent system that breathes life if you take cryptography alone it's kind of somewhat dry and somewhat abstract and once you bring in the economic part which could be a relatively thin layer but you know a critical layer then then suddenly you have uh pieces of the puzzle that stick together to form a coherent um system so before bitcoin the cypherpunks were really trying to solve this problem for almost decades right and they they innovated in many different ways one of them was eagled um there was there's a number of different like bitcoin precursors that i think all relied on pure cryptography right and it was that integration of economics that really was what allowed bitcoin and therefore this whole entire industry to flourish maybe you could talk about just the relationship between cryptography and economics and maybe um tell our listeners like maybe when it when is it the better time to use cryptography and when is it the better time to use economics and how you think about balancing these two forces right um so i think a lot of the the previous solutions can kind of had um partial decentralization they they used um cryptography to them to the maximum extent possible but they still had this somewhere in the system some sort of of central party and that led to attacks for example by um by government um like one of the i guess one of the big realizations is that cryptography alone so let's look at the goals of cryptography what is the goal of cryptography it's basically to take a trusted third party that does some sort of functionality and replace it by pure code or pure pure mathematics and it turns out that there's some impossibility results there's some things that you just fundamentally cannot do and so what you want to do is you want to relax the constraints a little bit so you have this this spectrum of trust right so on the one hand you have very low trust technology like mathematics and then you can walk your way up you have cryptography physics and then maybe economics and then you know you have things that are very you know human um rooted in in human culture things like the legal system or the monetary system or even religious systems um that are deep in in the narrative and you know you want to go as far as possible into the spectrum but you want to be realistic right there's some things you just can't do with cryptography okay so if we kind of turn it down a notch and include economics um then suddenly this is the inflection point where um you can breathe life into into the cryptography and to be very specific one one problem that cryptography alone cannot solve is the double spend problem so it's this idea that you need to have some sort of entity that can remember that you've spent something so that it can prevent you from spending it again and that's this notion of of state uh and consensus so cryptography the way i think of it it it um kind of solves stateless problems um so we can it can you can start with a state and then and then it will give you a valid state transition it can prove to you that something's happened according to the rules or with possibly you know certain security guarantees like privacy or whatever um but one thing that it cannot do is take this graph of all the possible states and state transitions and collapse it down to one canonical one which we call the truth so basically what consensus does is that it it anchors um kind of it's a little bit like a quantum analogy right so you have in the world in the quantum world you have many different states that live in a superposition and you know you kind of want to choose one you want to collapse it to just one and this is what consensus does and in order to solve consensus you need to move a little bit out of cryptography and and dip your toe into um you know us things that are very economic and more specifically you know we have assumptions like the 51 assumption in bitcoin or you know in the theorem we could have the the two-thirds um assumption and you know we can talk about this assumption in many different flavors you know we have um things like honesty assumptions where we just model the actors as always behaving according to the rules but we could also have you know maybe um uh rationality assumptions we can assume and this is closer to the the reality of things where um we can assume that for example two-thirds of the of the players are are rational you know they're they're motivated by by money monique is kind of interesting it's like this this one of the things that really transcends cultures and and and and and boundaries um and you can use money kind of as one of the really strong layers to as the basis as a foundation for for building society so bitcoin is famously known as a string of signatures like in the white paper like satoshi called bitcoins as like a very long string of signatures and that's all cryptography but what you're saying is that bitcoin as a system is a and determining what the correct string of signatures is is determined by social consensus and that that's and bitcoiners are famously saying like no there is no social consensus to bitcoin there's only math but a lot of coming things coming out of the ethereum camp is like well at the end of the day crypto economics is always one part secured by the social layer so what you what you're saying is that the reason why everyone can come to consensus about what the correct string of blocks is is incentivized by economics particularly by the bitcoin hard cap the btc hard cap provides the economic incentive to and enables economic assurances but in in your description uh justin you were saying that you know originally the cypherpunks wanted everything to be run by cryptography that was really hard that was really ambitious perhaps even impossible and so therefore we can compromise and instead of just relying on only cryptographic assurances we also integrate economic assurances or or assumptions as well but to me in my mind that indicates a priority or a tier right where you know if we can do something with cryptography and without economic without economics we should perhaps do it with cryptography if we don't have to make that compromise is that a fair assumption yeah exactly um so we do have this this spectrum of trust that i call it but you know i think you call it the the protocol sync thesis right like the heavy dense stuff um it wants to go at the at the bottom it sinks to the bottom and that's the foundation um for for for your stack um yeah so that's exactly right when you relax things suddenly a whole world of opportunities appears and they have this kind of heuristic which is that if cryptography doesn't work try crypto economics and usually it will work um and this is actually in the you know in in in research for fm 2.0 this is kind of what helps us push forward like usually like the very first solution that we come up with is crypto economic and we know yeah you know it's possible to solve this and you know at least we have one solution um and then kind of the next step is okay can we improve upon this and then that brings me to my second heuristic which is that if you can do without crypto economics if you can do it purely with cryptography then that is going to be at least in the long run a superior solution um and so that's what you want to be aiming for long term that is one of the best mental models for understanding the protocol sync thesis that i've ever heard and so that i think this is already a super valuable conversation ryan and i have described you know the protocol scene thesis as like you know trust minimized decentralized uh you know credibly neutral but at the end of the day what's going on is we're just boiling back down to that's what cryptography is and so the protocol synthesis i think could be restated in systems that use cryptography more than they use economic or trust-based assumptions right and actually you can you can look at at this heuristic kind of in the in the fullest spectrum of things so if you look at uniswap for example um you know just to to get started just to get to the real world it's made some compromises you know it relies on infuria it relies on the graph it relies on all sorts of centralized providers but um you know over time you can kind of peel off these um these layers that are higher trust and kind of shift everything to to to the high trust uh realm and you know with lots of engineering lots of creativity and research we will get there um and you know there's some good reasons to believe um that you know the the end goal is the moon right we will solve all our problems uh we have extremely powerful um arsenal of tools um that have been developed in uh theoretical cryptography and those will make their way progressively through applied cryptography and then you know the final the final boss which is real world cryptography so i don't think we want to dive into this justin because i don't think people fully understand um the the field of of cryptography and so what what we've basically done in kind of the the past couple of decades is we we discovered this amazing thing called cryptography as as humanity and then uh with bitcoin we blended cryptography with economics and that gave us the ability to get a digital consensus on things it was a huge unlock for humanity in that it helped us solve the double spend problem so we can have this marvelous thing we call digital scarcity which was not previously a layer on the internet so that's cryptography plus economics digital scarcity right and that is bitcoin and ethereum of course made that sort of a general digital scarcity compute engine but here's the thing cryptography is a changing field and an advancing field right so the cryptography that bitcoin is based on was that built out in the like 1960s 1970s that sort of era of cryptography maybe you could tell us on that but the exciting thing about this that i want our listeners to know is that um cryptography is advancing too in kind of a similar way where we had the compute revolution with moore's law we had the ability to put more transistors on a chip right with these cryptography advances we can almost put like more trust on a chain more consensus more it's it helps us these cryptography advances help us scale consensus to all new levels and it's a it's a changing field can you talk about how crypto economics is just getting started because of these new cryptography functions right um so one of the things that i'll say is that as i mentioned there's these different flavors of cryptography right there's the theoretical cryptography which basically asks can you do something yes or no um and you know usually the way you answer it is if the answer is yes then they'll try and give you a specific construction if the answer is no they'll give you an impossibility result telling you it's impossible to do um but oftentimes if the answer is yes the construction that they'll give you as cryptographers is like uh you know pie in the sky it's it feels very distant from the real world um and for for decades you know we've had theoretical cryptographers who are you know passionately in love with what they do you know it's very intellectually stimulating but they're disconnected from reality and it turns out that in theoretical compu cryptography we've made huge leaps and bounds um and actually this um kind of in a way culminated this year 2020 with the discovery of what's called code obfuscation um so it's a very powerful cryptographic tool um and now we know how to do it on very standard cryptographic assumptions and sorry is this anything to do with the cryptocurrency industry or is code obfuscation something that is purely out of the cryptographic domain so um code obfuscation is kind of this beacon of hope for um and it's kind of uh giving us a road map for the next few um you know years and decades and in short what it what it tells us is that everything that we could wish to do in cryptography we can do it um and so it's basically the zero to one moment where whatever you want to do you can do it unless um you know unless there's some sort of impossibility result but if you can do it you can do it with code obfuscation um so at the very least because we know how to do code obfuscation we know how to do kind of the rest of cryptography the the the term that we we have is that we say that obfuscation is crypto complete this one building block gives us all the other building blocks which is a really amazing thing that my mind goes to touring completeness is that an okay like metaphor yeah so it's the same word complete um turing completeness is basically once you have a few basic instructions you can run any program um you know that could be run on a computer and it's the same thing here where uh with code obfuscation you actually need two primitives you need once you have hash functions and an obfuscation these two building blocks alone give you the rest of cryptography um and so this is fulfilling or if so what this answers is perhaps maybe the original cypherpunk vision of can the world be completely run on cryptography and so if if you're telling me that three theoretical cryptography is quote unquote solved by code of eusation does that mean that the original cypherpunk dream of a cryptography run universe is still in the cards no i don't think it's in the cards and you know that you kind of have these these things that you just can't do with cryptography and and like um for me the the the the separating line is stateless versus stateful so um cryptography can do all the stateless stuff um and then once you combine it with one further ingredient which is you know blockchain or consensus which will give you this state then you can do everything and by everything i mean that you can basically simulate any trusted third party with just blockchains and and and math um i mean when you when you just to give you a little bit of insight as to what code obfuscation is so code obfuscation the idea is that you can have programs um which hold secrets and these programs are public so it's kind of this paradox where you have a an open source program but it holds the secrets in the program so the secret is kind of garbled and obfuscated um and when you think of a trusted third party what is a trusted third party well if you think of it as a human for example that's just like a brain with neurons and you can model that as a computer running some sort of os you know taking it as inputs you know these digital signals um you know for you for your eyes and whatnot um and then you can basically encode um any any rules that you'd want from this trusted third party into your program and instead of running it in kind of um in on a brain you're going to run it in in pure in pure math and you know you can kind of another kind of analogy is is trusted hardware right so you have these distrusted kind of secure enclaves that are meant to uh run programs but at the same time hold these secrets it's like a hardware wallet right so you have this the secret embedded in the hardware and the idea is that you're not meant to be able to extract um the the secret um and yeah you can encode um whatever rules you you want this trusted party to do or this trusted hardware to do in code and then you can compile it to just pure math with this code obfuscation technique in theory so this is all theoretically possible justin so what does it take for the theory to start to catch up to to the practical like what is the cryptography that lives today in in bitcoin right and how is that caught up to the practical implementation of of of bitcoin like i guess i'm i'm wondering why we haven't seen the theoretical possibilities in practice yet right um so the way i think of crypt you know progress of cryptography is like there's three big quantum leaps that need to happen for so basically you need to go from zero to one just say yes in theory this is possible to build and that's the realm of theoretical cryptography then the next big step is basically what's called applied cryptography and the idea here is that basically you want to look at the whole design space and and look at all the different trade-offs and try and find constructions with you know all sorts of different properties that may potentially be applicable at some point into the future um and then you have this final quantum step which is real world cryptography and the idea here is that you have someone with a very specific use case and they're going to pick one single design in this in this design space and they want to make sure that it's good enough in every single property and so often times there's there's a lot of leg work to do to basically um [Music] you know just make sure that it it's good enough across the board um for for use in in in the real world and what ethereum is basically it's a machine for turning applied cryptography into real-world cryptography um and for for a very long time we have we haven't really had this massive um you know force pulling cryptography out of the abstract and into the real world um and this is this is why like cryptographers absolutely love blockchains and kind of blockchains is is is eating cryptography you know you go to a blockchain conference and it's like so you go to a cryptographic conference and it's blockchain blockchain everywhere um and you know every time i i email a cryptographer saying hey i read your i read your paper here's a few questions and hey maybe we'll uh we're considering integrating this into ethereum you know they come back super enthusiastic you know they they love it because you know we're giving meaning to to to their work and we're kind of basically giving them um this this possibility of of of taking it from the applied cryptography into into the the real world cryptography and i guess you know um going back to one of your your your recent podcasts with with chris dixon right he was talking about how there's this um this virtuous cycle between the technology and the use case right as the use case grows there's more demand for technology there's more money more attention and that feeds back in to you know building more powerful technology which then unlocks more and more use cases and you know we've we've seen this for example with with computing as you said you know we've seen moore's law you know 20 years ago you know you didn't have you know gps in your pocket or you didn't have a camera and you know all these little gadgets um led to to all sorts of of new applications that we couldn't predict like things like like uber and over time we're gonna grow our tool set of cryptographic gadgets and we're gonna get um not only are we gonna solve all the known problems that we have with decentralized applications where we had to make a trade-off for example we had to trade off privacy or we had to trade off scalability or we had to trade off front-running or things like that but my guess is that we're going to see totally new applications which were you know basically impossible to predict that's the thing i feel like chris was saying in the podcast and that you're also echoing now is that of course these systems are digital scarcity engines and they they produce monies but they are also computers right that can be fundamentally improved from one generation to the next they can be upgraded they can be enhanced you can go from a pentium processor to something much more powerful and these enhancements can bring about massive new eras of possibilities that weren't previously possible in the last generation of compute i think what you're saying justin is like bitcoin as it stands right now and ethereum v2 this era of compute is just scratching the surface on what these computers and this new era is capable of that is exactly right and we're actually seeing um it's actually the beginning in three different places so when you think of the blockchain space we uh we basically have layer one um where you know we're cramming a lot of innovation into ef2 and we have a whole roadmap for for deploying this and i'm more than happy to talk about it and then we have innovations at layer 2 and like the genius of layer 2 is that um once you have you know this so-called turing completeness once you have the virtual if you're in virtual machine and that's enough to do everything you reach escape velocity and so um you know you you're able to capture whatever comes to you like the the evm is a sponge for for innovation and then you have um you know something where is extremely early days today is all the auxiliary infrastructure which i guess you could call layer three um you know things like um block explorers or um you know search or you know basic things like syncing like like infura and metamask like all of this is just so so primitive we we're kind of still doing it the traditional web two way um like that if you want to to you know if you want to build on ethereum you kind of as in on the layer one a decentralized application you have this forcing function to make your decentralized name the core the smart contract you know decentralized um but then what often happens is that you you today you you you won't make the investment and all the extra layer 3 stuff because there's just there's too many auxiliary services um and it's not your your your core focus but over time um these technologies will get commoditized um and will will reach a point where the the whole ecosystem will be able to reap the benefits um that they bring you know i've frequently spoken of this industry as one of the few bright shining spots that i can find in the world right now there's not there's pretty it's pretty easy to find reasons to be pessimistic about the state of the world yet with ethereum and bitcoin and this whole entire revolution it really is a shining spot on the hill to be really optimistic about the future and for some reason i've always said that i think the future will be better because of things like ethereum and when when we people use the metaphor behind like ready player one where like there's infinite possibilities and in such a rich futuristic environment that seems where we're going but i've never actually been able to articulate how we get there and i think that's what we're doing here in this conversation the the bridge between some crazy awesome ready player one universe and the what we have today with ethereum 1.0 and then also ethereum 2.0 the beacon chain that gap seems to be able to be filled by some of what we are talking about here and before we before we get into that we were talking about uh the cryptography as an academic study was kind of like locked in the classroom up until blockchain right up until we had crypto economics and now it seems to be that with the advent of you know crypto and blockchain and ethereum we've actually been able to actually have a real world place for that academic study to manifest itself in the real world would you say that that manifestation is inside the evm and how does ethereum just relate to the study of cryptography and or cryptographers in general can you just expand on that relationship yeah so i think we're going to see crypto crypto everywhere not just in the evm we're going to see it you know deep in the guts of the you know the consensus engine so for example in ef2 we have five pieces of cryptography right we have bls signatures which basically allows you to have so-called aggregateable signatures the idea of aggregateable signatures is you have a thousand people signing a message the the naive way of verifying these messages is you you verify them one by one like a thousand times and so if if each message let's take say takes one millisecond to verify verifying a thousand messages is going to cost you a whole second and that's you know very expensive the idea of aggregatable signatures is you can combine these 1 000 signatures into a single one and just verify this one and that's the the same as if you had verified all 1000 individually um and just to give you like a scale of the power of cryptography with just this one primitive so um if you look at all the other proof of stake systems you know they have a 1 000 validators or less we you know on f2 we have right now 60 000 validators and we could even we could support hundreds of thousands potentially even millions of validators um and this has a real practical consequences like right now um you know in order to stake you need 32 ether and you know we we tried really hard to bring this number down 32 ether but it's still you know today an insane amount of money is like for you know 40 000 or whatever um but before we had you know this um this roadmap to use bls signatures we were gonna go with 1 500 if to stake which is like 2 million or whatever um and that would be like a huge barrier to entry for decentralization so yeah that's one of the primitives very powerful primitive aggregatable signatures so that's that that's a small example of of how cryptography can scale basically you just scale decentralization with aggregated signatures just like that went from a 2 million dollar stake which would have been probably hundreds maybe thousands if we're lucky validators to now tens of thousands of validators just with that simple cryptographic primitive i want to get back to something you were saying because this all relates justin is that um you're saying ethereum is is poised to capture this exponential of all of this cryptography progress this new era of compute and you're talking about like the three layers like there's a layer one there's a layer two layer three all of those areas can kind of capture some of this innovation but you know what i think is interesting is the question of why is ethereum poised to capture this versus another crypto network say a bitcoin is because of the layer zero the layer zero is almost the the social layer it's kind of a layer that david and i operate on on bank list but you operate on in a sense too just in that the ethereum social contract is very much open it's very pragmatic so it it is very much open to these types of innovation uh some will criticize ethereum for that it's like we just had lynn alden on the podcast and she was talking about like i like bitcoin because it's a fully matured 100 it's done the project is done right it's solidified um whereas ethereum it's it's completely changing but if this this theory of compute cryptography compute is right you actually want some change because you want to incorporate these 10x 100x games and it seems like ethereum has that on the social layer is that part of the reason you say ethereum is perfectly poised to capture some of this cryptography uh advancement absolutely and i think you've said it extremely well like this layer zero is absolutely critical um and you're right like if if we are if we are living in an exponential world and you know we are there you know it's really obvious when you zoom out a little bit um then you know you need to have some some way of it adapting to this world um and you know you can have like really clever tricks you know like the like the um the ethereum virtual machine where you know you you just have this as soon as you reach the turing completeness then then you're done and you know you can get the best of both worlds you can get both the kind of the solid layer one which doesn't change very often and and kind of all the innovation that can be captured with programmability um but you know going back to this layer zero which is kind of the cultural thing absolutely it resonates very strongly with me um you know we in ethereum culture we have a culture of of of building a culture of innovation a culture of being at the bleeding edge and not only kind of passively observing the bleeding edge but actively pushing it forward um and you know we have a culture of being you know i guess trying to predict the future like trying to be you know placing ourselves 10 20 years into the future um and and and thinking about you know long-term fundamentals not just you know the the the present day um and and for me you know being um you know in this space uh for for several years you know when when i think back to the the fundamentals of human motivation what what motivates humans well i think ethereum has everything so it has um kind of the intellectual curiosity aspect it has the ideological aspect where you want you know maybe to drive some some change in society um it has the the financial aspects it has the um explorer aspect where you know you're discovering uncharted territory it has the entrepreneurial aspect um and you know it's just a huge amount of dopamine going on just being in the space because i feel it i feel it in this episode i feel the dopamine rush as you're talking justin exactly yeah um i think and i'm i'm not seeing you know i am seeing so much uh you know dopamine in the in in the in the whole space and yeah the bright red spot for me is is ethereum so justin we're going to get into the topic of of unit swap and how more cryptographic tools can help you know kind of smooth out the rough edges around an application like unit swap and all other applications on ethereum that have chinks in the armor because while everyone loves unisy because it's trustless and on chain there's plenty of supporting infrastructure that needs to go in in order to use use unit swap like inferior and metamask these are all central points that needs to be tackled by cryptography before we get to that conversation however i want to back up and talk about some of these extra new tools in the tool belt these new cryptographic mechanisms that uh previously weren't incorporated with you know just bitcoin or ethereum 1.0 uh you've stated that you know bitcoin and ethereum 1.0 and then also bittorrent are just cryptographic hashes and signatures and those are two tools you know the fire and the wheel as you said but there are many many more tools in the tool belts what what new tools do we have that we didn't have when we first first uh got bitcoin or ethereum 1.0 off the ground right um i mean one tool that you guys might be familiar with which is you know absolutely mind-blowing um and it's it's actually one of the reasons why i'm in ethereum like i i i was very attracted to these these so-called snarks um and you know today it's it's almost as if snarks are commoditized you know they've become boring which is amazing right we've gone from mind-blowing technology you know five years ago to something which is you know boring and deployed in the real world so snarks as you probably know is basically allows you to take arbitrary computation and squeeze it down the squeeze down the the validity of this computation down to tiny proof which is constant size so you know you can have um you know a program and you can have some input you and then you know the program could take many many you know minutes or seconds or whatever days and years uh to run and then it finally will produce an output and basically you can prove that the output is valid so it corresponds to the input and the program um and you can verify that in in constant time so at that scale right so if it takes you know years to compute something we could put it at the base layer of ethereum but that would be a terrible idea because then ethereum would take years to compute that especially on a distributed network and so if we can uh compress down what is needed to put into the base layer that scales things right and is that is that basically the underlying pattern for all of these new tools um no so there's like um there's very different vectors like different tools do totally different things and you're right on the topic of scalability basically you should think of the blockchain as being this very weak verifier so it can verify cryptographic tools but it has very limited computational resources on the other hand the real world kind of the external world outside of blockchain is a very very powerful prover we have huge and huge amounts of of computational power and and basically we can leverage this um extra computational power to to squeeze things down to compress it a little bit like um you know compressing a file i guess um uh to its minimal form and it turns out that for computation the minimal form is basically zero or very close to zero and then you feed that small amount um of of of information on on on the blockchain and that's yeah that's how you get scalability um in terms of other directions just to give you a little bit of of a flavor so one that i'm that i'm quite excited and it it it's it's actually um very reminiscent of of proof of work um is is um cryptography which is related to time so and i i call it um cryptophysics so it's kind of um cryptography meets physics so in the in the in the world of of bitcoin we have a proof of work and what is proof of work is basically a proof of energy expenditure so it's like this you know really cool thing where cryptography which is like you know very abstract mathematics suddenly meets reality through energy consumption and it turns out that we can do a similar thing with time so we can have um cryptography me time and the way that it works is through computation so if you think of proof of work as being massively parallel computation to to connect with energy it turns out that it's the the dual for time so by dual i mean inherently sequential so if you have a comp a piece of computation that needs to operate one step at a time and you can't jump ahead some steps kind of you need the result from the previous step in order to move to the next step well if every step is going to take some amount of time you know a few nanoseconds or whatever it is then you can string these these steps and you can use an inherently sequential computation to mimic time and that will give you some really cool you know cryptographic primitives like for example one is what's called um time lock encryption so you can have a message and you can encrypt it for some amount of time let's say one minute and after one minute kind of auto magically it decrypts itself so that's kind of a really mind-blowing cryptographic primitive and it turns out that you know it could be used for example in the context of uniswap to remove front running right so uni swap we have this this this problem right now which is that if you because you're trading in in you know in in public daylight and everyone can see your trades and anyone can place trades ahead of you and behind you just by playing with with the the gas price you can get front run um and so one way to solve front running which is uh really cool is you when you make a trade you got you will encrypt it for a very small amount of time you broadcast it it gets included on chain and then once it's on chain it kind of automatically gets decrypted and that makes it impossible to front run because the front runners don't know what they're front running that's insanely cool i want to get into the details about the time element because to my understanding if if you are doing a computation that takes time can you throw more computation at it and speed up the time that it takes or is it actually locked into some sort of time unit that we're familiar with like this will take you know five seconds and it will always take five seconds or five minutes and it will always take you know five minutes how does that time element work yeah um so um basically you wanna you want your your time lock encryption where where the delay is based on inherently sequential and what does in a healthy sequential mean it means that even if you own like all the computing power in the universe that's not gonna help you like you're gonna need to do step by step and it's gonna take time to to do the whole computation and one way to to think of it is for example a hash chain right so you start with some sort of number and then you just hash that and then you hash that so you repeatedly hashing um in a sequential manner not in the parallel manner but in a sequential manner and you know the idea of hashes is that the output of a hash is meant to be some some random looking number right so you can't predict random looking numbers so your only way forward is just to keep on hashing and you can't parallelize it you can't get speed ups one of the things you can do on the other hand is that you can try and design very specialized hardware that will do the inherently sequential computation you know faster than using let's say a cpu which is not optimized for this particular operation and so um one of the kind of the the crazy projects that we have at the afm foundation is to try and build the best possible um hardware that that humanity can build or this inherently sequential uh computation up to like a small margin of error uh and then distribute this hardware for to to the whole world and that will give you basically a a very decent um way of mapping computation and time is that the vdf project um that you just described justin okay so some folks might be familiar with that well so so you just described snarks which gives us a way to compress trust essentially increase transactions per second trusted transactions per second and and then you just describe sort of a time lock sort of tool that gives us almost an alternative to um to proof of work in in some ways because just just like it's very difficult to get energy in the real world no one knows how to time travel so we can't go back in time so that could be a very strong base primitive for lots of other things once we have certainty uh of of a given uh timestamp what else is there out here yeah um i mean just to to give a small note on on the the time thing so it turns out that when you have this notion of time in cryptography you can do perfect randomness unbiasable randomness so you know when you when you think of you know ethereum as a computer it can do everything well i can do many things but one of the things they couldn't do which is super basic is randomness right and that's one of i think one of the reasons why we don't have you know things like lotteries like we could have a billion dollar lottery on ethereum uh the only missing ingredient is that we don't have we don't know how to do you know good randomness um and you know it turns out that there's a very deep connection between time and randomness um okay moving on so in terms of other primitives um one that is you know quite quite cool and it's it it follows actually it's quite related to the snark is zero knowledge right so zero knowledge is this idea where you're doing computation and this computation involves secrets and you don't you want to prove that the computation was done properly but you don't want to reveal the secrets um and it it turns out that once you have the snarks where the s by the way stands for succinct um you're almost you almost have you're more than half the way there in terms of zero knowledge and the reason is that if you you have your computation and it compresses everything to a tiny amount of data so your your amount of leakage your kind of information theoretically is very very small um you know to start with because your proof is tiny so you know if you started with lots and lots of secrets the the most you could leak is like the a small portion of your secrets but it turns out that um you can easily get zero knowledge from snarks so this is one of these these very powerful things and and if you if you think of it in the context of of defy and uniswap it basically solves privacy um and and and you know this this this is a big deal for d5 right like can we really have large you know players large institutional players or even the retail you know participates in a big way on d5 where every single transaction is for the public to you know to analyze and and see it it just just won't work right so um we you know privacy is a necessary step it's coming um and and we have the tools um to uh to address that and i guess um in in the context of of uni swap you know we have uh we we have this this this on chain uh a privacy aspect where not only can we can we match what the centralized exchanges do right so in the context of a centralized exchange you don't tell anyone you know all you see is kind of the older book and the trades but you don't know who's making the trades or who's adding orders to the order book um so but the the one trade-off is that you have to share who you are with the exchange so not only can we match this in the sense that all the public information is only the trades and the order book but we can go beyond that we can be in a position where not even this the exchange is aware of of who's doing the trades so justin are there any other uh tools that we should talk about before we actually go into the uni-swap deep dive we're kind of blending these conversations as it is anyways yeah so there's so you know there's actually so many tools out there so um let me try and pick uh you know two yeah let's fire them off um so one which is really awesome is this idea of fully homomorphic encryption right so the idea here is it's kind of off chain privacy so if if zero knowledge solves the um the unchained privacy what about off chain privacy so on off chain privacy you have a different problem right so you you as a user you um you you're very constrained right you're using d5 on your phone or on your browser you know you're not running a data center with and so what you do is you're relying on a a service provider and you you're basically making api queries you you're you're sending them information and they're giving you responses and every time you make a query you're basically leaking the query so for example if you do a google search and you you know you you type in some rather you know personal information then google will know that and it turns out that this there's this magical primitive called fully homomorphic encryption fhe which allows and this is mind-blowing which allows um a service provider to respond to the query any query without knowing what the query is so imagine google being able to you know give you like the top 10 you know hits on on whatever query you make without being able to know what the query is yeah that is absolutely insane and i think the the need for that in the these days is pretty obvious with all the the topics of surveillance and surveillance capitalism going on i think that applies to so much of what you know modern society talks about as some of the problems that we are trying to solve in in today's society right um you know if i were to you know make it this a little bit more concrete uh in the context of uniswap um so we have you know a service called the graph which is basically backend infrastructure to to uni-swap and what it does is that it gives you kind of all the the the trading metrics and whatnot so you can say okay give me information about the if die pair between this date and this date and it will you know pull in all the information uh and and display it to you on the screen so you can make kind of an informed trading decision um but you know you're also using other services like infuria for example um or that also have like similarly similar kind of api um query points and you know when you're leaking this information you know you could potential you know these service providers could potentially link kind of addresses to like ethereum addresses to ip addresses and they could um you know even further anonymize you beyond what you're already leaking on chain if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemini since i first got back into crypto back in 2017 and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets including many of the hot d5 tokens

15 bonus check them out gemini.com go bankless so we've gone through a number of different cool new tools and applied them to unit swap and so i kind of want to actually formalize that conversation justin when you see people interacting with uniswap what are like the low-hanging fruits that maybe people don't think about that they are actually trusting you know centralized choke points centralized you know points of trust and what what and which of these tools applied to help add or remove trust from that whole process what what should come first in this conversation right um so one actually which i haven't mentioned which is which is low hanging fruit um in several ways is is this idea of custody right so just to just to zoom out a little bit custody i think is um is a big reason why we're having this bull run right now you know it's kind of like a technical detail hidden in in in the background but what has happened is that over the last few years um custodians such as exchanges but also other custodians have built um really high grade custody um of of crypto assets so what does it mean to custody crypto assets it simply means um being able to secure a private key and so what they've done is that they've they've designed systems where the the private key is split into multiple shares um and then um these keys can be kind of can work together kind of somewhat recombined but not really to compute the output of a function and this function is the signing function so basically it's um you know the custody has has has been uh sold for um for the for for large financial large financial players and i think we're going to see custody being solved again for for retail and for retail specifically there's it it's kind of surprising to me that this hasn't happened yet but basically if you're if you have funds on metamask you know on your on your desktop on your laptop um then they're pretty vulnerable and the reason why they're pretty vulnerable is that there's any number of ways in which an attacker can get your funds um and one of the reasons why it's scary is because not only are you as an individual vulnerable but the whole space is vulnerable so it's kind of a systemic risk where from one day to another you know everyone using metamask could lose their funds which would be you know devastating it could be like a one billion dollar hack um so if you think for example of if there's like a remote code execution vulnerability in the browser which happens very frequently or your operating system has a remote code um execution vulnerability or maybe there's some sort of malicious employee within metamask or malicious employee within the google play store or the apple play store that will you know push forward the malicious update or malicious code you know you're extremely vulnerable and so what you want to be doing in the context of custody for retail is very simple it's just 2fa and we have that for exchanges but we don't have that for decentralized exchanges so what is 2fa it's very simple is you take your private key you split it into two parts one part on your laptop let's say the other part on your phone and then you read you need an attacker would need to hack both you know your phone and the desktop in order to to to get the the the two um and like the best way to do 2fa in a decentralized fashion is using a notion called mpc multi-party computation and the idea here is that you have multiple parties each with secrets that want to compute the output of a function so yeah and in this case the two parties are your two devices so while there's one human the two parties in question are like your computer and your phone or maybe you know maybe you want to be even more secure in like your computer your ipad and your phone and you know maybe something else and and so um when i ever like log into apple apple says like hey is this actually you type in this code perhaps there's some sort of mechanism where you know my phone and my computer are both doing a little bit of computation to produce that private key and then there's some sort of relay of communication between these two devices so even if there's a malicious person inside of metamask or who got a bug on my computer it's isolated is all of this correct yeah that's absolutely right and the great news is that this can be you know largely transparent to the user um so for example you know your phone so you can you're gonna trade on your laptop right because you have a big big screen and your phone's just going to be sitting there in the background and you can you can give it some rules which you say like if i'm only trading let's say you know 100 or less you know within a day then just automatically sign it and only if certain rules trigger then you know just send me a notification and i just need to tap yes and then it's done where are those rules housed those aren't rules built into ethereum that is off chain rules where are those rules stored yeah so this is basically an opportunity um i think a low-hanging fruit opportunity for someone in the ecosystem to to go build this and it's basically they would build apps an app which runs on your phone where you can you can you know just tell it what kind of rules and i think um you know things like um wallets like argent uh try to do this to an extent uh projects like zango do this to an extent as well um yeah i mean as as vitalik says you know that i think there's there's a lot of opportunity and um in not only security but also the ux of security is pushing this forward i want to underscore how important custody is in particular self custody that is the thing that keeps this entire money system economy decentralized right the i mean we we chose the name bankless for this movement um because we want to do more without banks and the way banks centralize historically uh has been primarily through through custody even with gold gold is inherently a decentralized you know store of value money technology but it's very hard to defend and protect your gold isn't it that's why it accrues or to move it and these sorts of things that's why it accrues in banks and then once it's centralized in in banks um you use lose that decentralization you you lose that self-sovereignty so what we're talking about here is applied cryptography basically if we can make private key management easy if we can incorporate you know social um the ability to store things socially or across multiple devices and have a great user experience then we don't need crypto banks to the extent that we need them now which is a great thing for the decentralization of this movement and our ability to go bankless that's how cryptography plus economics leads to um an incredibly powerful tool for good for the world absolutely yeah and there's like no fundamental reasons for not having both security and ux it's just a matter of time justin when is this coming like why haven't we seen it yet and when is this coming i think this is this this one in particular is a low-hanging fruit um and i you know i really want to see it in 2021 and i'm more than happy to talk to people who you know are in this space and you know want some some some ideas about how to actually deliver on that um yeah it's it's it's low hanging fruit like and and part of it is because all the heavy lifting cryptographic work has already been done uh for for these institutional players um that are now custodying you know you know billions of dollars um and and and have allowed uh for for these more regulated institutions to you know to to come in okay so justin let's continue with the uniswap case study and again we're just using unit swap because everyone is familiar with it we're not picking on it in any particular way let's say we solve the multi-party computation issue for private key management we've got that solved our metamask is now secure what is the next low-hanging fruit that is a vulnerability that you see people engaging with when they currently engage in with unit swap in his current state okay um another one which i think is is coming soon and is actually you know uni swap have really done their best to push this forward is this idea of authenticating the front end right so when you're downloading a website like how do you know you're downloading the right thing and it's it's actually shocking how how brittle the web 2 infrastructure is like you have this notion of a registrar which will custody your your dns domain name they get hacked they can do whatever they want uh with your dns um or you know even if there's some sort of rogue employee within and that's happened many times there's a whole infrastructure around ssl certificates and these so-called certificate authorities and and basically we can remove all this trust uh with with ipfs and and and ens um and this this is just plain old you know hashes and signatures but it's kind of on the off chain uh side of things and you know we're already starting to see browsers you know do the integration with ens and ipfs like opera uh and brave um and you know this is just a relatively kind of incremental and slow rollout but it's happening much faster than i expected um so what does that do for the end user what does that just mean that there is a www.you know uniswap ipfs uh url that i can go to that is always persistently available so long as i have the internet connection yeah so what that gives you is um anti-phishing right so someone you know like the uniswap frontend is extremely valuable to an attacker they they get hold of it for some period of time they can fish maybe tens of thousands of people into basically signing the wrong transaction on their meta mask and just losing their money um so you know they could they could you know for example authorize right you know with erc20s you need this you have this authorization step that you have to do and then you can trade you know they could authorize you know all their funds to to the wrong contract instead of authorizing it to the union swap to some sort of rogue contract and that that will you know potentially allow them to steal all their money so this is this really is a security thing not a liveness thing and so if if i remember correctly unit swap does have a ipfs uh website is that do you know if that's true yeah yeah so they push you know their website to ipfs um should we be using that one instead or does that does that one not have all of the solutions that what we were talking about right here yeah the the the problem is there's still intermediaries and more specifically there's there's cloudflare so unisop has actually done a great job in what i call kind of assumption consolidation right you want to try and minimize the number of parties that you're trusting and what they're doing is that they're using cloudflare as both the registrar who controls the url and um as the ipfs gateway so the gateway is kind of this bridge between the old web 2 world and the web 3 world um and it's it's it's a very thin layer of infrastructure which is not necessary for some ex for some browsers like like like like brave um and opera but it's still required you know for for the more mainstream browsers like like google chrome so what you're talking about here too is not only anti-phishing but there's there's a criticism that um the user interface of unit swap is a centralization vector and a a third party could shut just shut down the the interface and then it it you know um shuts down not smart contracts ability to use unit swap but user's ability to to use unit swap and it's basically the non-technical users right yes and if it's persistent to ipfs and you have an ens domain name behind that and cloud fair starts using that by the way we uh we saw a press release this week that cloud fair was looking at how to incorporate more ipfs and ens inside of its content delivery network i'm not sure if that's totally related but it feels like what this means is you could have unstoppable user interfaces basically that are always available yes and like this has real practical implications for millions of people like um if you think for example of and this is this is a topic which really grinds me the the wrong way is um you know is sanctions like for some reason right the us government thinks it's all powerful and it can impose sanctions on other countries and then you have millions of people suffering in these countries and um like it turns out and this is unfortunate that that you know and there was some sort of mini controversy on twitter that the unisa frontend just doesn't work in some countries like iran or cuba or whatever and you know it's very unfortunate and i think it's linked to the fact that you know at the end of the day um there is a legal entity behind uni swap that is based in the u.s and they have to comply with sanctions if we were to have this you know really good native integrations then suddenly we're opening up this technology to some of the people in the world who need it the most that are under these these sanctions okay so we've solved the custody issue with multi-party computation and using multiple devices we've solved the persistent front end accessibility using things like ipfs what's next on the low-hanging fruit where should we go next okay um i think another really cool one is this idea of of sync so basically you're you're on your phone or on your browser and you you haven't been connected to the ethereum blockchain in some amount of time so you're out of sync right and um what you want to do is basically basically sync up and the the piece of infrastructure that is very common here is is called infuria um and basically you can go to inferior and tell me okay what is what is the head and you know and uh and sync up and this is this is bad for several reasons the first reason um is liveness infuria goes down and half of d5 the front ends go down not ideal um but there's maybe an even even worse problem than that um which is um around infera being malicious and feeding you wrong data so it tells you that you know this is the real state of ethereum but actually it's something completely different and this kind of goes back to the whole you know fishing thing where it's like you have slightly different attacks going um going on but basically they can trick users especially the less sophisticated users into doing really bad things including losing their funds um so one possible attack on on uni swap if if in through is compromised is that infura could tell you that you you you've made a trade when actually you didn't do the trade like you know your your your slippage protection kicked in and you know you actually didn't do the trade so you you think you're hedged or you think you're in a position when actually you're not or you know vice versa i could tell it could tell you oh your trade didn't go through uh because of slippage protection so you you try again you know you redo the trade and it turns out you're now overexposed because you've made the trade twice um and you know for uni swap i guess that's not too bad um but you know for some applications it's devastating if if infura um happens to be happy happens to be compromised and so the technology um that basically solved this uh which is which is very cool um is one uh like clients uh but um so that's that's infrastructure that we can pro we can provide at the at the layer one um making the layer one friendly to light clients and then another one which is very cryptographic heavy but we've made big big strides in in the recent months even is this idea of incrementable verifiable computation and the idea here is it's it's a snark um where you you can kind of always keep on building on it so you have imagine imagine the the tip or what's called the head of ethereum every time there's a new block the state progresses and so you can imagine that for every single block there's an associate associated proof that proves that not only is this state transition valid but all the previous state transitions all the way back to genesis are are valid um and you can do that for like clients in such a way that the syncing process is kind of instantaneous you only have to download this one snark and it will tell you that you know this is the valid chain and you don't have to trust you know an entity like infura for both liveness and for safety so is this using that same sort of principle of compressing computation using cryptography down to the bare minimum and that makes it really easy to say i don't know what block number we're at in the theorem right now like you know some 10 20 million i don't know but you know 10 20 million blocks takes a long time to download takes days to download but what you're saying with this like client mechanism is you can just download the latest block and then you're trusting whoever you're downloading it from but in that latest block there is a header that can verify every single block in all of history so in that instantaneous moment you get a complete verification that you are actually indeed communicating with the ethereum blockchain was that correct yes um not only are you communicating with the correct blockchain but also from there onwards every query that you make to different blockchain for example if you want to read some state in the blockchain all of that is authenticated and improvably secure so infuria has is a very common criticism uh from people outside of ethereum because people say quote-unquote ethereum is centralized around infira is this the direct counter argument for saying like well even if that's true this light client innovation is the thing that's going to solve that is that what this is yeah um so admittedly the if one design is horrible for like clients it's not like client friendly it is possible to do it in theory but it just in practice is very very messy in ef2 we have made a huge effort to make if to the beacon chain like client friendly and it's extremely it beats uh you know bitcoin by an order of magnitude in terms of like client friendliness and bitcoin is extremely like client friendly and then you can on top of that um you can have this kind of optional layer of infrastructure which is which is the incremental incremental verifiable computation that i was talking about that compresses kind of these relatively lightweight proofs but that still grow with the amount of time so if you've been disconnected for two weeks it's going to be 14 times greater than if you were disconnected for just one day but you know you can compress these two weeks down to to to a single proof or any amount of time down to a single proof using this incremental verifiable computation okay so we've solved custodianship with multi-party computation we've solved uh we've solved syncing and being able to trust which what is the correct blockchain with light clients uh what was the first one we also solved um front running yes and so where where do we go next what's the next lowest hanging fruit these are some of the biggest problems that people i think uh appropriately critique ethereum in its current state for yet what you are saying is that we have the cryptographic tool to solve all these problems where should we go next what's the next lowest low-hanging fruit yeah i mean you mentioned people criticizing and you know very often when when you know hayden you know makes a tweet you have like the the you know maxi trolls that come down and then they they try to list all all the downsides so what i've done is i've gone on twitter and i've i've tried to find every single criticism of uni swap and every single one so far can be solved with cryptography which is which is amazing um so we talked about also on-chain privacy off-chain privacy um one which uh which is which is cool is this idea of composability right like one of the big power of d5 is that you have these uh money legos and you can compose them together well it turns out that before money legos we had cryptographic legos um and specifically we had we have a framework in cryptography called universal composability the same composability word um and the universal what that what that means is that you can if if you have a primitive which fits within this this framework then you can compose it with any other cryptographic primitive and you're guaranteed that it's not going to break which is very much unlike d5 nowadays where you take too many two money legos you put them together and then there's an explosion uh some of the time um and so i'm this is a little bit more you know nebulous and a bit more of a kind of open research but i think there's a there's an opportunity out there for someone to come up with a similar universal composability framework which is generalized to crypto economics not just cryptography so that we can have very strong assurances that if you're going to build your your money lego it's it's not it's never going to blow up and it's going to play nice with the other money legos so the word compartmentalization comes to mind where we are have all these d5 money legos and while they can be composed together when in their current form when we compose them together they start to meld into the same thing yet what i think you're saying is that we can still have those same benefits but we can actually compartmentalize each money lego to be kind of in its own ecosystem so that uh and as a result of that the composability accidental accidental interactions that create explosions can be controlled i'm still a little bit unsure as to how that control comes from maybe you could expand on that how do we get stronger assurances that when we combine two money legos that we're accidentally not creating tnt right um so so what one of the features of composability is that you kind of you kind of naively have this exponential explosion of complexity right you start with with you know one body you know there's this famous body problem in physics which is like the three body problem you start with with one body and two body and three by and then the complexity just blows up i mean it's kind of similar with uh with with these money legos like you have one money lego that's all fine and good now you have two complexity has increased now you have three and it's it's kind of melcat's law right which is like the it's it's quadratic like for for every node can can talk to every other node and then you have this quadratic thing going on and really the the genius of universal composability is that if you prove local properties if you're one money lego you prove that it has certain properties kind of locally then that gives you global guarantees about the whole system the whole universe um if you were to compose them so basically it it's a way to limit complexity and facilitate the security analysis you just need to analyze one one money lego at a time as opposed to analyzing the whole system with which could have all sorts of weird complicated emergent behavior that is impossible and chaotic what's the theoretical problem that this solves maybe you could give us an example that our listeners and myself could relate to yeah i mean you could think for example um you know we've seen one money lego which is flash loans right you you compose it with um with let's say uni swap which is going which is going to be you know some used as a price oracle and then there's like a third defy money lego which is um like um you know synthetics right the way you build a synthetic is you use the oracle so individually each of these defy apps is secure but when you put the three together the oracle the the synthetic and and and the um the flash loan you get an explosion and then and then how does the how does this solution uh prevent that from happening or prevent prevent something from blowing up right um so basically and this is this kind of open problem but you know the reason why i'm optimistic is that we have a solution for pure cryptography like the open problem is basically to come up with a set of properties for money legos which will tell you that um if you adhere to the to to an interface to an api for these legos which have certain properties then you'll have like a universal universal composable oracle for example um and that that will be kind of secure regardless of of if you have some sort of you know flash loan infrastructure yes this this is maybe the most nebulous kind of idea but um i think it's a good challenge for someone listening so what you guys can't see here or you can if you're watching this on youtube is oh actually no you can't but we will share this this is a spreadsheet that justin put together of objections that are in place i think like you know definitely you've heard some of these if you've been on twitter if you've been in cryptocircles of uh ethereum is is centralized around in fiora no one's going to be their own bank and and use private keys um you know it's impossible to uh download and sync a note all of these things justin is going through this line by line row by row and talking about how cryptography solves this we will actually share this spreadsheet just not assuming it's okay with you that we share the spreadsheet okay we will we'll share the spreadsheet in the in the show notes so you can see what we were working from what haven't we covered still justin what's next okay um there's at least two um so um one of them is latency right so um when you're making a trade on on uni swap you know it it it could take several seconds um for your trade to go on chain um and you know we've made huge leap and bounce right so we have for example bitcoin where the average block time is 10 minutes and if one you know the average block time is is only 15 seconds but there is this one caveat where because it's proof of work sometimes it's like one minute sometimes it's one second and and and this variance really hurts um user experience so we have you know when in eve two we're making um a kind of another big breakthrough forward is that we have these fixed duration slots so there's like this 12 second slots and so you have much more um control over the duration but 12 seconds is still an eternity right um you want you want hundreds of milliseconds because that's that's the speed at which the internet operates um and the the good news is that um is that we we in in in if two and in with sharding we're gonna be able to get uh this kind of latency and the the the trick that we have here is um what's called uh staggering so we have these 64 shards right this is where transactions get go on chain in in the shot and what we can do is instead of having all 64 shards be aligned in time we can stagger them a little bit by let's say 200 milliseconds each so shot 0 kind of will have a block you know every 12 seconds and then shot one will have a block every 12 seconds plus 200 milliseconds relative to shot block zero and then basically if you stagger all your all your shards um then basically every 200 milliseconds you have an opportunity to include your data on the on the e2 um you know system so you will be able to get a kind of uni-swap um latencies like um that down uh by by by a huge amount you know down down to basically internet level uh latencies that's just a really clever mechanism for you know keeping the throughput the same because we can't increase throughput that's that turns into centralization but since we have 64 shards we have some optionality with the timing of these shards so that actually gives ethereum the l1 some maybe it's an illusion maybe it's not maybe it's actually more of a special trick up the sleeve but having it having a base layer blockchain with 200 millisecond uh block times perceived block times is pretty powerful that's a that's a ux that has been has been hounding this entire industry since genesis yes um yeah it's a really cute trick and it's one of the the advantages of shouting in the sense that you have different people working on different shots at any given point in time and so basically you can just assign tasks at you can schedule everything so that as you said the perceived latency is is very very small um you know one of the the the problems with this with this idea is that it's it's potentially not um crypto economically uh incentive aligned and the reason is that um when you're when you're building a block you have various incentives to either publish your block early or to publish late so you know one one incentive to publish you know early for example is that it gives your block more time to propagate through the network one incentive to publish your block late maybe is so that you have more time for transactions to come in and then you have more transaction fees and so one of the tools that we're considering using is is these these vdfs so the vds remember they they link cryptography and time and they basically um allow us uh to to limit the extent uh by which a a block proposer can can can play around can manipulate when the block comes out so you're kind of forcing it into a very specific schedule for for broadcasting and creating these blocks that's absolutely insane justin you said you had two more do you have another one for us before we move on to what i think will be the most mind-expanding part of this entire episode yeah so i think um i think this is a great segue uh over the last one so one of the criticisms of of the bitcoin maxies is that unit swap is great and all but um the only thing you can trade there is erc20 coins that that they're correct to an extent like you know like they will say oh you can't even trade bitcoin really because the only thing that you have is like  qualified bitcoin which is rap bitcoin um and it turns out that with with very fancy technology you can build um you can have bitcoin the the real deal the native bitcoin um totally trustless can live on ethereum using pure cryptography and justin when you say the native bitcoin you're talking about um a bitcoin that is tokenized on ethereum that has the same trust assurances as native bitcoin on the bitcoin network and i know our listeners will be familiar with with the differences there that's what you're talking about though right that's exactly right yeah so and maybe you could also talk about the comparison between a system like that and tbtc and how a a native token uh is actually an improvement upon something like tbtc yeah it seems like tbdc uses the um the crypto the economic part to supplement for the the cryptography that it's it's not doing exactly yes so this this fits in you know whatever the heuristic that i said before like if cryptography doesn't work or it's too difficult try cryptoeconomics and that's exactly what tbtc has done um the problem with tbtc is that it's it's too collateral intensive so basically um the idea of tbtc is that you're going to create a bitcoin synthetic and the way that you do synthetics is with over collateral collateralization and so if um you know if you want to have you know 10 billion dollars of bitcoin on on ethereum you're going to need you know 15 billion dollars of efer and it just doesn't scale um it's it's or at least it's it's extremely expensive um and then you have you have a another you know very interesting project called renbtc uh where there they actually use uh you know multi-party computation and but they they also have a very important economic aspect where they have this rent token and it turns out that if an attacker [Music] buys out a majority of the rent tokens and participates in these npcs um then they can they can basically break the system and so it's it's a very similar consideration where um the you know for rent btc the market cap of ren uh needs to be at least as large uh as the as the tokens that are being you know bridged over from from from bitcoin over to ethereum so that also doesn't doesn't doesn't scale very well and then you know just to go through all the the interesting i guess um versions of btc we also have the wrapped btc and rap btc is basically like a centralized custodian specifically bitgo which is which is which is trusted and that's that's obviously um not ideal so um it turns out that if you um if you use um code obfuscation which is this very powerful technique that i was talking about earlier then you can do a really cool trick so just to give a little bit of context the the the bitcoin blockchain is kind of stuck in the stone age if we kind of kind of extend this this metaphor in the sense that the only thing that the bitcoin scripts can do the only thing they understand is hashes and signatures and this is kind of unfortunate because you um in order to build a two-way bridge between bitcoin and ethereum which is trustless you want the bitcoin blockchain to be aware of the efferent blockchain um so the the the process basically of of of having these bridges is is is like a full a four-way process so you have your bitcoin your btc on bitcoin you're gonna lock them um on bitcoin the the ethereum blockchain sees that they're locked and then it gonna mint an equivalent token um on ethereum and then once once you've you you've had enough playing with your btc on ethereum you're gonna you're gonna burn the the tokenized version of bitcoin and then and this is the hardest step you want the bitcoin blockchain to see the ethereum blockchain and see that they have been burnt so that you can unlock them on the bitcoin side and kind of redeem them one for one in a trustless manner um but the problem is how can you make the bitcoin blockchain aware of ethereum using just signatures and and and hashes and it turns out that with code obfuscation you can do a generic snork to signature reducer so what does that mean it means that you can take any snork and instead of verifying the snark the usual way which involves advanced cryptography that the bitcoin blockchain that just doesn't have the capability um you can distill it to just a signature basically the what the program does is that it's going to verify the snark internally so the obfuscated code will verify the snark and there's a secret key inside the program which is obfuscated remember that's the superpower of code affiliation is that it has a secret inside it and then it's going to use this secret to to sign off on the fact that the the the the statement that is being proved by this knock is correct and then now that you have this snork to signature um reducer you can take the signature and and put it on the bitcoin blockchain which which you will understand because it's just a plain old signature and that is sufficient to for for bitcoin to be aware of the ethereum blockchain basically you can build a snark which tells you this is the state of ethereum right now this is a proof that this is the valid state you know going back to to the previous discussion around incremental incremental verified computation this is the the state of different blockchain and now you can verify it and now you can close the loop and build a totally trustless bitcoin uh on ethereum a two-way bridge between bitcoin and ethereum is the gold standard that i didn't know was possible and so what you're saying is that it is theoretically proven to be possible it's just that we need to actually apply the cryptography how big of a challenge do you think that is to actually get something like this up and running like where are we now and where do we need to be to get this to actually work yeah so going back to the you know the three big stages of cryptography you have theoretical applied and then real world we're we're just basically leaving the theoretical we've answered positively the answer can we do this but you know it's kind of comical how far away we are from practicality um like right now if you were to try and and use these techniques of code obfuscation you'd have a program which would run you know for for longer than the age of the universe it's like the the it's so impractical that it is laughable um but it's actually you know not so laughable in the sense that um this is the journey that cryptographic primitives take so if you look at snarks for example snarks you know were kind of sold theoretically 30 years ago and back then they were it would they were comically impractical and you know over over time with with a lot of dedication and research and and development we now have snarks which are extremely extremely fast and and and practical and so my kind of opt with my optimistic hat on you know in in this exponential world um i'm i'm very hopeful that um you know in in 20 years you know maybe 30 years uh we will have this primitive and it will be practical and then and one of the the interesting things is that it actually allows us to run the evm on bitcoin uh which is kind of an interesting consequence um but yeah we will still be i guess limited by the one megabyte block yes we will for eternity i think so the mental model i've had with this is is we've we've experienced moore's law's growth in computation and that has scaled computation and it seems to be that uh the optimistic case for a cryptography run universe is that we get comparable levels of growth in that scale and computation but we get it scaled in efficiency in cryptography and so if we do see that like moore's law level growth in cryptography's ability to scale computation and compress it then that's actually how we do get that two-way bitcoin to ethereum bridge is that the right uh perception to take justin yeah yeah i think so i mean in you know in the real world with transistors we have moore's law which is maybe like a doubling of the the transistor density every every year or so in in cryptography it's it's it's much much faster you have a primitive like snarks or io and it's more like um you know you have a 100x improvement or 1000x improvement every year um you know you started so far where you you know like you're astronomically far away um but but um you know over a decade if every year you improve by a fact of thousand and eventually you'll get there this is because it's software changes primarily we're not talking about like you know phys physics constraints as we were with moore's law exactly it's it's pure software um and even even more kind of abstractly it's like these cryptographic protocols and mathematical tricks and whatnot so justin say we have this two-way bridge we've solved that problem let's talk about the incentive to actually get btc on to ethereum and i i think people uh kind of forget that there's two different versions of bitcoin there's btc the assets and then there's bitcoin the blockchain in the same way that there's ether the asset and ethereum the blockchain yet there's just this uh obfuscation with bitcoin because it's the same name but there's actually two different things going on here so after we established this two-way bridge just maybe you could illustrate why people would migrate their btc the asset from the bitcoin blockchain to the ethereum blockchain right um so you know as you said this there's two bitcoins there's bitcoin with a capital b which is the blockchain and bitcoin with a lowercase b which is the asset and just for the sake of clarity when i'm gonna when i refer to the asset i'll actually say btc so we have bitcoin the blockchain and btc the asset and i guess there's you know in the short term there's various kind of reasons to to to migrate btc onto ethereum you know for example to make to make use of of yield um you know in the context of of d5 yield farming um but i i actually believe that long term if you look at a few you know mega trends that you know we can dig in i actually don't see a future you know in 20 to 30 years for bitcoin the blockchain um i i think that there's going to be what i call like a decoupling of the the asset and the blockchain um the the asset is going to outgrow its shell the shell is kind of going to to crack and break and there's going to be an uploading of the btc the asset onto ethereum and when the the bitcoin blockchain does break uh for for reasons that we should go into um then um at that point we can declare um you know any btc on the broken bitcoin to be you know burnt lost forever um which is by the way it is great for scarcity um and then you know we we can then declare ethereum as the new more secure more friendly home for for btc what you're talking about is back to your comment about state you're just migrating state here to a better computer yes i mean the important thing here is that we need to do it in a trustless and scalable way and unfortunately none of the existing solutions um you know for for tokenizing btc allow for that but in the future we will have this you know migration process which uh is aligned with the the values and culture of of bitcoin and i think i'm hoping i think that in 20 to 30 years it will be it will be obvious and and and it's actually a win-win for everyone um both both the the the bitcoiners and and i guess the experience yeah not for the miners though the miners tend to lose for some some reason in both in both camps justin why why do you say that uh the bitcoin blockchain is destined to die what what is these uh mega trends that's going on in cryptography that would indicate that the bitcoin blockchain has a a countdown timer on its lifespan right um so i guess there's there's kind of three three big uh reasons like the first one is kind of a bit nebulous which is that um the bitcoin blockchain is is ossifying or i should say is already ossified and i guess culturally speaking it has this um maximum viable ossification it will be as as ossified as it can be and you know we've talked about this it's somewhat at odds with the greater macro picture of an exponential world and you know if you go back to the root of ossification it means you know becoming a bone um and i i i think you know i the way i picture it is that bitcoin is becoming stronger and stronger you know the layers and layers of bones but the ex the the environment the context is adding more and more pressure at some point in time it's just the bonus is gonna go crack um now why what are these kind of external pressures there's kind of two two flavors like the first one is around quantum computing um so we have this kind of quantum mega trend which just changes the rule yet again of computation right if if blockchains is an innovation computing quantum is as well and there is some non-trivial intersection between between blockchain and quantum which we need to to take into account uh seriously um and then the other kind of big mega trend i guess is is the flip side of the 21 million um bitcoin limit whereby um and this this kind of moves us away from cryptography into the economic aspect of crypto economics whereby um it's it's been shown that basically the the incentive alignment disappears once you only rely on on on on fees as opposed to to subsidies so with the 21 million limit the the block subsidy goes to zero you're left with only fees and this is problematic because um basically the the main issue is that fees can be stolen in the sense that if i'm a bitcoin miner i build a block with transactions um today you you're kind of expecting all the other miners once i find a block to build on top of my block and they have an incentive to do this because there's this baseline um inflation in in terms of the reward but if you have no inflation actually the the the the thing that a rational miner would do is that it would not build a new block instead they would steal all the transactions that pay that pays fees and and um and then try and and build and fork off basically and and and then and so you have a team from stanford which basically uh analyzed this and and built you know models and they wrote a paper um basically explaining why um it's it's an unstable kind of crypto economic equilibrium to only rely on transaction fees we made this we've made this argument a number of times on bank list the very the second argument that that you're making and i think one of the interesting things about it is um bitcoin is memed as digital gold and there's an element of of truth to that meme in that it helps uh somebody wrap their mind around the concept of digital scarcity so that makes sense right but one major difference that always seems to be overlooked is that the fact that gold in the physical form does not have to pay for its security with transaction fees it paid for its security costs in like the supernova of a star like it's it's a chemical element right um and it doesn't have to its security is not dependent on some sort of transaction fee for me to give a bar of gold to david right whereas bitcoin totally is and in fact that's the model it's getting away from its in you know issuance meme as creating the security which is its core strength and moving to this this transaction fee that that makes it not very much like gold and i do also agree this will become more apparent to people the breakdown of that digital gold meme will become more apparent to people as time goes on and block subsidy every four years uh gets diminished and cut uh further but what does that mean bitcoin is left with it it kind of means it's left with what its core strength arguably is right now which is it's a it's a meme it's a it's kind of a property ledger right and i don't mean like when i say meme i actually don't mean that in a condescending way like i have uh david and i think have high reverence for memes right like money is a meme at some some level it's a social coordination tool but um you can't only have memes exactly that's a it's a very different bitcoin than the future that i think many bitcoiners imagine today that that's kind of the future that that you're painting well i actually don't think it's that different in a way because um i think a significant portion of bitcoin is love btc the asset but they hate the blockchain they don't even use it it's necessary evil like um the real the real purpose of bitcoin is all about the assets so i think we're fairly aligned here right we're we're giving bitcoin as the opportunity to take that that precious btc and and like house it in a very secure and friendly environment um and kind of a little bit like a butterfly i guess you know it's it it comes out of the cocoon and then it it finds immense emancipation as a butterfly starting from a caterpillar um so this is an economic argument this is talking about crypto economics however what's new to me in this conversation is that there is also a purely cryptographic argument that the continuation of the bitcoin blockchain might not be able to continue as trends in cryptography uh improve uh can you let's first rehash that part of the conversation because i that's the novel part of the conversation to me and then we can actually go into perhaps the migration process from bt btc on bitcoin to btc on ethereum yeah so there's actually three different ways in which quantum potentially affects um you know a bitcoin so the first one is the most well-known so in in in quantum you have this this um this algorithm called shaw's algorithm and it allows you to do things like factoring large numbers but it also breaks the cryptography on bitcoin which is basically based on elliptic curve the discrete log problem anyway long story short is that quantum breaks the cryptography in bitcoin and what that means is actually like an economic um um consequence which is that all the lost coins at least a lot of coins for which the the publicly has been made public and um peter waller who is um one of the the core bitcoin developers um did some statistics and he found in 2019 i believe that 37 of the bitcoin supply was um kind of liable to these kinds of quantum attacks so basically the the the the public key is is public as opposed to just the the address which is the hash of the public key and with that information a quantum computer a large enough quantum computer could basically find the private key and then spend the funds and this is bad go go ahead yeah no go go ahead finish it finish your thought okay yeah and and this is bad for the same reason that the dow was bad and it led to a fork right the dow basically was oh god we have an attacker who is now in control of 10 or 15 i forget exactly of the supply that that's just not gonna work um is it and so um you know imagine having an attacker with you know even 10 of the bitcoin supply you know if bitcoin is a multi-trillion dollar asset that that's just on untenable and so it ruins the credible neutrality of the asset because some attacker got their hands on bitcoins that wasn't theirs yes exactly you have basically you have a flood of bitcoin which pollutes all all the rest yeah yeah and so we have assurances that this is a possible thing and likely to happen in maybe the next 30 years is that about right yeah 30 years is the very conservative estimator is usually given like like everything moves exponentially including quantum and you know we have an equivalent of moore's law for quantum computers and so far it's very much on track and basically you know every year we're going to get better and better quantum computers and in 20 to 30 years assuming this this law um remains then you know we'll be will be able to to break the the crypto and it's kind of interesting because it the time scales like 20 to 30 years align with the economic argument that i put before right like in 20 to 30 years um like one of the reasons why the um the the first economic argument didn't kick in is because even though the um the inflation reduces by by two every four years the price more than increases by two every four years uh but if you look over very long time scales you you know you can't have an asset which just grows exponentially forever like exponentials do end um and in in in in 30 years over 99.9 percent like just about uh over that will be will be mine and and like one of one of the other things is that the basically the the ratio of the security budget and the asset should be just totally out of whack you know you're going to have you know like a factor of of one to a thousand and so it it's it just doesn't it doesn't make sense there justin is this quantum problem not a problem for ethereum it is it is absolutely um and i think um ethereum will go through the the same migration process that i'm that i'm uh that i guess i'm happy to describe but maybe before describing this migration process uh i should kind of flesh out the the other two quantum attacks that are relevant to to bitcoin okay so the the other um basically two attacks are are based on what's called grover's algorithm and this actually affects proof of work so um in in um you know very famously satoshi wrote one cpu one vote right and what he meant by that is that your computational power is going to be linear with the number of of transistors that you have and the amount of energy that you're spending so you can kind of think of it as as one transistor one vote or one drool one vote it turns out that in in quantum computing you have these really non-obvious effects where you have a superposition of things and you have quantum entanglement and and these very you know cool kind of quantum effects mean that you actually don't have this this linear rule one one transistor one vote instead you have more like uh you have this this quadratic effect where um if you if you run a computation for n steps your your computational power is kind of actually more like n squared as opposed to n um and so what that means it has two consequences the first one is that at some point in time it's possible that you know the the the very first um person who's able to make um proof of work on a quantum computer um be more more more efficient um economically efficient than than using traditional computers will have such a large advantage that for some period of time um they will totally dominate the proof of work so you know it could be the nsa for example that you know for a period of one year because they they have the only quantum computer in the world that can do that will be able to totally control the bitcoin blockchain um so that's kind of like a short-term attack but what happens with proof-of-work is that you know there's a difficulty adjustment right and so the the difficulty will adjust and then other people will start getting quantum computers and then you you enter this new steady state and all is good right it's only a temporary attack but actually that's not the case so it turns out um that there's a paper from from this year uh which was titled something like on the on the insecurity of of of quantum bitcoin mining which basically made made a very similar point to the to the to the to the first one around the the the instability of the the bitcoin mining when you have when you rely only on fees so it turns out that this quadratic effect makes the the chain even more unstable uh because of these these um because it just changes the the the nature of mining um so yeah satoshi you know quite understandably couldn't predict and forecast and kind of think through all the consequences of of proof-of-work you know 40 years into the future but um yeah it's it's it's a possible future whereby in in 30 years uh mining will be will be truly truly messed up so this episode is centered around the combination of cryptography and economics which creates cryptoeconomics and when you can't use cryptography you use cryptoeconomics to fill those gaps but what you're saying justin is that bitcoin over the long term has both flaws in cryptography and in economics that you know no one could have predicted at genesis but now that we are 12 years into this revolution we actually do see you know things on the horizon that we don't actually have the problems for and without a migration plan without being able to pivot and your concern is that you know the bitcoin blockchain is trying to become as ossified as possible when there are still obstacles that we can see down the road and so that it's always been my like why my interest is always on it on ethereum is that there's no way that we understood the power of crypto economics the first blockchain the first crypto economic system that this industry ever invented which was bitcoin and so i'm much more interested in the system that comes after we understand that there is so much untapped potential in crypto economics so you you earlier you said that ethereum one and also is also ethereum two perhaps uh has the same problem that bitcoin does yet it has it hasn't ossified yet it has a migration plan maybe we can talk about what that migration plan looks like for both bitcoin and ethereum 1.0 into a future that does not fall to these uh these cryptographic attacks or economic failures right um so i guess the the migration plan is in is in two two steps like the first one is you want to upgrade your cryptography to be so-called post-quantum secure um and you know that's that's something where a lot of progress is being made um a lot of um enthusiasm and you know we have this is something that's essentially been solved at least at the theoretical level because we know how to do quantum secure snarks you know the for example the stocks from stockwear they're quite insecure and then when you have that you can do um a very very large part of the cryptography needed for for for for blockchains so that's step one and that's that's just you know an engineering update the other thing that we need to do is more of an economic or social update which is that we need to find a way to bail out to to discard um the the lost coins because they're a liability we need to have a mechanism to say okay these coins are lost and we're just going to forget about them and my my suggestion is is as follows and i think is kind of optimal in the sense that it gives people the the the most time to migrate right you don't it's kind of awkward if you're gonna say okay in in one year we're just gonna um we're just gonna call any coin that has migrated um lost because that would be extremely controversial but what is much less controversial is anything that is um forced to us by technology so basically there's going to be a breaking point and anything um that hasn't migrated after the breaking point well obviously is lost and so what i suggest building is basically this this two-way bridge between bitcoin and ethereum that i was talking about 100 trustless and then there's a little um kind of feature which i call um kind of a quantum canary and a quantum bomb okay so what is a canaries the canary in the coal mine the canary in the coal mine is able to sniff out um kind of as an early detector some something something bad um and and this quantum canary would be able to sniff out that quantum computers are here today uh maybe not quite quite completely large enough to break um you know the the the cryptography but it's kind of a an early sign um and then this quantum canary would basically trigger a bomb which would destroy the bridge um and once the the the bomb has detonated and the bridge has collapsed anything that's remains in the old world is considered lost and anything that has migrated um has has now found is now in what in the canonical home um and one thing that you can do is you can incentivize uh you can attach a bounty to this canary so whoever is the first one to present proof to the blockchain that quantum computers are real and are a threat they can receive a very generous bounty uh for for doing so and so go ahead ron oh i would i was uh actually what if you're gonna close this go go for yours first and so this is the formalization of the separation between btc the asset and bitcoin the blockchain where the bitcoin blockchain is actually forgotten yet btc the asset is able to remain if and and and justin i want to get your question on this a lot of bitcoiners might listen to this and throw up a flag saying you know we don't want that like we don't like ethereum we don't want our bitcoins on ethereum but yet is this an option regardless of consensus like do we need consensus behind you know a majority of btc holding individuals for this to work or is this something that we can build and establish anyways without needing to have some sort of consensus among stakeholders yeah i think it's um a little bit between the two so um we can have bitcoin the assets in a very native way um come come on and and many other blockchains so in a way bitcoin will not just live on on ethereum but they will you know probably live on on many different uh blockchains and so you know there is a social aspect where you know i think the whichever blockchain has the most bitcoin you know these native bitcoins uh what will hold the claim for being the new home um basically we we need to be able to define some sort of canonical home and and and the reason is that um when you have bitcoin on multiple blockchains if if the consensus of that blockchain blows up um then then you you you wanna um basically preserve the integrity of the asset so you wanna have some sort of root notion of trust um and you know i think and that that will have to be determined socially but i think if theorem has a good shot um if it holds most of the the tokenized bitcoin and has very high grade security consensus it has a shot as as being deemed a new home for btc it it very much strikes me that um we've been talking a lot about like difference between bitcoin and ethereum is is kind of ossification right um but there's also the layer at which you ossify right and one of the one of the challenges maybe is that bitcoin has kind of ossified um it's it's it's layer one uh when really the thing it needs to ossify more is its layer zero because the social contract around bitcoin as a fixed cap asset store of value reserve the bitcoin movement can remain ossified in in sort of in spirit in seoul in social contract um but it can move its body and its body being the kind of the layer one the network is sort of a rickety old computer that is really fast it's aging really fast and so what you're talking about is something you know connection that maybe some bitcoiners haven't made yet is like ossify your layer zero ossify your your social contract and your meme layer but you don't have to ossify layer one or layer two or layer three because this is compute technology and we've just entered this new era and they're going to be waves of innovation that provide 10x 100x improvements so why in the world would you ossify your layer one and that seems to be the the more the pragmatic approach that ethereum is taking and i do actually see an ethereum some more ossification around these these core values in in layers here which is exciting to see but now with ethereum we have kind of layer one that we can continue iterating on and improving you know so much so that we're creating a whole other network this e2 thing that lives in parallel and we're taking the layer zero and we're migrating it over it's um it it seems to be a very winning strategy and i guess this this is why justin this um this episode fits very much into our eth bull thesis uh series of episodes here yeah i agree um it makes sense for bitcoiners to solidify their their layer zero and and get ready at least psychologically speaking to um to consider options on on layer one but i think they've also already solidified their layer zero or at least they're in the process of doing it like we hear people on twitter or whatever um saying that anything that doesn't have the 21 million limit is not bitcoin and they will use very very strong language and i think it's being ingrained in the dna of what it means to be bitcoin um and i think that's that's perfectly fine um but there are trade-offs um to that mentality there's like an another there's a flip side to the coin um and in a way uh bitcoin can get the best of both worlds bitcoin can get the best of both worlds it can not only have the this amazing scarcity which is with the 21 million um limits but it can also and even for free kind of latch onto the security guarantees that uh ethereum uh will provide with a very different model which is the the minimum viable issuance enough to provide security but minimal to keep basically the economic waste to to to to a small amount it does seem to be the best of both worlds it really is up to the social layer of bitcoin to say if they actually want that or not um and you know i guess at any point bias could be included in this conversation but it would seem to be that it would be in bitcoin's best interest to not go down with the ship and admit that ethereum might be a great new host to upload btc the asset too because as we all know bitcoiners love btc the asset and the bitcoin blockchain is more of an afterthought justin this episode has been absolutely fantastic in addition to talking about the the obstacles and optionality between bitcoin and theorem we talked a ton about the power of cryptography and at least with the bankless thesis banklessness is about power to the individual and cryptography has always been about putting power back into the hands of the of the individual and my own twitter handle trustless states talks about the state of being trustless which cryptography is inherently involved with uh we would have never been able to produce this episode without your help and without your amazing agenda that you helped put a put together for us thank you so for so much for coming on at the bankless podcast and telling us intel and showcasing the future of cryptography and what can it can do for the average individual and what this uh crypto economic revolution can do for the world for returning sovereignty back to the individual justin thank you for coming on the bankless podcast guys thank you so much it's been an honor bankless is one of my favorites that is awesome to hear okay guys action items we are going to include a spreadsheet to the research that we referenced as justin was going through those cryptography solutions and kind of the the problems that we solved we'll include that as a link in the action items in the show notes check that out if you want the detail justin also mentioned some research papers so we're going to ping him after this show and see if we can get links to a few of those finally bull market david what do we need in the bull market we need five star reviews if you thought that this episode was interesting and informative and you think other people should listen to it i think other people should listen to it we need five star reviews to get bank lists to the top of the itunes podcast charts we're trying to scrape our way to the top of business and investing categories we are not yet in the top 50 i don't even believe ryan we're in the top 75 and so it's up to the bankless nation to give us those five-star reviews so we can get to the top of the itunes podcast charts your likes on youtube help as well if you're watching it that way guys risks and disclaimers eath is risky so is bitcoin all of crypto is risky you could lose what you put in we are headed west though this is the frontier it's the frontier of cryptography as well it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
