foreign [Music] to the Devcon 6 experience coming up next in these line of interviews I'm talking with Peter from the guest team I don't really know if Peter has ever done an interview Before Peter is one of these core devs that is heads down and just believes in ethereum even though his hot take is that most of the stuff that we do on the ethereum app layer is just like a bunch of shenanigans that he's confused by yet he still is one of the coolest and most important people in this space tirelessly and relentingly building out Geth for the rest of us to use and not just the ethereum ecosystem but Geth is that consensus client the execution client of ethereum that so many people have forked and spun off and built their own blockchain and raised billions of dollars like Avalanche Phantom like any like all layer one the whole meme of like forking death and then juicing it up and then raising 100 million dollars comes from Geth and a lot of Peter's work and other peoples of the guest team so I asked Peter about how he feels about all this and overall just what it's like been building Geth for the last eight plus years now so I hope you enjoyed this interview but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or fished and I owe a large part of that credit to my ledger Hardware wallet or really my ledgers like all of them all five of them because ledgers hold like 99 of my crypto assets and it makes me feel good about self-custody private Key Management you know what else makes me feel good using the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet or view your nfts or just keep up to date with the web3 communities and of course you've heard of arbitrum and the arbitrim ecosystem is really heating up with their recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrum has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with her recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrary and Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrim Nitro shipped last month it has made arbitrum faster and cheaper than ever so make sure that you experienced what arbitrim has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking the fuel Network free from the evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security and maybe you're on arbitrum but you want to get to fuel you might use something like a cross the layer 2 Bridge from Uma a cross is a safe and secure Bridge making it easy to transfer your assets from one layer two to another or back to ethereum it's super fast super cheap and all secured by uma's optimistic Oracle and our last sponsor nexo which has like five different products and you're probably going to be interested in at least one of them first you can buy crypto instantly with credit debit or bank transfer it's also got an advanced trading platform called nexo Pro you can also earn interest on your crypto your Bitcoin your ether or whatever asset you like it's also got an instant crypto line of credit with as low as zero percent APR and a crypto backed MasterCard one of those things is probably what you want so go check out nexo the fine Financial hub for the digital age and let's go ahead and get right into the interview right now and we are back to Bogota Devcon Devcon number six and I'm here with Peter from the guest team Peter welcome to the show thank you very much for having me uh Peter for the people that uh don't know you or aren't familiar with you you have a critical role in ethereum and you have for a long time uh could you just give us a quick download as to your history with ethereum wow well critical I wouldn't call that may be important I can agree with that so I've been with ethereum for I don't know around eight years give or take a bit less that's like all of the years right no it's it's all about the half the first half I'm missing the first half I'm missing the most funny years and well essentially I've been on the gas team building guests for the past forever and uh essentially transitioned from a lowly whisper developer up to currently being the lead of uh of the team so what's it like to build Geth because Geth is such a an important part of the ethereum technology stack and you've just been heads down building Geth for that in this entire time uh and it's many people shift around in crypto they hop from company to team to projects but you've been with Geth the entire time what motivates you to build Geth that's actually a hard question because from one perspective building gas is particularly boring in that it's uh I mean five ten years or 10 years ago eight years ago seven years ago it was um all about adding features and doing all kind of crazy stuff nowadays it's more about maintaining it so I think initially many years ago the drive was around shipping new stuff shipping awesome stuff which was really nice and especially as a fresh developer it really gives you the I don't drive to just keep crunching now that drive is most definitely gone because ethereum doesn't ship stuff that fast however now I think the drive kind of switched over to seeing that you have this immensely valuable Network and you know that you're kind of building it and you're one of those handful of people who can understand it and maintain it and it's less definitely less fun to do it but it does have its reward aspect it's just you feel a certain fulfillment of being able to be part of it ethereum is often described as a city right there was uh the Metropolis hard Fork we use the city metaphors to show and talk about the growth of the ecosystem and much of the city stands on the infrastructure of Geth uh I believe you've been to most if not all of devcons what's it like to watch this city emerge on top of the software that you're building that's a interesting that's um sometimes very fun sometimes very frustrating I think one of one of the most predominant aspect that I've noticed is that um in Defcon 1m2 it was all about Geth or all about okay Clarity the other clients so let's not dominate the thing but then the core devs were kind of the center of the attention everybody wanted to see what we're doing everybody was just interested now fast forward seven years people are like who are you again so it's a maybe maybe some people recognize me but most of the other quarters are having a much I would say harder time being recognized but it's the focus somehow shifted from from ethereum being this platform and everything revolves around it so now somehow the platform is considered a given and then people all the fun stuff is happening above it so it's um it definitely changes but uh but the nice aspect is that there are legitimate a lot of very fun stuff being built on top so it's uh it's nice to see that sometimes I'm feeling that oh I'm missing out on it but uh it's fun it's you kind of need to give space for others to to build cool stuff yeah sometimes do you think do you think it's like funny or ironic that some people might not recognize you or know who you are even though almost in the entire of the ethereum stack is built on top of death no no no I um it's very pleasant but somebody recognizes me and it's very pleasant not to be recognized as much as vitalik since I'm happy to be able to walk around without being stopped every five meters so it's um I think it's a good um good mix of having that fuzzy feeling without being overwhelmed the 2021 era of crypto uh was marked by just many teams the meme was that many teams are just for Geth and Juice It Up and start a new blockchain what was it like to see this era of crypto uh in it just come to pass wow mixed feelings um I I'm trying to formulate in a way without picking um picking on any project so there were a few projects which grew really really big and really popular and did relatively little those were kind of frustrating because they kind of used their weight and their marketing specifically marketing weight or I know being an exchange wait to to pushing their platform that one was frustrating you we had other projects we had a lot of projects we just take the code Rebrand it and run with it yeah okay they're going to fail anyway or they're not really serious so we don't care and there's ever slide ever so often the a couple process projects which are serious whether they compete with ethereum or not debatable kind of like Avalanche but they I feel that there are certain projects which try to be nice and uh and for them it's it's nice to to collaborate with them even though we collaborate very little but it's it's nice so kind of mixed bag frustration not caring and being happy but I think working on open source software it's kind of that's the game that people are going to take yours foreign so are you going to work on Geth for the rest of your life like what is the trajectory with you and guess like what do you see when you look into the future I don't know it's um I will definitely admit that I had my ups and downs and I firstly had my frustrating periods where I like okay screw it I'll just flip the table and walk away I would probably attribute that mostly to covet it was a bit rough but um I don't know so for now I really enjoy it I especially that the merch happen and now we have important Forks coming but a bit smaller ones I think these are very interesting and they do give me this drive I don't know maybe once we reach the point where things just settle down then it will be less interesting plus I think now me remaining is kind of useful and I don't really want to say important rather it's helpful if I don't go I'm almost certain that there will be a time when you will have a lot more clients a lot more specialized where me alone would not be that relevant and that might be an interesting time to just call it a day what's your least favorite thing about ethereum The Depths adapts yes the application layer yes um what about the application layer offends you uh no the D5 stock now I will flat admit I don't understand it it's just like this black magic of thing which for whatever reason works I don't understand why it works I try to understand it I don't have time to figure it out and it seems like this uh thing that I don't understand why it just doesn't collapse and it's fascinating that it doesn't collapse I'm afraid that it will collapse and I don't have time to understand it it frustrates me so that's the thing I hate about ethereum so I mean ethereum is a layer for applications that's kind of the point right like Geth is an execution client to execute applications what what does your idealized version of the ethereum app layer look like if it's not a bunch of defy stuff no no there's absolutely nothing wrong with D5 stuff I'm just waiting for non-defi stuff yeah I uh nfts okay they got a really bad rep I think there was a lot of abuse but that was at least something that wasn't necessarily revolving around money initially it had this money aspects too I'm really looking forward to certain for example um one thing that was super nice was on the opening ceremony they announced a small nft for the merge contributors which would allow people to have access to conferences and it was like okay this is not money it actually isn't nft it's used as ethereum is the super nice application and the super nice gesture but it's completely non-financial and that's it seemed like a very nice thing to do but you have other applications you have ens I really like that so anything that doesn't necessarily revolve around the money I prefer that a bit more and there's nothing wrong with D5 nothing wrong with all the money aspects I know we need them to to be here so happy that they are here I'm just not a fair so you're in the Vitality camp where you're just more focused on the non-financial use cases of what ethereum can do yeah yeah I would say yeah it's with the non-financial aspects you can have very nice conversations with anybody and you can just talk about the fun aspects whereas every time you talk about the financial stuff with somebody sooner or later they will ask okay so what do I need to buy and that's when you want to exit the conversation and um and and even if I'm among friends I mean my tight friends circle they kind of learned it that they don't ask these questions because I'm not answering anyway and we can just discuss stuff but if I end up in a broader friend Circle within 10 minutes we're back to okay so what do you think about this token I'm like yeah okay so what's your favorite thing about ethereum then either part of the the tech stack or the culture or anything actually uh I was just talking about this with Maurice yesterday he I'm not going to give names he was talking with various non-etherium projects linked to ethereum not really ethereum is other chains actors Etc and his observations was that at in a lot of these chains you have a certain rivalry you have a certain uh you know we don't really like those with we like those uh and I kind of feel that at least within the circle that I'm moving around in the ethereum community is very very positive it's not about uh let's make it so that ethereum becomes this thing and something else fails in exchange rather we'll just build our little buy and everybody else does whatever they want at least the people I talk to are kind of I feel that they are like this most people and that that's very positive that's I think that's the single best thing about the this holy theorem community what can the ethereum community do to make your life easier or make death the best thing that it can be how can we get out of your way nothing I think no no no I um I've this is a question I get asked over and over again and well the fact is Geth is a very very technical software development project we deliberately didn't spin out of the EF we deliberately don't have our own conferences we don't have our own booth here at Defcon we could have had it and we've already said that now we don't want to be some big thing we just want to be a single team that does software development but because of that when people ask how can they help us well yeah we're developing software so kind of that's where our day starts and our day ends so how can you help us making the software I know our bottlenecks are usually we receive more code than we can review even internally we have devs who produce more code and we can reliably merge and then that's that's the biggest frustration so I guess if I would necessarily had to name something that for somebody from the outside could help get with it would be joining these testing efforts for example the merge had an immense effort well Maris was pioneering the testing the merge and we had a lot of teams fuzzing and doing all kinds of stuff now that doesn't necessarily help get directly but it does help us uh sleep well at night because we know that the thing that we wrote it's not just that we think that it works but actually none of the other tasks fail so that's a very very not boost to our I know how to call it us believing that the code is okay and that that really helps because then I don't have to second guess I don't have to sit there on needles waiting for the merch to blow up I can be sure for example when the merch was happened our biggest fear was that somebody comes up with an attack at the island of service that we didn't thought about the fact that the merge wouldn't go smoothly in its normal form without an attacks well we were kind of convinced that it's going to go perfectly so that was and I think that we owe that to the immense effort that essentially the entire Community contributed that's Peter what's uh what's ethereum's biggest weakness if you had to attack ethereum how would you do it how would I do it um I still think ethereum is the ethereum software or ethium platform is not really robust enough there are still um many areas so my my personal fit with ethereum and all the chat all the IPS and everything is always the Isle of service that's always I try to see okay can I somehow break things and uh I feel it that ethereum is very robust however our path is so our network is constantly growing everybody wants to do more on it everyone wants to store more on it and nobody really wants to talk about okay but how can we clean the old crap up and this is it works up until a certain point and then things start to break and at least for the guest team sometimes people ask us what does maintaining death mean because we're not we're we're not really adding features so then what are we doing for the past eight years and um the answer is that well for eight years the natural constantly growing and every time it grows past a certain threshold something breaks and then maintaining gas or maintaining ethereum is keeping up with the breakages and just redesigning internals swapping out stuff so that it keeps on going and I think this is eventually we will run out of ideas to do and then eventually if we keep on this Collision path ethereum will break but yeah we have the I mean we have the Purge and a few other EIP so there are definitely things that we are working towards to solve these problems but in its current aspect I think that's uh that's how I would break it through maybe just let it run so just don't touch it it will break by itself interesting interesting so uh ethereum if we just let it let it sit we'll have it it will break somehow uh and so the just uh just to give an example look at the binance marching so essentially binance smart chain is ethereum has steroids they just bumped up the constants a bit so it's like running ethereum on either four or five x speed and you just look at that chain and you see what's going to happen to us just four to five times slower yeah exactly and so this is what the the importance of that ethereum road map where uh but but do you believe that we can actually get to a state where we don't have to touch ethereum ever or are we always going to be having to kind of bump ethereum back into a good course so on the roadmap there are at least two things that um pruning historical chain segments that will help us go very far plus there are even now a lot of VIPs a lot of workshops currently going with Dank sharding that will allow us to push the boundaries without raising the the stress on the network too much so there are a lot of things that we are currently doing to actually do that I think this will give us quite a nice Runway there's still a couple thorny issues vertical trees might solve some of them I'm still not 100 sure but there are the nice thing is that there are actually a lot of attempts to solve it so it's not like we're not talking about these problems rather yeah most people don't really acknowledge it but at least there's a group of researchers and codefs who to figure it out that okay this is a problem and we need to solve it and it might take five years I don't know some random number maybe 10 maybe two but uh we are trying to actively solve it so going back to one of my first questions why work on Geth what's the motivation what do you think ethereum is here to do to the world like is ethereum good for the world and how will the world change or hopefully improve because of ethereum's existence that's that's a philosophical question usually I suck at those it's um time like I'm more of a practical person so I I kind of just see it as a really nice platform that allows people to build tabs that can interact with each other I think technologically this is amazing that you can even I have to admit the defy space where you have all these little pieces of puzzle and they somehow just assemble into this huge yarn ball and it doesn't collapse that's amazing and and I think this is what this technology allows us to do whether that's good or bad for the world I don't know I would say that completely depends on what's getting built on top and I think that kind of depends on the ethereum community of what it allows to be built or what it prevents from being built so I would say ethereum isn't necessarily good or bad it's just a thing that allows people to do good or bad for the world well Peter of course we always use in the open source world that we stand on the shoulders of giants and you have been tirelessly working on Geth for so many years uh and so we everyone here as we're listening whether they know you or not has so much things to give for all of your contributions so thank you for what you've done for ethereum um thank you very much but uh I do want to add that many people believe I mean a lot of people do say that they owe me a lot but I am I am the vocal part of the team there are many many other people on the team and I most definitely don't deserve all that credit so when people come to you and tell you thank you who do you pass that think you on to you should I try whenever people say that this is a very awesome world that is very awesome I always just try to point out that yes but this was done by Martin that was done by Cena that was done by Marius it's a probably I don't always manage to do that but I I think it's really really important that people who are just in the trenches they also get at least a shout out that they're there and I'm really trying to for example when we have a we had a really nice interrupt where we smacked out the merge and the interoperability between the clients and uh essential EF said that every client team can send free people there and then we said that okay we either going from EF budget or our own budget but I'm taking the entire team because it's not fair that you have a couple people who are more visible and they get to hang out with all the cool people in Greece and then people who are in the trenches they stay there so I'm I'm trying somehow to make it a bit more Equitable so that the silent part also gets some some fun well to the silent part uh thank you for your service as well because everyone appreciates it and Peter thank you for joining me here at Devcon thank you very much for the invite cheers [Music]
