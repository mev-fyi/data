what the FED is doing right now is that a new thing like should we be worried yeah we should totally be worried I mean that's the undertone all right cool what the FED is doing right now is not normal in any respect and I think to answer your question the core point that people need to know is that between 2010 and 2020 the FED just broke into an entirely new graph they started doing these experiments with easy money that changed their role in the economy that changed the financial system in really really deep ways we're sitting here in late 2022 and the FED is trying to so-called Titan you know they're trying to hike interest rates to fight inflation and that sounds pretty normal but the backdrop is is that they're doing it in this wildly distorted environment that they themselves have created which means that they don't really know what's going to happen so my headline is things are the opposite of normal right now and if there's one party that really has no clue how this is all going to play out it is the Federal Reserve itself
