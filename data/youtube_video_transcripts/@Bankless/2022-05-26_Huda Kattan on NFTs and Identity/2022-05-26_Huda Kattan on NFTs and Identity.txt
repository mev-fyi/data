as people with an nft space like we understand the value of an nft and what it does for our identity but people still don't really necessarily understand that our identities themselves are so complex and you know it's really hard to put it into a jpeg it really is hard it's not for me like one thing or one project i get really involved i love to learn about the founders and i feel like when there's a founder they can get behind i think that kind of adds to the project as well you know i know there's like there's a concept of like the jpeg itself the image itself you know is kind of a visual identity or a visual representation of who you are there's also like you know a lot of people like the fancy projects when we at huda beauty eventually do launch at ft which we're planning on it is the first time i'm saying that out loud oh my god that's a big moment when we do do one i think v friends and yugo labs are like trailblazers for like between the utility space between the way they do air drops like just so many amazing things that i feel like you know i want to look to them when we do one and create something that provides value provides utility provides the identity you know so you get that whole trifecta of like value to the to the person who's holding it
