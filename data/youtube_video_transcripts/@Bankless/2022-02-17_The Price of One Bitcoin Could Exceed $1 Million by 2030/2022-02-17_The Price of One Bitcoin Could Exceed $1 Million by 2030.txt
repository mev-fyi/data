price of one bitcoin could exceed one million dollars by 2030. you've seen can you kind of just walk us through the slide about how this one million dollar bitcoin prediction came to be so first off if you believe that crypto broadly is a distinct asset class it's also going to affect other asset classes we've sort of uh sized the opportunity as in the next 10 years as being you know 25 fold from where it is today which would amount to about a 28 trillion dollar market cap but in the context of global equities and m2 and global bonds in real estate that's actually still only a fraction yeah and real quick i will note you've seen though that uh this 28 trillion dollar like price would be you know almost 3x gold so that in itself is fairly bold that's right that is right uh but i i'd make the argument that you know bitcoin is a 100x better version of gold it's it's more portable it's more divisible i've never considered ever buying gold uh and yet every chance i have my i buy bitcoin
