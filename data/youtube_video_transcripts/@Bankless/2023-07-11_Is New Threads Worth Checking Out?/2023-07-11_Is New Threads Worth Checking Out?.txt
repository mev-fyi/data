is threads worth checking out for me personally I'm really waiting for the web 3 Twitter replacement I'm not so excited about another centralized company so you switch from Elon to Zuckerberg like wow Twitter's been going downhill since musk bought it and then threads comes along but can it actually peel people away from Twitter I actually don't think so because it gives me Google Plus Vibes it got shut down eventually because it just didn't really do anything good as much as like Fred's has that massive head start it's literally a Twitter clone it doesn't offer anything new
