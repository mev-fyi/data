if you're saying we're in a war economy right now what is that and are we actually at War the big war is in Ukraine and we are giving weapons to Ukraine with the lend lease program we are not directly involved in that war but we're helping Ukraine via giving them stuff and that's similar to the way we helped Britain in the beginning of World War II before we got involved it's called the lendlies program again it's the same kind of thing except now it's Ukraine instead of Britain do you expect this to turn into a hotter war or is this more like a cold war type scenario that we've seen in decades past I certainly hope it does not turn into a hot War you know we have nuclear weapons we have less than we did before but we still have enough to blow up us and Russia pretty effective but a cold war struggle is still like a war you know we still have to produce a lot of stuff so that's a real conflict and of course it could turn hot and we have to prepare for that even if it doesn't happen
