welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless's darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this episode from bankless darkwear session series I'm interviewing Modi the CEO and co-founder of braavos which is one of the two main smart contract wallets in these darknet ecosystem the other one being Argent now if you understand smart contract wallets you'll know that eventually this Paradigm of externally owned a accounts which is probably the wallet that you use if you use Ledger or a metamask is not long for this world whereas 99 of wallets these days are probably externally owned accounts eventually once we crack the smart contract wallet nut 99.9 of all wallets out there will be smart contract wallets the potential that these wallets have will break your brain in terms of what they can do for the world and so I'll let your imagination run with his interview from Monty but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make these episodes possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine in crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylus initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust c c plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps feds can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 fees by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite tpy apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every layer 2 and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wallet experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to spam both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview alright bankless Nation we are here at the starkware sessions once again and I'm talking to Modi of braavos what's Bravos Bravos is uh the richest and most powerful City in all seven Kingdom but what are you working on uh so in Bravos we are working on a small contract based wallet on top of stock net taking full layer utilization on account obstruction and really want to drive ux4 to bring the next cohort of users into crypto okay so smart contract Wallet account abstraction for people that don't really know these terms uh where should we start so you can think about account abstraction and small contract based wallet as as synonyms it's not technically accurate but I think that in a high level it's accurate and think about account obstruction is something that divides your uh your wallet your account into two two parts you have the application Parts like in all normal wallets that that you know and you have the account contract on chain that can run arbitrary Logic on your transaction now every transaction the design on your application is going through the account smart contract and that's that is very powerful because we can add a custom signature verification logic and we can add custom execution logic and we can really enable functionality that that you couldn't do before on on blockchains the metaphor that I've used to explain this to people is that the the wallet that they're typically used for if they're signing with a metamask or a ledger is called an externally owned account which is another just like not helpful term to describe what's going on here but that's what it is uh and uh this is like externally owned account is like Bitcoin whereas a smart contract wallet is like ethereum but these are for wallets and so your externally owned account is kind of like a dumb input output wallet and then your smart contract wallet is like a programmable bank account it's a programmable wallet and like why is that hard to explain well because the limitations are endless and so like where do you even start uh and but um the other way I would describe this is like a smart a smart contract wallet or account abstraction is like a virtual wallet as in we have different ways of accessing this virtual wallet but the wallet itself exists inside of ethereum rather than an externally owned account comes from a private key that is external uh to to the actual uh blockchain because like a private key actually does not exist on a blockchain only the uh public address does uh do all these metaphors line up what would you add to this yes definitely definitely and maybe an interesting fact that on stock net your public key is actually not your address so since uh you can only access the stocknet blockchain through account abstraction to Smart contract accounts then you have the account smart contract address which is your account address and the public key is just a storage inside of that so the public key unlike ethereum is not uh your address and that gives you a lot of flexibility because you can use different public Keys you can add more signatures more signers into your account and that's actually what we do in in braavos okay so let's I want to unpack that a little bit you I don't have with a smart contract wallet I don't have one public address I have many no so you have one public address okay but you can have multiple signers multiple signers okay how does a signer come to be so uh if I would present what we call Bravo's account obstruction security pyramid then we can see a hierarchy of security measures that they the user like in a buffet can decide to activate so at the very bottom we have uh the notorious seed phrase that we all know and yeah don't don't love so much and that that is the externally owned aspect of this thing that's uh the seed phrase that we derived the keepers the private key and the public key right and that's that's a the corresponding of an externally owned account that we know from uh from ethereum okay but but again the the public key here is not your address right your account smart contract is your address okay and on top of that the user can add a more advanced signers that will give better ux and much much better security so one of the things that we've released uh about two three months ago is something that we call the hardware signer and and the hollow signer uses the security chip that we have in our mobile devices in order to generate keys and sign transactions and that's that's really cool because that makes Hardware wallet redundant you get the security of a hardware wallet by the device that you already have so for for people who don't know in modern phone let's say all iPhones and most advanced latest Android phones we have a dedicated security chip inside the phone which is completely isolated from the regular application processor and it's uh it's very hard to break even if your phone get hacked your phone gets rooted a hack an attacker won't have access to to the keys that resides in this security chip and we utilize that together with the power of account obstruction in order to generate keys and to sign your your transactions now I think that the the cool thing is you can ask why why no blockchain has done that before like it's uh you know if it's so secure and uh and it's it's very easy in terms of a few weeks because you sign transactions like you use Apple pay or Google pay uh uh so the the reason that no blockchain has done that before at least no popular blockchain and it can be done not on ethereum not on bitcoin not even on stocknet itself is because the security scheme that we have in this mobile chip is not compatible with a signature scheme that we have on blockchain and this is just like the Ed's ecsa signature scheme it just doesn't work in the chip it's just like incompatible exactly it's incompatible but since we have a count abstraction and we have arbitrary verification logic then we can code the the signature verification logic that we want and that's exactly what we did we coded the verification logic that is corresponding with uh with the security chip that we have in our phones and that gives you gives you a very high level of uh of security actually it gives you two-factor authentication if you think about that sense the keys are generated within this secure Enclave within the secure chip they are unknown the Privacy is unknown to anyone it is unknown to the to the application it is unknown to the operating system it is unknown to the user so the user doesn't have the private key so it's binded to the device and uh the other thing is that it's a 10 you authenticate transactions only using your biometric so either your face ID or your touch ID and also you know biometric authentication Works directly with the security chip so again even if your device gets hacked and an attacker get roots on your device they cannot steal your keys and they cannot sign transactions for you so I call it that's a great combination of um I say ux and security because from user point of view it is seamless it is frictionless you sign transaction the same way that you use Apple pay and Google pay but under the hood you get the strongest level of security and you also just give users assurances because it's they're signing as transaction going through the same process that they're already familiar with on their phone and so like I pay you with Apple pay all the time I go through the New York subway I use Apple pay I pay for my coffee with Apple pay and like making transaction signing also with that same like oh like there's a smiley face and just gave me the checks the the thumbs up that feels good to me as a normal consumer it's just like this is is a process that I'm familiar with exactly it's completely frictionless if you dry it when you try it you will see that it is exactly like you pay for uh a ticket on the subway and it's the the ux that of course we need uh to actually have uh you know adoption at Grand scales and so I remember um uh long time bank listeners might remember the burner wallet where you just like log into like uh xdi.org or something and then boom you have a wallet like that automatic process is is kind of that ux that we really need in order to be able to put private keys in people's hands yeah I want to ask you about like signers so we have this virtual wallet it's got a it's got a contract address and that is our wallet but there can be multiple signers who can access that wallet yeah can we can you unpack that a little bit how does that work yeah so for example we we've added the hardware signer which is a an addition on signing on top of the seed signer on top of the key that is derived from the seed and and once we added the Halo signer uh the c-signer doesn't do anything meaning even if an attacker uh stole your seed software or whatever they cannot issue a transaction on behalf of your account the only thing that they can do is they can issue a transaction with a time delay to remove the hardware signer and the reason that we support that is if your device gets stolen or if your device gets tricked we still want you to be able to gain control back of your account but for for an attacker uh they will need to weigh this time delay period and in this time you will understand that someone stole your seat and you can move your funds to a secure place so is it the seed signer is that like the the master account as in the place where the smart contract wall is incepted from yes I I call it this and that's why it's at the base of the pyramid right yes I call it a soft Master a soft Master right yes a soft Master because once the Hubble signer is enabled the hardware signer is like the master the sign again because we consider it to be fully secure the hollow sign-on can run over anything that The Siege phrases is trying to do but that's not all so a hardware signer is is as we said extremely secure and a great combination of ux and security but let's say that you have uh uh a lot of money in your uh in your account and you want to be extra secure and you normally you don't use this account on a daily basis but this is like your huddling account so we allow you to add a second signer which means that you will have the Hubble assigner as well as an additional signer and you will need two signatures right in order to execute a transaction on chain and we call it the this is on the top of the pyramid this is the multi Hardware signer so for example you will sign a transaction on your browser extension Bravos Bravos extension and then it will automatically redirects you to your brother's Mobile wallet and you sign there and only once both transactions are signed then the transaction will actually executed will be executed on chain and so this is an example of the expressivity of smart contract wallets or virtual wallets and uh and so we have this seed phrase signer which is where the smart contract wallet originates from it is the private key that creates the whole thing in the first place but then once that and that's like the what you call the soft Master but you can actually create a smart contract wallet using that soft Master but then that smart contract wallet can revoke permissions from the originating seed phrase which is why we call it soft as in like we've taken away the power of the thing that created it and then you can add on a second signer and say well this new account has these new these permissions and actually those new permissions can be greater than the power of the account that made it in the first place the soft master and then you can start to add in a third device or a fourth device and each one of these uh X like um signers can have rules or arbitrary rules applied to them and this is what you're talking about again at the top of the pyramid we have a hardware multi-signer which in parentheses 3fa as in three Factor authentication as in certain rules that need multiple signers in order to sign off on in order to execute something yeah so these are all examples of like this virtual wallet the smart contract wallet that can have arbitrary rules about external signers and that can be anything yes and and more than that I want to emphasize two things one an account can be born can be deployed on chain already within a hardware signer built in so uh none of the transaction will be signed by the seed phrase key in no time so so that's that's uh that's one thing that I think is is very interesting and more than that the second thing that that we can do is uh not uh having these functionalities on separate accounts we can have them according to your transaction value or to your daily limit that you want to set so for example let's say that you have a threshold of 100 you say one hundred dollars I don't care which sign are signs uh up to uh one thousand dollars I want the harbor signer above one thousand dollars a day I want to have uh two signers so I want to have three Factor authentication I want to be authenticated or something I know something I am and something I have and this is why this is like a programmable bank account like what do you want because any input can become a rule into this virtual virtual wall it's virtual bank account that we've created how far can this really go can this go to the point of like um something of a rule of like anyone that has a particular nft in their wallet can execute some particular rule inside of my smart contract wallet and so like maybe I have a smart contract wallet and if you have a crypto dick butt nft I'll allow you to do something in my wallet whatever that may be is that possible exactly so the cool thing about smart contract based wallet and account obstruction is that you can have an arbitrary Logic on any transaction so whatever you can imagine we can code and it can be implemented and that's really like taking I think the uh the crypto user experience to to the next level both in terms of functionality but I think more important in terms of in terms of Simplicity we want to reduce the burden uh from user shoulders about taking care of their keys and taking care of not making even a single error uh and all their uh the funds are gone Etc and a smart contract based wallets like Bravos really enabled us to do that yeah and I really want to impress this upon listeners that like this is a Bitcoin to ethereum moment for the wallet world where like imagine if crypto was just Bitcoin it would be much less expressive and with much less applications that are possible and that same thing is true with the smart contract wallet world this is goes from just having dumb input output wallets uh to having very expressive wallets that can literally do anything and so the use cases that come out of this world are literally infinite exactly that's a great great analogy and my belief is all wallets going forward will be small contract based right the incumbents today will transform to be small contract based and certainly new wallets will be small Concord based because the the level of uh functionality and ux that it enables it it's an order of magnitude better yeah and just to really drive this point home uh let's imagine that you the user of a smart contract wallet you're at home and you need to send a very large transaction oh like almost all of your money and perhaps you have three signers and so you're on your desktop computer because that's where we mostly do our stuff and you process the transaction and then a message shows up on your phone saying like oh this is a large transfer you need your phone to also sign off on this so then you press approve on your phone and then your mom calls you and says oh son like I just got this message to send all of this money from your wallet to another wallet is this you and you're like yeah that's me and then your mom also says yeah yes because it was so large that you needed an external like reference point and like you could go off into the details about how far this goes but the cool thing is is that these are all devices and so it's really the device that is the unique signer no longer just like a unique private key exactly I think that's pretty cool exactly and that's a very good point because when we add a second sign and we don't add a second seed right we want to get rid of the seat for the long run we don't want any seed so when we add a second signer there's still only one seed for the account so the users still need to handle only one seat and in the future even that uh would be redundant right and so like when users write down their seed phrase they might notice that in their Ledger or metamask you can keep on making new accounts over and over and over again and so one C phrase generates an infinite number of accounts and these like new accounts are like Diners right that's what they are yeah and and also in Bravo so in Bravos you can also create multiple accounts so you can have like an account for your daily transactions and you can have your holding account out and you can have I don't know your nft account and you can set different level of security to each and every account you can put on on one account the hardware signer and the other account and the multi-signer and on the third account you can just stay with the scene so there's a conversation pivoting here a little bit about ZK Roll-Ups and smart contract wallets there's a particular Synergy behind the world of ZK layer twos and smart contract wallets can you unpack that Center why does that Synergy exist what's so special about the relationship between smart contract Wallace and ZK Roll-Ups so if we take stockings as an example stocknet has two very important features the first feature is that it has or at least will have very low gas fees and this is important because all this logic that we are talking uh talking about is very heavy in terms of compute for example to implement this elliptic curve of the mobile chipset are initial and naive implementation was 400 000 steps 400 000 kyber steps Cairo is the programming language that we use on stocknet like solidity on on ethereum and that's that's a that's a lot today we released uh an improvement of that that reduces 40 the number of steps so 250 240 000 steps but still a lot so we need very low compute uh gas price in order for that to make uh to be economically viable because we want people to use that not only for transferring millions of dollars but also you know when you when you use the subway and to do this together with a Improvement that startnet will issue in direct next version rolling out in two weeks we will have a sense of difference between using the auto signer and using like a a regular signer so that's one thing the gas phase and the second thing is that on stock net we have a count abstraction built into the protocol meaning every transaction must go through an account before it interacts with other contracts on chain before it goes to an amm to an nft Marketplace to whatever and that's extremely powerful because then we can enforce all these signer and all this logic that we talked about so getting into Bravos more specifically uh other bank list listeners might be familiar with Argent uh Bravos also built on the starknet starkware ecosystems uh what are you really leaning into at Bravos like what are your first applications that you're trying to get integrated into your guys's wallet so so first of all all the the the security aspects that we uh that we've just discussed in the past 20 minutes the idea is to uh to make user onboarding as friction as as possible and as secure as possible as I said to remove the burden from the user's shoulders to take care of security Etc to be in a position that they need to order how the wallet pay for that learn how to use that store another seed phrase right it's like very difficult even to for technical people certainly for uh for Mass market so that's one thing the entire aspect around making your wallet making your account like a traditional bank but a decentralized self-custodial bank that is completely controlled by you with a great ux so that's one and the second thing is the entire aspect of D5 so today in Bravos we already have exchange integrated into the wallet so users don't need to go to outside apps in order to exchange funds The Next Step will be to have I call it one click earn yield so we will be able to earn yield on your assets in the wallet whether it's on stock net or under the hood automatically bridge to the ethereum brace layer and for example stake your heat on in rocket pool or in Lido and uh and Aaron yield and going even forward uh enabling borrowing and Landing also from within the wallet so the goal is that everyday users users that are not crypto Savvy will get the full experience of crypto right at the fingertips with like two taps so if anyone in the bankless nation listening to this be it uh so maybe they're a developer or maybe they're just a user trying to get their hands on on their wallet uh who are you guys really looking for to to engage with like what relationships are you guys looking for AT braavos and How might people get started learning more so first of all uh you are welcome to our website and to our Twitter account we share a lot of information there uh there is a lot of detailed technical kind of blog posts about the Hubble signer and why is it secure and how the keys are actually being generated in in manufacturing process of the Silicon etc etc so that's one thing we have a very vibrant Discord community that people are welcome uh to join I think for us there is a lot of things that in terms of the user journey and the overall ux that we can solve one thing that is really bothers me is uh the on-ramp of uh of Fiat money uh to to crypto I think uh we as an industry need to find ways to make it much more uh much easier much more simple it shouldn't take like half an hour with all sorts of IDs and pictures and proof of address Etc Etc so today on on Brothers we support several on-ramp mechanism from credit card from a direct bank transfer from centralized exchange you can transfer directly to your to your wallet and of course Bridge from from other chains but I think that this point is still with very high friction and anyone that works on interesting stuff in that area will be will be great to cooperate amazing well thank you so much for helping me walk through the the world of account extraction and Hardware walls cheers thank you cheers foreign [Music]
