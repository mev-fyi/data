[Music] hey everyone a quick note before we dive into this episode this is the last interview we will be airing from my time in puerto rico earlier this year we will have the documentary about my trip to puerto rico and really what's happening in the nft and crypto art scene there coming out very soon uh and in the meantime i hope you enjoyed this conversation with rob nelson rob has had a long career in media he's a graduate of stanford law school done a number of different things and now is a co-founder at roundtable which is a puerto rican-based media company that's really trying to be a bridge in this time when news feels very polarizing and very fragmented they really want to bring all voices together in conversation hence roundtable they also have a significant crypto nft metaverse vertical it's something they're very focused on so rob and i talk about the crypto nft scene in puerto rico as well as really the crypto and nft scene generally and i think there'll be a lot of value to be had from this conversation even though it was recorded back in february so not every reference not every reference might not be perfectly up to date but a lot of evergreen nuggets came out of this conversation and as always i have to give a huge thanks to metamask for sponsoring this content sponsoring the trip to puerto rico and the content that's coming out of there really really

of your quick background and really what you're doing here in puerto rico um so my quick background is i am i came out of a traditional television background i had a show on fox news but i'm an independent just want to be clear had a show on regular fox i've done shows with most of the big networks um radio and um digital became more and more compelling to me as a way to start having the problem with traditional media is it's very in a box corporate media cnn fox news very boxed right it doesn't matter who's got their narratives and the way it's structured it's hyper centralized you know we say what goes out we say what's done and all of that just seemed like it wasn't creating a real engagement that we've created by definition with how social media works and all that we have this we have the tech and the space to do it well we're not utilizing it at for more media for news content or any media and so that's what excited me about kind of moving in more into this to this space this technology to do it in combining um two cool worlds um roundtable media which i'm the executive producer and and ho anchor host of roundtable is a decentralized media platform well not not in the sense of not in the sense of decentralized blockchain decentralized meaning in the sense of media decentralized so explain what that means well cnn fox news msnbc doesn't matter everything runs through essential hub that central hub decides who gets to say what when they get to say it which is totally the opposite right of say a social platform where everybody can say whatever they want right roundtable is what we call a curated publishing platform we invite channels into the universe and they become a channel partner with us so you know to be invited in so you can be told crazy but once you're in it's your content it's you're free to do and say what you want in in the universe and i'll bring people together to have great roundtable conversations but you're your own entity i'm not saying what you can and can't say we're not letting that on we're not publishing that we're not going with that story today we're going with that story it's a much different model and it's much closer and organic and it allows you to bring a lot of different voices into a conversation and let them also just keep having their own voices if you're on santa fox news you can have your voice on the thing but then on the side nobody sees what you're doing because it network didn't want to put it on so that's what i mean by that and we've created two verticals one in news and causes again to bring all sides all viewpoints uncensored unbiased you know open for conversation and also in the crypto blockchain space which is more unique in that that's a new space in media that i think desperately wants and needs to have a universe of conversations that are really percolating in a vast expanding space and when did you first come to puerto rico and decide to set up this whole amazing ecosystem here right so i didn't you know wasn't personally me just coming to do this obviously we have an amazing you know team of founding partners um james heckman brock pierce david bailey um you know all hyper successful in the in the media technology crypto space um and uh and so roundtable fish was official last june and the plan was to come to to to base it in puerto rico were you already here no was brock already here yes okay i came you know as sort of a co-founding member of the early team to get this going and uh i've been here for like four months you know basically okay so you're one of the transplants yes so so go ahead no i was gonna say part of well go i'm guessing like people always say why puerto rico sure yeah i mean and and did 60 play a part so for me the reason why puerto rico was well again i think what people don't understand about puerto rico and the blockchain crypto space is it's it is an incubator of so much in the blockchain space it is truly i was in law school in in the mid to late 90s in silicon valley at stanford where all this was happening with the internet and you know the last renditions of the web and it was it's very much like that here it's very much like you have all these people who have so much knowledge and insight and information about the about the world and whether some of them originally came because of x60 or not it started this percolation of people the ogs to the new to all wanting to figure this space out and when you get that cluster just like in silicon valley it starts creating this amazing synergy and and there's a few places around the country where i think that's really happening and puerto rico is one of them miami's another new york um you know where you're seeing this concentration in the u.s right dubai as well of that kind of thing and it does something it just creates something that then starts creating more and so from the outside people like well why puerto rico and you're like well you could have said that about silicon valley why silicon valley it wasn't like someone picked silicon valley and put a thing in it it was like started happening there were all kinds of reasons why that space allowed it to percolate once it starts percolating takes a life of its own and it seems like it's both transplants coming in and some of that is act 60 to your point some of it maybe other things and then you also have a population here who was born here and grew up here who are also taken to this tremendously and super involved so you actually do have those two forces working together yes in concert can you put a finger on like why puerto rico was such a good spark for is there something about the culture here that that kind of makes it combust like that in a really positive way i mean i think there might be a number of reasons i'm not gonna pretend like i you know know the reasons that everybody thinks of doing something i i honestly think a big part of it is that it's it sort of started happening the thing that's a little different about blockchain crypto say maybe then the internet and then you know web world and tech as we were all that now became our things we all use on every day in the 90s late 90s early 2000s and say the silicon valley thing is that the axis you know you need capital you need creators you need technologists you need that all together silicon valley that started happening it started happening here and to some extent i think it's almost like it becomes it creates itself right you know does that make sense there is something about puerto rico that i think or i think there is something here that feels like this spark of like innovation freedom go for it you know puerto rico is sort of unique in how it sits with the rest of the us having been kind of mistreated by the main thing and steal people people ask me oh are there drug stores you know emily what do you think drug stores i guess there's a 24 hour cbs across from a 24-hour walgreens like you know but i do think there's a sort of an independent like fiery-ness yeah that percolates for for creativity but that said you've also got a lot of the kinds of people who started to come here now more want to come here because you see it you so you want to be where it is the one caveat i will say is in in blockchain you're allowed it's odd in that it's actually you can have a lot of the decentralized nature of it coming from a lot of places but it doesn't mean you don't still get hubs you know we did the the puerto rico we had the puerto rico blockchain week you know and i i was amazed at all the incredible people that were here and that came here and the conversation kept being about you know that puerto rico is such an incredibly interesting place to to for this one of the spots for this to emerge and it's like geyser of activity a geyser interesting is it feels it makes a certain amount of sense because i've been here and learned more about it i know you have some really strong technical institutes and so there's like you know people coming out with engineering degrees that are super technically strong and then you have obviously such an incredible art culture and there's the murals and of the artists so when you're talking about an industry and nfts in particular maybe more than like d5 call it right like you need the technical you need the kind of creative art side and then you add in some tax incentives it's like the perfect kind of pot to blend it all up yes with a little bit of uh a little bit of a revolutionary mindset that i think undercuts underlies in puerto rico so there's a little of that like it's a kind of place where you're like it and it's obviously a beautiful place and it's creative and inspiring you feel it when you're here but it has a little bit of that let's go do this let's go shake the world up yeah a block away yeah you know and and and even even the way puerto ricans protest you know this is a protest for teachers yeah um and and uh even the way like you notice i compare difference between say u.s protests which you know people marching and holding their scientists a little angry and all protests have that passion but in puerto rico the protests almost have like there's a sort of a musicalness to it they got drum beating you know and then chanting and the whole thing right even that it's like more artistic it has a little bit of a like wow this is going you know um so i think that energy is a big is is a big part of it and i think well let's talk nft space because i think that's an example where you're really right that creativity and that artistic community and that culture and and i do want to mention why i also think there's a real connection a real unique thing when it comes to what the blockchain space can do in a place like puerto rico so i want to ask you about that i do want to ask have there been protests as we're on this topic of protest around act 60 and around yes they're they're crypto they're they're happy and and you know they they and my big answer on that is you know there's a legitimate discussion to have about how anything works right and you know they're always you know i don't call it bad actors but sure they're people who just want to make who just want to come make money and get rich and not pay taxes and leave but what you find when you look at the core of i see that people the ogs if you will there's a real sense of like creating value yeah creating value and wealth creation that benefits everybody you know the number of of really innovative leaders in this space that i have heard say genuinely like in a private conversation you know what we can do what we can do in this space as we create wealth is how much we can create change social change political change economic change that's not just like a buzzword for these people for it's it's how do we do that it's built into the nature of the crypto universe so what's your take revolution how how what do you see web 3 being able to do in puerto rico what is like the yeah what what is the whole so i think one of the unique things about blockchain is typically if you look whenever a new industry of any kind emerges it's good for the economy on the face of it right silicon valley just great stuff for the economy right yeah bring a sports team into a city and they argue we should get all these benefits for our stadium and you should all pay for it because we're going to bring so many jobs and crazy right the whole amazon thing you know when amazon's going to be in new york later or whatever yeah you know it's like how many jobs how much right that's all great it's important you build an industry it creates jobs and that's important to a community right roundtable we're really committed to being part of the puerto rican community hiring puerto ricans you know i know amazing programs going on to train people in in the new tech and the coding for the blockchain there's some amazing things and some of those are silicon valley people who came and are like you know this guy is an amazing program to train coders and they pay for it you know like they pay you pay them back after you get your education and you have your job if you make the money right and it's like you learn a skill that's really needed and you create wealth in a community but there's a difference between that which is traditional and what i think the blockchain space offers and this is the thing i think a lot of people don't necessarily see which is the one difference is creating a job in silicon valley you're creating a job with amazon someone gets a paycheck the economy does well with blockchain you have the ability to create wealth that generates wealth for the people you're creating for so it's not just i gave you a job it's we gave you a means to actually be a wealth generator to generate wealth you know and that's where you look at a community and not just puerto rico when you look at a lot of countries say in latin america a lot of countries where there's a lot of unbanked people you can actually blockchain technologies will and allow for you to actually let the people of that community become stakeholders become wealth generators so they can actually earn income from that it's not just you can invest or have a job you can become an income earner as part of that token and it's the beauty of how blockchain wealth can spread so it's a unique kind of wealth generator we've never had how much of that makes sense yeah i think it totally does but i want to drill down how much of that ability to become like an income earner off a token right i'm seeing that i'm talking to people here who are artists who are experiencing great i want to talk about it with ours because it's a great example and it's amazing how much of that is there's a lot of opportunity right now because we're so early and so if you get in early enough there's more opportunity and how much do you think that really will persist over the maturation of blockchain listen i again there are people who are far more expert at this than me right i get the gift of being able to interview a lot of really smart people and have really great conversations bringing them together it has the potential to be absolutely transformative it is not it is not a closed i sometimes like say blockchain can redefine capitalism it doesn't it's not a it's not a closed end thing it's not a limited pool oh you got an early too bad for everybody else it's a continual wealth generator as long as people keep seeing and adding the value to something it keeps going so you create more and more wealth in the process right you know example like packet you know decentralizing broadband you know everyone's got their broadband you know they're paying the provider remember the internet was going to be free yeah but now you have to pay because you got to pay someone to get on it what about all that unused bandwidth space all that space you have well if you could mine that and share it and sell it you'd make money and someone else would get the bandwidth right there's everybody needs bandwidth the ability to build a community and spread that just keeps growing it's not a ponzi scheme where it runs out it just keeps growing it just keeps spreading and in the process you bring broadband to people who don't have it you bring income to people who are sharing broadband in their community in a in a less developed country and creating that and creating that wealth you're creating stakeholders of wealth and it just keeps going and there's endless possibilities that's why i think people who are in the space in these communities see the power it can do say to a community or a culture or even for artists to like create but for old communities to to value a culture and and create wealth aggregation running one of the things i love about some of the nft conversations is the idea that you could take you could have a token that could actually give back to the culture the community of that original culture to make revenue from it versus just someone selling t-shirts i mean i love it that's obviously like the the great white hope for any of us who are like in this space is like and you know why i'm here because i want to talk about how that's happening one thing that i thought was interesting let me wait before we ask that let me ask you something as someone looking at the space yeah right do you does that did you come in and you do a popular podcast on it do you hear do you see do feel like most people in the artistic space are starting to understand how you could like a better word you can mint the art meant the culture you can create that value do they see that i i think people are i think the the concern i have is i see artists who don't know about who don't know and much about blockchain right they and they see the nft space and they're like cool i can become a millionaire right like they look at the headlines and it's like no this is still an industry like any other it requires a lot of work to build a name for yourself there are still gatekeepers and i think right now it's easier than it's ever going to be because it's only going to get more saturated so that's why i ask about that that long tail of this because i think it's like it's like social media like in the early days of social media people who were using it well could get traction really easily now there are so many people out on social media so it's harder right it's still doable but it just means you have to get more creative it evolves in terms of how to make a name for yourself using the platform and using the technology and i think that's what will happen with nfts is like it'll get harder as it gets more saturated to differentiate yourself and it's totally doable and it's amazing technology that some people who couldn't monetize their work before will manage to leverage in a totally new way that they couldn't have done previously it's still a win but it's not a silver bullet or a magic bullet no matter what will make money so i think that's a great way to sort of see it what i in my head the way i look at it is you might have had this conversation in 1997 or 98 or 99 around what they called netcommerce you know well some people will some people will be able to and some people will never use it because you know mom and pop shops aren't going to go because everyone had to be more coded and everything you had to be more of a techie to do it right cut to today nobody goes well you know there's a limit on how much people can make you know using online commerce there's really no limit you have to have a good idea but everybody's got there there is no such thing the middle of the million an antarctican someone's probably got there like airbnb online for the for the true adventurer come here you know it's like you don't go oh well you know that space is full yeah and i think the problem is we're not quite there yet where the technology it's still more early adopter yeah it's still more a little tech heavy but we're going to see a point in in the not too distant future where that technology has been more integrated and the apps and the on-ramps and the things are there that make it far easier easier access just like now on your phone you don't think about it you don't think about your web address you don't think about your email address but people did in the late 90s and once that starts happening and i think really smart people in this space have told me it is happening at twice the speed of what was happening in the 90s we are moving fast once that happens those technologies become more easily adoptable it's built into your phone all that stuff's there and then you're right you know you still have not everybody can necessarily succeed but it's not like it's a limited pool anymore the internet was absolutely and i think you know we're so early that you can't necessarily even see what's going to evolve from this like you know i've seen people give the the examples of like when the car was invented we didn't anticipate like rental car industries and insurance like we didn't it just made all the ancillary industries that get built and there's probably an even more technologically you know advanced uh you know analogy to give there and so i think it is absolutely like that and i think what will inevitably happen is the cynics will say you're like well look it didn't you know suddenly make everyone rich and it didn't pull every country that's in poverty out of poverty and da da da da and and somehow use that as a way to discount the fact that there are all these people who were in poverty who now aren't only because of this or you know the fact that every artist isn't selling their work right now as an nft somehow discounts the fact that you have artists and i've spoken with them here who are like i couldn't make it in the gallery industry i wasn't getting you know i couldn't monetize my work as a digital only artist and now i suddenly can and like instead of focusing on how incredible it is that anybody is able to now live their life more authentically there's a focus on the fact that not everyone is very and so this is cool phenomenon that's somehow this is cool because i wanted to i want to address that for a second in the in the nft space okay and but but the the piece into that for me you mentioned you know now everybody's a content creator you know right on social media whatever i i worked and you know had my first big jobs when you had to go through gatekeepers yeah and get on fox by having a great idea that a lot of people were looking at you got them because an executive who you convinced and maybe you were super talented and smart but you got lucky in that sense you had to squeeze through the narrow gateway and only this many get on and by the way we decide whether to pull you maybe you how many great shows had critical reviews or audiences loved it and they cancel it right nothing you can do you can beg plea please give me back the difference that happened in the content creation space was yes everybody and their brother and sister and neighbor can make a show and maybe you'll only have 100 followers but by taking away the gatekeepers you create an endless number of possibilities as you said for people to go yeah wait i have an interesting idea and if that idea really is cool and interesting enough and it has value to people it works and you don't need anyone's permission i think in the nft space we're seeing that potential and i love your point like how many artists how many and that's just art like publishing writing songs how many people in the space struggle have always struggled making very little super talent some get lucky some are you know boom and the rest don't right this space creates a way to truly create a much broader monetization not everyone's going to be ultra rich but to have your work valued and actually be able to live as an artist that doesn't exist yeah and even to have the gratification like you know an artist i spoke with who was like you know he it's a shot to your self-esteem when a gallery won't take your work or you know you've got these gatekeepers who basically have determined that whatever you're not up to their standards this and that and then you take it to the public and you go wide with it and you make it at nft and you say and suddenly you're getting that validation like no there is an entire group of people that resonates with this for me or you know resonates with my art and like you know i think even from that standpoint it's your point like you may not become a millionaire but like that in and of itself is like a beautiful thing and social media did that in some ways to your point with shows or with with people who had ideas and opinions that fox didn't want to put on the air or cnn didn't want to you know give a show to and now they have a tick tock following or they have an instagram yeah or look at you have a podcast this is the page you did this right totally i think you would have made it through the little narrow gatekeeper maybe one in a million shots but it was more even it was like even forget it also just being in this industry and this is partly the early thing right like the opportunity i'm in puerto rico right now talking to you talking to all these people because you know because this industry it partly is nascent but also like have this this awesome community that like have the community has determined there's value in it and cnn probably certainly doesn't think there's value i think that is the key when you say the communities term value one thing that i think is so essential to understanding you know the blockchain crypto space is the community side you know one of the big a big o.g going way back to the early days the bitcoin began you know beginnings right he said to me he said you know what he's like and he says it publicly if your goal is just to get in come to puerto rico get into crypto and get rich and you could apply this to anyone not just in puerto rico you're missing the point now you may get lucky and make money but the point of the crypto blockchain space has always been about creating community and creating change wealth aggregation more independence more freedom more autonomy right that's a part of it and you shouldn't decouple them and people who are super successful will say don't you decouple those at your own long-term success risk because without community it doesn't work with community there's endless value yeah there's endless value so to the space of like say publishing that's a really good example if you publish a book right now you either get used to get a big publisher if you don't get the big publisher you self-publish yep okay and the whole joke yourself publishing is yeah watch out it's self-publishing what's your distribution anybody can self-publish a book now so it means nothing look i put my book on and it became a best-seller in four hours on amazon it was like whatever right and and i've heard people say right is you're publishing a book self-publishing so nobody cares nobody knows this and i've heard people argue well because nft the nft space is creating a way to create self-published books not just music and and artwork yeah and people say yeah but nope you know you're not gonna be able to get mass distribution that way and you said something really important you said community it's like you don't need everyone in the world to know about your book or to buy your art you need a community that values it so if you have a community that cares about your art cares about your book cares about your topic that's all you need you don't have to be the world's number one bestseller maybe your ego wants that you can make money and build and thrive in niche communities and blockchain crypto creates the ability for endless number of niche communities you've got a community of that values it you're in and good totally and this is why the gatekeeper concept is so absurd on the face of it right that you're going to have like a handful of people who are going to represent a very specific like narrow set of their own interests determining what everyone's interest would be i mean you know that we saw that fracture with social media and i think this is just you know that fracturing on steroids in terms of the way to monetize it for individual creators and and new avenues by which to build those communities how long have you had your podcast uh since uh late october early november right yeah right and would you say you're doing pretty well so much better than i could ever right now let's back it up ten years and you're gonna do a show and you're gonna pitch who you're gonna pitch some big podcast some big platform yeah and they say no no one's gonna want that show who knows cares right nothing you can do right you start you quit you have a good idea suddenly it's gaining traction right you are living proof of how that works and you don't need the whole world to know and then now people will sponsor you and support you and people want in you're building it the same way and that's the beauty of it yeah and like she's gonna be able to do the same thing but the difference with kids i think is they're gonna grow up little kids are gonna grow up in a world where this technology is like like a 15 year old today with you know it's so omnipresent it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna be different they're gonna not think of this as a weird space that they don't understand what do you mean and what's an nft wait what's a crypto it's gonna be yeah what do you mean get my phone out here i i made you know it's gonna be so organic to them okay we are we have to wrap so i'm gonna ask one final question which is are you planning on staying in puerto rico that's a pretty question okay so in five ten years like what do you think this will be like as it pertains to web3 what do you hope it looks like with web3 is it is it the silicon valley of web 3 where does this end up yes so i think the answer to that is there may be a couple silicon valleys of web 3. and that is a little different and again as i was saying before that partly has to do with the nature of how silicon valley required you to have people in a place the developers the the potential to finance you know to fund the capital all that blockchain allows a lot more of it to happen all right remote fall over decentralized right that doesn't mean you won't have concentrations though because the concentration still exists where like ideas brain trusts creativity tend to it's just the nature we're human beings we engage by what's around us puerto rico i i really believe you guys that has is perfectly poised to be one of those silicon valleys like i said miami miami's fighting for it too miami's doing it all right right new york's going we want in la's like lost a little bit on that process but who knows so yes i think you're going to see it blossom and emerge in puerto rico won't be the only one yeah like i said dubai you're gonna place this out you're gonna see this revolution of creativity and technological change and social political economic change happening everywhere but i think puerto rico is going to be it's already becoming a hub of it there's you know there is a unique amount of energy and creativity and technology and capital flowing here and it's going to keep percolating and it's going to benefit the puerto rican community i just want to be clear not just because they get an aside benefit from oh there's more jobs or tourism or hotels or whatever because they become part it's a it is in a way a perfect place because there are economic development challenges here to create that i had a great conversation with a member of the mayor's cabinet of san juan and talking and he came out of the hood and talking about wanting to see how we could bring these training tech these things into schools that are more remote you know and start giving these kids for financial literacy in the blockchain space and that's going to happen and as you start creating that developing that and educating and training every last thought on this the number of uber drivers i talked to in sam in san juan who will ask me will the mind blow blockchain or crypto like you know i've gotten into crypto and and they're doing it they see it as a way to start creating another income stream that they control and own and it's not like once in a while it happens all the time and that's the difference excites me about that is it reminds me i worked in politics you and i both worked in politics and i was in iowa for the presidential campaign and it was like the amount of like kind of political literacy and like election illiteracy in iowa is so high because they're this early state and so it's just imbued in the culture there and i think you're starting to feel that here in puerto rico which is that you know everybody is sort of aware of crypto in a way that you don't see everywhere else because it's becoming sort of a cultural industry and an industry that's important here in the on the island which is exciting and that does mean everybody talking working together bringing it together right it is a process i truly believe there is a real commitment certainly on the part of round table like to beat that bridge to be part of building that bridge that really does involve and engage and create that value wealth for puerto ricans you know and that that becomes their wealth and it's going to happen in all kinds of especially like places we have a lot of unbanked people not i'm saying here around the world um you know it really will happen and it will take everybody coming together and working and that's why i think roundtable is here and why it's so cool because we are going to be part of that collective process of creating that and it's i think it's going to end up being a pretty beautiful story awesome well we'll come back to track the aftermath of the story call it or as it further unfolds um awesome well thank you rob i really appreciate it this is awesome [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced
