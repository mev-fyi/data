let's talk uh china david so okay china yeah sad face okay this this is um i guess stuff getting real in china and we've had bands before this time maybe it's different we had uh sahil on the podcast if you guys missed that earlier this week go check out our state of the nation with sawhill where we cover this in depth but what's the the high level take here what are they banning what does this mean for us yeah so what are they banning is a little bit kind of up in the air i think um it's more related to actual businesses so if you hel are helping facilitate crypto transactions then uh that's bad uh but i there there's um a little bit of speculation that simply holding crypto and owning crypto is still okay it's gonna be one of those things where we're just gonna have to find out after the fact um chinese regulators they kind of get to do whatever they want right and so they will interpret their own laws in ways that will benefit them by their choosing but as far as being a business in china you are shutting down basically is what's going going on and not only are businesses inside of china but businesses that are serving chinese customers are also restricting access to their platforms to chinese customers so we've seen mining pools not allow chinese miners we see exchanges that are based in china with a lot of chinese customers have extreme outflows and this is why we know that this ban is real because we are actually seeing on-chain verifiable data and decisions being made by companies that are in china or relating to chinese customers actually change their policies so it's kind of like the easiest tell ever to figure out oh yeah this one's actually real yeah uh huobi which is a large uh exchange based in china they are getting rid of if you're if you're a chinese citizen and you're on huobi you have to exit you have to leave right they're they're blocking them all from their platform that's going to phase out also you mentioned outflows david there was a coinbase chart that just showed like ethan bitcoin outflows from huobi um on like over the last few months but then on on the on the um the news of this and it was just like this single red spike down yeah right actually exit all chinese exchanges largest largest decrease ever now to some of your thoughts earlier as we were talking about maybe some of this is going to end up in d5 like this capital has got to go somewhere and china's just squeezing the bloom they're squeezing it outside of their borders outside of their regulated exchanges seems like a short-sighted move but it's going somewhere else maybe it's going to d5 maybe it's going to us exchanges maybe it's going to the binances of the world but they don't want it in their jurisdiction this is also something that i noticed this week david is they blocked coin gecko coin market cap and trading view it's all blocked in china now so great firewall of course you can vpn around that i guess right but this is uh now more censorship of d5 maybe a direct attack on d5 and crypto to make these uh these websites blocked in in china it's the first time they've been blocked ever hey as we all know you actually can't ban crypto you can only ban your own citizens from touching crypto uh and so crypto it's still actually in china it's just now illegal for you as a chinese citizen to actually touch it and there that's an important distinction and an important takeaway i mean how much can china they've already banned video games apparently uh so like how much is trying to actually get a ban before their their citizens are just fed up with it uh i mean it's china so the answer is like a lot but there's a tipping point somewhere yeah absolutely and i i think they're just going to you you know this many citizens are just going to not listen right they'll just um they'll just find other avenues and ways of doing this and move capital the way they want to there's speculation that all of this uh demand out of all these chinese exchanges to trade and speculate and do exchange things has gone from these chinese exchanges to duidx to a trustless defy exchange which operates on a similar performance level because of the layer two as the exchanges that they are fleeing from and so i think the big takeaway here is that when a nation state like china comes and bans crypto where do they go they don't go to another alternative like more western centralized exchange they go to d5 right because they just got quote unquote censored and so they're not going to go on to another sensorable platform they're going to go on to a defy platform and so there's an article here out of cointelegraph that says the dydx token gains 80 in a week what's driving the decks token rally and their their subline is traders raised their bids for the decentralized exchange token believing as it would benefit from china's decision to classify all crypto transactions as illegal and so there's speculation that people are moving on to dydx in order to escape china which just makes sense like go on to the censorship resistant platform after you get censored by your nation state that's what they're for well yeah there's there's sort of a crypto narrative for you it's like china ban equals bullish for defy bullish ban that could be what's happening uh love that man love that i i think that could be what's happening hey we
