we're still here welcome to bankless where we explore the Frontier internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more Bagless guys crypto skeptic take today just some context for the episode you're about to hear we have Molly white on the episode the title of which is web 3 is going great David and I recorded this just over a month ago on October 7th with Molly it's been an RQ to get out we've had a lot of podcasts in queue we had it targeted for release today the day that you are listening to it so November 14th I believe you'll be listening to this episode For the First Time Molly did not have the context of the FTX meltdown as we're going into this so as you are listening to this episode put yourself in the place of the crypto industry a month ago before the events unfolded for FTX I'm gonna get into some of the claims that Molly makes in this episode but David do you want to give us some more context for uh where we've come since our original episode recording with Molly yeah certainly during this episode with Molly uh we met the person that can critique web3 the best and Molly is a is a software engineer engineer a very experienced one she's also a contributor towards Wikipedia and so there's some web 3 valence web3 ethos valence that she has like contributing to the open Commons of knowledge knows how to code and she's somebody that knows the difference and I think I really appreciated Molly when she made claims that like critiquing the lack of scalability of these systems is like not the right critique or critiquing like the energy of Bitcoin is in isn't really the best critique uh but so her critiques of what she was talking about goes straight to the heart of web3 they are real criticisms and so this that is the frame of mind that we can go into this and like Ryan said we recorded this a month ago we've just been holding it in the pocket uh and then the FTX debacle happened so we actually are re-recording the intro to this podcast that you are now listening to because we had to update it and I think just because of this FTX debacle it might just hit it's certainly hitting a little harder for me as to how this industry looks to the people that are not yet Believers and I think that is the frame of mind that it will be useful to go into this episode is like damn sometimes it's pretty hard to justify what we're up to in this industry and I think Molly comes and shares that perspective well Molly had a lot of critical takes before the FTX before it actually just happened so you can imagine what she would she would add to this and overall I I do think she is a good skeptic and we need more of those in the crypto space of course uh so a few things we get into this episode Molly's Central claim why web3 is not going so great this was even prior to FTX number two why she thinks tokens actually make everything worse interesting point there and why despite acknowledging some of the good in crypto and web 3 Molly believes crypto is a net negative for the world and probably will be in the near future thinker claims got a little bit stronger after the week's events of course David and I have a debrief after the episode which we've recorded on October 7th as well so you can hear our frame of mind then if you are a bankless premium subscriber you get access to that I can't even remember everything we said at this point in time David but some high hot takes post this conversation that I actually want to uh listen to again I think and see how well they uh we've gone through the portal of this FTX debacle now like the frame of mind is just completely different and I think it is going to be interesting to see what we said back then a lifetime I'm so curious anyway if you want to access to the brief debrief episode of course it's on the bankless

software engineer she's been a long time Wikipedia editor we thank her for her Wikipedia service it's a website I use every day she also cares very deeply about free and open access to high quality information and things that we definitely value in crypto and at bankless and recently Molly has been doing a lot of critical speaking uh about crypto about this thing called web3 she covers this in her website it's called web3 is going just great and at Chronicle Chronicles all the headlines of all the grift hacks toxicity going on in crypto uh marvelous website I enjoy it a lot Molly welcome to bankless thanks for having me uh so this is going to be a fun conversation I think and really we want to uh get out of our crypto Bubbles and and hear your perspective during this conversation Molly but let's start with this question so how great is web3 really going fantastic you know when I first created the site I was trying to figure out what Webster even was and like what was what it was all about and every time I was looking for stuff I kept coming across things where I was like wow this doesn't seem like it's going so great so that's sort of where the title came from I I love it and uh so for for folks I can't see we're we're going to share this uh on YouTube but if you're listening to this the title is web3 is going just great and the subtitles and it's definitely not an enormous grip that's pouring lighter fluid on an already smoldering planet that is the tone and I'm looking at a few of the more recent this is as of October 6 uh the headlines like Celsius they just exposed the names of all their customers and their recent transactions of course uh bankless listeners will be familiar with the celsius's shenanigans um also on October 6th the binance smart chain just halted uh we also have South Korea reportedly freezing 40 million from dokwan uh Z cash suffering attacks it's kind of all of the bad news I would say in crypto Molly give us a sense for some of these headlines how you select them from an editorial perspective and what the website itself is is trying to accomplish so well I guess I'll start with what I'm trying to accomplish with the website which is when I created it back in the fall and winter of last year um you know crypto was really on a bull run prices were at almost all-time highs people were really buying into a lot of the Mania and it felt like a lot of the headlines that I was seeing even in mainstream media but also in the crypto press were around people becoming you know overnight Millionaires and you know putting a ton of money into crypto and then becoming super wealthy and you know saving their families because of crypto and it felt like there was not all that much attention being given to where things were going really poorly and you know even when crypto was on a bull run there were a lot of examples of things going really really badly where projects would get hacked or you know someone would get their their wallets would be compromised or you know some of them were just really bad ideas of projects that people were thinking up that they were like we're gonna do this but on the blockchain um and so I was kind of hoping to provide sort of the alternate perspective or at least just like a little bit of balance to some of the reporting to say that like hey not everyone is becoming a millionaire overnight and maybe if you put your retirement money into this it won't be there in a couple of months um so that's really the goal is just to say that like You know despite some of the really you know the boosterism there's also a lot to be concerned about um as far as how I select you know articles for the site it mostly has to do with um I mean any example of something going really poorly any loss that's over like a hundred thousand dollars or so I usually will include but I also try to really highlight some of the examples where people as individuals are getting hurt so you know even if a person isn't losing an amount of money that would be significant to like an institution I still will often put it in there you know if it's really significant to them just because I think that's also been a pretty big issue where you know people will put money that they really can't afford to lose into crypto and then something goes wrong did you ever think you'd have this much content Molly yeah I didn't uh expect it to be today Molly there's a lot of people in crypto uh I think bankless would be a part of this group of people that are like perpetually optimistic and perpetually bullish like we can really only see the best of what crypto has to offer uh some might some might call us the people that are like you know handing out the Kool-Aid if if you will so this this effort is like the opposite it's like the anti-kool-aid it's like trying to say hey there's all these crypto like crypto Believers that are just like only are up only like Believers and they can't really see the negative side and so you're trying to sober us up with this website is that kind of the goal I think so although you know I think with some of the True Believers you know the really idealistic folks there's only so much that can really be done on that um but you know I think I think it is important regardless of what technology you're interested in to sort of pay attention to the potential downsides where people can get hurt if they're using it um you know the risks that people are being exposed to and then you know I also try to reach some of the people who are still kind of on the fence around crypto and they're trying to decide you know is this actually a good place to invest my money you know should I be taking big bets on crypto um are all of those really sparkling headlines actually true you know so I think it's kind of a multi-faceted approach so would you say that you are like anti-crypto or are you just saying seeing that there's an imbalance in the narrative space and you're trying to counterbalance it say that I am anti-crypto um you know I for what it has been promising it has not lived up to a lot of those promises um and the promises have been really big lately um you know I mean crypto's been around for a while but the sort of web 3 hype and a lot of the talk you know around it becoming a really mainstream part of the financial system and even Society you know those are really big promises and so far the technology doesn't seem to have really lived up to that um nor have a lot of the people who are building in the crypto space can we talk about some of those promises um high level Molly just to get kind of your framing of it so from your perspective what promises do you think crypto has made to the world what what checks has it written and um how many of those checks have been cashed uh which which ones are falling short well I mean like anything it really depends on who you talk to so there are some people out there who will say that you know crypto is really just for speculation and you know that's it which I would probably say okay it has served well as a speculative asset for people who are interested in that type of thing um but when you start to look at some of the promises that are being made by really big names and the crypto Space by some of the VCS who've been jumping in it's stuff around like uh becoming a major part of the financial system in some cases even like replacing traditional Finance when you get to some of the more extremes um there's a lot of talk around banking the unbanked and you know fixing uh the widespread inequality and the financial system providing services to people who have not had access to them um you know serving as a better store of value than some stores of value that we have today I mean the list kind of goes on depending on who you're talking to um becoming a pillar of the you know a web as we know it is a big one with web3 you know people talking about blockchains really underpinning every service you use online um and so far I don't think any of those checks have been cached you know there have been instances where you could argue that you know Bitcoin or something like that has served as a store of value assuming that you're willing to you know take two specific points on the timeline and compare them rather than you know the the highs and the lows or you know depending on when someone actually needs that store of value um but besides that you know it's it's not replaced web technology is not banked the unbanked what do you what would you give uh what would you say to the statement just like you know it's early like Bitcoin was created in 2009 but also Bitcoin didn't really open up many of the doors that created those narratives like replacing parts of the internet that was like more that came out for ethereum that was an ethereum brought that so ethereum brought that in like 2015. so like well we've got like seven years of ethereum history and most of ethereum's history and development has really happened in like the last four or five years so what would you say to the the response of just like yo we're still trying to figure it out but the vision is still here like the foundation's still here yeah so that comes up a lot um I think in the tech world you know five or ten years is actually a pretty long time and things move faster in technology than they do in a lot of other Industries just because of you know you don't have to set up a manufacturing plant or something like that you know there isn't that sort of um upfront cost and so you know I still would have expected a little more by now um as far as you know becoming a really stable part of technology is that people are using day to day that are actually deployed and like being used by real people um I also think that you know there hasn't been a great explanation of even how we will get to the point where crypto Banks the unbanked or you know underpins the whole web um you know there's a lot of people who will say things like well once we fix the scaling and the transaction costs and you know the privacy issues then it'll you know be something that everyone uses every day but that's a big leap you know to say well when we just fix all of those problems it'll be perfect which like that's true of a lot of things you know once we fix all of the emissions problems with fossil fuels then we'll have no climate change problems but you know that's actually not possible right at least today we have no clear way of getting there so most people aren't saying things like that what would you say Molly to some of the success that maybe um I'm sure you wouldn't argue that there haven't been some successes in crypto um but some of the successes maybe uh a few notable things of course the total crypto market cap is over a trillion dollars right and I know that's price but if you if you pick an asset like Bitcoin for example um for any like four or five year period that you've held Bitcoin has appreciated relative to the dollar and for you know a Bitcoin Advocate they are not um promising no volatility certainly right hoddle has been an adage for for that Community for from the very beginning they they are promising that it will hold up um to the dollar which is going through kind of a debasing type of experience and Bitcoin is not so something like that but we could also take decentralized finance and we see a use case like stable coins which are like borderless dollars there's you know over 100 billion in stable coins out there the ethereum network itself did about the value transfer of the Visa Network last year uniswap a smart contract protocol born what three four years ago did over a trillion in value kind of this permissionless open ecosystem what would you say to some of those successes do you just think that they're just kind of Niche and not significant compared to the the promises the checks that were written or uh do you think that there could be something early that that might manifest later and you're still holding out hope um I mean I think a lot of the successes of crypto are um a little bit hard to measure I think you know things like market cap are really hard to measure in crypto where things can be double counted pretty easily and tokens are often being over inflated so I have a you know healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to things like market cap um you know I think that there are people using crypto I think that's sort of hard to uh argue but as far as the use cases that are being promised and the you know the idea that stable coins are a better option in some cases or you know for for things other than trying to get into the crypto ecosystem I think that's a little bit hard to argue um I also don't know if stable coins on the whole or have been you know purely successful there have been a lot of issues with stable coins and there are a lot of questions around a lot of remaining stable coins are you you're probably referring to uh to Luna and Tara as as one of those uh quote unquote stablecoin failures that happened earlier this year I'm curious from your perspective as you've watched a crypto more closely over the last you know year or two what are some of the most colossal failures that you've seen what's what's kind of the biggest evidence uh to support your points well I think Tara Luna is a pretty good example not only the collapse of that specific coin but also all of the sort of Ripple effects that it had throughout crypto where other projects were you know using the anchor protocol or you know had exposure to Tara um you know I think the failures of some of the other institutions like Celsius that's been pretty spectacular um you know people having a lot of money locked up in Celsius and who truly believed that it was like a safe place to put their money and it was better than banks in some situations so I think that's another really good example um and then you know some of the huge hacks that have been happening lately especially when it comes to crypto Bridges um you know I feel like every time I read something about a blockchain bridge it's because like 100 plus million dollars were just exploited um there have been a couple of those so yeah I think those are probably my top three I think we definitely as an industry should take responsibility and ownership over why people in the outside part of the world are considering these things like D5 and web3 right uh Celsius in hindsight was a bank uh and this guy Alex machinski wore this like shirt that said like you know let's bring down the banks and it was like it had defy on the back end but it was like a centralized institution that took customers deposits and as an industry we kind of just like Let It Go on because nothing really bad was happening but nothing bad does happen when prices go up right it's always when prices go down uh and then there's also like kind of the issue the definitional issue of all of these cross-train Bridges which are use multi-cigs which is kind of like a bank with some limitations but not enough limitations right so as an industry we do have this like definition problem where we don't actually know how to label these things because they are new they are like net new to the world and so as a result we get it it's labeled like crypto it's what crypto is it's what Defy is it's what web3 is even though like these things have gotten like blurred and honestly like bastardized some of the pure crypto native products that are supposed to not do these things what do you think when you hear this well I would say that I I wouldn't call them a bank because I think that's actually what got a lot of people really drawn into Celsius is that they were told that Celsius was a bank and when they read that they were like great my money's safe you know if you put money into a bank in the United States and the bank suddenly explodes you don't lose all your money right it's insured by the fdisd and I think people thought that they were getting those kinds of protections with Celsius and especially with voyager which had actually sort of implied that they were protected by the same fdisc Insurance um and so like when you say Bank people get a really specific idea in their head that is not what crypto you know what Celsius and Voyager and other sort of centralized exchanges are providing I think from from a terminology perspective when we talk about Bank on Bank lists which is what the show is called like we're trying to go self-sovereign without banks what David was referring to is um there's kind of a when we say Bank we have sort of a negative connotation uh in it and and not applying this to outside of crypto although we do often apply it to you to financial institutions that are banks outside of crypto but crypto Banks themselves when David says Banks he means means that there is a hidden trust Vector there that is a siled institution that doesn't have transparency where you're actually depending on a set of individuals in this case Alex machinski who you had to trust and so David was using it in a um well it turned out to be a bank in that a lot of people thought what they were doing was self-sovereign and I just deposit here and um you know I can you know um it's transparent it's fully open the way decentralized Finance is what it turned out is they were you know depositing funds into a closed uh bank that Alex machinski could like deploy however he wanted with his group of Executives and withdraw funds to so it implies this trust Vector but I think I take your wider point that is a lot of these um and we've been critical of this as well a lot of these interest accounts whether it's an anchor or whether it's in Celsius are marketed as if they are risk-free um to retail in a the terminology of bank which people think of as oh FDIC insured this thing is completely safe and they're certainly not those things yeah and I think there were sort of people in both camps in the Celsius uh instance you know I've read a lot of the letters that people sent to the judge in the bankruptcy case and there were some people who absolutely believed it was like a bank in the sense of like stability and you know you're not going to lose access to your funds there were also definitely people who thought it was more of a self-sovereign thing and there was one person I remember who wrote in and said that like because usdc made all of these guarantees around being tradable one for one with a US dollar how is it possible that her money was locked up in something like Celsius and it's like she almost didn't realize there was an intermediary there that was you know controlling her money so I think it's yeah I think I think it maybe goes both ways do you think that that makes this more of an education problem than it is really a like a structural web3 crypto problem I think every I think there's always an education problem in finance and Technology actually um you know crypto especially is really uh you can get in the weeds really fast and you know even with the project that I run you know I find people who follow the project and who are clearly like pretty interested in crypto either because they like it or they don't but you know who have a fairly decent knowledge of it who also sort of misunderstand things you know I've had I posted about the Celsius um uh disclosure of all their customer names the other day and and someone was like wow so much for defy and it's like well no celsius isn't D5 you know but those are a lot of to a lot of people that's like they have no idea what that means can I just say can I just pause and say I I very much appreciate that you're getting to that level of detail even with the critiques because many um crypto critics uh do not do that I think um you know in addition to all of the grifters and scammers we see in the crypto Community I think there are many uh crypto critics who sort of um don't actually take the time to understand what they're criticizing and I've read countless articles uh after the Celsius implosion about how uh this was an example of defy and look how broken Defy is and I just wanted to go to the reporter and say hey this is not defy at all like don't don't throw us in with those people like this is not what this industry is about in fact nothing was transparent or decentralized about this entire operation um and so uh there's that element uh as well but I I definitely appreciate the work you're doing here I guess one high level common I'd say Molly is um I think you'll find that many people in crypto Dave and myself and I think a lot of bankless listeners included will look at all of the events that you just mentioned the scams the grifters the Celsius the irresponsibility of of block fi the three arrows Capital like margin uh craziness Shenanigans the Luna Terra dokwan um you know daima style chains we can go down the list you'll find many of us have been calling these things out the entire time and uh also after the fact um also you know emphasize how this is does not rep present crypto values is not what our what our community and our industry stands for so we kind of stand uh I think um in support with you on that but one difference I think and I want to get some clarity is um as David mentioned he called us Perma Bulls right at the outset of the show and that's because like we it doesn't mean that prices won't go down and think you can't you know it doesn't mean that you won't lose 90 percent in a certain cycle but we are bullish over the long run over the 5 to 10 to 20 year time cycle that this entire thing that is being built in crypto is not only uh going to appreciate in price that aside but it's actually going to be good for the world is going to be a net benefit it's going to actually help Humanity in ways that are not the same but are similar to the level of the internet this is another wave of the internet if you will and so we are uh long term even though we see all the scams in the grift we think crypto is a net positive for the world not a net negative but I'm wondering if you disagree with that so we talked about like you know uh current state even some in crypto might argue that's been a net negative so far but they're still in crypto because and I would argue that's still net positive so far but that aside some people would say it's net negative but they're still in crypto still building because they think we are building a brighter better future do you think that this possibility even exists or do you think are you kind of thinking that crypto is a net negative not only now in its current form but into the future is as well like it's never going to be worth more than all of the effort and all of the the grift and all of the the negative negative externalities that have been pushed out by what are your thoughts on this yeah so I don't have strong hopes I guess for the future of crypto um but you know I I would say that anything is possible um and you know I've said this before that you know my goal with the work that I'm doing is not to be able to look back you know 10 or 15 years from now and be like ha I was right crypto had no purpose nobody's using it there are no blockchains in existence you know or whatever like say you know to to be able to say that my goal is really to try to make sure that the web is a better place for the people who are using it which you know and if that means that in five years you know ten years all the problems are fixed crypto is amazing everyone's using it you know I'm I've got my wallet and I'm paying for my groceries with crypto or whatever it might be that's fine like if it's better and fixed that's great um but you know in the same vein if five or ten years from now people aren't getting scammed and you know they're not losing all their money and these things aren't blowing up every other day because crypto turned out not to have any promise that's also fine um you know I I just want to sort of make sure that everything is moving in a better Direction um so you know broadly speaking I don't have strong hopes for crypto you know I think that for you know I would need to see pretty strong evidence that the technology has a lot of promise for the applications that it's being I guess advertised for and I haven't seen that yet I haven't seen really compelling use cases of it yet um that aren't doing things like you know basically taking advantage of the lack of Regulation um but you know that's also something that can change right like if some if someone finally comes up with that one web three project it's like dang that is actually better than the alternative and you know is providing a useful service and isn't just taking advantage of the fact that it's being poorly regulated then yeah I'm like I'm open to changing my views I'm not I'm not you know totally stuck in the mud here but um I don't share your permeable I guess perspective that's probably pretty clear well from a values perspective you mentioned one thing uh you want the web you want to see the web be in a better place for those who are using it so so maybe you are uh you are a maximalist you're bullish on the web as a technology and um that seems to I'm guessing here Molly because we don't know each other well yet but like I'm guessing your contribution to Wikipedia uh contribution to kind of Open Source tools as an engineer as a developer are all based based on on that belief I'm curious your perspective on like is there anything wrong with the Internet today do you think like what are the problems with the internet like what would you solve if you could wave a magic wand yeah I mean I've gone into this a little bit before in some of my writing where I actually share a lot of the same goals as a lot of the people who are working on web3 projects you know people will talk about the um extreme levels of surveillance that are happening on the web the capture of the web by just a few small companies um you know the the lack of access to Web projects and even to the internet in general um you know I think there's a lot of issues with the web that uh web3 Advocates talk about that I also really care about you know the the really crazy way that platforms are being governed these days um you know I I would actually point to those same things the difference is that I sort of don't see crypto as a great solution to those problems um you know I tend to feel that problems with the web are really they tend to come down to problems with like society and the way that these communities are being built and it's really tough to sort of fix a really societal problem with just a technology um you know I think that it's going to take something like um societal sort of change and Regulatory change on the web to really help with a lot of those issues um and crypto I worry tends to go in sometimes the opposite direction with really sort of hyper financializing a lot of things um and sort of taking trying to take sort of the side route to fixing those things without actually addressing a lot of the underlying issue and so you have common ground with with the um the stated problems that the web 3 Community might say about the the existing internet how about the stated problems with the the money system right because there's almost like two sides of crypto there's kind of like Tech web3 crypto and then there's also like money crypto which is like central banks are broken Banks uh in general are kind of broken they're inefficient you can't program against them they're not open and so we have this thing called a non-sovereign store of value and and we have other Primitives that we can create and we want programmable money and we want a bankless money system um are you sympathetic to some of the problems that they point to or yeah what are your thoughts on the money side of crypto yeah I mean so the money side of crypto is definitely further out of my area of expertise I would say you know I come from sort of a software background not an econ background or a policy background but you know I think that again a lot of the people in crypto are identifying serious issues with banking you know there's a lot of issues with access to banking there's High fees it's it's slow you know there's all sorts of stuff um but I think also they tend to sometimes ignore the reasons for some of those issues you know like a lot of the slowness is coming from regulatory uh intervention for example and so you know it's like you can make a faster system that's completely unregulated but you also end up with a lot of the chaos that we've been seeing in crypto where you know your funds are gone they're gone and there's no you know recourse there or you know pick your pick your example um so you know again I think there are issues there I think there are improvements that could definitely be made made in the financial system you know some of the slowness for example does not need to exist we live in a world where you know Banks probably don't need to be on a nine to five schedule or you know other Financial systems um but you know I I also sort of question crypto's ability to just sort of circumvent those issues and end up in a better State rather than address the issues themselves so putting on my crypto Optimist crypto apologist hat um which fits very nicely by the way um uh there's there's like two there's two sides of this crypto conversation there's like the web conversation whereas like our our platforms uh are owned by some like Tech Elites and they dictate what we say and they don't feel as Fair they don't make us feel very empowered and then there's also like the banking situation which it kind of feels like there's just these banking Elites and they just like use our money as a way to generate revenue for themselves and not pass it back to the consumer and not really enable the consumer very well and I think the crypto the crypto take is that we've we've had these web 2 apps Facebook Twitter you know Instagram and their trajectory doesn't feel good for most people like their trajectory is bad uh so your Facebook's causing Civil Wars and I don't know redirect three take I think that may be the general take but yeah that's a general take right and so but the website the web 3 take is that like there's kind of no fixing web 2 uh there's no way to like hit the reverse button on web 2 and like oh that didn't work let's go back and go go in a different route uh and that's kind of the same take that we have with banking because of Regulation like these these regulations have entrenched winners in the banking system that has calcified uh the banking system and I think the web free take might even extend that to like the political system is like the the political system is entrenched and not changing and so while so many crypto people like talk about like we got all these use cases we got we're gonna fix the banks we're gonna fix the web two platforms we're gonna fix like social organization systems it's like it's because we see like the trend of you know what the current state of the internet is is heading towards a dead end and we also feel that with finance and we also feel that with politics and like social cohesion and so like while crypto is coming in and not really necessarily like fixing things right off the bat what we are kind of doing is we're like taking the cage we're like rattling it and like hey we need to like shake some things up real quick and yeah we're gonna like break some stuff but that's kind of what we need to like go backwards to then progress forwards again into the future how do you feel about this take well I have said you know that one thing I think crypto does succeed in doing very well is highlighting issues that need to be addressed whether it's with traditional Finance the web whatever you want to call it um you know I think it has really made people more aware of issues in banking which like most people probably don't think a whole lot about um but you know now that people are focusing on crypto I think they sort of do think about those things more same with the web um but you know I think it's also I I sort of questioned the idea that the web is unfixably broken that Society banking politics are unfixably broken because those are not things that really just go away you know like it sort of depends how you define web too but like if you talk about going from web 2 to web 3 and you say that web 2 is unfixably broken and web3 might be a path forward a lot of web 3 relies on the current web that we have today so depending on how you're defining web 2 I guess like I don't really see how that follows you could definitely if you're defining web 2 is like large platform companies that are really controlling social media or something like that then you could you could definitely make an argument for those going away in some form and being replaced with something else but if you're talking about web 2 as just sort of the web that we use today like websites are still going to exist with web3 you know they're still going to be just sort of the underpinnings of the web and so you know I don't really know how you can say that the web is intractably broken and should be replaced with something else unless you're talking about like kind of getting rid of the whole thing which is definitely not what web3 is trying to do I think we're mainly focusing it on our our social media platforms our web platforms like the big ones that you know you it used to be when I would go onto the internet there would be like 20 websites that I would visit and now it's like three Twitter Facebook so if that's if that's sort of the the way you're approaching it you know then I I sort of see what you're saying you know like those things are really broken and we should replace them with web3 or something like that but by the the same vein like if that's a possible way forward why can't we say that those things are unfixably broken let's replace them with something else you know social communities with a better governance model regulations that prevent companies from forming those in you know enormous monopolies um you know Federated social media things like that so one take on on crypto for this is because what's really interesting Molly is that we see so many of the same the same problems that you do right and crypto is saying hey we're trying to build something to fix some of these things and at times many times I would say crypto is um overly ambitious in its promises and I don't think that um like token incentives don't help this right because it it it incentivizes projects and Founders to over promise and then undeliver right and yet there is something here that I think is is fresh and and kind of different because crypto at its best um can we hope that it does offer a different kind of governance model if you will at the root it's um similar to me to you um I know we've made this comparison in the past on Bank list but like um a constitution right if you're trying to replace Kings uh and uh dictators and Emperors what do you do 17 1700s United States you have to create a governance framework you have to write a protocol you have to put in some new legal code that gets Social consensus that balances out power and is more credibly neutral and at its best that's what we see the hints of in Technologies like ethereum it's credibly neutral it's censorship resistant it's peer-to-peer it's decentralized anybody with an internet connection has the ability to open up a bank account essentially all they need is a private key and it's theirs right and this is a hopeful substrate I personally don't know Molly if we'll ever get to the level of like replacing Facebook right like I remember the early days in in cryptos like people my early days in crypto people are talking about let's just put Uber on a blockchain right and it'll be better Uber and the world will be magic and of course like it doesn't work these this way at all but there is hope and we've seen some evidence I think at least us crypto bulls have us Perma you know optimists and evangelists that um what we are able to do is instantiate some of our values of decentralization of credible neutrality in the base layer protocol and something that Dave and I often say in bankless is if they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values like it's a new type of Constitution and this isn't to say that we shouldn't continue to try in our existing nation-state uh governance Frameworks to fix things and reform things right it's like we encourage people to buy crypto and vote like you should still vote you should still need to participate actively in your democracy this is not kind of a like me you know I'm sure you've heard sort of the the Bitcoin tribe Bitcoin Maximus tribe of a little bit like we're going to buy a bunker and the World's Gonna like be destroyed and like I that is one subset of crypto that at least bankless David and I do not resonate with at all like let's try to fix the the problems in our existing uh governments but also we have this other approach that is exploring new uh a new frontier in kind of the digital landscape there's there it just feels so much Molly like there's something there and I I guess I'm curious twofold my question here is one is do you think that there might be something there or do you just think look your Starry Eyed dreamers like it's not gonna work and then secondly if it's not this Molly like what is it because to be honest I don't have a lot of Hope in our existing political system I mean like we've tried these things our existing Frameworks our existing companies Silicon Valley like what's going to shake the banks up unless it's some external startup technology that's like hey we can out-compete you um you know Hayden Adams can create a decentralized exchange with a sixty thousand dollar grant that can beat the NASDAQ in like five to ten years right ten thousand uh I don't know what the the range is some people have told me ten thousand sixty thousand hundred and twenty thousand at some range there were maybe multiple grants David regardless um what do you think about this idea Molly yeah so I think I'd probably share some of your starry-eyed optimism around uh substrates when it comes to the web right um you know I think that a lot of what has been enabled by crypto has been enabled thanks to the web you know someone has an internet connection they have access to the web and you know two building communities there into organizing without needing to be within physical proximity to people and you know to participating in systems that are built in various ways that will allow them to do really powerful things and I really do share that underlying um system of thought and you know decentralization is possible on the web uh without crypto you know there are ways of of building you know collaborative governance systems on the web um you know I I like the the sort of positive things that crypto is trying to do but I also try to acknowledge some of the really negative things that I think threaten a lot of its future you know when when we talk about governance in crypto for example so far a lot of the government structures have operated around the token-based model where you really your power in that project is completely you know correlated to how much money you've put into that project which I think is the wrong direction for us to be going these really pay to play models where if you don't have the capital you can't even participate and if you don't have a ton of capital you can't have an impact on a project um and so I started doing some research you know because I was reading about a lot of these Dows that were set up in that way and I was like boy that seems bad and so I was trying to do a lot of research into you know okay so how are other projects you know clearly there are people in crypto who agree that that's not a great way of doing things I don't think a lot of people think that's the optimal way of doing things uh so I started you know doing a lot of research into so okay so how are projects trying to solve this problem and things got worse when I started looking at that you know when I was looking at ways that projects were trying to do you know one person one vote that type of thing it got really scary as far as privacy and some of the um sort of sacrifices that you had to make in order to do those types of things so you know I sort of worry about those types of um you know trying to basically predicate everything on crypto because you start with an obvious governance model that has serious problems and you start trying to circumvent those problems and things just get worse and worse worse is what it seems like to me um you know my my thought is to build systems where you're not immediately fighting against the token based model um you know when you talk about how to replace Banks you know and the the best way to do that is to out compete them with you know some startup that's doing things in a really genius way you know that seems sort of to be really leaning into the sort of capitalist model that we're already stuck with at this point and saying okay the only solution to capitalism is hyper capitalism and you know just gotta compete and you know let the free market decide and then we can overthrow the banks or whatever and again that seems like the wrong direction you know I feel like financializing everything making everything that people are doing into this really you know hyper capitalized financialized transaction fuels anti-social and you know detrimental to society to community to the web you know um so yeah I think I think you know I'm starry-eyed about the future of the web I'm not Starry Eyed about the future of crypto one of the the stories that crypto proponents will like to bring up is the story of uber uh Uber tried to issue Equity to all of its Uber drivers but they just couldn't for a variety of reasons it was there was too much overhead the regulations for doing this were too ridiculous they just couldn't figure out a way of of transferring Equity from company to contributor uh to the drivers um and then then this like airdrop meta happened where a uniswap air dropped like 30 percent of its token Supply straight to users previous users previous contributors to the protocol and they did it with like the snap of the fingers uh and so we like to use this example as like a contrast between like the previous systems the systems without private keys because it was Private keys that specifically enabled this uh we had this ethereum address you could just like as a destination to deposit a symbol of equity a symbol of ownership it's a symbol of power to the users and so yes one take is that yes this is kind of like hyper financialization we're creating more financial assets and providing them to more and more people but also at the same time like the Paradigm that we came from wasn't really able to support a large diffusion of capital and power to a wide number of individuals like and to us this is like just a huge success story well when when you hear that story like what do you hear um I mean that Uber wasn't able to do it doesn't seem all that compelling to me you know there are plenty of examples of co-ops that function pretty well um you know so I I I guess I don't I don't know a lot about the Uber story but it does seem like we probably don't need crypto to make that happen we might need you know better um you know changes to basically the financial and Regulatory framework to make that smoother but you know co-ops do exist and mutual organizations have been operating for a really long time the brave wallet is your secure multi-train on-ramp into web 3 and it's built directly into the brave privacy browser gone are the days of managing multiple wall extensions that put you at risk of fishing spoofs and tracking with the brave wallet you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains including ethereum layer tubes Solana and more all without downloading risky extensions the brave wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between Wallace and extensions it's lightweight but packed with great features like built-in token swaps buying and holding nfts with a gallery view and support for Hardware wallets but also much more than that because Brave is shipping new features every single month with the mission to make web 3 easier to navigate for its over 55 million users while extensions are a thing of the past so get started with Graves web 3 ready browser today an experience of decentralized web seems honestly without all the Clutter you can download the browser at brave.com banklist and click the wall icon to get started if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network what about this idea Molly I I know you you've come back a few times to this idea of like hyper capitalism a capitalism and being kind of a negative right and like you know plutocratic token votes and um we certainly like agree with your point take your point about that but what about this idea of um public goods that we're creating I mean the internet protocols the adoption of protocols like TCP and other layers of of the internet stack um they're not owned by anyone specifically right they're they're kind of a public good for all of humanity open source code works very much the same way Wikipedia for goodness sakes this is like uh open source public good for the world I don't know you're in the in the inner Beast of Wikipedia so you might have a different uh opinion on that more informed opinion on that but um this idea is not just that uh we are creating kind of like new uh corporations and llc's and tokenized um private Capital into these but we are creating new public substrate so for example now with ethereum as I said earlier anybody all over the world let's let's say imagine for for a minute that some element of uh the the defy optimists are right and there is also this this um defy banking system on ethereum well what that would mean and it's good it's like comparable to maybe better than the kind of banking system you might get in the West in the developed West right or something like this even though I think the West's banking system kind of sucks in lots of ways but let's say it's that well now what have you done is a public good you have a um somebody in India Africa all over the world all they need is an internet connection they have the ability to spin up and access a bank account okay how would they get access to these sort of financial tools they don't have to pay anything in order to do this there are gas fees and this sort of thing this is the scalability conversation we're trying to uh fervently and and feverishly uh make those gas fees go down but the the idea would be they just spin up an account and just like they have a keyboard they have an internet connection they're plugged in to this communication Network while they could be plugged in to this ownership Network this property rights system that is crypto native no one can tell them not at some level I guess I'm saying is um there is a lens where you could look at crypto and focus on all of like the perverse incentives that happen when money gets injected into the system but um maybe are you missing the public good side of what we're also creating here which is like I mean you just want anyone can use uniswap it's a you know to anyone can spin up an erc20 and like create their own business anyone has access to a stable coin from any part of the world what about this side of crypto seems much less capitalist and much more public goods yeah so this kind of gets into what I touched on earlier where a lot of the arguments for crypto and web 3 end up you end up in discussions where it's like okay but what if we fix all the problems and then everyone has access to this perfect banking system and it's like yeah I want that too let's fix all the problems and have a perfect banking system which is great but I I have not yet seen how we're gonna just fix all the problems um you know I think that creating open source software creating networks that everyone has access to those are great things I think you know public goods are far more important than we tend to treat them as a society um but I don't think that solely because something is a public good that it is also going to be the future of society I mean like there's a lot of Open Source software out there that's wonderful but I don't think it's gonna overtake the banking system and I don't think it's you know the the the you know makes the developers all perfect and wonderful people so you know I think that I think that um creating a public good is is definitely a good thing but I don't know if it is the argument for why something should exist so Molly your comment is kind of like yeah cool Ryan Show me first right like that that system doesn't really exist you know deployed and working and wonderful I just need a plausible path from where we are today to where we are in 10 15 years when this Utopia has been achieved and nothing about uniswap and a metamask wallet and um you know a protocol like maker or Ave or compound nothing about these tools that exist today kind of um show a glimpse to you of what that future could be do you still think these things are too niche no so it's it's not to say that there aren't crypto projects that are doing cool things you know I think decentralized networks in general are interesting and cool and I think there are crypto projects that are providing value to people that are helping people the thing that I don't that the thing that I really try to make clear is that it is the negative sides of things that I see as being almost intractable potentially intractable um and and sort of not offsetting uh or rather offsetting the good that a lot of these projects are trying to do and so you know when we talk about things like you know removing the money from the system because money is having such a negative impact I don't see how that's possible with crypto because crypto is predicated on being you know the only way you really maintain a network when you get down to it a decentralized network with crypto you know the way that that is that that happens is by paying people with money and you know requiring money to use the system so you know that there have been people who have been like well what if we just ignore the tokens ignore the crypto tokens we'll just look at web 3. it's like how are you going to use web3 without the token how are you going to use the ethereum network if you don't have any ease um you know so I think there's just like you can't just separate things like that and say well like ignore all the bad stuff for a second what about the good stuff like I was like you know this is why it's a net negative to you in your mind because you're like you're like hey uh Bank this guy it's like the negatives are a 10 in terms of like plus or minus 10 for the world right it's bad all of these things and I you do acknowledge the positive but maybe that's just a two right and so you got a negative 10 versus a plus two and you still get negative eight it's a net negative for the world and you see that even if crypto is more successful it's always going to be kind of net negative because you're seeing these sort of harmful types of incentive structures and influences and like core I guess like core grift and scam inside of the system is this right yeah I mean if you just look at the history of crypto you know as crypto has become more successful more mainstream more widely adopted the grift and the scam and the harm that it has done has also grown enormously you'd say proportionally like it's just like at least [Laughter] um and so you know if that pattern suddenly stops and like okay we we fix all the grift and the scam and the you know the issues with um you know people evading regulations and blah blah you know fix all of that and we just keep the good stuff great I think that's great you know it's like it's like what I said at the beginning you know if we fix all the problems we end up with only the good stuff you know I'm not gonna still be here waving my flag about how crypto is the worst thing in the world like but I don't see the credible way that we can get to that future state where all the bad stuff just magically disappears um and these wonderful utopian you know Visions continue to persist on the note of the hyper financialization of society the the way that I try and reframe this uh and and the worry here is that like cool we have this new primitive it's the erc20 token we also have nfts and now people can mint all these tokens and they can go everywhere and they can inject their way into society and a lot of people are worried about this because there's many aspects of society that perhaps Finance should like stay out of perhaps money should stay out of um the way that I try and reframe this is that yes there's the the line we are hyper financializing like culture but also I try and flip it around and I say we're actually injecting culture into our finance we can't have one without the other so you're putting Finance into culture but you're also putting taking culture and you're all actually culture is corrupting finance and I'm using corrupting in like a good way and so people are saying yes like we're hyper financializing our culture and finance is coming into corrupt culture for the bad but I would like to say like actually you're allowing culture to become expressed in these Financial assets and I think we really saw this in which was the bull market of 2021 when nfts while there are many like you know jpegs that are Collectibles and they're kind of Ponzi schemes and they're kind of just like sweet you're buying this like picture of a monkey for a quarter million dollars it makes no sense wow that money could have definitely have gone to better use because there's also artists that are making real neat art that are tokenizing their art with nfts and selling those nfts on the internet because art collectors want to collect those things and so we are are financing new culture we're financing new art that I don't think we could have done in a web two way not without like apple taking a 30 cut on the iOS store or you know Facebook or Instagram wanting a slice of it uh and so this era this part is like yes we are we are putting Finance into art when ways that make some people uncomfortable but we're also uh economically we're making a lot more art economically viable by the creation of nfts and while it is definitely not the dominant use case of nfts a lot of it's like the monkey jpeg speculation uh it is a real part that is actually putting a food on the table for a lot of new artists what would you say to this like reframing of like the nft uh financialization side of things yeah I mean so I wrote a whole essay about sort of the idea of nfc's enabling digital art and you know empowering artists um and I can go into it if you want but it's also kind of a long rant um you know I I don't necessarily think that it was the crypto itself that specifically uh enabled artists to be paid you know the the the the new idea with nfts is sort of this idea of like digital scarcity where people are assigning value to digital art in a similar sort of frame of mind as they do to physical paintings and things like that right but you know you can do that without crypto you know you could sign you could digitally sign a piece of artwork and upload it somewhere and then people could check it and see that I own you know some piece of artwork and you can incredibly do that um it's really the sort of cultural change that that you know people were willing to assign enormous amounts of value to nfts um you know associated with digital art that has helped artists and it has like you know again I will acknowledge that there are artists who have benefited from nfts um but it was really the speculative bubble around nfts that has enabled artists to get paid if there had been a speculative bubble around you know pgp signs pieces of artwork you know it could have been the same thing do I think it's necessarily likely that that would have emerged no but I also don't think that it's really crypto it's the speculative side of things that sort of made that possible I feel like the maybe the the thought on that or pushback on that Molly is you know in the same way you're saying basically hey everything you guys are saying sounds great but like show me because it's not happening yet right I I feel like um you know Optimus and crypto could say the same thing to the existing system sure the existing banking system could be better sure it could you know serve underserved populations I'm sure artists could create a pgp signed piece of art and actually earn income but that's not happening so existing system show us meanwhile while you're trying to show us we're going to be building stuff over here to actually make these possibilities happen what would you say to that kind of pushback yeah I mean so I think the the thing about the nfts is that you know a lot of people will say like well we hate the speculative bubble we like that it's helping artists and my point is that you know helping artists was not I don't know how possible that is without the speculative bubble right um and so I think that that's really something that's key to focus on when it comes to nfts as far as the sort of General argument around like show me fix it um you know I think that that's a very reasonable point I think there are serious issues with the existing system that we have today um but I also don't see that you know externalities of crypto uh adding to that very much you know what I mean like by saying we're gonna replace it with this other system I would hope that that system would be better than the current system not worse um and so you know although I appreciate that people are working towards creating a better system uh you know if they're doing it in a way that I think is actually net negative and is harm fruitful to people I think that's important to say you know I think there's a lot of talk in crypto around like just let us build you know would you would you shut up Molly and let us build you know I get that a lot um and it's like I get it I love that people want to just build stuff but we've also got Decades of history of tech companies just building stuff and then going whoops you know like guess we accidentally started Civil Wars you know or guess you know there's this huge issue with radicalization online that we just completely ignored and so I think that pointing out the issues when people are talking about revolutionizing something with technology is critical regardless of you know the end State I think it will either help to empower the the web 3 end state in what I imagine would be your best case scenario or it will help us avoid ending up with a system that is worse than what we're already dealing with today actually so my take on that is we definitely do not want you to shut up Molly we want you to keep speaking actually so here's my hidden agenda in this is actually like um you seem so smart and knowledgeable about things that even many people inside of crypto who are buying monkey jpegs have no idea about that like my hidden agenda is actually to recruit you internally like we want all of the good Skeptics uh you know as a selfish Builder side of things who's optimistic about this community what we're doing we want them internal to help us fix things uh and uh yeah so keep up the the good work even if you decide to always hate crypto please uh keep us honest we definitely appreciate that um let me ask you yeah no I was not accusing you of being one of the shut up and last well okay but it is a very common refrain let me ask you because I know you've also been been critical of um uh you know energy consumption um particularly on uh the Bitcoin ethereum side of things um one example where I feel like and I want you to keep me honest here crypto has made tremendous strives is recently with ethereum so you know forever it said we're gonna move to proof of stake it's coming it's any time like soon well they actually did it once yeah six months away they actually did it it actually happened uh in September and um all of that energy use I think you'd probably be you know harness the same kind of criticisms you've always had against Bitcoin but this is an example where ethereum a major Network a major contributor to this problem in your eyes uh has actually improved um would you give crypto any points for that absolutely yeah I mean I I think it's great that they pulled off the merge and that the environmental impact has been uh mitigated to an enormous extent you know I think that's great um you know I've I've always tried to keep my criticism of crypto as far as the environmental impact goes um somewhat tempered just because I think there can be sort of a tendency to over focus on that in the sort of critical side of things where you know there was a lot of people they're like it's burning down the rainforest is terrible and that was sort of the only argument which um you know it is terrible that you know the ethereum emissions were horrifying so were the current bitcoin ones um but that has never sort of been my only issue with it and so you know I think I was always very careful sort of before the ethereum merged to to sort of not focus on that quite too much because people would end up sort of Shifting the discussion towards okay so how do we fix the environmental issue which you know seems to me like a somewhat solvable problem it's the same thing with um things like scalability you know or gas fees well maybe not gas fees quite as much but scalability where it's like people are like oh my God you know it's so unscalable it's never going to scale and it's like well there are a lot of things that we're never going to scale that have scaled actually pretty well like the web you know we never thought we were going to be able to stream video or you know record something like this but we're doing it now um you know so I think it's sort of important to to look at okay so what is an issue with crypto that exists today that uh is like fundamental to the structure of it and the way that it has been designed and imagined and then what if it's which part of it is like well we just need a little bit of time for the software Engineers to you know make it a little bit more scalable or whatever it might be um and I sort of see the environmental impact as more of the second uh where you know we've known for a long time that there are alternatives to proof of work that people have been using you know it's not like ethereum event invented proof of stake when they did the merge um so it always sort of struck me as like a solvable problem I don't know if the Bitcoin one is a solvable problem but that's not for a technological reason yeah I do appreciate the the fact that we're having a crypto skeptic on that uh is saying that the energy and scaling things are actually not the things to be skeptical about uh I listened to your episode with uh Jason kalkanis and uh one of the one of the arguments that you guys were talking about was like the Bitcoin energy consumption and I thought that you guys actually completely nailed it uh the and it's rare to actually see like crypto outside uh crypto Skeptics crypto Outsiders I don't know if you accept that label or not or whatever but just like uh say like it's it's what one part about the energy consumption is its current amount of energy consumption but it's also the mechanism itself that if Bitcoin does achieve what many of the bitcoiners wanted to achieve then the energy consumption also like rides Along on those coattails uh in a negative sense and and and so uh I just wanted to give you give you props for being able to like identify unique crypto parts to be to be skeptical about rather than just like the easy ones which is like all gas fees and and energy consumption um well Molly I want to ask about like your personality like disposition would you call it consider yourself like a pessimist or an optimist or somewhere in the middle I definitely sort of trend towards the cynical on a lot of things especially really specific things but I think generally speaking I'm an optimist you know I I describe myself as Starry Eyed about the web like I do think that there is a lot there that is you know could be wonderful I'm mostly cynical about how things are today sure um but yeah I guess I guess probably somewhere sort of in the middle okay um and so like me and Ryan we consider ourselves like crypto natives we use this metaphor like crypto tourists there's people who come in during the bull markets and then they leave then there's crypto settlers uh and like uh we're like we would like we talked about earlier like uh kind of permeables like work like crypto has like baked itself into a part of my identity at this point uh and so if crypto does a healthy things no not necessarily um uh but like if crypto doesn't do the things that like I think it does and it starts to do the things that you think it does like part of my identity gets like crushed a little bit and so like when you look at like uh you know people like me people like me and Ryan who are just like we're in crypto to see it see it it's I it's most idealistic Vision built out or die trying like what what do you see when you see like this this type of crypto character when you look over the fence and see all these crypto idealists who just like are so crypto pilled that they like can't think about anything else like what's your take on what we're up to what our deal is I mean I think there's always risk in taking a stance that is so strong that you're not willing to change it you know I think I think I mean and I think that's just broadly true outside of crypto and Technology even um you know I think it's important to be sort of open to evaluating new evidence as it comes in um you know so I think being bullish on something sort of despite all evidence to the contrary is not always a great thing but I think being idealistic about something is fine you know I think it's it's good for there to be idealists out there um you know I'm idealistical about a lot of things uh so you know I think I think it sort of depends exactly where you draw that line that was a very friendly way of saying David get some help I'm aware I'm aware of my Molly you know I think a lot of you know uh bearish Against All Odds and unwilling to change my position and that this is a huge part of my identity which you know I guess I might give off that perception because I run a website about this yeah it hasn't been my perception in this conversation it's like um we've been honestly can I say something so bankless has been on a quest for a while to find good crypto critics and it's eluded us like honestly I feel like this is a genuine Quest we've been on and uh this is one of the first conversations I think the other one David that comes to mind is our conversation with Rowan gray um oh I was gonna say Dimitrius yeah but Rowan gray uh and then and then Molly I would count you as maybe the second or maybe the third good crypto skeptic that we've actually talked to so um for whatever that's worth to you we appreciate it um one other thing I guess and in all of this um you've you've gone back several times to kind of like it's not about necessarily the current use cases you accept the fact that you know crypto could clean up its act with respect to energy it could actually you know scale transactions maybe there'll be some great D5 use cases that work for you know a citizen uh in a country in in Africa and actually start to bank the unbanked you accept these possibilities but you have this fundamental issue with the business model of crypto this idea of like tokenizing everything this idea of like financializing and incentivizing things through kind of money um I want to push back on that idea too and this is kind of a an idea that is is certainly probably core to to web3 and uh and also crypto and it's articulated I think in in some ways by um uh VCS like Chris Dixon and Jason Horowitz and also at bankless and that's this idea of the but wait the internet has a hidden business model already and I know one of your core concerns that you mentioned earlier in our conversation is like surveillance we are surveyed on on the internet every single swipe every single tap every single click is logged in a database even kind of the movement the location you're in it's all logged in a database in the US this takes the the form of like um capitalist surveillance and the reason is I think you'd probably uh agree with this is advertising advertising is the business model of the internet that's been the business model of web one it's been the business model of web2 and it's incented this surveillance apparatus that fortunately not yet in the US has been used by the state but is certainly used by large tech companies to prey on citizens has caused some political instability as a result of this this business model and talk about Cambridge analytica on Facebook and all of those things going on and so the idea of crypto is it doesn't replace advertising as the business model but it adds a different one this idea of ownership right so you can own a specific piece uh of the internet um and maybe like pay as you go um it disincents or starts to disrupt the whole uh business model of advertising of the internet and so like I guess maybe pushing back on this idea that um financializing everything tokenizing everything is bad there seems to be a problem with the existing business model of the internet in that this is surveilling everything it's preying on us in a way that is unhealthy uh do you see this uh problem and is there any other way out besides the web 3 ownership adding a different layer uh you know in the capitalist system to to to the internet changing up the business models or any way out of this so I would disagree that the advertising model of the internet is endemic to the internet in the way that the token model is endemic to crypto um you know there exists sites on the internet today that don't advertise to you Wikipedia is a good example of one you know that exists there is no advertising on Wikipedia uh and so it's it's I think not correct to argue that you know in order to succeed on the web you need to be advertising to customers or surveilling your users um I agree that it's not the dominant form of uh business on the web obviously I think everyone would agree that advertising is clearly the the way that people tend to get uh to monetize their websites and things like that but um it's not fundamental in the same way can I ask just because we're on the subject of Wikipedia what's it like to like contribute to Wikipedia I I imagine this is kind of like a messy process and you there's probably so so many things Dow governance could learn from like um you know the the nature of contribution to something like Wikipedia But like what's a day in the life what kind of things have you done there you know how does this thing actually work I think people people have lost their Wonder for Wikipedia But like I remember the early days of Wikipedia it's just like mind-blowing that people would come together for free and write a freaking encyclopedia that is just like an incredible resource for uh for Humanity so tell us about that I think Wikipedia is sort of partly what keeps me so idealistic about the web because like Wikipedia is one of those things that should not function right like there you look at it you're like how is that possible that people are just doing that for fun they're not being paid you know they're not experts or academics uh but it works right you know so that's sort of one thing that tries it sort of tempers a lot of my cynicism around things where it's like that could not possibly work it's like well it kind of does um but yeah I mean I think as far as like a day in the life it is a very messy process um especially on more popular Pages or pages that themselves are controversial in some way but it's sometimes kind of um meditative in the quieter parts of Wikipedia you know if you find some random article on some really Niche subject and you want to just like do a deep dive that's pretty fun I enjoy that a lot um but yeah I I mean I enjoy I think all parts of it the arguments sometimes are a little bit more than and I would like to put up with what motivates you what you got what motivates you to contribute what motivates the the average Wikipedia uh contributor to to actually do the work if because it's not token there's no token how could you possibly be motivated yeah um they've actually tried to do research on this because I just like nobody really knows um I think there's sort of this weird subset of people who just love doing stuff like that you know it's like this sort of born encyclopedist or like the porn archivist almost who just get a lot of joy out of like collating data and making it accessible to people for me a lot of it has to do with just a really strong belief that like knowledge should be available to people as widely as possible without being you know stuck in expensive volumes of encyclopedias or you know behind academic paywalls or behind news paywalls increasingly um I think you know creating that resources societally incredibly important um but you know I think there's a really broad range of reasons that people edit you know some people like you know in sort of a token based model they like to see their edit count go up that just makes them happy inside they can't spend close edits anywhere but yeah it's like a cloud thing um but I think I think probably most people are just motivated by the the end results you know that that is very fundamental so spreading knowledge to the entire world and believing that that is uh an important thing to do Molly that that's what keeps you contributing um you know famously though Wikipedia is blocked in many different countries around the world right um I'm not sure that it gets through to to China across the Great firewall there are other locations where uh it doesn't get to either how important in in your mind is um getting access to Wikipedia knowledge base like Wikipedia to these places where it's currently censored it would you rate that as as very important I would say it is yeah I mean it's it's impactful to be able to have access to that kind of knowledge um and I would say that the attempts to block it have been somewhat unsuccessful I think a lot of uh people get around the great firewall to access Wikipedia you know Russia recently tried to block it and you know is it via VPN or how do they how do they do this yeah to some extent um it's it's largely by a VPN but um or you know people will log on via tour or things like that um but you know I think that as a community we sort of do what we can to enable people in those situations to access Wikipedia in various ways there have been attempts to you know create offline versions that could be distributed um or to you know uh enable people to circumvent those you know firewalls uh to to the extent that we can do you think that um anything you've seen in crypto has has a role to play in uh making things like Wikipedia more censorship resistant I'm thinking projects maybe like ipfs which is sort of a distributed file storage system projects even like ens which is a decentralized DNS system so you can go to kind of like a website URL and access it um have you seen anything there that that is interesting these are less talked about I think in crypto because it's not a jpeg token that that could be pumped but um yeah what are your thoughts around this yeah I mean I think the general decentralization idea is really interesting and important um and has been you know far before crypto and probably will continue to be um you know again I don't always feel like crypto is necessary for decentralized storage but I do think that you know the attempts to make it available through crypto are interesting um you know ipfs file coin some of those projects are really interesting um but yeah so far we haven't seen it Molly um this has been a lot of fun I guess last question for you because as I said at the outset uh David and I want to get outside of our kind of crypto bubble and maybe bankless listeners uh who want to do that as well um do you have any advice for people in general in crypto people that you've seen that are a bit maybe you know too much drinking too much of the Kool-Aid a bit too starry-eyed a bit to naive do you have any advice for for them on how to break outside of their kind of information bubble what would you say yeah I mean I think just being open to alternate perspectives is important you know like I try not to read all anti-crypto stuff all the time you know I listen to podcasts like this one in order to you know I read crypto media a lot and I think that is really key to having a fairly uh healthy perspective on things um you know I think there are really I think I think they're probably more uh good crypto critics than maybe you do um who are doing really really interesting work uh and you know I think I would just encourage people to try to just try it you know they're they're not boring to listen to they're not trying to sell you anything no well maybe we'll get a few names for you after uh from you after the show Molly and other crypto critics we can bring on this has been a really fun conversation and and thank you for for
