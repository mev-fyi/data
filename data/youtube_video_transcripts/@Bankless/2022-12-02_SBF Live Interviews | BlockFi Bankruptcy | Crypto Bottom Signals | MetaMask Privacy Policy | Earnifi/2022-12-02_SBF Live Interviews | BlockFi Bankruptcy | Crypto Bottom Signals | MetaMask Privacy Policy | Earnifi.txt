given Sam's history of masking his appearance and being very cold and calculating about his publicity I could definitely take the argument maybe I would lean to the argument that this is also part of his plan that this is also very much calculated and he's using this kind of childless I was too young got caught up in things I'm learning my lesson I'm sorry but that can't work right no absolutely no because he's still 16 billion he stole 16 billion dollars bankless Nation Happy First Friday of December David hard to believe we're in the 12th month of the year and I just want this video is it it is the best December is the best month of the year oh your birthday I knew this oh no I'm not gonna need that and that is narcissistic about it I mean it's a contributing factor but perhaps yeah I didn't mean to imply yes uh of course I'm sure you think Christmas and the holidays and spending time with loved ones yeah nothing to do with your birthday right well I mean it's just one of many nice things about December yeah well I I'm glad for this year to be over in crypto yeah I want to put this behind us also I'm claiming that it's going to be a bullish month prices will be up in 30 days do you remember um I think with depth of the bear Market was like December 2018 was it 2019. yeah right at the end of the year yeah but you don't think you already think we thought I I think so yeah all right all right we're going to talk about that a few things to talk about this week number one SPF he's given interviews now what the hell right against legal advice I can't imagine this lawyers are very happy about this and he's going on a tour dude why SPF Redemption tour the Redemption Arc has already started but before we get to all of that mess we gotta talk about all the bottom signals and why I think it's going to be a bullish month uh because bottom signals Ryan are abound uh and there's also some bullish signals the ethereum ecosystem is winning some key infrastructure from other chains also layer 2 ecosystem metrics are at all-time Highs but there's one big announcement Ryan that I know you're super excited for I'm super excited do you want to tease it or do you well this could be the biggest bottom signal at all maybe I'll just say it hopefully we'll tease it okay we acquire hired a company what we can do for real this time this is not a Wells Fargo prank this is not you know us putting our uh Banker's name on the Philadelphia Flyers Stadium this is real we really did this podcast did this uh seriously guys this is a new tool for the bankless nation we want to tell you all about it so we'll get to all of these topics David before we get into this episode though we gotta shout out our friends long time friends really and sponsors at opolis Opus is a seriously fantastic product for benefits Healthcare benefits and payroll what does opolis do David they help you go bankless the web 3 world is not very friendly to Independent entrepreneurs or anyone

notes to book a meeting with a membership success Steward and if you do that by December 31st of this year which is coming up you got one month you will get a thousand work tokens and a thousand Bank tokens so start 2023 off right with Healthcare and other things that's right believe me David we have kids you never forget about your kids Healthcare yeah number one super important when I told my mom that I lost Healthcare between jobs she uh laid an impression upon me and I haven't done that since well okay um how long were you like two or three weeks just two or three that's that's not bad I mean some people like do for like months even even that she was like David you can't do that to me I think we just got Healthcare set up and you were like uh for bankless for you and I and you were like on a scooter one day right oh yeah am I remembering this and you were looking down at your phone this is early days of the podcast and uh you like flipped off your phone and you showed up to a bank this conversation we were having with like a missing tooth and like a black eye and I'm like oh God I am glad we got Health Care before this incident I don't remember this I don't think that was I think that was well into bank list I don't think that was at the beginning oh man it's all it all that was a year and a half into Vegas we definitely had Healthcare but yes I did land on my face after falling off a scooter uh so you never know comes in handy all right guys let's talk about Bitcoin is it falling on its face did it just fall off a scooter or is it doing okay can we forget about this scooter no uh Bitcoin is up two and a half percent this week so it's on the scooter happy music yeah I started the week at 16 16 500 ending the week at seventeen thousand dollars up two and a half percent nice job Bitcoin well and eth this week was got a motorized scooter it's like a moped scooter God damn it uh ether is up six percent on the week start of the week at twelve hundred dollars ending the week at twelve hundred seventy five dollars six percent you know what David's so tempted to call the bottom he's so tempted right now to be like Ryan we're never going to Triple digits and the last seven days proves it aren't you I'm not just reading your mom oh my God I would love to be able to call the fact that we're not going back to Triple digits um I don't have complete confidence well like it's gonna be a long 2023 and it's gonna be crab-ish um like yeah I don't know it feels good man I don't I don't we we actually didn't include this in the agenda because it was just a thing but uh Powell had a meeting this week and he was super dovish meeting uh on interest rates it just like giving very warm signals that like we'd reach the top as as far as interest rates and stocks really popped after that and I think crypto's up as a result of that too so um that could be playing in anyway we'll talk about that in future weeks on the FED watch but tell us about the ratio up or down Bitcoin ratio up three point seven percent we are currently at .0753 nice this ratio is holding strong in fact it's like it's doing great we're achieving it's doing great is that why so many angry Bitcoin maximalists are in my mentions these days is that new uh it gets worse when the ratio's up believe me I think there's a correlation uh let's talk about total crypto market cap where are we under Chilean still yeah still under a trillion we're at uh 890 billion dollars we gain 20 billion dollars in market cap on the week okay not a bad gain uh bottom signals yeah we got some bottom signals okay what are the bottom signals uh so uh one of the big bottom signals is going on is just the absolute wreckage that is happening happening in the Bitcoin minor World which sounds bad which sounds bearish but that's why it's a bottom signal this has always marked uh close to or the bottom in previous Cycles where Bitcoin miners are not profitable they are they go to business right yeah they go bankrupt many of them do yeah so an antminer 19 which is one of the most recent miners uh Bitcoin Asic units uh more one of the more recent ones is now a negative unit at the average United States industrial electricity price so if you have a if you have one of the more modern uh Bitcoin Miners and you have average American U.S industrial electricity you are not making money as a Bitcoin miner what do you do you turn them off right you turn them off yes right uh you also sell Bitcoins by the way which is what this graph is showing from will Clemente Bitcoin miners have been selling relatively aggressively combined with a hash rate Decline and thus today's hash ribbons bearish cross which is what the graph is indicating this indicates that we are indeed in a minor of a period of minor capitulation so miners have bills they got to pay they're selling Bitcoin at the bottom to pay those bills they're turning their miners off and this these are all things that happen at the bottom line poof look at all this red that's what I read a hash ribbon bearish cross looks like it looks like a lot of red what about this one from Zach Val is that this is uh from Zach voll who pays attention to the Bitcoin mining mining world and he just like he documents everything that happens in mining in a month uh bit Farms pays down 27 million dollars of debt Cathedral announces payroll Cuts Iris energy is unable able to service loans and unplugs machines Manny topa I don't know any of these mining companies Manny Toba and enacts 18-month moratorium on new mining projects that that's like Canadian province oh I had no idea New York Governor signs two-year moratorium on new mining projects we've covered that last week hydroquo Hydro Quebec which I'm assuming is a Canadian utilities service ask Canada energy uh to suspend allocations to minors oof applied digital launches a 100 million dollar fund for distressed crypto assets including mining stronghold reports a net loss of 50 million dollars in Q3 compute Nora sells mining assets to generate Capital its former lender and a bunch of other mining related topics but yeah just like a bleak month in the in the world Mysteries yeah is it time to buy it blood in the streets yes if you are a capitalized Miner you are buying blood yeah but you have to not be out of blood in order to buy yes you have to have your own blood yes you need some blood banks this is weird right so I'll get straight uh you say this is another bottom signal dcg's death so we did a few episodes on dcg and we we called this the last Domino to follow uh to to fall and this is of course Genesis that we're talking about um this is Ryan salkis tweeting the reports of dcg's death are greatly exaggerated dcg is fine I'm sorry we'll report tomorrow I guess they reported today but what's the the tldr of this is dcg actually maybe that last Domino to fall hasn't fully Fallen maybe it's just wobbly or maybe the fall won't be as as hard is that what we're looking at here yeah I'm trusting Ryan sulcus is uh analysis and interpretation of events here but he's just saying that like yeah dcg got hit Genesis got hit but they're gonna like they're gonna make it they're gonna make it they're definitely gonna have a scar but they're gonna make it which means that that you know that's the the contention stops there if that is true you think the contagion stops there if that is true okay if that's true if that's true the containing to stop there I I think some other veterans are calling for the the bottom and this is not yet backed by evidence all right we're seeing things like Bitcoin minor capitulation which we see at the end of all bottom markets we're seeing maybe the last the contagion and sort of a restore of Health I still personally think David we've got the the doldrums ahead of us where apathy comes into the market we've talked about but some OG some veterans are also saying that this feels bottom signal Leaf this is uh signaling bottom signaling this is Phil benella who's been in the space for a while everyone yeah oh yeah that's right hey Phil everyone that could be broken has been everyone that could be broken has been there's nobody left to sell and no margin left to liquidate the risk reward has not been this attractive in four years it's not easy but right now it pays to be an optimist among pessimists by the way that's what the bottom feels like yeah it's it's like it starts to really pay to be an optimist when everyone else is pessimistic the opposite is also True by the way yeah you want to be pessimistic when everyone's overly exuberant and optimistic what's your take on this yeah I think I think this is a sentiment that is shared by many people uh Chris brniski recently like like formally flipped as in he's saying that he called the bottom uh Eric Wall who has had Barrick wall as his Twitter handle for like over a year now has now become bolic well I know it's a meme but these are veterans that have seen these Cycles before and many people are saying like yeah just like this feels right and we can do a bunch of like real technical analysis on charts you can look at like minor capitulation you can like try and look at numbers but I mean at some point gut feel by veterans is just as valid as a sentiment indicator as many many others veteran holders we've been through multiple Cycles those are the ones I pay attention to right yeah and so Ryan you're like oh I I totally could see just like the doldrum the would you call it last week like the apathy bottom where we spend a year of going flat and then people just check out because it has because crypto prices hasn't gone up and then you get the last capitulation to wash people out we kind of had that throughout the last bear market so we had like there was a 20 the 18 the 2018 bottom at 82 was like the capitulation bottom which to me feels like the 875 ether bottom that happened last May yeah um uh we had a we had a recent bottom at like a 1 100 ish maybe a little bit lower and then in 20 uh so fast forward out of the 2018 bottom at 82 into 2019 there was like another bottom at like 120 when it got down that low and then there was the March 2020 covet crash back down to eighty dollars briefly I think I think without that covid crash we would have had higher lows throughout the entire crab market so 80 in 2018 120 in in 2019 I don't know 150 to 200 in 2020 but then we had the covet crash and it took us down to 80 again so like that's why I'm like David don't call the bottom don't call the bottom don't say anything's wrong but also I really really want to because you look you could be right it's just to me we're in the bottom range we're in the bottom Zone you know like what I would call for in kind of apathy layers like from eth something like 40 off where we are now like that could happen but like I'm not one of those people are calling a few months ago for like 100 eth right no way he ain't going there all right we're too bother me to hang out there and so I could see things like this happen plus by the way David is like you mentioned the code crash yeah it's kind of those black Black Swan events that could pop up at any point in time and take us back down but I'm in the bottom one or two on the horizon sure yeah I don't want to call an exact bottom because always be wrong and I'd rather let you uh you'd be wrong on this podcast with with uh with with strict bottom calls David but uh I'm I'm willing to certainly call we're in the bottom Zone it does feel like this I think the Vets are right all right let's juxtapose the bottom signals because we have all-time high in Layer Two land what are we looking at here David yeah so this is a pretty awesome chart of the amount of weekly gas that layer 1 ethereum block space that is being consumed by layer twos and that chart is so awesome uh so it's basically if you go all the way back to January 2020 it's basically a zero and it is just a hockey stick up and to the right to where we are November and November was a killer month for layer 2 gas gas consumption seemingly almost doubled previous months of time so what what does that mean that just means like activity on the ethereum layer 2 ecosystem is like huge at all-time highs in a very big way this is a long-standing bankless thesis that is playing out yes um and it's taken a little longer maybe than some thoughts play out but it's totally playing out like directly it's been correct and it seems to be more correct this is a stat for arbitrum what are we looking at here David yeah I want to highlight two specific Layer Two ecosystems one is arbitrum which is at all-time highs of unique contracts deployed so contract addresses smart contracts that are deployed to arbitrum had an all-time high apps yes exactly and then also Daily transactions there's a which is the next tweet daily transactions on arbitrum are also at all-time high here's hop protocol uh so hop bridged a 158 million dollars in the month of November which is up from 98 million dollars the month before wow 100 000 unique wallets right using Hop look layer twos can be the new centralized exchanges at some level what I mean by this is like people we saw these stats last week people are moving their funds from centralized exchanges and they're going bankless and you can keep the that on maina or you could go to Layer Two so I'm glad to see people uh exploring the layer 2 Universe there's an app on Layer Two this is I believe on arbitrum yeah uh GMX of course uh heavy D5 power users will be familiar with GMX uh had more daily fees than uniswap what a layer two application generated more daily fees then uniswap on the layer 1. that's insane dude who's Bear's looking into yeah I think we should do a get an analyst piece on this yeah uh I mean we've had an analyst piece yeah Ben from the bankless analyst if you pay attention to the bankless newsletter you have known about GMX months ago when we covered it are you talking about me I remember this no I'm talking about you the listener oh I was like I thought you were calling me out for not reading our newsletter I would never do that [Music] um all right wait till you see uh my Spotify rap scores ankles is not the number one podcast what are we looking at here oh I think you've got some uh some tea I got some tea I got some Alpha yeah okay Alpha in a bad way though it's like for coming from the rumor mill or sources yeah so you know those tweets that people on Twitter make fun of when they say here's a big claim sources and then like the sources this is that uh so you're doing that I'm doing that yeah a source has uh so this is a tweet uh that says is there a leaderboard for best performing VCS multi coin one 2021 right like they were the best performer in 2021 what about 2022 um and I was just looking I just wanted some data because I was curious so a little bird came into my data engine multi-coin on VC best performing VC funds in 2021 and 20 and 22. and so a bird came into my ear and whispered to me the the state of multi-coin the multi-coins fund One Fund two and hedge fund spill it so after uh FTX they lost money in FTX after like the Solana all the other like all Air ones that they've invested to didn't have great price action through 2022 fund one is at a one x multi coins fund one is just a one x it's just a 1x yes uh fund number two is at point four x wow so what does that mean they're down 60 um allegedly the hedge fund is also below Watermark um and when they when most when everyone was like oh my God multi-coin has made so much money apparently multi-coin when they report the value of the fund they Mark to Market their tokens which is a big No-No apparently in the VC space you just take the coin gecko price you multiply that by the amount of tokens but there's not the liquidity taxes there's not the liquidity to back it up yes also like there's fasting schedules so like various funds Mark to Market their tokens with a discount sometimes heavy discounts like over 50 percent apparently multicorn was just like marked marketing the full value of their tokens without taking in any illiquidity and where I mean you could uh assume used that to uh you know Flex it's like look how much money we made even though like there's not enough liquidity there to support it yikes first I will say of course this is this is sources this is sources sources all right so this is uh you know has not been confirmed remember David and myself and multi-coin we're also not journalists um so we haven't done the due diligence but like I could see this being true what's interesting is um 2021 was just a absolutely breakout year for multi-coin I remember um even Brian celkis uh last year I think uh multi-coin cost of money was on his like top people who've turned things around list multi-coin in in 2018 was uh sort of on the on the list really for the EOS and you know kind of getting fully behind that and for that kind of tanking never recovering and then they kind of had a Redemption story in 2021 looks like 2022 has fully reversed all of that regardless of what the the numbers are um I think that is that is true some of these alternative layer one liquid Investments have not paid off and this is not just multi-coin by the way I think there's a a class of um hedge funds that that have been playing in this in this space as well I'm willing to bet multi-coin got the brunt of it because they were the funds that like exemplify the alt layer 1 trade also I would say like when I was talking to the person that gave you this this information like my response to them was like it's crazy how strong the rule of fast up equals fast down played out in crypto FTX rose out of nowhere and became massive and then disappeared in the blink of an eye same thing with like if you made money too quickly it went away ultimately when the bear Market turned easy up easy down yeah exactly do you want to see kind of a jerk tweet it's a little bit of a jerk tweet but I think exemplifies it um so fun fact last year December 31st 2021 um I tweeted this out and this is like all this was the takeoff of all layer ones yeah yes so I tweet out I think alt layer ones are largely overvalued and I was largely thinking of David um Luna I was thinking of avalanche Apex Solana just that they're overvalued based on their fundamentals and then I I said what's your best argument for why I'm wrong a lot of people gave fantastic responses Kyle comes in hot from a multi-coin of course and he's like let's bet on the soul eat price end of year 2021 versus end of year 2022 so that would be now I'm gonna check on that price for me oh no right what is it it is it started at that moment is the is the this time frame that you're showing on screen is that the time frame we are down okay so we started so one Soul used to be worth .046 ether yeah this is like the Bitcoin ether ratio that we talked about at the beginning of the markets but now we're doing it for Seoul and now it's at .012 so that is a down of 0.046 divided by 0.012 uh almost four so eth is up 4X versus Solana in that time yeah uh fun fact we also didn't actually make a bet yeah yeah you you wouldn't make it back you know I wouldn't make a bet but um but yeah that's how confident people were I think and look I'm not picking on Kyle what's the coin but I think the alternative layer ones had a crazy explosive year in 2021 it's basically rewound all of that and gone backwards um congrats to those who sold that trip I think Kyle did I have a student just fine yeah it's personal funds um not the fun apparently what are we talking about next what's coming up next sorry Kyle uh coming up next we judge spf's ability to spin a narrative at the New York Times deal books Summit we'll judge it out of ten how well did SPF spin a narrative uh we'll also share some reactions from Twitter and we'll also talk about the inferior debacle is infuria selling your data or is the internet selling your data and the inferior system is just a part

David I think people listening are like when are these guys going to stop talking about FTX and I really want to I want to stop talking about SPF I want to stop thinking about him but he keeps coming back and Hunt like I was trying to like do something else last night and then he pops on for a one hour interview uh with the New York Times that was broadcast by CNBC it was absolutely insane I couldn't look away like we're trying to we're trying to figure out the psychology of this guy so um give us the context here what's this tweet from DC and how should we start dissecting the interviews SPF has been doing over the last two days yeah so this is a tweet from DC which is just giving his take on the on the The Summit itself the deal book Summit and the interview and DC goes I'm only 30 minutes in but I want to thank Andrew Sorkin for not making this a puff interview as we have seen from The New York Times in recent days I was extremely skeptical up front but yes hard hitting questions collected uh collected from the community FBS harmed good job so this is one take about the the Andrew Sorkin uh SPF interview this sentiment was not shared by everyone uh Ryan you said that it was insane do you what what part of the uh Summit do you think was insane like the whole thing the questions what did you think so I just caught I think probably the last maybe 45 minutes I think it's a fully an hour and uh giving people context that it's called the deal book Summit right yeah so it's called deal book um broadcasts on uh CNBC I believe New York Times kind of I simply put this together professional interviewer Andrew Sorkin and was not a puff interview I mean like so Andrew was asking SPF questions like um what do your parents think of this they're lawyers law professors how did they react when you told them he was asking questions about tell me about the drug Sam he was saying like where did all John fuels sleep over this yes that that um at one point he said uh it looked like a whole bunch of you know Ritalin kids just in a drug-filled sleep over playing with people's money right no that's not wrong and it was a great interview honestly okay so you're giving a thumbs up to the interviewer yes okay where the the weirdness comes in for me is Sam bankman freed I don't know how many times he said I'm sorry I was irresponsible he looked like a kid brought into the principal's office um actually let me that was the pose that he took too just imagine a kid like swinging his his legs in a chair with like his shoulders hunched up like looking down at his feet that was the posture that was everything actually let me uh let me pull up some of my my uh tweets I was I said this conversation's insane and then he was just sharing everything I remember that was like it's like TMI man like you don't have to do this right are your legal experts telling you to stop and then it just started feeling like a full confession right he was he was saying everything was all out there he's he talked about so he answered Andrew's question about what drugs uh he was using um and then there was this one question Andrew asked him uh so what did we learn from this Sam what's your future Sam and then sbf's reply was I don't know what's gonna happen a lot is not in my hands I want to be helpful I don't know where this all will lead it felt to me David like this was it's like a child speaking it was very childish I mean this guy stole 16 billion dollars what does he mean he doesn't know what's gonna happen like he's going to jail right and that's what should be happening the whole thing struck me as very almost like infantile like like Andrew's speaking to a child coming to the principal's office well that's what he said it was like it was just he called it a sleepover you and your FTS leadership were having a good sleepover for you know months and there was like yeah so it was just like these kind of like golly gee type responses like I'm sorry I didn't mean for this to happen I don't know what's gonna happen next dude you stole 16 billion dollars well okay but he so you said that this was like a confession by SPF that's not what I saw I saw what you see and so okay so if I'm gonna rate the Andrew interviewer I'm gonna give him um seven to eight out of ten uh where he did not uh he approach the right subjects and he did press he did not he was not informed enough or or chose to ignore things that he should have doubled down on and in my if I was going to like as a as a somebody who like you know organizes interviews and does a lot of interviews it felt like Andrew was like okay here's like six or seven topics I have an hour I need to ask two or three questions about each topic to hit all the topics and then we're done with the interview that's great forgetting that like two or three questions might actually lead to more and you need to press Sam when you are at the end of their questions if he has not answered the question so he like Sam answered the question to the ability that Sam wanted to and then and then Andrew was like okay he let him get away with him he did not press him in the way that I would have pressed him so yeah very importantly he's no one coming out of that interview would be like oh Sam stole money like that was not an impression that you might have been left with David do you see the audience reaction like people were clapping for him like Sam bankman Freedia um so at one point in time uh Sam was like uh I'm not gonna lie it's been a bad month and people laugh there's like this this pause and there's like laughter throughout the audience I mean I don't know some of this is is just human empathy type of reaction like yeah like uh so so I get that but um I think I think it's also very hard in these interviews because I think um you're trying to understand the person and so there has to be some level of like empathy in order to get into the person's mind and yet you have to hold them accountable I don't know I I guess my expectations for Android mainstream media interview going in were so low yeah that I would even rank uh Andrew higher than like uh seven or eight but like we're probably largely in agreeance on that okay what about the the Sam piece how would you rate that you said you did it didn't feel like a confession to you what did it feel like to you I think I want to get to the answer but Ryan but I want to go through some of the tweets of the specific uh interview and then we'll eventually lead into that and lead into that answer uh and so this is uh this is the very start of the of uh of the summit where uh Andrew sorks and uh Sorkin is applauding Sam for even showing up and giving the interview and then the crowd starts clapping and then Andrew's like Sam Beckman freed everyone wow and everyone's like clapping for his bravery of even showing up in this particular yeah these are some hearty claps yeah I'm saying yeah and so like that's how this whole thing started uh moving this one did though do you see this one dude it's like Crossing his arms that's me so Andrew leads this interview with an email that was sent to Sorkin from a customer who had apparently his life savings inside of FTX and this this customer said can you please ask SBF why he decided to seal my life savings and SPF replies to this man and he goes yeah I'm deeply sorry about what happened like because what else can you say I'm deeply sorry about what happened yeah okay so next part that I wanted to bring up uh I did not knowingly co-mingle funds so this is like one of the first moments that SPF was pressured uh and uh this was when he was asked about like okay did you know that that uh FTX was sending funds over to Alameda and Sam was like I did not knowingly co-mingle fun this is a straight lie though this is a straight lie yeah straight out live yes and so when asked about like where'd all the money go uh Sam starts with us FTX which he says to his knowledge is fully solvent and then he turns to the international platform and when he talks about the solvency of the international platform and where all that money went he talked he starts to talk about leverage and how margin systems work and Ryan this is in my opinion the point to focus on complete Dodge where is all of the money and Sam goes to explain to you margin trading and leverage and how what what that is implied and we'll get to this again throughout throughout this conversation is that instead of Sam taking FTX customer deposits and giving them to Alameda he's saying that Alameda took out such a large margin position on FTX that it wiped out the entire exchange so instead of an explicit transfer of value from customer deposits to Alameda there is an implied and implicit transfer of value through alameda's margin position which he claimed that he had no oversight over Alameda and he should and he apologized for not having over any oversight of Alameda but he was unaware of the massive size of alameda's Leverage position on FTX and because that it was of the way that margin systems work and this is why he's explaining how margin systems work and leverage that it was an implicit transfer of funds from customer deposits to Alameda but then the interviewer asked like okay but you're not allowed to do that with customer deposits unless because of the terms of service of FTX and then Sam goes well that's one part of the terms of service but another part of the terms of service says like we'll give you field if you do let us do it and then he just Dodges it and this is the moment that Andrew Sorkin did not press him on that yeah I get it yeah yeah I get it so so Sam's like I didn't actually steal the money right what he actually did was like I gave it to a friend no I left Casino I let the mechanism of margin trading allow an implicit transfer of value from anyone who is trading against Alameda to Alameda I mean which is a lie because he also straight up sent FTX customer deposits to Alameda which is the important thing to remember there are other parts in this conversation by the way I don't know if they're they're here David but like uh where Andrew's asking him about the the 300 million dollars of property that he purchased in the uh in the Bahamas um and including like luxury apartments for his parents and this sort of thing I mean like he didn't have much to say on that either but uh what are we looking at here yeah so another question from Andrew says uh what are your lawyers telling you right now do they even want you to be here and audience laughs uh and Sam Bank Winfrey's like no they totally don't want me to come here but uh I have a duty to talk is an interesting what is the game here what is the game is this does this guy think he has like bulletproof armor like has he already purchased his get out of free jail card okay so do you think that uh this is an accidental slip up by SPF or do you think that this is a calculated move by him I mean I I would have thought that the golly sucks thing it felt very like accidental and the child getting uh called into the principal's office right if it feels very much like that it gives off that Vibe but I think given Sam's history of uh masking his appearance and being very cold and calculating about his publicity um I could definitely take the argument maybe I would lean to the argument that this is also part of his plan that this is also very much calculated and so this is also part of a an apology tour yeah and he's using this kind of childist I was too young got caught up in things I'm learning my lesson I'm sorry yeah um but that can't work no absolutely no because it's still 16 because he stole 16 billion dollars okay I don't care how old you are uh so okay just a few more parts of this interview uh he was asked about where he got the money from all the political donations uh and Sam Brigman free said prophets his own personal profits from trades okay interesting um we'll go on to the next one uh and uh when he asked about why he uh made so many donations to Media he says I wanted to support good journalism okay okay thank you for supporting good journalism Sam and basically the summary of what what Sam Bateman freed said and what he is trying to get across this whole like tour of interviews and this is just the first interview by the way he is trying to say that he is sorry because he failed to manage risk he did not steal 16 billion dollars he failed to manage risk not theft I just it was a mistake we just had poor risk management risk management yeah okay okay yeah that was the first of two right that uh the second interview which I actually haven't listened to yet David was on Good Morning America this morning I mean he's doing the full apology tour in mainstream media uh what's that not going on crypto uh in crypto media that's for sure uh so this is a clip out of the Good Morning America interview which we're going to play which I think sums up a little bit of everything you ready to play it yeah one of the reasons FDX went bankrupt is because FTX deposits yep we're used to pay alameda's creditors Carolyn Ellison said you knew about that is that true you know the best I can tell uh Ali did have a big position open on FTX um that position uh I think was you know very over collateralized uh a year ago there is a total Market collapse and you know specifically large correlated collapse in its assets you know over the last month and to some extent over the last year that I you know threatened that position quite a bit and I think that's you know as best I understand a lot of what happened there I I am no cryptocurrency expert I'm no Finance actually but I don't think you answered my question I always ask you did you know that FDX deposits were used to pay off Alameda creditors uh I don't know of FTX deposits being used to pay off Alameda creditors are you I would which creditors are you referring to Carolyn Ellison said that you all knew that these funds were used were put into Alameda they were the funds owned by your depositors so I can't speak for who knew what you know a lot of the customers on FTX did have you know borrowers either you know in dollars or Bitcoin or Euros but as you know the FTX terms of service tell the people who signed up none of the digital Assets in your account are the property of or shall be or maybe loaned to FTX Trading but you're saying that happened my understanding is a few things happen the first is there is a margin trading facility on FTX by which users can lend out funds by which other users borrow funds and so there are explicit cases where there is you know marching send where there is borrow lending if the Alameda is borrowing the money that belongs to FDX depositors that's a bright red line isn't it there are a lot of cases where that's actually explicitly part of the programs and that are happening out here here it says that the digital assets may not be loaned to FTX Trading they can't be loaned out I there existed a bar lending facility on FTX and and I think that's probably covered I don't remember exactly where but somewhere else in the terms of service but they'd have to approve of that they're saying they didn't approve of it here they're saying you approved of it if you've rewinded to you know the beginning of FTX um where you know some customers were you know uh I think in line with sort of existing relationships that that they've had at least in some cases wiring money straight to Alameda research in order to trade on FTX so you do know and you did know that FDX deposits were being funneled to Alameda so I was vaguely aware that that was how some virus were being sent in the first place um didn't that set off alarm bells in your head so there are a lot of people who are involved in that process and look I really deeply wish that I had taken like a lot more responsibility for understanding what the details were of what was going on there I knew that legal was involved I knew that other groups at the company were involved that you know there were agreements drafted up but you're ultimately responsible and ultimately absolutely like I look I should have been on top of this and I feel really really bad and rightful that I wasn't and a lot of people got hurt and that that's on me here's what Mark Cuban has to say about that yep he said if I were him I'd be afraid of going to jail for a long time at the end of the day you know it's not my call what happens and uh the world will judge me as it will are you worried about going to jail there are a lot of things that are worrying me right now um and you know as best as possible I'm trying to focus on what I can do going forward to be helpful and you know let whatever you know Regulatory and legal processes are happening play out as I will I do want to move on but this is just finally on this this is really a yes or no question yeah Carolyn Ellison says you knew that FTX funds were being funneled to Alameda did you know that I knew that there is an open margin position there and that that involves no but that's all that I'm asking if she's in court and you're in court and she's under oath and you're under oath and you're asked did you know that these funds were being funneled to alamedia what is your answer I did not know that there is any improper uh use of customer funds my God David that pause at the end just this long pause remember when we had our interview with him and Eric Voorhees and and Eric Voorhees asked him the Ave question and he had to repeat the question yes he has to think about what the hell to say okay but um so first of all good job from these clips I haven't watched the full interview but George Stephanopoulos does a good job asking him the same question multiple times yes and I think this is what a good journalist does yeah um but what is Sam thinking going like this is this has a different flavor than kind of the the childish kid in the in the principal's office this has the the flavor of somebody who's uh I I guess on the stand and there's a prosecutor asking questions and uh this person has no idea what the what they're going to say like has not prepared at all has not rehearsed like I can't this is why it's also hard for me to believe that this is all um it just feels so Amateur hour David it's hard for me to believe that this is all kind of contrived from this Mastermind of of PR who knows how to get out of this like I can't believe anybody sitting watching this would come away from this thinking yeah it's like Sam's Sam's Anderson he didn't mean to is just poor risk management gone wrong like this has to be just him failing uh on the apology tour this is just like an embarrassing moment isn't it you would hope so uh other people have tweeted out that they totally believe him which we will get there so we'll go to some of the reactions on Twitter to get people's reactions to to this interview uh left Harris uh tweets out a man stole 10 billion dollars FTX just got interviewed and portrayed almost as a victim and got Applause at the end still free and fine Aaron Schwartz who downloaded academic journals to share with the world got one million dollars in fines in 35 years in prison this will lead him to take his own life okay so left Harris not taking any saying that this this interview was a bunch of BS uh Bill Ackman Bill Ackman who is Bill Ackman Bill Ackman is an American billionaire investor and a hedge fund manager founder CEO of persons Pershing Square Capital Management he tweets out call me crazy but I think SBF is telling the truth and SPF replies on Twitter I deeply appreciate that I messed up I'm going to do everything I can to make it right even though I know I knew it might never be enough to which I replied WTF is going on well you can't I'm sorry you're way out of this can you Mike dudas who tweets out call me crazy but I think SPF is a pathological liar contrasting points those are different yeah yeah it says he's telling the truth Mike dudas says he's a pathological liar what else we got Mike novogratt says it was delusional let's be really clear Sam was delusional about what happened in his culpability in it he needs to be prosecuted he will spend time in jail and it wasn't just Sam you don't pull this off with one person really good point I think we haven't emphasized that point enough other people also need to go to jail not just Sam and then here is the point that I think really drives this home this is from Nick Carter Sam isn't behaving like a renegade who is ignoring the advice of his lawyers he is behaving like he has a world-class crisis management firm and legal team constructing a very specific and deliberate public narrative I think that is my take as well oh so NYX thinks that he's really playing 4D chess here yes but it looks like he is just playing checkers yeah just doing a portrait and that is that is another rules right that is the take is like he is actually playing 40 chess but when you look at him and like oh this guy he's like he's at the point to Garner the sympathy I think so how does that work in a court of law where you have prosecutors I think they are working the court of public opinion why does that matter that well that's not running for a political office I would think I think it matters I think it matters we'll see how this pays off for him uh what's this take from Balaji this is Balaji saying jurisdiction isn't why SPF is getting kid gloves remember the US got a satellite state to throw Alexey pursev in jail without charges for protecting privacy which happened in two days so they'd lean on the Bahamas if they wanted to they just don't want to uh here is I think Ryan what could be the most egregious headline I have ever seen about this whole debacle out of Bloomberg Sam bakeman freed fooled a lot of people but not Essie chair chairman Gary Gensler whose warnings about risk and lack of Regulation were well founded absolutely F off coming out of Bloomberg all right was this written by Gensler it's like cancer pseudonym Max chafkin oh my God incredible Gary Gensler called FTX is the worst headline I've he was sitting in a room he had meetings with FTX executives I it's infuriating dude I that that is the worst opinion I don't I don't know whether this is um spf's incompetence or if he really is playing 4D Jazz but I know that Gary Gensler did not was not the one that was to be listened to in this uh Fiasco all right so this is turning into a movie series already a mini series on Amazon directors are bringing the FTX story I don't know if that'll bring any any truth uncover anymore um also I think we have to get to kind of our Second Story well SPF is hitting the new circuit going on Good Morning America giving these interviews uh more of the contagion is being felt of course we know block fi was in a bad State when it paused withdrawals after the collapse of FTX they have now announced and filed papers for chapter 11 bankruptcy what this means David is if you have funds in blockfi unfortunately uh you're not likely to get them out anytime soon you'll have to go through the legal process it'll be sort of a Celsius style of thing um and this is a shame and we were just talking to um soccer and Jetty from breaking points podcast by the way that episode is coming out on Monday he had funds in blockfi yeah right this is sort of somebody who's crypto adjacent but supportive of the industry and he had some funds in Block fi and was affected by this a lot of people affected by this you know it's crazy here too David is um the if you recall of course block fi um had gotten in Dire Straits during three years capital and the terror collapse and FDX came bailed them out this was their Lifeline David good guy Sam comes again yeah do you know do you know what that that bailout was based on the FTX bailout what do you mean based on okay it was like collateralized by Robin Hood shares right so this bailout was collateralized by Robin Hood chairs walk me through what that means this I think this tweet walks you through it blockify is a creditor to FTX that lent to Alameda that led to emergent which is a shell company owned by SBF that bought Robin Hood shares that were pledged as collateral to a guaranteed a block fly to loan to FTX that was used to bail out a block by itself I don't understand exactly I don't understand what just happened is a creditor to FTX yeah okay so block fi is a creditor to FTX FTX borrowed from block fi and then fgx lent that money to Alameda Alameda lent that money to block five so block five borrowed from FTX who lent to Alameda that led to this shell company called emergent okay that was actually owned by SBF okay so immersion is a shell Company by SPF which is the shell company that bought Robin Hood shares this this emergent company bought Robin Hood shares that were pledged as a collateral to guarantee block fi the loan to FDX that was used to bail out block fi itself wait okay pledged Robinson collect lateral yes collateral two block Phi to guarantee to block five the loan to FDX I gave the loan to FTX and FTX used that loan money to bail out block fi and that loan was collateralized by Robin Hood chairs yes which owns by a shell company got that money from Alameda research which got that money from SES what the  is this dude ah what if you don't laugh you cry and that's what block fies bailout was based on that's what depositors the hope of depositors was based on since uh May June of this year do you think if you can just create a  mesh network of interconnected money to the point where all the money disappears because it's out of a smoke of confusion you can just mint more money that way I don't know what you think I mean absolutely and look this is uh this is heartbreaking for a lot of people who are in Block five block five depositors I mean we're really learning some tough lessons in this chapter of uh of crypto for sure but this activity is insane I want to read this tweet again block fight is a creditor to FTX that lenta Alameda that lend to emerging which was it a shell company owned by SBF that bought Robin Hood shares which were pledge as collateral to guarantee the block fight loan to fgx that was used to bail out block by itself what the okay so this is the pattern that we saw throughout Sam bakeman's freed and throughout FTX Empire we also saw the same pattern with Heroes Capital maxing out lines of credit using anything as collateral as possible borrow everything that you can create as much like interdependent connections as possible uh and then like the you create a super fragile system and then like easy tweets and then the thing falls apart yeah put it in the pond everything everything's Pond like any platter we have Robin Hood chairs at the collateral the backs that the uh to buy block five can you believe this and remember remember what that I said was the whole summary of what SPF was saying we forgot to manage risk no yeah you maxed out your risk bro you set your house on fire you stole from everyone in your neighborhood I don't know man you did a lot more than just uh not manage risk all right that's FDX all right this week um maybe things get quieter from here I don't know what Sam's next move is going to be um I'm kind of curious jail it's jail it's got to be jail we did an episode on this uh earlier in the week if you guys want to catch that on the question we post was why is sambang Winfrey not in jail I don't think we got a satisfying answer at the end of that we did get an answer we just weren't happy about it the answer is that he paid uh the Democrats and the Republicans and the New York Times and all these journalists and all these non-profits and now no one wants him to go to jail because if he goes to jail they'll have to give back all of that money as clawbacks that's the answer as to what he's not my hope is that it's just too soon that the justices that's okay right that's what I was thinking until and why is he doing this with the interview to her yes I was thinking okay it's just too soon like people get confused by crypto they're waiting for the dust to settle we'll charge him he'll go to jail now with this speaking tour I have capitulated it's like oh he might get away with this like it he's talking as if he's got some sort of bulletproof armor some sort of Shield over him like he's got the master and some people are letting him do that okay we'll see how this uh emerges I I for one would be happy not to have to think about him for uh at least a at least a day don't hold your breath um all right let's talk about metamask privacy stuff what is going on in this world that was an issue last week as well tell us yeah okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna speed run through this so uh inferior and metamask uh got into a bunch of public heat on Twitter because uh it was reported that metamask was a reporting users IP addresses and mapping them to uh their ethereum wallets uh which and the reason why it was metamask was is because actually it's in fira because when you make a transaction through metamask it routes it through an inferior node but that doesn't have to but that's the default uh and then people okay well inferior is the one that's mapping IP addresses to metamask users what the hell why are you guys doing this uh and then both Joseph Joseph Lubin puts out a tweet thread uh providing a bunch of clarity on this uh but I actually felt that it was Dan Finley's tweets uh tweet threads that were uh the most helpful so if you want to get a long form answer which we don't have time for there is Joe lubin's tweet thread 21 tweets that explains it um and basically the tldr of this is that no inferior is actually doing the same thing that everyone else is doing which is the minimum amount of user data retention possible the only reason why inferior and metamask are taking Flack for this is they are also the most transparent about what's going on to say this more simply it's not in fira that's capturing user data the Internet is just this place that captures user data there's just like we leave data all over the time all over the place this is what David trom was talking about uh which is why he made which is why he made this whole thing called traffic analysis traffic analysis can map your IP address to your ethereum wallet into not a result of inferior it's just the fact that inferior is a part of the internet and and then I am currently I am regurgitating and restating what Dan Finley says who Dan Finley is one of my personal heroes in this base so I trust him so this is me bestowing trust upon Dan Finley I think he's a great guy I've done multiple podcasts with him and this is what he says and I totally believe him so maybe you just have to fact check me but I think that this is kind of a nothing burger and I actually think uh again to double down on the point the reason why people are upset at metamask and inferior is because they are actually the ones that are the most transparent about what is going on and so that that transparency allowed for this rage to be like surfaced so this was this was kind of spicy so this was uh my crypto wallet uh tweeting out which is a which is a metamask competitor saying angry that metamask is going to start collecting even more of your information now your IP address is we have never and we'll never collect identify a viable in a way information for our users so use our wallet and then Taylor Monahan now metamask responds except you do you have and you always you will always because there's no way not to don't respect your users like that you send every user's various on-chain addresses iPad addresses info to Mew API which is themselves blockchain.info Moonbeam Network on and on the only difference is that you blatantly lie about it ooh spicy and then Dan Finley who retweets this tweet if you want to hit the back button Ryan says other wallets are opportunistically acting like this their centralized web infrastructure magically isn't it is if they have any anti-denial of service layer and who can survive in crypto without one they're storing data too so I think the tldr is like this is the meta inferior's not doing anything that isn't also done by anyone else and it's also not their choice uh my takeaway is just float around the internet using a VPN sure and this is less of a problem for you you have to protect these things at the base layer because assume your data is leaking everywhere if you want to get super uh hardcore use tour um it's what we got to do right now uh David what do we got coming up next coming up next we got some some really good stuff some really really good stuff which I'm excited to talk about because that was some bad stuff uh the ethereum ecosystem scores some huge wins which we're going to talk about uh there's some solid nft activity as well going around and bankless that's us Ryan uh acquires a company that helped put a hundred and fifty million dollars into people's wallets wow good for that much good for them we're going to talk about that and more

news day David alluded to it before the break but uh bankless has just acquired a 150 million dollar tool for you for the bankless community we did that that doesn't mean we paid 150 million for this all right David let's just be clear on that this tool has created 150 million dollars worth of value for bankless users people that are on the bank list journey in D5 primarily through airdrops and other claimable activities the tool is called earnify you may have heard us talk about earnify on the podcast before I think in the form of uh sponsorship this is a tool we've used for a while and we liked it so much we wanted to bring it into the bankless family and give it more exposure give it more support and scale it up so a few reasons we did this I can get into those but give me your reactions first David uh why don't you tell me why we did this why did we do this well uh Once Upon a Time people might be able to infer I'm a little bit of a disorganized individual so I had like 10 12 15 active ethereum wallets during air drop season and without earnify I actually would have missed like three or four uniswap air drops so I remember this yeah so this is how the story started so I was using earnify to plug in all of my addresses that I didn't want to have to load up through metamask uh restore old private keys I just had like an Excel sheet of my ethereum addresses and one by one I plopped them into earnify and I found like tens of thousands of dollars that I had not previously claimed that I thought that I had totally claimed to catch cushions yeah the uni drop specifically yeah but some other ones as well I also discovered that I had missed airdrops that had expired sad face uh and which should also let me know and then it also let me know that I had a pudgy penguin little penguins available to Mint so like the amount of money I got from this thing uh was a lot it was insane yeah it was funny I remember watching you do this and like uh discovering the tool this is like in April and it was just like this is your Tweet LMAO just found another wallet with the uniswap airdrop that is two years scored two years after the unit swap bear drop you were just hitting me with these like oh found another 400 uh uni this is like worth thousands of dollars each each time right yeah um and so I really at the time talked to you and I was like who built this tool it's fantastic I started using it too and I was like wow all of these addresses that I've used um I have uh ear drops unearned ear drops unclaimed tokens that I can be so I reached out to the earnify account and said uh hey thanks for helping David find all of his tokens uh you guys up for a conversation about how we can collaborate I was just thinking hey we want to give them some more um exposure on bankless and that's when we met the founder of earnify his name is Dawson Dawson he is a bankless listener from way back apparently uh and uh he's a hacker he's a developer something that some skills that David and I do not have um turns out he has been hacking at hackathons uh of the last couple of years and he's won a whole bunch of them that he's participated in these are like crypto-centric eccentric hackathons he even has a podcast David specifically for D5 Builders so we started talking to Dawson uh and we talked some more he's got the original bankless uh t-shirts before we were even talking to him he was wearing makeup I know I know anyway um talks went so well we decided to bring Dawson on as a co-founder of this new entity we're calling bankless Labs but about the purpose of bankless labs is to build tools build equipment all right so if you think of bankless media the thing that we're doing right now the theme for us has been educated education the theme's been education uh and like our goal has been to bring crypto to a billion users and we've done that through podcasts through newsletter through all sorts of media that were in parking and we're still going to do that but it's not the Banker's Journey doesn't end with education it also stretches into equipment tools we want to educate we want to equip and in order to equip we need to start building some of these tools for the bankless journey and earnify to me David is like a top recommended tool like if you're starting a crypto Journey the thing you need to do is get on Bank list get on some other great podcast education material that's the education part right then you need some tools you need metamask you need a ledger wallet you also need to plug in your addresses in earnify so you don't miss airdrop opportunities or other notification events that will happen on chain because these things will keep happening and if you don't have this plugged in you got to do all the work manually and that's no fun so um we brought Dawson in we brought earnify in we're giving it some more exposure we're scaling it up we're building out the roadmap and I could not be more excited to bring tools into the bank list Journey as well ah yeah this is a there's a lot of potential here which I mean we'll we'll refrain from turning this into a massive ad for earnify although you should put your ethereum address into earnify uh because it's an email notification service you put your address in if a new airdrop new event happens that you you can claim it will email you so it's the whole thing is that it saves you time um go click my meme because I think my meme's really good oh which one is this one yes yeah that one yeah so this is the my one Rick and Morty what does my purpose mean what is my purpose you find me money like that's the you find users money you always have this weird relationship with robots David I'm not always comfortable with okay they're not just built to serve you all right they could be your friends too this is my meme by the way that we got forced to the bottom of the post it's a little real life bro I don't know what that Meme is it's great anyway guys uh if you want to join the journey with us go try to learn if I put some youth dresses in uh it's free so you want to scale that up cover more addresses and get some the premium airdrops um so check that out and we're releasing a whole bunch more in the coming weeks super excited to do that uh David some other stuff is getting released during this bear Market what is this from Casa I would classify this as an ethereum win maybe yeah yeah give us a context here there's three big wins that we're about to go through which are infrastructure that has previously been specific to other ecosystems which are now opening the doors to ethereum so this is Casa which is a key management system it's like a multi-sig system on training wheels so think like gnosis but with humans on the other end to you know kind of white glove your support there's different tiers that you can access there's of course free there's an iPhone app there's like a cheap 120 a year one there's like a more expensive ones but is it various just like help to self-custody your assets in a highly secure way so it's like white glove Fort Knox Services anyways Casa has always been uh very highly regarded in the Bitcoin ecosystem as just really really good product and now ethereum support is coming soon so that's very exciting for the ethereum world uh this is a company that's been around for a very long time very reputable uh people love it and now we get all their products and services for ethereum which is amazing that's a big step for them has been a big Bitcoin Advocate and pretty critical of ethereum and uh he I believe is a co-founder behind this as well yeah and that is just the first so we're off to the second Phantom wallet out of Solana is now coming to ethereum and polygon uh I remember like a lot of people when they say like what are you what do you like so much about Solana they say like the transactions times and phantom of phantom wall is great well Phantom wallets now also coming to ethereum and polygon at the same time so that is now a new wallet in this side the ethereum ecosystem to add to the competition sphere which is very much needed and also Trader Joe out of avalanche avalanche's biggest decks yeah this is like the uniswap of avalanche is now deploying on arbitrum so you know you know the whole idea that Ryan that we had during the outlier One Summer that all all layer ones will just become Roll-Ups on ethereum yes I remember that that might not play out but all all layer 1 applications might instead Deploy on layer twos on ethereum because that is what we are seeing here uh so I'm sure a Trader Joe on Avalanche is not going anywhere but they are also definitely coming to arbitrum so congratulations to the Trader Joe team for making the break into the ethereum ecosystem yeah okay so on to new subjects we're talking about ethereum censorship in the last week earlier or earlier this week uh fire what's it called flashbots open sourced their block Building Services there are block building software so many more people can build blocks and that has recently turned over the peak of ofac compliant blocks that have been built even though 79 of of ethereum blocks were have previously been of fat compliant that doesn't mean that tornado cache is censored you can always still get a generator crash transaction into ethereum but if you're a United States student citizen you go to jail um anyways uh flashbots open source that are block building and we have seen a downtrend in the percentage of ofac compliant blocks cool uh hazu responds to this tweet uh this tweet which is just a retreat of what we're just showing plus more neutral relayers coming online which is an announcement of gnosis Dao and ultrasound money plus the adoption of minimum bid plus existing relays accepting submissions from external Builders should make this chart look quite different over time and this Ryan summarizes why I've never really been concerned about this whole like ethereum's totally censored like it's all the amount of solutions that we had that were in the pipeline and in the near term as well just like were massive so I get so much fun about this so people actually think that that ethereum is censoring complete he can't get in tornado cash transaction through an ethereum Network which is completely untrue and I'm just like I just have stopped responding these tweets because like just let time play out and um you know knowledge will diffuse what's what's happening with the Ave though are they pausing some markets on the D5 side yeah so I remember last week when we talked about the guy that did a short position on his curves left to Ave with like 1.8 million dollars a bad debt and then Gauntlet released that post recommending that Ave turn off uh trading on or turn off uh liquidity just pause them uh yeah just yeah we'll yeah pause turn them off temporary freezing the following market so a bunch of tokens uh are no longer acceptable collateral on Ave uh yfi CRV ZRX Mana one-inch bat ample Rye LUSD steak Sushi DPI maker mkr actually some pretty big why are all these things Frozen they're just not liquid enough uh we're at the bot when you were at the bottom of a bear Market uh you were also at all-time lows in liquidity it's just a risk parameter that is tweaks up and down so freezing it now and I'm sure they'll turn them back on as they become more adopted more liquid et cetera et cetera I remind people that's designed in the protocol is supposed to function that way and I'm glad governance is uh being proactive about that David let's talk about nft stuff some Collectibles um first gotta talk about the bankless Collectibles God we are just shipping some cool stuff man our second collectible is coming out tomorrow the first was that the SBF versus Voorhees debate David do you want to tease what the newest bankless collectible is which uh Pro which podcast is this uh okay so it is the uh let me let me see well I know you know the answer so I'll just teases for The Listener there are two foundational technologies that kick-started the Renaissance oh the title you broke it it's a crypto Renaissance episode today was trying to say the printing press a double entry bookkeeping I should have just said that wow that that could have been the riddle anyway you know what it is Josh Rosenthal the episode we are having a Twitter spaces with Josh Rosenthal we're talking about the episode as we're releasing this collectible nft uh having that tomorrow so uh there's also a secondary Market where you can buy and sell bankless Collectibles that uh We've spun up too that's kind of cool doing this uh nft podcast nft experiment uh it's going pretty well first ever podcasts nfts and this will be the second ever pretty cool we got two now um David speaking of nfts punch  punch my favorite nft oh there's a date for this December 7th now we have the podcast Tim Ferriss earlier this week and uh this is what uh Brewster looks like is that what you thought that they look like Right Punch looks like uh um ish it's more 3D than I thought but yeah that's about it yeah um yeah so that's cool uh so that that mint is happening in seven days now uh all right open C says nft creators earned 1 billion in royalties that's pretty big man that's a pretty big economy for the creators and that was uh over the last year one billion in royalties that's just royalties God nft people got it so easy remember how long it took us to get one billion dollars locked in D5 it took us like two years dude but nft people are feeling pretty down bad even worse than D5 I think maybe not I don't know we're both pretty wrecked all right uh moving on pudgy Penguins what are they doing this week yeah so Apache Penguins had a sale in Sotheby's which sell sold out uh so 10 pudgy penguins got sold in the Sotheby's auction for something like 129 000 including the pudgy penguin that uh is Kohl's Cole the founder creator of budget penguin his nft his pudgy penguin his famous one sold along with a bunch of other rares uh I don't think I don't don't test my Nifty knowledge uh I'm not with the Penguins I'm not up on it but telegram I do remember this telegram had a whole network uh the smart contract Network that they were launching called the telegram Network I believe is ton was a telegram open network or something like that it raised like a billion dollars for this this is back from my uh Circa 2018 2017 2018 days I remember this being wasn't quite an Ico but it was like uh it's definitely nice yeah it was definitely yeah okay it was an Ico okay it was an Ico it's part of the token Mania anyway telegram back doing some crypto stuff uh their founder uh CEO durov that's how you say his name I have known to no idea okay uh he is saying that they are building crypto wallets and it's centralized exchange to prevent things like FTX from happening again what is this David is this just another like I know pump kind of thing I I mean nothing really came of the the telegram open network back in 2018 is this more the same so I so when I've read this article uh and the the details are more than just the headline when I read this article I was like damn what year is it uh it turns out that telegram sold 50 million dollars in user names using its own chain based auction platform fragment so apparently the ton blockchain is up and running they're planning on putting a DEX on it and they're planning on allowing telegram to be a wallet as well and it's also right not available to citizens in the United States wait look yep that's but okay I I mean that's I don't I don't ask too many questions I don't know dude okay all right well I mean think of this as nap chain I guess that is um uh somewhat censored if you live in the U.S um all right let's talk about uh Fidelity this is actually huge news that went under the radar but Fidelity crypto is a go so remember Fidelity is a 4.5 trillion dollar firm Asset Management they just launched trillions of crypto trading yeah trillion with the T retail crypto trading this is Fidelity and they're doing it now when the rest of the world hates crypto right uh why is this a big deal David well just because of that 4.5 trillion dollar amount but it's one of the big big signs of just like the correct amount of adoption the best kind of adoption that you could hope for Fidelity they've been pro-crypto for a very long time mostly Pro Bitcoin a recently a pro uh ethereum but now they're also Pro retail which we love uh so nice job crypto uh excuse me nice job Fidelity crypto I've really liked their strategy it's kind of like the tortoise type strategy the slow and study and they do things very methodically very carefully and very um not by the whims of the market yeah but they're but they're there I mean they're they're an old institution that's been at the Forefront at some level and certainly leading their peers uh really cool to see it also binance getting into the proof of Reserve game a little bit more what's this David yeah binance released their proof of reserves I asked nicarta hey Nick Carter who's like the king of prus of reserves uh can you give me a comment as to how good the system is he told me that he's writing an article about it but binance is not the only proof of Reserve System that got announced oh by the way the binance proof of Reserve systems uh claims that they have 582 000 Bitcoin in reserve with only a liability set of 575 000 giving binance a margin of over 6 000 Bitcoins cool bitmex produce a proof of a liability system meaning that if you are a user of bitmax and you've deposited Bitcoin you can get a cryptographic assurance that your deposit is accounted for in the overall liability of the system which means that all you have to do is cross-reference how much liabilities they have which how much Bitcoins they have um so cool I like this Market pressure this is kind of like centralized exchange are like oh crap we better put our proof of reserves right yeah right solution in place right now improved liabilities um meanwhile uh centralized exchanges are also the ones still with money anyway are buying things this is binance launching a one billion dollar raise for a crypto Recovery Fund to buy troubled assets it's gonna be a lot of troubled assets we get through this uh this bear market and this crypto winter and binance wants to snap up a whole bunch of them a billion dollars to duel out looks like well yeah so a bunch of startups a bunch of funds a bunch of it's just everything lost money in FTX right and so binance says Hey we've got a billion dollars if you're in trouble we'll strike a deal with you um that's what that is it's not just binance it's uh jump cryptos in here and polygon Ventures Aptos Labs interesting group of uh collaborators everyone's it's like a freeding frenzy of like you know fire cell stuff some sad news over at Kraken they are laying off about 30 of their staff about 1 100 people people wow that is a big staff because of market conditions so that's a sad and unfortunate but there's also some fantastic Severance so they're also paying 16 weeks of base pay performance bonuses as determined by managers and also four months of health care benefits so doing it responsibly so that's the way it should be done imagine FTX employees right now yeah they don't have any health care yeah uh on the releases side unit swap just released a big nft aggregator no so actually this got released a while ago now it's finally live uh so we have to do a state of the nation with Hayden forever ago about this I guess it took longer to actually are you talking about Genie Genie yeah so you purchased Genie right purchase Genie and now nfts are live on you to swap The Exchange so you could trade nfts across marketplaces also if you are a historical Genie user you are airdrop five million dollars I bet you you should probably put in your ethereum address into earnify to check that if you are or not uh yeah absolutely very cool um I think that that was this is a great meme dude okay what's this meme this is the uh this is the Bane uh versus I don't know with the guy in the pink who what that is just it's just like a Face-Off between two entities who are doing the same pose and Bane's bear market and this guy in like this pink spandex suit is like yeah but nft is on you to swap not gonna reverse the bear Market sorry guys it's still pretty cool building through the bear stripe also enabled Fiat to crypto and fiata crypto and on-ramp and stripe is absolutely massive just like an API um that powers so many things actually Powers um bankless uh membership on sub stack as well and so this is a big deal allows customers to buy crypto um convert directly from from crypto to Fiat and make payments through through stripe yeah we would have had uh we had the conversations with the founder of stripe to come on Bank list to talk about this but then FTX happened so we had to reschedule them sad yeah he'll be on soon um Ledger doing debit cards reminder Ledger is the sponsor of the bankless podcast uh but we are talking about this because they have rolled out a crypto life debit card across the UK and Europe what is this thing going to be all right it pretty much explains itself you got a debit card it's got crypto in the back as you swipe your debit card you spend your crypto that is loaded up in your Ledger crypto life you have to you have to move you have to learn your Ledger wallet to this temporary place in order to kind of load from you yes you do you do have to do that yeah yeah at least you have to address a bank though it's very important till the end stage well speaking of uniswap earlier you know they're still hiring David yeah because you need to hire nft people now that's right it's jobs time all right bankless jobs board bankless.palot.com we've got a uniswap Labs a developer relations lead we've got a new swap Labs senior front end engineer we've got somebody from Rabbit Hole business operations and strategy Dottie land senior blockchain engineer diagram Ventures maker down meet some people oh look earn if I need some people too oh yes weird bankless Labs is hiring full stack engineers and Senior back-end Engineers check out all of those jobs at the bankless job site bankless.palot.com jobs all right Dave what's coming up next man coming up next we've got questions from the nation just one this week also some hot takes on crypto Twitter and also of course what Ryan and I are bullish on and I think one of the better memes of the week that we've had in a very long time so all of this and more coming up right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you and anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network it's questions from the nation time we've got one question this week there are a whole bunch but we had to pick one because we want to talk about something else but uh the question was from time 3 dash at time three dash on Twitter why did you change your name this very funny name referring to Sam bankmanfreet and what the question is referring to is the bankless Twitter account now rather than saying bankless our Twitter account handle it says bankmanless right right that's funny it was a funny joke Sam bankman free we did that I think like the day all of the stuff weeks ago now weeks it's been like this for weeks so why did we change our name well it's a funny joke yeah so like Sam Bateman free stole 10. 10 billion dollars of user deposits so we changed our Twitter name from Bank list to bankman list I thought that was a funny name funny thank you but how long will it be funny because it's still bankmanless on Twitter and the joke's getting a little bit old but I think we have a problem yeah it's so we can't change it back I don't understand this so Elon took over and we switched our name with the check mark which previously were able to change your name as much as you want but since like Bank list is a verified account you can only change your name like once a year or something I don't know but like we changed our name and now we can't change it back so now it's stuck as Bank we have emailed support we have petition people we need to reach out personally if you know Elon Musk you would like this change actually we'd like him on the podcast first let's do that first but also while he's going to ask people to ask um yes we are now bankman list for the foreseeable future all right it's not that far off it's fine it's not that bad but also it's just it's gonna be old like next year this is going to be real next year God damn it all right uh I think it's time to shout out some of our heaviest listener listeners this year David uh I know you're a big Spotify user so am I big time got your Spotify wrapped which summarizes all of your Year's listing habits including podcasts and we've had some fans that have been fully tapped in during the last year and have some incredible stats to share first I want to show we got our uh bankless stats back from Spotify apparently you and I recorded 16 000 and 92 minutes of new content is insane we are insane people this is that's more than 99 of other creators in the business category I wonder if it's like we have to we have to be in the top 10 of of our minutes over doing this do you no yes I don't know do you know how many days of content that is Ryan no I haven't that is 11 days of content that means you and I 24-hour days 24 hour days that means you and I have been in the recording studio with the studio recording for 11 days dude this doesn't even count debriefs on the premium podcast oh yeah this doesn't count debriefs this doesn't count like bonus episodes it's even more than that or YouTube only episode 11 days insane wow all right I don't know what that says about you and I but let's talk about what it says let's not talk about it okay so we put out a tweet that asked for if you got Bank lists in your Spotify wrapped tweet at us so we could see how many of you listen to bank lists for how long uh so here we go uh the fake Shippy coming in at number one at 21 000 minutes is bankless I don't get the how that happens okay we had 16 000 minutes of recording last year and uh Shippy Listen to 21 000 minutes that means you are listening to episodes multiple times at least yeah you got to be you can he got they got to be listening to it as they go to bed you have listened to more Bank lists than both than we made that's that we made get this guy a t-shirt we got to do something for Shippy that's huge that's number well done all right uh let's go through the rest of them oh no that was that would say okay we're not going through all of them okay cool there's there were so many thank you all to everyone who tweeted at us uh so many of you listen to thousands and thousands of minutes so I hope you guys like our voices maybe there's a invitation if you can beat Shippy yeah um tweeted us 21 000 and 93 minutes if you've topped that let us know and do something special for you guys um it's a lot that's a lot of bankless in your ears David all right takes the week what do we got for the first one uh we got a tweet out of zenica 33 I know you like the sweet round one you read it all right because you didn't like it is that why no they're working opportunities from Seneca number one Farm all the airdrops number two yeah get familiar with the AI tools number three create content written audio video yes yes yes number four learn to code number five join Dao number six figure out how to manage Discord server number seven read about defy and layer twos I actually liked it because of this last sentence you ready for it David yeah wealth is sewn in the bear reaped in the bowl hmm things that you can do right now during the bear Market uh to be active I think all of the air drops that I claimed with earnify in 2021 I uh became uh relevant to those airdrops I became what is the word those airdrops you you actually earned them you earned them I sold them during like 2020. yeah and then you're like we Harvest them in 2021 thanks to earn a fight there you go and spots for at unified identify this is a vitalik tweet I want to actually read this out and get your take on this okay so this is vitalik uh the notion of governance rights as a narrative for why a token should be valuable is pathological you're literally saying I'm buying X because later on somebody might buy it from me a bunch of other people to twist the protocol toward their special interests this is vitalik saying governance rights tokens are not very valuable it's more pathological it's more kind of a a meme what do you think about this I'd like to get Joel manager's opinion on this because he was the one that said yes the governance of a token is actually the valuable thing and that's the whole point as in if you can govern over something you can dictate its influence you can just vote in cash flows yourself what you want right so governance is power governance Capital power these are all the same things so the notion of governance rights is narrative I think it's I think maybe vitalik's just kind of being critical of the hand waviness at this um I don't know yeah I think he's saying governance rights on its own aren't as valuable as some people think that they are but I don't think that's been the value proposition that defy governance tokens have purported it's more the idea or like the thesis that token holders will vote in cash flows Capital flows to themselves get a portion of Revenue in the uni swap fee now that hasn't quite materialized yet no no like uniswap doesn't have a fee switch on to UNI token holders yet does it yeah continues and says as a regular individual pay 500 to get a point zero zero zero one percent chance to influence the outcome of some votes is just not a good trade the only people for whom it is a good Trader multi-millionaires from hedge funds yeah but isn't that kind of always the bet that like you can't you don't have much say as a small capitalized individual and so like governance power or like the value of Apple governance like as a retail investor I can't sway Apple governance but hedge funds can but that's why the price exists on the secondary Market anyways I'm not I'm confused by this fatality yeah I do think that governance tokens have a lot of uh problems I mean we had an episode with hasso where we've recently talked about this but um yeah I'm not as pessimistic as uh as vitalik on these things yeah um what's van Spencer saying here van Spencer 2022 not the Year everyone wants it that's for sure but probably the year we deserved for context Q4 2019 Genesis had about 60 million dollars of loans outstanding in Q4 of 2021 they had about 50 billion this is Genesis the company Genesis 60 million to 50 billion in two years yes right crazy uh and then he continues we are back to effectively zero C5 credit available in the industry outside of maple Finance which is emergent ashes to ashes basically saying the Mania is gone the credit's gone uh we are at the bottom oh this is a this is a bottom signal to me he's not calling the bottom but I'm in calling the bottom on his behalf these numbers are pretty astounding we went we grew from 60 million in C5 loans to 50 billion and that's just Genesis uh now we're back at zero um a lot of things have been washed away certainly in this market but what do you bullish on in spite of all this David So DC investor put out a tweet and said do you think the people that bought ether at 120 are inconsolably upset that they did not buy at eighty dollars no Source me uh as in like DC one of the guys that was buying the dip with us throughout 2018 to 2020. uh and so I follow up on that tweet and I say all of my sub 300 buys ether buys which that like ether bounce between 100 and 300 like four times between 2018 and 2020. so I say all of my sub 300 buys between 2018 and 2020 just blur into that one big dip I bought and what I am bullish on Ryan is that same thing happening all over again between one and two thousand dollars I think ether will bounce between 1 and 2 dollars perhaps a couple times over the next 12 18 God forbid 24 months but then that period of time will just blur into that one big dip that we all bought as we all stuck through the bear Market together goes to finally ten thousand dollars and Beyond so I mean that this this may be this uh Obsession I I don't think we have an obsession it's just an interesting number but like uh triple digit eth right whether it does hit Triple digits and you buy at 900 or they buy it at 1200 you're not even going to notice if the price of eighth is 10K yeah Ryan so just buy it then dude again people are gonna say you guys are like permeables this sounds crazy you haven't been saying 10K for a long time yes we have and we're not wrong I'm sorry etha's going to 10K like uh I don't know when I don't know how long that will take in the future but uh I have not wavered one minute from that belief and I remember when eth was hanging on 120. people thought it would never hit all-time highs again all-time highs being like 1400 or something like this and here we are we're already at 1400 we did it over 10x since then and this is the the lower Point you're in the bear Market all right so um anyway I don't know what else to say but I think he's totally right in that you don't notice a difference in the buys at this so don't time the bottom I think it's going to wisdom don't don't time the people that I'm obsessed with that just buy just goodbye [Music] uh Ryan where do you volatron uh bankless Labs David yeah we're doing going Beyond education uh tools for the journey I think it's really cool to have some more Dev Talent on the team I'm really excited about the road map that we're putting together with uh for earnify integrating that into the rest of the the bankless product that's cool it's cool building software David who would have thought two podcasters look at us I mean a media company buying a software wow a software tool that's great uh I think it's gonna be great for people on The Bangles journey and give us some time guys to integrate all of these things together right now there's a separate membership that you have for Bank list and for for earnify I mean we're going to work as we hire people up over the coming months to uh to get this all integrated and feeling really nice and packaged but uh I mean already dude this tool you know what's really fulfilling to me David is like um you know how the one time I've gone to a conference all the people who've come up to us and been like hey thank you for doing bankless you helped me on my crypto Journey um I got a job in crypto um I got financially independent as a result of this uh I was bullish you you developed conviction in some uh asset set that um you know did really well and continue to perform and then I'm a long-term holder on like all of these things it's like I feel like it's value that bank list has provided the community and uh earnify is another example of this it's like a way to quantify that 150 million dollars and confirmed air drops that people have received in the bank list Journey you know that thing where we've said um crypto pays you to learn about crypto you said that forever now we have tool we can go Harvest these things you can learn about on a bank list now you can go pick it up and to me that's very fulfilling like I want to grow those numbers the number of people that have done well in crypto who got on the journey through bankless education number of people who have generated wealth from the crypto economy those are the numbers that that mean the most to me and those are numbers I think we can grow when we have these sorts of tools so I am very bullish on what we're building next with with earnify and everything that's coming with bankless Labs 100 yeah we've been teasing like Bank list 2.0 for a while and we've started to have some of these things emerge bankless Collectibles came out a couple weeks ago we're now announcing this earnify thing we've teased a brand new website uh we told people to subscribe to bank list when that 25 off discount happened last week but if you didn't you should have um but there's still more to come and the cool thing is is all of these things do seamlessly integrate with each other once all these pieces are out so I'm excited for 2023 as we uh you know shoot more than more of this ammo that we have of bankless 2.0 out the door David do you know what time it is now yeah that's meme of the week time let's look at the meme of the week and you're particularly bullish on this one this is this is getting ridiculous what are we looking at man this is an article out of the Wall Street Journal titled Sam bakeman freed is super jacked and handsome the FTX founder is super hot he's amazing and we love him so much and there's a Sam picture of Sam bacon free just absolutely ripped muscle bound 80 great yeah looking good reminder this is a meme this is not real although like to this day do you even know I don't know that's what's funny about it I mean you could actually see this uh in the Wall Street Journal all right guys this one's kind of egregious but stick around though for the Moment of Zen actually the Moment of Zen today we are a quick conversation you had with Dawson who's Nelson co-founder of bankless lab so stick around if you want to hear about that of course as always gotta tell you about the risks and disclaimers gotta say none of this has been Financial advice it never is crypto is risky so is so is Bitcoin no matter what price you buy these things at but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot is the airdrop Checker artifies a web 3 notification tool that will let you know of all the things you have to go claim for your wallet claim for your wallet what does that mean so claiming for your wallet is things like airdrops whitelists nft mints and if I will check you for all these and let you know instantly what you have to go claim why do I need it you need it because without earnify you don't know when you have unclaimed assets this is tens of thousands of dollars sometimes that are just out there waiting for you for your wallet specifically how many people use earnify there are over 250 000 people who trust earnify for notifications okay so with earnify I plug in my ethereum address and it tells me what airdrops I can collect right exactly it allows you to do that for not just one address either you can do it up to 10 addresses up to 10 addresses and so how much money have you made people there are over 150 million dollars worth of airdrops that have been found through ernify since launching two years ago 150 million dollars so people have put in their ethereum addresses well multiple of them into earnify and earnify has helped them claim 1.5 million dollars not just 1.5 million 150 million dollars excuse me 150 million dollars that's amazing what why did you make earnify what inspired you to make it you know I'm a crypto Degen just like all of you I found that I had unclaimed airdrops that I didn't know about and so I made this tool originally for myself to check my wallets and then it turned out that a lot of other people wanted the exact same set of features so is it just airdrops it is much more than just airdrops so earnify began originally from a hackathon two years ago as the airdrop Checker and now arnifies expanded to pull-up tokens nft mints whitelists and many other things like pull-up Raffles for just all the free things that you don't know about yet for your wallets so what do I get if I sign up for earnify if you sign up for earnify you're gonna be able to check your addresses right now but you will also be signed up for email notifications when you match a new claimable asset in the future so this means that when the airdrop goes live you can be the first to know that your wallets are in that airdrop but you you can also pay for earnify right what what do you get if you pay for earnify if you're a serious defy user you should pay for earnify because you'll be able to watch more than just two addresses you'll be able to watch up to 10 and that means that you will get these email notifications for up to 10 of your addresses so you'll know more about all of the addresses that you have and all the assets that you can go claim how is certified different from any other airdrop notification service airdrops much more than just an airdrop notification service airdrop is the highest quality there is zero spam allowed everything is manually reviewed tested and checked to make sure that it's worth your time not just your time but also your money because I believe just like everyone else who is on the bankless journey that we should stay safe and avoid some of these spam issues some of these bankruptcy issues that we've been seeing over in the C5 world what are earnify's plans for the future is there a roadmap friendify has huge plans for the future Beyond just airdrops arnify is going to be checking you for all the things that your wallet can have so when new nfts job you can be notified of that when your ens names are about to expire you can be notified of that when anything happens on chain you need to be enabled to respond to that with something like vernify to notify you right away to go take action maybe your D5 loans are about to get liquidated maybe the ens name you've always wanted is about to go up for auction and you can bid on it and if I will notify you of all these things in the future [Music]
