foreign [Music] bankless Nation it is the merge Friday of September David what time is it the emergency clock I don't know Ryan it's time for the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an Ambitions Endeavor because it's merge week this week we are merged no longer future tense now past tents uh and so grab your coffee because that is what we are going to be covering uh the merge and so many more things that happened in the last seven days but mostly mostly the merge though mostly mostly the merch yeah we got it we're gonna talk about that a lot um last week was the last weekly roll-up on proof of work yes this week is the first weekly roll-off roll up completely on proof of stake as a podcast did not consume any energy in the production of this podcast I'm not sure that's totally true but ethereum is now my ethereum node is now consuming less energy than this podcast takes to create yes wow yeah that's a fun fact that is a fun fact how are you feeling man because so um I got some naps in between like I woke up for the merge middle of the night for me it by the way it happened at the worst possible time worst East Coast I was I was upset I put out tweet yesterday say hey can we delay the merge for a more like reasonable hour well and you don't get to decide unless you're a minor basically right that's the only power to decide but I mean it was looking pretty good the last few weeks it was you know 8 A.M in the morning something like this East Coast time that would have been perfect yeah as it had it got up to 11 p.m East Coast time which was it was gonna be great when was the exact time I can't remember I woke up at like 1 20 or 1 30 or something in the morning East my time and it happened between that and like 2 30 I believe I think it was like 2 30 to 2 45 in the morning yeah 2 30 to 2 45 in the morning uh but I mean there was a lot of energy on that call even for like folks in the US who are East Coast time and of course the call was attended by everyone from around the world what a surreal experience this was to to witness and how many people were on the the call itself David uh attending the call like in the actual Zoom it was something like 40 to 50 people uh we had a peak of people watching of almost 50 000 but by the time I woke up in the morning it was over a quarter million that's absolutely incredible the biggest event in crypto we'll talk about that a few other things we're going to cover inflation that was the news in macro markets but is it really that bad the s p stock seem to think it is we talk about what we think also a crypto founder has been issued an arrest warrant that happened this week as well we're going to tell you which one in the roll-up can you guess there are a few there are a few you could be thinking about right there but as always make sure if you enjoy the weekly Roll-Ups that you like this wherever you are listening subscribe of course on the podcast or YouTube and if you're listening to the podcast write us a review right the episode that's how we get up to the top of the charts David before we get to the markets there's an announcement from our friends and sponsors at swellnetwork this is a new eth staking opportunity it comes at a good time of course you and I David we like the swell team so much we also became Angel Investors but what is the swell Network what are they doing swellnetwork is joining the ranks of Rocket pool and Lido as a decentralized permissionless staking as a service system and soil is really going after the Best of Both Worlds from from both rocket pool and Lido it's got the permissioned validator set like Lido that helps it scale but it's also got the permission permission list validator pool so anyone can join the network and validate and so this is a brand new staking as a service network coming out of the ground just in time for the post merge world so there's a link in the show notes so you can go and join the swell Network Discord and get in on the ground floor of a brand news staking as a service system really excited and like Ryan said and also full disclaimer both Ryan and I are Angel Investors into swell and they are also a sponsor of this message all right David let's get in the markets this week starting with Daddy Bitcoin up or down on the week David you know Bitcoin actually made it up on the week so it is up uh 2.5 from 1900 through 19 300 to 19 850 so a modest 2.5 bump on the week that's actually really impressive given the week that was I mean down in stocks and uh I think down in each price as of now as of recording things were pretty flat post merge there was no there's really no volatility neither up nor down after a successful merge until we set it until we said that this was so we did a post merge recap and I think the ether Bulls were all commenting on the lack of volatility in this market and then what's this big red candle what price are we at this week right now we started the week at 16 50 D we are down 8.7 percent and you see these two big red candles that one in the middle of the week is the macro red candle where the inflation numbers came out and so we we tanked from like 1750 down to uh about 1500. uh then we reclaimed right into the merge at up to 1650 but then right as we started recording this uh we go all the way down to fifteen hundred dollars so we are overall ethers down eight and a half percent on the week oof I really by the time this episode is released I really have no idea no like this could recover the candle could reverse we could be down further who knows I mean sometimes I I just wonder if we tend to over analyze things this could just be Market noise Traders playing Trader games like people unwinding and eat pal trade who the hell knows yeah exactly um we'll look at this you know on the month type basis and that'll be a clear indication although I will say eth BTC ratio it was um doing well last week in favor of eth now it is uh back down so Bitcoin a very strong recovery on the ratio what's that looking like this week we really ended last week at like the top tick of the recent East BTC uh ratio move so we ended last week at 0.085 we are currently down to .075 uh currently at seven six excuse me um and so but we're bouncing between .075.085 so down 10 on the week so bad week but we will see as this thing goes into the future yeah what's interesting about the ratio is it's probably for you you I I would consider you now David you've come out as a ratio bull a big ratio I'm mainly long the ratio yes okay and when you say long you're talking about multi-year time Horizon I've I've heard you talk about like five years so like my time Horizon for eth is like five to ten years at minimum at least right actually for me similar to bitcoin um I think you have a similarly long time Horizon for the Bitcoin ratio um yeah at what point like do you think that thesis we'll have uh you know completed played out yeah like minimum something like 18 months and I'm really going for my my price Target is what I'm calling the lappening or the lapping uh so like you know you have the flipping where ether flips Bitcoin but I'm planning on unwinding this eath BTT position at like the lappening where their ether is like two times the Bitcoin price or two times the Bitcoin market cap no clue when that take when that's gonna happen but it's gonna be a multi-year-long Endeavor of course but the the whole argument is that minor cell pressure is fundamentally bearish and proof of stake huddle pressure is fundamentally bullish so time like how press set on our show time is on ether's side time is a Tailwind for ether and a headwind for Bitcoin and so like while these short-term moves like always just make no sense over the long term the cell pressure into proof of work is a headwind that Bitcoin has to fight against The Ether doesn't have to fight against what's really interesting about that is uh do you remember the episode we did with um Arthur Hayes right and like the concept we we kind of coined I don't know if there's a concept anyone else uses but like Arthur to us was a thesis driven Trader this to me David feels like you're being a thesis-driven Trader here yes in that like this is a trade definitely this is a trade yeah but so something I have to sell I have to press the sell button eventually if I want to get my youth back yeah exactly so it's David David's playing a trade here but it's not a kind of a narrative trade it's not a short term um our like trade or some other sort of trade it's like a trade that you think is backed by some fundamentals and that fundamental is about all about um flows into and out of the asset class um well let's talk about flows into the global cryptocurrency market cap do you think you mean out of Ryan oh uh oh are we down in the week yeah we're down on the week uh start of the week at 1.28 trillion we are down to 1.009 trillion so lost a few Billy on the week a few billion the week but that was up last week maybe artificially so with with Bitcoin kind of lagging as uh non-bitcoin coins emerged um David the last week we have been talking about the eth merge date the last thing we will show here is question of halves the eve merged yet and the answer to that question is yes yes it has binary yes or no the answer is yes this is your website there's a website you can go to if you want to confirm that check that has merch.com in big letters the answer to that question is yes we've successfully merged we'll get into that a little bit more further in the episode but David before we do we should talk about macro right here because I think the question in macro markets is inflation is up that sounds pretty bad stocks tumbled on the week here's the CNBC headline Dow tumbles 1 200 points for the worst day since June 2020 After hot inflation report June 2020 of course was a day I'm sure that was in the thick of the the covert uh scare so we're having a similar day here after a hot inflation report let me just recap the numbers from that inflation of report so let's go back to June so annualized inflation in June the numbers the official numbers 9.1 percent and if you recall that was the highest since 1981. so we hit a 40-year high so no question in anyone's mind that inflation was was running hot in June in the previous 12 months preceding it July 8.5 down a little bit but still up too close for comfort to the double-digit territory August the numbers we just got last week the reason for this Market tumble 8.3 percent so you think that would that's down from July David from on an annualized basis but apparently it was still larger than the market was anticipating the average analyst expectation for inflation was 8.1 percent and this came in at 8.3 percent so 200 basis points over on inflation and two percent over expectations and that's right the market tumbling that is apparently what people are crediting for the reason the market is tumbling so this is the headline over expectation inflation sent the market tumbling that hard this is what mainstream Financial media is reporting does a hot inflation report but I do think David we have to dig into these numbers a little bit further right because so first of all let me just say 8.3 percent still sounds really high like don't you want to be in the four percent ideally the two percent area like two to four maybe that's somewhat of the new normal but you actually can't look at this uh from a you know 12-month annualized basis because the the 12th month is really a lagging indicator here's a tweet from Tom Schmidt do you want to read this out tell us what this means yeah Tom says not to be that guy again but CPI is actually dropping month over month I really do think that year over year is a very confusing way to report inflation especially with the spikes and volatility we've had over the past two years and there's a chart here showing inflation going up and up and up and up and up until June and then it hits like what this looks like a ceiling and we've been going very marginally down ever since but the fact that we're not going up seems to be a decent Trend over the last three months according to this chart which is coming out of the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics so this is Tom's large Point larger point which is you can't really look at annualized numbers when we're dealing with this level of inflation volatility because of all of the craziness that we've seen with with kovid and you know economic sanctions and wars and all these things like these are sort of unprecedented time times and it doesn't make sense to look at 12 months in total what we should maybe also be looking at is the monthly total and inflation in August just the month of August not not the last 12 months of August and preceding it in August it was 0.1 percent and if you analyze annualize that out multiply that number by 12 months right get the new annualized number you get 1.2 percent just to hit those again into perspective so August prices of assets or whatever consumables that we measure inflation with is up 8.3 year over year but in the last month at prices of like food gas is only up 0.1 which is not high which was actually low and so I think the big question is uh if inflation has peaked what happens if the FED over adjusts too far you know it's like it's kind of like you're steering a car it's starting it's starting to wobble you turn to avoid something and then you you swipe back too far you over correct in the opposite direction and now you're in another Lane of traffic right that lane of traffic might actually be deflationary forces okay this is a tweet from Elon Musk saying a major Fed rate hike risks deflation that's what he's talking about If the Fed over corrects too much in the other direction and I think the market is really tussling with this right now and I mean so are the central Bankers of course and I'm not it's not very clear that they know what they're doing behind the steering wheel at this point and I guess there's precedent for this because the whole reason why we have inflation in the first place is because the Fed was too slow to increase interest rates in the first place so it would go it would continue to say that like well the fed's also going to be too slow to stop tightening as well like I feel like that's an easy Occam's razor take to have uh it definitely is they just might not be prepared for the Whiplash of of the times that we're living in and Ryan that's perhaps why we should have an algorithmically controlled monetary system and not a human-controlled monetary system speaking of um algorithmically controlled monetary system Ryan you know what happened this last week oh it did some algorithmically controlled money system just get an upgrade yeah did our money just get a software update we're going to talk about that how money is getting software updates these days and of course we're talking about the merge so we're going to be we're going to leave the FED behind us and we're going to go into the future talking about the ethereum merge right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eats with rocketpool and get reth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 50 18 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there merged merged we have officially merged David this is emerged this is a tweet from vitalik buterin just some guy on the internet and we finalized he said he's talking about the finalization of the proof of stake chain happy merge all this is a big moment for the ethereum ecosystem everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today David as we're recording this tweet is sitting at 170 000 likes echoing around the internet making this a historic event I think earlier David you called this the most historic event that crypto has ever seen maybe not the most important Milestone right you'd hearken back to like the launch of Bitcoin as a more important Milestone or even the launch of ethereum as a more important Milestone but an event is different an event is something the entire world is watching something that the community is anticipating and I think this was the biggest event we've ever seen in crypto certainly like how many people witnessed the launch of Bitcoin like under five how many people witnessed the launch of ethereum 10 to 15 000 how many people watched the live stream on the ethereum foundation YouTube last night a quarter million people and that's just the people that watched the stream so like a ton of people just watched just watched ethereum go through its transition to proof of stake so this is the biggest event in crypto history in those terms like the most number of eyeballs the most number of amount of hype uh and Ryan it went off without a hitch the move the merge was so incredibly smooth it was absolutely successful and when and just to clarify a term here vitalik is saying and we finalized that's actually a technical term so the merge happens as in we hit that TTD number that total terminal difficulty that tells all of The Ether proof of work ethereum main chain ethereum execution layer clients to start to stop paying attention proof of work and start paying attention to proof of stake that's the merge but the merge isn't complete until we finalize it and so that's about six minutes later and we need that finalization to lock in proof of stake because once a part was an Epoch and ethereum is finalized that means to go backwards in proof of stake you need to slash a huge proportion of ether out there and so it's one thing to merge but it's really like final when the ethereum proof of stake chain finalizes the execution layer and so that's really the celebration uh with that vet talks going for us there's now the full weight of ethereum proof of stake behind the ethereum execution layer so now going backwards on the Chain result more than six minutes results in billion dollars of slashing and that is the economic security that we have all been excited about and why the merge is such a big deal billions of dollars of Economic Security and David I was looking at this earlier did you know that if you add up eth all the erc20s all of the nfts we just forklifted a 400 billion dollar economy that is the size of the ethereum economy and we just swap that in real time we swapped out the consensus engine proof of work to proof of stake and of course one thing that the world might notice and I think mainstream is taking note of is the massive electricity consumption decrease this is a tweet from fatalities quoting Justin Drake uh with a figure here the merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2 percent 0.2 percent right energy crazy that it shows up yeah electricity use might have just been diminished uh last night with this event unfolding and of course we reported on this last week but uh Google knows about the merge so if you type in the merge into Google there's now past tense happened on September 15th 9 hours 54 minutes ago and instead of two bears walking towards each other are one black one white there's now a panda very happy cute looking Panda holding the eth logo so Google knows about the merge the world knows about the merge right now like is this this thing is echoing everywhere it's super cool that uh Google did that by the way I'm just you know it it's awesome to see apparently there are a ton of ethereum a ton of even bankless fans in the Google community so if any Google employees are listening right now shout out enjoyable here uh it's good to see the solidarity uh this is actually historic historic moment not just for crypto but for the entirety of the the internet as well um David we're looking at a tweet about bortle.wtf what what is this portal was that website that everyone is looking at to predict when the merge was actually happening right it was the like it's how we knew when the merge was going to happen and as we got closer and closer and closer that thing just got hugged to death uh so the numbers were that the bortle.wtf website was free refresh over 13 million times from 7 million unique IP addresses uh absolutely crazy it crashed at the end uh and so then I had to go and I I had both bortle and ultrasound Dot Money open and then bortle crashed so I went to look at ultrasound.money and then moments later ultrasound.money went down uh because maybe you were displaying it this is are you talking about on the the live stream the official I mean I wasn't displaying mine but just like everyone was looking at the same like four websites that were telling you when the merge was happening and like one by one by one they all went down yeah I got hugged to death huh yeah uh this is these are some images as it was happening David what are we looking at here yeah this is the ethereum foundation offices in Denver uh and we have Danny Ryan on the far left facing away from the camera and we've got Tim bego at the bottom people just like sitting on the ground like watching One TV there's Austin Griffith holding up the phone on the couch on the right there's Kevin a walkie in the bottom right corner a few other people that I don't remember don't recognize but just a ton of people yeah a ton of these ethereum development teams people really close to the heart of ethereum all this like sitting around waiting for the merge to happen and then here is a tweet from Raul Jordan out of Prismatic labs and he says when you meet on Reddit and four years later reduce the world's energy consumption by half a percent some fluctuation on the numbers here and of course this is Rel Jordan and Preston Van Loon two co-founders of Prismatic who met on Reddit I can kind of relate to this you know meeting co-founders on the internet and they're celebrating the uh the transition to proof of stake these guys have just been putting their Blood Sweat and Tears into a fantastic ethereum client out of Prismatic labs and so I'm sure these guys are just over the moon right now Preston I know particularly has been itching to merge for a very long time so congrats to both Raul and Preston here yeah he's absolutely been driving this forward it's funny that um how web2 facilitates kind of the the meeting of Founders and mines in web3 it's really an enabler of web3 like they met on Reddit you and I met on Twitter I mean so many people are like using web 2 tools using the internet itself to build out the property rights Slayer the next layer of the internet that's cool the other thing I'll say about the developers and I would always remind folks listening to thank your developers you know have you have you how do you think that a developer today seriously have you thanked a core developer this is my thank you for these two individuals especially because I remember when they stepped up to the plate in 2018 when it seemed like no one else was I I replied this under their tweet as a thank you I remember I thought eve2 would never ship then Prismatic Labs stepped up and said we're doing this no funding guarantees you guys just started building it was such a confidence boost to the eth community during a difficult time that was an epic bear Market in 2018 and my sincere thanks to Raul and Preston van loom and the Prismatic team and all of the other client teams out there that made this happen we wouldn't be here without you guys we would have nothing to talk about yeah so here here is an interesting chart from quant.com where if you click on one of these you can just see the ethereum hash rate dropped to zero wow like that that is going from uh it's like a lunar price yeah that's it's a it's a price chart you don't want to see but no that that purple line that blue line is it the hash power of ethereum and you can see it start to dwindle off up to the moment of the merge and then the merge happens and it just it just goes to zero this absolutely goes to zero there's a the subreddit R ether mining which it was actually a separate I've frequented quite often back in my mining days and here's a guy playing bagpipes while he shuts off his uh his mining rigs which I thought was just hilarious there still are some at-home um miners huh a few of them yeah this looks like a basement somewhere there's a decent number of hobbyist miners left in the world even uh even after their margins have gotten compressed uh if you haven't ever like gone down the mining Rabbit Hole just cruising down our ether mining it's kind of like an interesting uh an interesting uh Expedition into the world of uh of mining uh but now it is a relic of the past yes the if this your services are no longer needed and the minor watch has ended we'll need to go somewhere else uh essentially the holders of ether now become the miners of the ethereum network through proof of stake um this is a tweet from hasu what are we looking at yeah so as the miners power down and shut off Mev boost is powering on so hazu says Mev boost is live so now we're waiting for a validator to request a block using the new Builder API in just a quick refresher onto what Meb Mev boost is is that building a block is can be intensive you can do like naive block building is when you just like take in a bunch of transactions that have a bunch of high fees or you can recruit the sources of a professional block Builder that can extract some Mev from you and hopefully some some Optimum non-malicious Mev which is what Mev boost is doing and so as soon as the merge happened Meb boost went live saying hey you guys can as stakers as validators can feel free to request blocks from Mev boost using the new Builder API and hazu's tweeting here saying we're waiting waiting for validators to request blocks and then a few moments later uh if you've scroll down Ryan he goes there's it happened just landed in slot 47 million the first ever block produced by Mev boost apparently there was also a war room with the flashbots team and then right after that first block was created by me view boost a second block was created after that so Mev boost as miners shut down Mev boost is up and running so congrats to the flashboss team as well if you do not know what Mev boost is or what David was talking about just then we've got some resources for you so there's an episode that we put out with flashbots on Mev boost go check that out also another episode with Matt Cutler you can Google just type in bankless Matt Cutler and you'll get that episode and learn all about Mev boost it's an important addition to the protocol David let's take a look at ultrasound money this is uh I've been I've been itching to go here it's so good it's so this is the best website now to see in a post merge world all of the stats this is basically a dashboard of ethereum's issuance monetary policy right ether the assets a dashboard for all of these things maybe we'll highlight a few things that my eye is immediately drawn towards the the top of course we are post merged and the supply change since the merge went live is negative 203 eth I'm sure by the time people are listening this this will be far higher than it is right now but what this means is ever since the merge was deployed earlier today at the time of recording we have been burning more ether than we've been issuing so ether as an asset is officially ultra sound money burning more than it's issuing it's deflating the supply is not increasing for the first time ever supply of ether is actually going down what does this mean David it really is nice to see the first to where are we at like 10 hours of post merge ether being net deflationary I remember checking this when I went to bed and we were down to like negative 80 eth and there's actually been a moment inside of the last 10 hours where actually supply has gone up so I think we we immediately started burning like rapid like right after the merge because of all the activity I think we went down to like negative 100 each and then we went up to up to negative 70 each but then we started burning again because gas fees have gone up but what really draws my eye Ryan is back up to that chart just look at that slope up to the merge look how steep that slope is uh and that is ether issuance out of proof of work and then the merge happens and it the slope just stops so it actually straight up looks like a mountain peak uh and so a lot of a lot of burning right at the start a little bit of issuance and then a lot like something happened starting a few hours ago um and and we are definitely net deflationary bigly uh it's gonna be it's going to be interesting to watch can we maintain that deflation moving forward into the future for how long uh but right really this is the time to to really look at this website and like look at these ultrasound money mechanisms as long as gas prices are above 15 way average we will be burning more Ethan we're issuing that's what ultrasound money says as well they've run the numbers around this uh total eth Supply is 120 million 500 total eats supplies 125 total eats supplies 120 million 520 000 and some odd eth and you wonder how high each Supply will actually get I know uh Justin Drake has predicted at times that we won't ever get Beyond 122 million right so just you know 2 million more they could also be the case that we never get Beyond 121 million right so we don't know where this is going to start and stop the last thing I'll say on this I think we'll be doing more on each monetary policy in the future but um if you want a friend in your life maybe with a suit somebody who's kind of financially minded who looks at their assets and actually analyzes them if you want them to understand the mechanics of ether as an asset send them to bankless of course give them download some some of our episodes on this also send them to the ultrasound.money website if they understand all of the numbers on this page and where they came from I don't know how you can't be bullish after understanding all of this yeah that's a good point uh and so that is the place to send folks particularly in this post merge world uh and as we are recording something is happening on ethereum that is sending gas prices through the absolute roof right now relative roof gas is up to 78 gray 79 gray and it's not because ether is dumping so something's happening on ethereum we started this segment at 203 ether burnt uh we are up to 214 ether Burns so we have burnt 11 ether since starting to talk about this ultrasound.money website and I think if we hang around here for a second there it goes 214 200 218 we just burnt four more ether since I started this sentence this is so awesome and here's hazu saying eth is now the commodity money with the lowest rate of Supply inflation uh it's the number one stop if you are a believer in stock to flow The Ether stock to flow number is like five ten times higher than Bitcoins right now it's like breaking breaking that metric there is no commodity money with a lower rate of inflation than ether so if that makes you bullish you should be bullish and here's a chart from Martin koppelman that is showing the block times of the last 100 blocks and you can clearly see when the merge comes in proof of work when a proof of work averages uh you know pre-merge averages one block every 13.6 seconds but it averages that and so it fluctuates around that all the time and there was a there was a block that took you know something like I think two or three minutes up until the merge some blocks happen as quick as like two or three seconds but then you see the merge happen in this very organized uh proof of stake system allows for blocks to happen extremely regularly every 12 seconds and so that random block production that happens 13.6 seconds on average is now happening every 12 seconds with no fluctuation there's that there's that one little Spike where somebody missed a block and so that went from 12 seconds to 24 seconds but that was like irregular right every other block is at 12 seconds this looks like the uh the heartbeat of an entirely different organism yeah some proof of work to proof of stake the pattern is completely different also David you were helping to host the live stream as proof of as proof of stake was was going live and as as the merge was actually happening and uh you're saying earlier there's between 40 to 50 000 concurrent uh Watchers as as the merge was was occurring over you know quarter million total views so far and you had an opportunity to explain the merge in like one minute to all of these people how did that feel yeah it was like I I when we were organizing the call they're like David do you want to explain what the merge is I'm like I have been preparing for this my entire life yes yes I do want to explain the emerge in the most simple reductive way possible uh bankless listeners tell me how I did because here here we go proof of stake component of the beacon chain is like bumping out the proof of work minors for the ethereum the main ethereum consensus uh and so this merge what we are all here for today on the stream is to watch the event where the beacon chain the proof-of-state consensus of the beacon chain becomes the actual consensus of the main ethereum chain and all of the various clients there are many clients of ethereum there's different um they're instead of one canonical ethereum there's a five six many different clients of ethereum and each one of these are syncing with each other and the beacon chain to all uh listen to The Beacon chain all at the same time all at the same uh what is the TTD number total terminal difficulty a very large number and once we hit that number all of a sudden the main ethereum chain will start to listen to The Beacon chain instead of the miners and in that moment we will have merged with a beacon chain and become proof of stake so Fizz that is what the merge is and that is why we are all here today on this live stream David that was great man I think he did a great job there um there's also been some we've done it a few times yeah yes you have BankPlus has trained you for this um there's also been increasing mainstream coverage so maybe we should read a few headlines the New York Times can the merge save crypto the headline of their article this is The Verge ethereum just completed the merge here's how much energy it's saving the subtitle is a step into a more sustainable future for cryptocurrencies this is CBS News ethereum's merge is live here's what you need to know I love in the beginning of this segment I think they are showing an Elizabeth Warren tweet maybe um concerned about environmental impacts of cryptocurrencies which goes away in the merge World here's CNBC ethereum's massive software upgrade just went live here's what it does David we are breaking out into into mainstream like we said earlier this is the biggest event I think crypto has seen in the entire world has been watching yeah and of course as we predicted they're all talking about energy reduction which is a valid thing to talk about they've been your energy reduction is 0.2 percent of all Global electricity consumption that's massive uh and so I mean it's not the things that we get really excited about but to each their own if that's what's going to grab people's attention uh that's that's what's going to grab people's attention absolutely it is a it is a vital Improvement um so if you are wondering what the projected APR is this is of course some pre-merge projections but I think could be fairly close to the money we'll see how closely they live up to those expectations 6.1 percent APR is the estimate put out by a flashbots report based on the median estimated ethereum staking yields given block space demand over the last six months and this number David includes all of the block rewards for validators it also includes Mev so 6.1 percent might be a guess at where we start now whether that holds whether that goes up or down my guess is it probably heads in the direction of down unless blocks based demand drastically increases and then maybe that number goes up the reason it would head down is because I sort of anticipate more and more people will stake remember staking at this point guys is it's a one-way ticket right so you go in you can't come back out so it has to increase over time it's not going in the other direction but if block space demand Mev fees these sorts of things perform even better we get kind of another Bull Run for Block space demand then maybe this number goes up as well and of course David mihal has another website for us to take a look at he's of course the guy that created crypto fees on info moneyprinters.info Layer Two fees dot info you've seen us use his websites on the roll up all the time there's now simplestakers dot info which is telling you all the different ways you can get apy on staked eth derivative token so coinbase is CBE anchor Lido state likewise rocket pool all of the apis you can get by holding that staked token but he's also included an extra little an extra little bit of data which is also really helpful because you know these tokens the coinbase CBE token actually trades against ether not necessarily one to one uh so coinbase CB ether is trading against one ether at 0.97 meaning there's a three percent discrepancy and so he David Miha has also added the dislocation of the staked eth derivative tokens versus ether itself and so if you uh buy that point that coinbase CB ether 4.97 e for one eth you actually get an effective apy of 7.95 because you're buying that safety token as a at a discount and a three percent discount really useful website I'm wondering where he's getting this apy from because he I'm wondering if the actual transaction fees are actually coming into this uh this website because this kind of just seems like issuance uh off to Ping David's and ask yeah the the other thing I think it's very important if you're evaluating where to stake uh of course is apoy is only one side of the equation the other side of the equation is risk what you actually want to understand is your risk adjusted Awards rewards and none of these API websites David mihal or anyone else can't can't really assess quantitatively the risk of some of these centralized staking providers so just know that there's some risk listen to our episode with Justin Drake on censorship resistance if you want to find out more about that well David I think that wraps up the merge this has been a historic week we of course are very glad you could join us bankless nation in celebrating the ethereum merge never going to happen again oh but if you are still itching for more merged content there are some live streams and some videos that are available on the bankless YouTube if you miss them while we did them live but of course coming up on Tuesday I'm so excited for this one Ryan we are hosting Danny Ryan and Tim Baco the two lead coordinators behind this whole entire merge effort on the state of the nation guess what the title of that episode's gonna be Ryan uh I think I know what it is yeah it's merged merged that's of course it is uh so we're gonna talk to these guys about like the journey to get to where we are today and of course what Margarita they're drinking or pina colada they're drinking as they celebrate very well-deserved rest from a bunch of just I'm sure frustrating and and exciting times in ethereum and then coming up after that on the Monday podcast the week after that we have vitalik for the next steps for ethereum because there's still plenty of work to do while it does feel like we got something finished it also feels like this is just the beginning for ethereum and the optimism and excitement around the broader ether Community I think has got to be at all-time highs Ryan I mean how do you feel I'm absolutely thrilled David it goes to kind of maybe I'll save some of this to the end of what I'm excited about but this uh ethereum Community has really shown its strength and shown its metal and uh I'm excited to be able to ship this important upgrade I think it can for confirms a lot of the like the e-thesis and the bankless thesis that we've been talking about so much on our show over the past couple of years yeah speak of italic though coming up next vitalik somehow found the time to go to Ukraine crazy like just before merge week we're gonna talk about that also Starbucks putting reward points on the blockchain what's happening what does that mean and we tell you the crypto co-founder who's just been issued a warrant for arrest all that more coming up first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrum is an

bankless so somehow during the the eve of the merge the week or so before the merge fatalik had had the time and the and the balls to go into the middle of a war zone uh to go to a Kiev Texas it's also really nice to see that that uh kiev's hosting things like Tech Summits uh but then vitalik of course tweets saying big thanks to the Kiev Tech Summit and everyone involved for the opportunity to visit an amazing and brave community in Ukraine that we all have a lot to learn from and there's some pictures of him in Kiev at the Kiev Tech Summit I just want to emphasize David how badass this is of vitalik okay this is he's going to a conference in Ukraine and it's wartime and this was a hackathon that was hosted in a bombshell shelter and vitalik both found the time and had the courage to fly over and talk to the developers in Ukraine um I just think that's a such a stark contrast with a lot of the individuals we that we see in the crypto space who are here and I don't necessarily fault them I mean sometimes I do so if you're scanning if you're scamming someone I fault you but a lot of people aren't here for the mission a lot of a lot of people are here for the for the money uh they're here for the kind of the short the short term opportunity vitalik it's been clear has never been here for that purpose and uh you know things like this prove it to us yeah absolutely it's just surreal to watch him like be like this like monk figure like walk around the world as they're like some people in crypto have like four or five bodyguards vitalik is going with a single backpack to a into our war war zone absolutely crazy anyways on the other side of the world uh polygon tweets out guess what's brewing today Starbucks unveil Starbucks Odyssey on polygon a unique experience that enables you to earn and buy digital collectible stamps and unlock new and coveted coffee experiences so basically web3 Starbucks is coming to web3 Ryan through a loyalty program allowing uh customers and and Starbucks employees to purchase digital collectible stamps in the form of nfts and it's all going to be done on polygon so loyalty token rewards on the blockchain that's kind of cool it's uh you know Brew to earn I think is what some people are are calling this um but you know here's a fun fact for you I read this back back in 2019 did you know that that Starbucks is actually one of the largest is like a stable coin giant like the Starbucks cards for instance this is back in 2019 I'm sure they have more today at 1.6 billion dollars in Starbucks bucks right they're basically like internal Ledger stable coins and so you kind of start with nfts and I wonder if that leads Starbucks into kind of like payment and stablecoin issuance and you know you could turn that Starbucks stable coin into an erc20 couldn't you I'm not sure you're you're uh you're making some real crypto terms out of these things just to make this real crystal yeah yeah what's going on here is there are 1.6 billion dollars of credits that people have purchased in like Starbucks cars like you you spend twenty dollars a hundred dollars a thousand dollars to buy Starbucks points on a Starbucks card right and so that goes into a Starbucks bank account and they credit you with that thousand dollars or whatever you bought on your Starbucks card kind of acting like a thousand dollars right yes yeah but yeah so like they the Starbucks Starbucks is getting a yield on the money that you have credited them and instead of owing you a dollar liability they owe you coffee liabilities right and so they have all they have 100 1.6 billion dollars in the bank and they owe that in coffee to their customers it's just kind of a crazy model so it goes to show like the larger and larger of a fintech or yeah as you get larger and larger no matter what your business is you ultimately turn into a bank like yeah Starbucks started selling coffee but now it's just getting yield on customer deposits they're a coffee financing company yeah so they are coffee financing yeah yeah it's very interesting I I do think that there's a role to play here but anyway to say like starting with nfts that's very cool and loyalty points uh and then maybe maybe stable coins in the future as well um but speaking of nfts David Solana nfts are hitting all-time highs they're kind of having a moment right now what's going on it was a big surge on Solana for nft minting so there were 300 000 mints on one day on September 7th they spike out of nowhere and I did like some two minutes of research to figure out what nft drop this was it doesn't seem to be like there was one particular drop I could be wrong about that so people that are more familiar with the salon ecosystem can go check that from themselves but it just seems like they're it's like aggregate volume just surged for one day on Solana volume across all salon and marketplaces hit 11.5 million dollars on September 6th um cool all right that's pretty impressive I think Salon is getting definitely some strong Traction in the nft community so we'll see where that goes next um while in the in in contrast while ethereum is merging and forsaking proof of work abandoning proof of work for proof of stake uh a cup last week before before this happened the White House apparently just issued an environmental report on the impact criticizing the impact of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin saying that they could impede U.S efforts to combat climate change and this report David came out of the White House Office of Science and Technology uh and um they said they recommended that the U.S take action to mitigate the pollution tied to crypto production now the report apparently stopped short of prescribing specific regulations but this is definitely a shot across the bow for Bitcoin and the whole proof of work industry it's kind of not ethereum's problem anymore in one way because ethereum is no longer proof of work their proof of stake and I guess the ethereum community could take a posture to say hey it's not our problem it's like proof of Works problem Bitcoins problem and yet this does seem to be some sort of um stifling or government intervention on something that's happening in the free market and I know there are different takes in the crypto Community about this and in the ethereum community about this what's your take do you think that there's a role for the federal government to like restrict use of energy in in certain sectors or for specific reasons yeah uh no definitely not uh the government should not be determining what is good or bad use of energy yet at the same time I am like empathetic to the argument that like energy is more and more and more precious these days especially as like you know the world population grows global warming continues like we have to pick and choose our battles as to how we want our energy pointed and that I feel like that's where this uh the White House Office of science and technology is really coming from is like yes there's a limited supply of energy in the United States that we have Bitcoin is using a decent chunk of it um if Bitcoin grows perhaps we should do something to make sure that there's more energy for other other things as well I understand that perspective but never should there ever be some sort of ban against proof of work or should there be a statement essay who gets to consume what energy well it's interesting like the arbitrary nature of this and I think proof of work Advocates have to have talked about this before just like why are you picking on proof of work I mean didn't you tell me we had a conversation earlier this morning and uh you said some stat that um that resonated with me is like did you know YouTube consumes more energy than Bitcoin right I don't know about by about like 33 or so right so what if the US government said hey YouTube is consuming too much energy it's just a waste of time these are dumb like cat videos and bankless podcasts like who cares let's just make a podcast oh turn it off yeah it's like clearly useless and so I don't um think I I don't uh my problem is not with some government policy around um disincentivizing like or incenting kind of energy use in kind of Greener ways it's around the specific targeting of an industry it's like is it it's not a better way to put kind of a blanket tax on all energy use to kind of curtail demand and accomplish a specific purpose that way you're not targeting like you know uh Bitcoin mining over Christmas lights I mean who's to say which is which is more valuable and to me when you start to get into these political decisions uh as you know some bureaucrats deciding what's good use of energy and what's a bad use of energy you start to get into some real trouble you lose the credible neutrality of of the federal government but so I do think I I stand with bitcoiners on on that side of things and proof of work on that side of things although I'm still of the ethereum mindset of like guys you don't have to be using proof of work right like proof of stake is it's kind of better so uh there's an element where I'm not going to fight it too hard personally one thing I am looking forward to is you know the bitcoiner narrative is that Bitcoin consumes green energy and it doesn't get enough credit for all of the green energy that it consumes right and like I have a hard time understanding if that is like a classic bitcoiner narrative that like kind of just like chant the chant about or if that's actually backed up by data and so I'm I'm a fan of this topic surfacing because I would love some clarity on that from more people both inside the Bitcoin Camp that's not just the Cyber Hornets that attack me on Twitter and also outside of the Bitcoin Camp from like more people that like don't have a dog in the fight um although I'm not saying the White House will necessarily be biased I'm just saying I would love Clarity on this statement is Bitcoin does Bitcoin mining incentivize green energy I used to be a fan of that argument I'm becoming less and less of a fan of that argument as time goes on yeah I I agree and if you can eliminate it entirely it's it's hard to see how that is not better environment the greatest thing to do is to just not consume energy but bitcoiners will take offense to that meanwhile Michael Saylor doesn't care he is buying more Bitcoin microstrategy files to sell access I think so microstrategy files to sell up to 500 million of stock to fund more Bitcoin purchases wow that is insane dude it's definitely ballsy I you got to give him credit for that this is like or maybe you don't maybe you could maybe you could say it's like uh you know um fiducially irresponsible to investors in microstrategy but it's certainly interesting I mean I can't knock someone for being a permeable I guess so I I still content David that this will way out this will play out for him yeah and this is going to lower his average his cost basis by such a big number well done buying lower I guess I mean 500 million of stock to fund more Bitcoin purchases uh absolutely incredible uh this is an interesting headline out of a Zero Hedge uh China back amongst the top 10 countries in Bitcoin usage despite the Bitcoin ban uh and so even though Bitcoin is banned in China uh it has resumed its top 10 position I believe in number 10 number 10 as the country that uses Bitcoin the most uh cool You Can't Ban crypto I mean that's the takeaway right you can only ban your citizens from accessing crypto and apparently not even that speaking of banning um the tornado cash saga continues ofac just updated their frequently asked questions so I of course I of course uh read them I wanted to get some of the highlights I'll show that in a minute but I've got good news for you David yeah you and I might not be going to jail oh thank God and here here's the thing so there was a every time there's a knock on my door I'm like oh sweet it was something that happened like I was it four or five weeks ago right now of course uh you know tornado was put smart contracts were put in the ofax sanction list uh and then somebody dusted a whole bunch of public influential eth addresses including Jimmy Fallon Steve Aoki Logan Paul all the exchange CEOs Brian Armstrong vitalik you me the rest and what Ryan means by dusted is that somebody sent .1 ether to all of these addresses from the tornado cash contract making them in violation of the ofek rule exactly and without our consent very clearly be like somebody if if somebody sent a a you know and robbed a bank and then deposited that money into your account yeah exactly or if they sent exactly they've robbed the bank and deposited money into your account uh and then um are you a criminal or not right that's that's the question and of course you and I think that would be absolutely ludicrous for Treasury and for ofac to take that posture well although I'm totally willing for people to rob banks and them to put that money in my account I'm totally down for that you should not say that on a podcaster um this is a FAQ oh fact trying to clear this up do ofac reporting obligations apply to dusting transactions the issue that you and I just mentioned and it starts by saying ofac is aware of these things and I'll read the statement here technically ofax regulation would apply to these transactions okay so if somebody Robs a Bank deposits it into your bank account it's your problem David your problem somebody uh takes from tornado cash and sends it to your eth address without your consent without even your knowledge it is your problem technically that's what ofax position is to the extent however these dusting transactions have no other sanctions Nexus besides tornado cash ofac will not prioritize enforcement against delayed receipt of initial blocking reports and subsequent annual reports of blocked property from such U.S persons okay what they're saying here is technically it's a crime okay but we're gonna lower the priority through which we prosecute this prize we're at the end of the list that's what they're saying and it is asking as well I think the reading of this is they somehow want anyone who received some dust to file a report with ofac yeah I'm not gonna do that absolutely it's an absolutely it's an absolutely unbelievable um position um here are some of some more of the the frequently asked questions one was um what is prohibited as a result of ofax designation of tornado cash and ofac has clarified that if you're a U.S citizen and you do anything with tornado cash you are uh prohibited from doing that as a result of ofac and then they make this stuff menu though yeah that's not new but they're clarifying this but I found this uh funny the terminated cash website has been deleted from the internet what a statement they said that out loud but it clearly remains available through certain internet archives so uh don't worry guys the tornado the powers that be from the internet do not look at the man behind the curtain oh my God audacity yeah you didn't delete it from ethereum bro you can't delete the tornado cash website from the internet either do you remember there was a Beyonce did a super the Super Bowl halftime show one year I don't know this is like seven years ago or something like this there's like this terrible herbal picture of her that was posted where she was in this really awkward dance position and like after the fact her PR team her crew was trying their utmost to like delete Beyonce's picture from the internet that is a fooled Fool's errand you can't delete things from the internet that's not how this stuff works it's the Streisand Effect anyway that's some of the language coming through from from ofact so um you know clearly there will be uh court cases about this and we'll have to get some clarity in the court system because these are not tenable these are not reasonable positions um to say that if you get a dusted transaction yeah you're still doing something illegal we're just gonna put you at the end of the list in priority and like we'll talk to you later yeah like we could still come after you at any time just you're not going to be at the top of the list like what is that how is how is how is that tenable in a you know Matthew green restore the tornado cash contract so into a new version of on GitHub he did now I'm gonna go download those and put them on my wallet they did say that that is actually legal so that was another FAQ so it's not deleted from the internet they were talking about the user front end by the way they were not talking about the actual code they did understand that much they were talking about it myself yes it specifies that so a website has since been deleted internet cash website yes um okay but of course that can be hosted on ipfs that could be like there's you can't really delete the website um but yes they did clarify that if a U.S citizen copies and pays um you know and it hosts hosts of the tornado cash code in a git coin repository somewhere that is not illegal according to them well I was gonna put it on my wall anyways regardless of whether it is that would be fine that was always allowed that's all always allowed um speaking of things where people are actually getting in trouble for doing illegal things uh dogwon uh now has an arrest warrant uh for his arrest in South Korea so a court in Seoul issued a warrant for dokon and five others uh allocating that they violated the nation's capital markets law which I don't know what that means sounds very broad but yeah I bet there's something in there where like if you are responsible for imploding 50 billion dollars of capital that you probably broke some law somewhere uh and so yeah there is a warrant out for his arrest dokwan has said that he plans to cooperate when the time comes and he said that in this uh crypto interview media startup coinage when he uh that floated the prospect of jail time to dokwon and dokwon finished saying life is long meaning that like wow a lot of life to live so I might as well just like go to jail and pay this time and just go through it okay uh it's incredibly stoic we'll uh yeah we'll have to see where that that ends up and not only dokwan it was five others five others too involved in the company with dokwan so um that's happening meanwhile the the SEC in the US is setting up a new office where you can come in tell them about your crypto project this is going to be called the office of crypto assets so the statement here from the SEC is as a result of recent growth in the crypto assets and the life sciences Industries we saw a need to provide greater and more specialized support the SEC is coming up with an office apparently where you can go and talk to them I have yet to hear of a case where that's actually been useful for a real world crypto project that is trying to get some clarity on the asset class and and their position with respect to the asset class uh I don't know it's kind of a and speak of untenable positions it seems like an untenable position for the SEC to want to take leadership in crypto in the US and like not provide any free framework where it's legal or any Clarity where we can do these kinds of things in a legal way they're taking a very hostile approach while also saying that they want to be like the the place where you can come in and have a nice conversation with them I mean these things very much seem at odds so until they fix that I'm not sure that this will provide a lot of clarity or use for people building things in the real world in crypto yeah I want to make fun out of this because that's usually my default response but they do say that as a result of the recent growth in crypto uh we need we saw a need to provide greater and more specialized support more specialized support is what we have been asking for so like I can't knock that like keep going down that path but like still call me skeptical right like I wouldn't want to be the first or second or third organization to walk in through that office I'm just kind of getting like Dolores on bridge Vibes like when you you're walking yeah step into my office and then like your Harry Potter and you're like writing scars into your hands like I will not issue a legal security yeah there's something look there's an element to that just to contrast that with another uh us executive branch agency the cftc which has been much more welcoming to the crypto agency and kind of like talking about what uh is possible rather than all the things you cannot do and providing a much more clarity in in in the field of Commodities so that's that's a good contrast point but coinbase is starting to fight back even more uh this was a really cool move starting today from Brian Armstrong coinbase will begin integrating our crypto policy efforts right into our app this will help so Chad I know these will help our 103 million verified users get educated on crypto positions held by political leaders where they live and this is Brian showing a video of what the app looks like and you can actually see like here is uh a Democrat from District 9 York City and her crypto sentiment is uh positive you can see uh Caroline Maloney a Democrat New York District 12. her crypto sentiment is negative it displays all of these things inside of the app so that the 103 crypto users of coinbase can actually see where their politicians stand on this and the idea is I think Brian was pretty explicit um for instance U.S users can see crypto sentiment scores from members of Congress he says and then he says over time we want to help Pro crypto candidates solicit donations from the crypto Community he's being very explicit about this um why are we doing this because this will drum up donations from a base who wants the ability and right to own crypto in their jurisdiction does not want unfair laws and legislation against crypto this is so awesome like he like Brian and coinbase is just building piping of crypto money into crypto positive legislations in an easy to use app uh my God is that going to move the needle so much like and so like imagine being a senator and like you're seeing this like rating app of your of your like how loving you are to this particular industry that is so like where crypto so important to them that they're putting it in the main crypto app the coinbase app I know right it's built into the the most consumer friendly app of all time just like does this person support or not support crypto all it's missing and I don't know the legality of doing this but all it's missing is a button that says donate to this politician look at it Richie Tori's uh Democrat New York district 15 is very supportive nice button there imagine donate donate donate donate like coinbase already has all of your kyc information so they can just pass that along because you need to do that and if you're going to donate to somebody yeah like the the infrastructure is already there uh and I was talking about this I can't remember where on some podcast live stream I've been on Australian live streams the last like four days um crypto has the two things and we've talked about this before bankless has the two things that legislators want and need the most single issue highly motivated voters and money and coinbase is the host of a 104 million people who have money and care about crypto uh and now they're being piped in directly to like these congressmen and women I expect this to be such a huge help to the industry at large coinbase Brian yeah well done this is huge this is uh yeah big supporters of this this is coinbase uh showing up I think for crypto and defy in a way that we need most and if you don't think we need this I would encourage you to go back and listen to what we just said about ofac and tornado cash right David and I received a criminal transaction and ofac says we did something illegal yeah that's what they said in their FAQ I mean that's just not tenable and the only way we have to fight against this is money and votes and that's what that's what coinbase is is hoping to to provide the crypto communities the knowledge to allocate that money and those votes to the right places so we can push back on some of these unelected bureaucrats saying we don't have the right to unchain privacy so yeah big big plus one on that David what are we looking at here yeah this is a website that I wish was around in 2017. it's called token.onlocks.app and it's basically uh just being a reporting service for token unlocks so that is like Angel seed investors like or like seed rounds like series a series B token supplies are locked because of like like vesting schedules right so if you're an early investor you get your token locked up so that it can start to trade on the secondary market and that thing doesn't go to zero because all the early investors who bought it for very cheap are locked up for a certain amount of time and so this website is just like aggregating all of that information of how much of the token Supply is locked what are the next Supply unlocks what is that date how much is getting unlocked what's the circulating Supply what's the uh fully diluted valuation and so if you are worried about if you are if you should just like include this in your basic due diligence anytime you're ever going to buy a token so like usually if I'm going to buy a token I start on coin Gecko and I start to look at some of of that data but I think I would now go here next because I would then want to find out what is the what is the unlock schedule like is this thing like 90 liquid or 90 locked and if it's 90 locks like when's the next unlock coming who's gonna dump on me this is basically like it's the token website of course I'm going to repeat it token.unlocks.app could also be renamed are people going to dump on me and so you can go check on like if people are going to go dump on you or not yeah it's great to see this transparent see coming to crypto and I think it's something that I've not seen in stocks so it's kind of neat to see this in crypto um single dashboard we can view all of this uh this is some news coming out of Abra which is a crypto Bank based in the US they say today we are announcing the formation of Abra Bank the launch of Abra boost which is abra's new staking and yield offering and so this is Abra actually becoming a U.S state Chartered bank which is a full Bank not a trust and the digital asset space giving them the ability to do trading custody investing nfts credit cards and more and here's the justification according to their CEO Abra intends to be the premier web 3 and crypto Bank in the world while we believe in the ethos of not your keys not your coins we recognize that consumers and Institute institutions need help navigating crypto enter Abra Bank this to me I think is a narrative that we'll see there have been some banks that survived 2022 some crypto Banks right and they did things because they were you know much more prudent much less risk seeking than the Celsius of the world didn't make mistakes like block fi and I do think we're going to see a Resurgence of crypto Banks and the Resurgence I I'm hopeful David that these crypto banks will have learned their lesson from 2022 become much more transparent become much more defy friendly uh and I do think that there is a role for them to play as a risk not everyone can go completely bankless from day one and so we need sort of a you know a bridge at times in the meanwhile so I'll be monitoring the progress of of Abra and what they're doing there and like crypto banks in general yeah with the power of crypto new Banks can just be better than the old Banks and it's as simple as that moving into the world of binance chain Ryan did you know binance chain is actually doing ZK roll-ups is that the test net launches of zkbnb the first ZK roll-up on the binance smart chain uh so ZK Tech is not easy and so like there must be a pretty good team behind this too and of course buying and train has the second most second largest defy ecosystem after ethereum and they're generating a decent amount of fees so it actually makes sense that a ZK roll-up would eventually come to binance chain uh so binding chain becoming modular ZK technology is definitely not just uh for ethereum it's for any kind of modular modular blockchain now yeah the weird thing about deploying this on binance is because you'd think you'd want a fully decentralized settlement layer in order to escape scale your layers well you would think you would want that in the first place I think we're already that  is already sailed we'll watch to see what emerges there uh a new wallet a bankless custody style wallet self-custody wallet called plasma wallet has just arrived I've not tested this myself but it looks polished it does look Polished in fact I think I saw an image of the bankless podcast in one of these screenshots do you see that David oh wait really yeah we'll spin this around here is that US Weekly roll out there it is last week's merch or a weekly roll-up we have not tried this I love this wall yes we have not tried this I don't know too much about their team to be honest um but uh if you are on the frontier and want to try a new non-custodial wallet go check it out at plasmahyphenwallet.com let us know what you think and uh it's great to see more innovation in the space and lastly the Opera browser is now supporting metamask and other third-party wallets and so if that has been the blocker for you to use Opera uh because Opera didn't support metamask well that blocker is gone you can now support metamask inside of Opera and moving in to the raises this week Doodles coming in at a massive 704 million dollar valuation wow after raising 54 million does that feel like a bear Market valuation team you did not feel like almost a billion dollar valuation coming in from uh Alexis ohanians 776 FTX Ventures and a few others as well uh I'm not sure how I would feel as an NFC owner if the centralized team raises money I might feel like I'm the product here but to some degree like Spec's kind of what people might want if that's their Vibe this is kind of the board Apes model right versus like oh yeah definitely like the board Apes model yeah there's a place for it these valuations though are absolutely insane I'm not sure what they're based on um right hopefully these investors know what they're doing here and uh good luck to the Doodles team and the other raids of the week Koopa Troopa announces Coop Records fund number one uh Cooper Turley uh raising 10 million dollar early stage fund investing in the next generation of music and music nfts Cooper of course is known as the music nft guy and actually this last week Ryan during all of the merge hype during all the other live streams and podcasts that I did managed to get Cooper on the show a 20 minute episode as to what is what are music nfts and I think the crypto Community the the crypto Twitter Community has always been like kind of teasing Cooper is like why would I buy a music nft like what does it do for me yeah and his answer has always been a collectible yeah but he gave me a line that I actually really liked which was don't overthink it you need 25 people to buy a music nft at point one eth to equal a million downloads on Spotify so music nfcs don't need to be much just the 100 super fans 100 super fans that need to buy your music nft you can think about utility later you can think about access later but like how squeeze the margins are for artists is so bad that Cooper's answer is do you just need 25 people to buy your music nft to generate an equivalent amount of money for the Artist as a million dollar or a million downloads on Spotify congratulations to Cooper I'm really optimistic to see this guys this guy's future yeah I mean he's he's definitely been doing a lot in this space um I guess maybe that's advice don't overthink it the 700 million dollar Doodles valuation don't overthink it David maybe it makes sense bankless jobs this is our time to remind you that we're in a post merge world the first time we're talking about getting a job in crypto and ethereum is 100 proof of stake at this point those things don't have anything to do with one another I just wanted to say it one more time here are the jobs of the week I'm going to read a few out on the bankless jobs board molecule is hiring a head of engineering Bank list needs a growth marketer that's us make this needs a growth marketer it's non-technical and it's dope yes economia who needs a lead designer Silence full stack smart contract engineer super form senior back-end engineer big green full stack engineer misari software Engineers they need two of them root needs a head of fundraising I couldn't logical but you can find all of these jobs on the bankless job boards bankless.palot.com jobs sign up you'll get these in your inbox wow we got more coming up David what's in store next we got the takes of the week there are four of them and of course David and Ryan get to talk about during merge week what we are bullish on I wonder what that could possibly be uh but we're gonna get to all the takes and the week also some merge related takes and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible ZK sync is an ethereum layer 2 Network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge Roll-Ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but crypto killer apps need ZK sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge Roll-Ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof Foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync the brave browser is the user first browser for the web 3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web3 is freedom from Big Tech and Wall Street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives Brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets Brave wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web 3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and Solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned Pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet Download Brave at brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started alright guys we are back with the takes of the week here's the first from Fubar post merge the most important Improvement that can be shipped talking about ethereum isn't proto-dank sharding though that's plenty useful it's enabling withdrawals because making it as easy as possible to withdraw from centralized custodial staking pools is critical to validator decentralization I do think that enabling withdrawals is the next feature to come in the roadmap uh anyway from a priority perspective but there is some element that we've that the developers have talked about before where they would combine withdrawals and and proto-dink sharding together in the same hard fork and I think Fubar is kind of making the case like don't do that not if it costs us time because what we need right now is to enable withdrawals and he's making the case for decentralization purposes that's the reason we need to uh enable withdrawals what do you think yeah and just elaborate on this it it deposits into coinbase deposits into Lido when they stake these this ether for you it's fixed because there aren't withdrawals so so all ether and Lido is stuck there and so if we have centralization concerns like coinbase or Lido has too much eth we need to enable withdrawals so we can get that to be jumbled up and mixed around with the others taking as a service providers um I I don't I mean I'm not I'm not a developer but I don't think the withdrawal hard Fork is all that complicated so I could definitely be an in support of like Expediting this this update yeah for sure same same here we'll we'll see how that evolves I think the core devs are taking a much needed break yes for a little bit let them have a margarita and then we will okay we can't ask for withdrawals right away not this week anyway and this is a take from you David the ethereum never ships narrative in quote is Dead skull crossbones why is that dead so this has been the narrative that ethereum just is like a bunch of vaporware and never is never going to ship proof of stake it's never going to ship scaling it's never going to ship it's never gonna ship and at this point we've shipped proof of stake we created and then shipped eip1559 inside of that time we have scaling on layer twos the only thing left is data sharding and it's like the less complicated update in comparison to the merge and so the ethereum never doesn't ship narrative is now dead and so if you are the person who is claiming that ethereum doesn't ship stuff of which there are plenty of these people like the onus is on you to prove that that update that's coming of whatever we're going to talk about isn't coming like it's no longer on the responsibilities of like the ethereum community or ethereum developers to convince you that ethereum ships we've now proven it out on the in the biggest of ways so the ethereum never ships narrative is dead I think a bunch of uh narratives have been kind of slayed uh as a result of the merge in fact we did an episode earlier this week with Justin Drake on 15 bad takes you should you should definitely Listen to I think the merge kind of uh one of them's already done which is the merch will never ship it sticks a fork in a lot of those and a lot of those takes for sure um this is my take do you want to read this out yeah sure Ryan shot Adam says with a shedding of proof of work ethereum is fully charting its own course inspired by yet distinct from Bitcoin from here on out ethereum is no longer living in Bitcoin Shadow little brother is all grown up Ryan what'd you mean by this I think that for all of ethereum's life it's been someone living in the shadow of Bitcoin it's been kind of the the little brother all of the attention is on elder brother Bitcoin who's off going to college and he's you know the football quarterback the captain like you know everyone cares about uh big brother and little brother has been kind of living in Big Brother's Shadow and someone like copying some of the moves of Big Brother yeah um more and more ethereum has kind of diverged from the Bitcoin roadmap of course at Genesis the big Divergence was expressive smart contracts on the base layer that certainly has been true and um you know now with the merge I think it's it's fully charting its own course uh the origination of of ethereum at the time the best technology available for a consensus layer was proof of work uh it's no longer the case and so ethereum had to copy Bitcoin in the early days but now it's clearly charting its own course and I do think this opens up an opportunity David for ethereum to take kind of the the main Flagship role right always much respect to the older brother who's gotten us this for far but it's time for ethereum to kind of live its own life and do its own thing and I think the world needs ethereum to take center stage in this whole crypto movement as well and um I I see this merge as kind of a milestone and a key point at which the trajectory changes and the industry's focus is more slanted on ethereum moving forward versus Bitcoin I don't know if everyone sees that but that was certainly my takeaway from uh from the merge events and maybe it'll be seen that way historically as well absolutely this is a very different way to express my eth BTC trade little brother little brother's gonna all grow them up stronger yeah ethereum finally decoupling from his bigger brother yeah personify take this is my favorite uh take that we've ever put on the weekly roll-up I think yeah metallic.e vitalik buterin says normalize saying dub instead of w as the name of the letter W he follows and says all letters deserve a one syllable name so vitalik is saying we should change we should we should Fork the English language and we should merge in a new pronunciation of the letter W because we should change it to dub which I am a huge fan of that is a great take why okay so all of the other letters in the alphabet are one syllable is that correct yeah I think so yeah okay but then we have this W that just sticks out like a like yeah you have you and you have W like how do you think W feels in comparison to you she's like oh I'm just like two abused like no I'm dub okay but I don't know if that flows as well in the song because like we need to u v that's fine dub XYZ dub XYZ yeah that's fine that flows I don't know I don't know I don't know if I uh support this vitalik take David how old is your youngest kid 11. she's 11 right now okay yeah too late too late to indoctrinate her with new ABCs yeah I think it's past for this generation you have to like start from scratch I don't know um my parents will never go for this David yeah what do you bullish on this week man I know the answer but tell me anyway I'm bullish on what I feel like is the next era of crypto it really feels like that was ethereum proof of work is like ethereum beta I know I know we kind of tea Solana for being a beta mainnet but like if they could call themselves beta I'll call ethereum proof of work beta uh and now like ethereum proof of stake layer twos uh sharding soon TM uh like it really and but that proof of stake thing is so critical that this really feels like the way that ethereum has always been meant to express when it was envisioned back in 2014 uh and so with with proof of work with like the dark cloud of proof of work energy consumption and Supply over uh Supply cell pressure it really feels like we're in a new paradigm of crypto not just for ethereum but you know we all know that like crypto as an industry trades like alongside Bitcoin well that's because bitcoin's proof of work ethereum has been proof of work up until now and so the it has been a proof of work Paradigm ever since ethereum is currently one half of bitcoin's market cap and that that's magnitude of market cap is now proof of stake uh and so this part of crypto the decentralized finance part is under a new paradigm it's a new era of crypto and so it really just feels like a zero to one moment for the crypto industry and it's going to take time for that to like show up in market prices and show up in activity but like this is what this is the version of crypto that I've been waiting for and been here for for years now and it's finally arrived to Ryan and bullish on a turning of the page for the industry I I really like that and and you know I jotted down as I was listening some of um vitalik's first comments in the post merge somebody asked them on the call post merge and he said this about the merge I think Hudson Jameson asked me how you feeling like what what does this mean he said this to me the merge symbolizes the difference between early stage ethereum and the ethereum we've always wanted right that's the kind of that shift a new era a different uh a new change so yeah that resonates with me as well Ryan what are you both Sean is it similar you know this is I I guess I could say similar right it's just definitely uh kind of merch related but let me um let me zoom out and talk about this in the context of my own personal uh crypto journey and maybe like the bankless journey as well because those things are are kind of intertwined I feel like we have just closed a major uh chapter David for ethereum as you just said the end of an era and the entrance of a new era um also for bankless at some level also for me my own personal thesis do you know um you and I many others in the ethereum community we're very early chanters of this meme that we started you know 2018 eth is money eth is money let's talk about this asset for its monetary properties and the reason that was so important to us was not number go up it was because we saw this fundamental link between the value of ether and the economic security of these of the network and those things could not be severed right right and it didn't make sense to think about a valueless eth right it was all kind of one unified theory of the world right and so um we were chanting this and had been um chanting it at nauseum for the last few years and that kind of evolved into like ultrasound money and the monetary premium properties of eth do you know what David I feel like I don't have to say it anymore yeah I feel like it's part of the DNA just I'm a minor man now my watch has ended too I don't have to say it anymore it's not I am going to talk about it I am going to say it from time to time ethus money this ultrasound money but you know from here on out there's no more pushing that we have to do it's just gonna freaking happen why go to ultrasound.money just go to that website you'll just see it happening like there's nothing crypto there's nothing the social layer has to do to make this happen anymore it's now it's gonna happen on its own and as the economics become more obvious more people will accept the fact that ether is an internet Bond ether is a store of value that's not issued by a nation state that's issued by an Internet Protocol like the entire thesis all the stuff we've been talking about and at some level David this is why we started bankless because this story hadn't been been told very well the story of D5 the story of going bankless the story of etha's money and the value that this network could bring now I just feel like it's it's it's done it's like my watch is ended so I think moving forward you and I don't have to actually Focus as much on getting the story out as of Ethan's money of course we're going to of course it's going to be important but this is also entering another chapter and it's just going to happen with us or without us with the community support or without the community's support because it's now it's fully baked into the algorithm itself right yeah the the values have been indoctrinated instantiated in the actual code and once it's there it's really hard to get it out and that's that's been the whole purpose ever since since I think that really just like begs the questions like all right then what's next what's the next thing to talk well no I think there's plenty left to talk about and one of the ways I've always described ethereum versus Bitcoin is that Bitcoin the blockchain is meant to serve BTC the asset like all the surrounding infrastructure is meant to do one thing which is preserve the 21 million hard cap of Bitcoin ethereum is the inverse of that where ether the currency is actually just meant to support ethereum the economy and we know that ethereum the economy doesn't only exist on the ethereum layer one now like it's the economy's escaped and it's got It's escaped into the layer twos and so now I think the story to be told anti-etherium's roll-up Centric road map we see the story manifesting itself with arbitrum Nova and it it uh ethereum finding its way into Reddit right that's what arbitrum Nova is is the ethereum escaping out of the layer one and building a chain that's specific for Reddit and that's the ethereum roll-up Centric road map and so I think this next era of ethereum is now that ethereum has taken care of itself it's gotten its security properties and its monetary properties unlock and like that thing is you know tie a bow on that and like that's the way that it's good to go the rest is building Roll-Ups layer twos and layer threes custom fit for different corners of the internet and putting economies and money and bankless tools in all corners of the internet and I think that's the final frontier of ethereum now that we are post merge yeah I totally agree and I think some of our content will uh will begin to reflect that we still gotta have a few more episodes of course on the merge uh coming up but um yeah I'm super excited to to enter into like the second chapter of not only ethereum but also bankless and start to explore these these Brave New Frontiers David we've got a meme of the week what are we looking at right now we are looking at the this meme of the crying Tick Tock dancer girl so she is for some reason bawling your eyes out while doing a tick tock dance and the caption is miners staking their eth post merge uh and so if you're a miner who's collected that Ethan you are now sticking it yeah you might be sad that your mining business is gone but hey at least you're staking and that's why this crying Tick-Tock girl is doing The Tick Tock dance she's still dancing piercing her eyes she's still dancing not giving up guys as always gotta end with risks and disclaimers of course ether is risky so is Bitcoin so is all of crypto you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier there are New Frontiers unfolding it's not for everyone but we're glad
