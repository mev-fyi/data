Reddit the social media website what are they building on arbitrim Nova what they're building is called Community points and what community points is it's live in you know particular subreddits today is a point system where you participate in the community you comment you you upload Etc and you get these points which are actually blockchain tokens delivered on arbitrary and the reason why that's so cool is because now users have self-sovereignty over these points so no longer can Reddit say hey I'm shutting down your account and now you lose your points users actually keep those points and they control those points and they're not controlled in a centralized database it's actually pretty forward thinking I've read it to offer this to users and to somewhat give up this control over these points but it's also very very very powerful and the reason why it's powerful is because it's an open ecosystem it's on arbitrinova and anyone else can launch an app here as well I can launch a game and the currency in my game are these Reddit Community points that's something which I can totally do so you're not only having the you know reddit's foundational you know Unity points here but you actually can have an ecosystem that builds around Community points
