the same way that the united states government like put a permanent bid on vaccines before they were developed would it be unprecedented for them to do something similar with energy markets that would be kind of like the 40s right so in the 40s they said look here's this war we're going to be a permanent bid for like building industrial facilities making war machines and you know you're gonna you're gonna get paid so if you had some sort of policy where they said look we are going to incentivize new production as quickly as possible i do think that would be one of the more productive uses of public capital the u.s said look if if prices go below x we will expand our strategic petroleum reserve we might have oversupply at some point that's kind of the history of public arrangements where they solve one problem and they create another overall it's just going to be a very challenging decade i think different countries are going to handle it differently i think some of them might try to do things like that other times i think the private sector can wake up and you know if you kind of get out of their way that they can go and do that
