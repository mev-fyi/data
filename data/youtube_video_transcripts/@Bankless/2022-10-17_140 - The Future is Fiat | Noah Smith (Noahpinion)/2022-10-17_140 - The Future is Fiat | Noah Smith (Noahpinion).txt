foreign [Music] explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys an episode title you probably wouldn't think to see on Bank list the future is Fiat wait what are we talking about today David and I talked to writer Economist Noah Smith he's a contrarian he is what I would call a knowledgeable Outsider which is fairly rare in crypto conversations uh he's bullish on some crypto claims but he's also willing to call BS on many other claims that's why this was such an interesting conversation we have two sections in this episode the first is all about geopolitics no one thinks we're already at War we go into that question of who we're at war with and why why Noah thinks the world is dividing between the new allies which is the US and EU and the new axis which is Russia and China and in the economic Showdown and we talk about who would win is it China or is it the US are they equally matched is one power greater than the other at this point in time and does it have to actually come to blows that's the question we ask you know in this episode in the second part we talk all about Noah's thoughts on crypto what is his bold case for crypto War question mark we get into that discussion we also talk about what a global conflict would actually look like now that crypto enables Capital flight that is a big theme of this episode the flight of capital and which kinds of powers are more impacted by this Capital flight finally getting to know as big critique of the crypto industry the misconceptions he thinks that we believe and why he says the future is Fiat all in all David this was a really fun episode to do and uh yeah what were some of your thoughts going into this Noah is such a clear-headed articulate fun to talk to guy I just had a fantastic time being on the other side of the microphone he's a tree to listen to and he delivers his uh his thoughts on like pretty Punchy and entertaining ways uh so if I for my content perspective uh I'm I'm thoroughly I enjoyed this whole entire thing um and he's got such a broad scope of what he is informed on he seems to be like one part historian because he was rattling off some like deep history in fact that's how we start off this episode uh and just to compare and and like learn about and position ourselves in history in terms of like Global macro Powers uh but also to also understand the crypto industry a little bit better uh just a polymath through and through and a very articulate one of that yeah I uh I absolutely agree it was a lot of fun and there there were lots of uh points in the conversation where Noah talks about we and I think that that we he kept referring to is is representative of the United States I I really feel like though we didn't get to talk too much about the United States and its future Noah really views himself as kind of a um maybe an advocate for the United States as a as a nation and uh that was interesting to me as well so if you're in another part of the world that doesn't really identify with the we of U.S citizen that Noah's talking to that's the Vantage Point that he's coming from so so you could definitely see that in the episode premium subscribers of course stick around after the show for the debrief where Dave and I talk about our thoughts after the show this is almost more fun than the podcast sometimes it is because we get to give our raw and filtered thoughts to the bankless nation if you're a premium subscriber there's a link in in the show notes where you can access that and if you're not one become one today guys we're gonna get right to the episode with no

Network thankless Nation we are super excited to host this conversation with Noah Smith he was described to me as a Millennials economist and I think that's a pretty good description uh he's he's pretty rational he's open-minded he's also a Future Ford but I also think that description is just the start because uh Noah does more I feel like than uh Economist activity he's kind of a polymath he's an excellent writer I have absorbed a ton of his content on his sub Stacks it's one of my favorites it's always something prescient he's he's posting and I think he's also described himself as quote somewhat favorable to the optimistic view of crypto but he's also measured on his view of crypto so it's good to bring you on the bank list program Noah on a bank list on a crypto podcast I should say how are you doing today hey I'm doing all right I you know it's a good day it is a good day uh September 26th is when we're recording this uh 2022 for posterity so in case the day you're listening to this is not a good day it's a very important day in history it is the best holiday stanislav Petrov day on this day in 1983 on this day in 1983 uh there was like Russian uh you know Warning Systems accidentally detected what they thought was an American nuclear launch and oh yeah the rapid response people wanted to launch world war three and one guy stanislav Petrov said no no guys I think it's a glitch and because of this guy the human race was saved because at that time we had approximately like 10 times as many nukes as we do now [Music] or birds or something that the radar was picking up right oh yeah yeah yeah something yeah yeah well it's I mean it's it's Russia so they didn't really want to do you know Russia has has become this very atavistic place they're really degenerating from an advanced Society they they almost got there you know and then they they're degenerating into this this sort of Barbarian hell right now and it's not a good look and of course they're not gonna have a statue of a guy who doesn't launch nukes what would you accredit that uh the decline of Russia towards corruption authoritarianism the the resource curse it's when you have an Economy based on oil and therefore like whether you get rich or powerful depends entirely on your control of this of this resource and what you know then that does not lend itself to you know the kind of broad-based society so when you look at the beginning of the Soviet Union before they really became an oil superpower at all um you know it was all about manufacturing right it was it was the Russian Industrial Revolution and of course they did it in a stupid and efficient way but they still did it right they still the Soviet Union ramped up manufacturing a ton and it was mostly for the military and it wasn't that efficient but they could make they learned to make a bunch of stuff and then you know starting in the 70s under Brezhnev uh they really started when oil became incredibly expensive and Russia developed its oil resources uh Russia shifted from being this sort of inefficient yet powerful manufacturing Empire to to an Empire of oil and then when you look at countries that do this most of them turn out badly I know Norway turned out well but like most countries that go down this road have very dysfunctional politics and um and so Russia Russia's technological capabilities degraded they essentially according to Camille galliev who's the best guy to follow on this they just they stopped respecting nerds you know by being a being a good engineer no longer became a a good thing in society if you needed someone to dig the oil up out of the ground you could just pay Halliburton or whoever to come over and do it for you and all you did was control the land and uh you know that that doesn't really lend itself to an intellectual society and so that's what really happened they forgot their nerds uh they you know they just they degenerated into into barbarians because that's all the all the barbarians are just extractive people right people who just live via extraction of resources instead of creation of research this sounds like a NOAA blog post maybe you haven't written this yet but like what happens to a society that doesn't respect nerds is basically Russia is kind of the case study of that I you know we're obviously going to talk nerds because um you know one of the Nerds that we hold in highest esteem and I I hope he doesn't like to be characterized as a as a he doesn't mind being characterized as a nerd as vitalik buterin which I I know you know him you've interviewed him recently we'll talk about him in a second but while we're on kind of the Russia theme for for a minute can we I my part of our purpose in this uh episode I think Noah is to like get a download of your brain like how you think some of your mental models for the world and match that against kind of our um mental models for for crypto and some of our intuitions and see where they they match and see where they wait they kind of clash and I think in order to do that we need to understand a bit about your mental model of um the world right now from a macro geopolitical perspective there was a post you wrote recently called the war economy and I think this was first in a series of posts and you differentiated the war economy as being sort of a new era that we've entered into like as in I think present tense we are in the war economy and this is very different from the neoliberal economy of like the 1990s and maybe early 2000s um can we talk about that for a minute let's camp on this idea of the war economy some some idea of a gigantic economic reorganization uh that that's happening but like the the first question in in that word war is a question maybe to you um are we at War right now Noah like if you're saying we're in a war economy right now what is that and are we actually at War well uh so formally we're you know involved in some random uh small military conflicts like uh you know in a policing role but it's not really a war the big war is uh is in Ukraine and we are giving weapons to Ukraine uh on on with the lend lease program we are not directly involved in that War uh but we're helping Ukraine via giving them stuff basically and that's similar to the way we helped Britain um in the beginning of World War II you know before we got involved uh for for a while Britain was just holding out defending itself against Nazi attacks and we supported them with lendlies we sent them tanks and planes and guns and whatever else they needed and so that that effort ramped up our defense production at one point we were actually draining some of our own military resources just to send lots of stuff to Britain and it's very analogous to I mean you know it's called the lend lease program again it's it's the same kind of thing except now it's Ukraine instead of Britain and so um that and if you want to read a book about this I recommend Freedom's Forge it's about how uh private industrialists essentially took over and saved the American war effort and it couldn't have happened without them especially um Bill Knudsen was the uh he's the sort of the guy who built Chevrolet kind of uh the even greater auto manufacturing guide than Henry Ford and um and then when you know Roosevelt called him up and said would you like to be ha you know be on this um uh you know Council of war production he just said yes you know because he was an immigrant he was a Danish immigrant and he uh he said this country has given so much to me now I have to give back so he boarded a train quit his Taipei incredibly prestigious job and just went to Washington to join this uh you know we're planning um uh Council and so that's uh that's a really interesting story of how we did this but for the for the beginning of it we weren't fighting any War we were just supporting Britain so uh you're seeing almost the beginnings of kind of would you call it an economic war and like what do you expect I guess two questions do you expect this to turn into a hotter war or is this more like a like a cold war type scenario that we've seen in in decades past and then like from a war perspective is this about sort of the U.S maybe NATO and Russia or are there other powers at play I think you have this concept of like the new axis and the new allies like borrowing from like World War II uh terminology talk about this for us right okay so um will this be a hot war or Cold War I certainly hope it does not turn into a hot War yeah you know um during the cold you know we have nuclear weapons we have less than we did before but we still have enough to blow up us and Russia pretty effectively uh we both have about 1600 nuclear weapons deployed which that that will roast both countries it might not destroy the human race but it's it's enough to roast our countries and and I'll die yeah and there'll be a nuke dropped on my head I live at the center of San Francisco um anyway if the Russians can aim I'm not sure they can they can aim but um they I'll die so um anyway I really hope it does not turn hot but so I think it'll be a cold war but you'll notice that the Cold War had plenty of actual Wars embedded within it it just didn't have the big one right they called it cold because we never launched the nukes but we had you know Millions die in Korea Millions die in Vietnam Millions die in Afghanistan and millions die in a whole bunch of proxy wars that the superpowers were not involved in directly at all um you know proxy wars genocides uh some of which we supported some of which we opposed but uh but then you know Cambodia Indonesia Ethiopia all these these genocides um so the Cold War killed tens of millions of people uh if we just thought that's a good good outcome compared to nuclear Holocaust and Armageddon which is even worse and so I I hope and expect that that you know people still love their children and don't want to see their countries become ashes and that we will not directly go to war with Russia or China um and will not launch the nukes I I really hope and expect that that will happen but a cold war struggle is you know is still like a war you know we still have to produce a lot of stuff we had major defense production and spending during the Cold War um and so so that's a real conflict and of course it could turn hot and we have to prepare for that even if it doesn't happen uh hopefully it doesn't happen and so um in terms of the new access there's really two reasons I coined that term first of all it's uh um they're not calling it an axis the axis original axis terminology was mostly just a term you know we used it was a term Mussolini made up he said this is the access upon which the world will turn we're like oh those guys are called the axis but actually it was just a series of loose sort of pacts between these countries Japan Italy Germany World War II right and uh you know there were a few other smaller ones that we don't uh remember like Finland um who joined because they were just you know once the Soviet Union started stop stopped being Germany's partner and started being Germany's enemy when Germany stabbed them in the back Finland is like okay we'll we'll join the Nazis because the Soviets are the biggest threat to us but we forgive them we forget about that you know you um uh but but yeah so there was a I don't know Bulgaria or somewhere um but anyway so there was uh yeah it was a loose partnership like the Nazis and the you know Japanese empire did not like each other they did not care about each other they didn't coordinate at all they would have if they had won the war they would have immediately had a cold war with each other and started fighting right they they um it was a loose partnership they didn't really give each other anything so we in the Soviet Union were actually pretty close allies we supplied the Soviet Union with all so I talked about Lend Lease we did this for Britain we also did this for Stalin you know we were the industrial Powerhouse we give Stalin all this stuff and Stalin said that without our material support he would have lost the the war and that would have been very very bad and um you know as bad as Stalin was he was the second worst guy in Europe at the time and had we not you know given him all like you know the Soviet Union we did had some manufacturing you know but they but not not enough and so we just gave them tons of material uh to resist the Germans and it worked um they uh they threw they supplied the Manpower we supplied the material and um and that worked you know and so we're doing a similar thing for Ukraine that we did for Stalin that time um and since you know some of the fighting was on Ukrainian territory and uh you know this is sort of like we're supporting Ukraine again um Ukraine always gets invaded because it's right in the sort of the highway between Europe and and Asia right it's one of those new access who is the new axis so we know who the old access is China and Russia are they with each other really because they don't really I don't really pair them in my brain like how much of a partnership is there really there oh uh well the point is that the new the original access wasn't as close to the Allied as people sure and that was what I was I was trying to describe so so that the answer is that it is a partnership of convenience it is not a partnership of values much as their values might coincide you know like um totalitarianism isn't like this thing where to tell you know totalitarian say hey you're a totalitarian too friend it's not like that right it's like oh we want to rule the world you want to rule the world it's like there's this inherent distrust between these Powers right and and Hitler and and Stalin briefly Allied and then Hitler stabbed Stalin in the back very predictable kind of you know betrayal because uh evil turns in on itself that's a quote from the dragonlance Chronicles which is an old fantasy series uh that is kind of like uh my uh my enemies enemies my friend sort of Alliance that you're talking yeah exactly that's exactly right and so so for China what they want from Russia is basically distract Europe distract America if possible so we can have a Freer hand in our backyard to increase our power within Asia which is what they really care about right they and so they're they're they're hoping Russia will just basically like distract these people go they're like okay you're up America you go fight the Russians while we do our thing and um and that's what they're hoping uh also you know of course pragmatically speaking they want oil from Russia and they're getting oil at a deep discount from Russia um you know Russia is can't really easily sell oil to Europe or or wherever anymore so they're selling to China and India which is who is their old Cold War Ally and they're selling oil to these to China and India but they have to really discount it very steeply because now those buyers have some monopsony power and are able to exert leverage and say hey how about a discount and they're getting a big discount like 30 or more and just just to make sure that my thinking is correct Russia is like that's a big nuisance like invading neighbors and and you know committing atrocities and it's just annoying uh but it's so annoying yeah but China is like the bigger threat right the actual one with like organization and economic strength is this is this right like Russia is being the one doing the doing the violence but it's it's China that's the much bigger Cloud on the horizon correct well yes and no I mean so so Russia has more nukes Russia could roast us more easily than China could and that is a bigger threat but in terms of actually winning a cold war with us there's no way Russia could contend with us in a in a cold war you know they they contended with us in the 20th century there's no way they could do that in the 21st they are a small shrunken version of of the Soviet Union uh you know and they their shadow of their former self there's no way that they could contend with us in a cold war on their own if if they're but China is a completely different animal China's strength is economic um so people don't understand the magnitude of this they need to understand the magnitude China by value added China manufactures as much as the United States and all of Europe combined that's how important China has become to manufacturing has become the center of Supply chains for everything that gets traded and produced across borders it is in the indispensable country for a lot of companies it is the world's greatest manufacturing power and remember the reason we won World War II was not because you know we love freedom and liberty and justice in our men are He-Man you know awesome Fighters and patton you know yelled a lot that's not why it happened um it was because we outmanufactured the enemy plain and simple um and so China could do that to us today the way we did it to Germany and Japan in World War II and so so that's for the first time in the history of industrialization the core of global manufacturing is not in Europe or America or Allies of America so okay so just tracking to where we are and how you view the world like Noah's lens on the world right so we are in a war economy right now this is not a kinetic war between superpowers yet we hope it never turns into that it's more like a cold war that we're already in uh and there are kind of two I guess um sides of the chessboard there's the the new allies which are sort of the US and Europe and Associated allies and there's the new axis which is Taiwan yeah and hopefully India will join but there's still a the swing power they're kind of an unknown and so the new axis would be Russia and China and that you you put together this post that I thought was really interesting with some actually actual Graphics uh and data points where you sort of sized up the two economies and you're kind of like Battle of the Titans who would actually win and by the way bankless listeners this is the sort of thing that that Noah publishes on his uh on his blog which I think is super valuable and you sort of uh size up the economy and a few metrics you look at one is kind of population of the new allies in the new axis another is GDP and another is manufacturing and as I was scanning through this post it seems like you know the the new axis uh is Superior in terms of population at least right now we could talk about demographics in the future but they beat the new allies except if you add India in the mix and they're kind of the I guess the Dark Horse in this from a GDP perspective the new allies are still ahead versus the the new axis by a good bit it seems like uh but from a manufacturing perspective it looks like the new axis is pretty close it's kind of like neck and neck certainly within Striking Distance and like if you look at China which is this blue bar right here going up it is looks like it's almost double the size of the US from a manufacturing perspective you need all of the US plus Europe combined to equal China in terms of manufacturing prowess so kind of set this up for us is this what the landscape looks like if you were to kind of compare new allies versus new access like which is ahead in terms of winning some kind of War not a kinetic War but maybe an economic War whatever thing that we're in right now I would say that they're approximately equal right they're equally matched this this graph is the one that I would look at um you know this uh so I didn't you know there's a few other countries I could have added on the new allies side like um you know Korea is important Australia and Canada are like I guess non-negligible um but then but it's it's comparable it we do not have the you know in in the in World War II we just over match Germany and Japan like America by themselves could just out manufacture Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan together you know several times over that is not true anymore that is in in this and and during the the the Cold War we could out manufacture the Soviet Union you know they were a lot better than modern Russia but they weren't as good as us we and our allies in Europe and Japan could just completely overmatch them in terms of manufacturing capacity for the first time a power has risen that can that uh you know can match us and our allies in terms of manufacturing capacity uh I would say that the small differences on that graph are as much an artifact of measurement as they are representing a real Advantage for us I would say that overall it's approximately equal and we saw now now we manufacture different things so we saw during the pandemic um America had a huge difficulty manufacturing uh masks and other you know sort of very basic kind of uh physical Goods that we needed for the pandemic we couldn't ramp up because we were just so used to ordering this stuff from overseas um and this has triggered a big realization that we need supply chain resilience in order to harden ourselves for this this war economy and so that's a big part of the war economy is just supply chain resilience and of course it's not even worth writing a big post about that because the buy Administration is already all over it it's one of their big things that they're doing sort of in the background um but notice that when it came time to make vaccines everyone was predicting that we'd have this big trouble manufacturing mRNA vaccines in large quantities especially the lipid nanoparticles uh in which the MRNA vaccines are are you know delivered um and so we had no trouble actually our our biotech companies Rose to the occasion in a very World War II like effort uh you know we call up like we we figured out what the supply chain was we called them all up they massively expanded production the government funded a big expansion of production you know with guaranteed contracts and things like that and then these biotech companies just made it all and we produced massive amounts of vaccines China still can't produce any of that they've been working on this for for years they don't even have the capacity much less the capacity ready at hand um and so so so China utterly failed in this test of advanced high-level manufacturing and this really illustrates the way that Global Supply chains have changed over the last 30 years over the last 30 years especially the last 20 years over the last 20 years what has happened is that all the simple stuff the stuff that we made a hundred years ago and that formed the backbone of American industry during our industrialization period um that stuff has been farmed out to China instead of farmed out to domestic robots which was the other alternative it was farmed out to China and so China has that all that stuff and we retained the very high value stuff the stuff you can sell for a lot of money in peacetime right we took the the ends of the supply chain so you know when you when you would get an iPhone it would say like designed in Cupertino manufactured in China right and that's really typical so we would design the stuff other people would slap it together we would make some of the high value components and China has has striven to make more of the high value components domestically um so we do we make the hard stuff that requires like Innovation and a lot of like nerds who are you know large disproportionately immigrant nerds uh you know working in a lab somewhere figuring out how to make like this this really awesome screen or this really high performance chip or you know blah blah blah this this really software you know that works really well and so and and then China has like the the what we used to have which is just armies of guys uh and by guys I mean usually women um in you know these gigantic incredibly efficient factories with Machine Tools you know it's not just like manual labor anymore uh they they have like a lot of machine tools and some factories they even have it's even automated they have robots but um but China is doing the volume and if we were to go to war it would be a contest of quality versus quantity and they'd have the quantity on their side and I'm not confident we could beat that hmm one interesting thing I notice in those in the charts that we were showing on screen is that it it took many nations to get above China in terms of manufacturing output and I think what you were saying before that is like during World War II America was like the big Chad in the room in terms of manufacturing we were like a unipolar power that we were just dominant like we we directed the world because we had all of that power and now it seems to be a little bit flipped in that China has all of the manufacturing power it takes a coalition of countries to be able to match China although we do beat China in some uh when you stack all of them together but what you're saying is that that manufacturing of what China is uniquely capable at is uh like the the qualitative side of what China is capable of manufacturing is something to consider and what they are good at is gives them an advantage in times of tension and conflict is that an apt summary it gives them one advantage you know like uh like I said we just have different capabilities Supply chains means specialization in the old days that we were not as we didn't have as much supply chain because it was not as easy to just ship little components around the world and manage everything via the Internet that has changed since the time of World War II in a big way uh so in back then it was like Germany makes cars we make cars I guess that's still true of cars because they're heavy and hard to ship but then it was like Germany makes chemicals we make chemicals Germany makes you know like uh I don't know Electronics we make electronics and so that was um that was sort of how it was then uh now uh we are integrated into Supply chains we're interdependent economically in a way that we weren't then we still had a lot of trade then but it was like you know metals and commodities and stuff like that that was getting traded it wasn't this you know the supply chaining of of stuff right you're look at where your computer gets made it gets made all over the place and so that wasn't that just wasn't the way it was back then and so now that we have these Supply chains we have to think about a little different than just numbers you know yes the numbers are important but we also have to think about what's in those numbers you know we uh what do we have a choke hold over and so one of the most important things that we have a choke hold over and that China of course China knows us and is trying to correct it but it's difficult is computer chips so um almost all the computer chips in the world are made by the United States and its allies and computer chips are would you including Taiwan in this I'm including Taiwan okay because we'll get to Taiwan in a second but all which I wanted a surprisingly small amount you know people talk about how tsmc makes all the stuff tsmc makes some great high-end stuff in terms of in terms of market share in terms of value added taiwan's actually reasonably small um they're just they're just strategically important for chips because they have uh you know some very advanced stuff with this one company tsmc and um but but essentially the United States uh Taiwan South Korea Japan Europe together produce most of the semiconductor industry in the world and China's racing to catch up but they won't be there for a while and without semiconductors without chips it's very hard to make a modern military so that's a bottleneck that we have China has the bottleneck on processing of minerals so uh you know if you dig up lithium right out of the ground and you want to process it somewhere China does most of that right and lithium is important for batteries and batteries or what go in drones and drones are you know small drones and and small drones are getting more and more important to war and so that's a you know that's a strategic uh Rare Earth minerals everybody talks about um then there's stuff like you know Cobalt and copper and nickel and all these things like that try to processes a lot of the stuff and that's that's very low end primary industry if you were trying to think of like where you could make a bunch of money today would you think about nickel processing not in the US not at all I mean if you watch a commodity right 100 years ago you absolutely would okay can I ask a high level question maybe no this is a really dumb question but let me ask the dumb question that that might be on other people other listeners Minds which is like why does all of any of this matter manufacturing output GDP uh population labor why does it matter in the nuclear era post 1945 when every country on the planet every major superpower has effectively mutually assured destruction anyway doesn't that just completely level the playing field like if you got into an all-out Total War scenario and the nuke start flying no one wins everybody loses and isn't this a totally different world if we're matching like you know who would win in a contest of the wills you know kinetic power manufacturing we're not producing tanks anymore like the nuclear arsenal of one country can completely level another and that can happen simultaneously so like does any of this even matter anymore so so how's Russia doing right now with that idea can you elaborate all right so Russia has actually the slightly more than us the most deployed nukes in the world 1600 uh nukes deployed so because they are allowing them to conquer the world it's not because they are fighting a like kind of I guess a proxy war maybe uh against the West proxy for them they're yeah they're emptying out their population ah waiting for Snowden to fight you know I'm excited about that well so so tell me so tell me about this how does this work if you're not sort of uh if you're actually like a head-on conflict between the new allies and the new axis like World War II style type of thing right doesn't that just don't nukes just like equalize the playing field and maybe don't take news yeah to some degree it's like does that change the calculus at all uh yes it changes the calculus somewhat sure um nuclear deterrent is is very important to turn into Total War so the the thing is that if all you have is nukes and you don't have the rest of the military machine and the industrial manufacturing might whatever to back it up if all you have is nukes then you can either kill yourself to destroy the world or do nothing and surrender right you have you have a binary Choice kill yourself you can either be a suicide bomber or you can do or you can just roll over because that's what it is if you launch nukes is mutually assured destruction remember if one country launches nukes in another country it's getting nuked in return because we have second strike capabilities nuclear submarines and such and um and so if you if you nuke you get nuked and then you die so essentially launching the nuclear war as being a suicide bomber as a nation so your point is that no nation is like effectively willing to do that exactly we don't know and we don't know and I I and I hope we don't find out um same but but certainly Russia cared in the Soviet Union cared enough about conventional military forces to build up a massive conventional Army uh even though it had 10 times as many nukes as modern Russia enough to roast not just America but the whole planet you know they had 20 000 nukes um 30 000 X I'm sorry 30 000 nukes we had about 20 25 000. and so that's just insane that's you know you just turn the country into a parking lot you turn the world into like a nuclear hellhole Wasteland and that's what a lot of the science fiction of the 60s and 70s was about because but in the 80s it reached a real peak you know that's on our nuclear Arsenal is peaked um if you just Google do a Google image search for nuclear arsenals you will see how much things have actually come come down and how crazy it was in the 80s um but they nevertheless built up a giant conventional Army we built up a giant conventional Army um conventional deterrence was still important and so as it will be today can I ask you another point on this and by the way maybe that that's why we're round tripping to a happy uh Petrov Day to you that was 1983 as you said earlier what a thing that was avoided at that point in time um absolute worldwide destruction um but like there's another kind of event that uh has been talked about before and Ray dalio I don't know if you read any Dalia but like changing World Order his sort of thing he thinks that um China and the US the new axis new allies as you've turned them could come to blows over the Taiwan effectively like that could be the thing what's your take on that do you think Taiwan is the thing How likely is are China and the U.S to come to blows over the Taiwan issue relatively likely hmm um Joe Biden has now said four times unequivocally that if Taiwan is attacked we'll defend it each time the White House said our position has not changed that means that was always what we were going to do um and so we were we were always going to defend Taiwan if it's if it's attacked and that remains true now um yes it is highly likely China China's leaders definitely want to retake Taiwan China's population probably wants to retake Taiwan as well so do you think that there's a potential future where what we're seeing with Ukraine as the proxy war between the United States and Russia Taiwan becomes the proxy war between the United States and China and if we want to compare these two things how much more or less involved might we might we be in Taiwan well first of all neither of those is proxy at all um the current war with with Russia is not a proxy war I mean you can say foreign for the United States Ukraine is a proxy for us but certainly for Russia they're mobilizing our whole society that's not a process right conflict and if the United States fought China directly that would be a proxy war on neither side that is just called a Mormon um the fact that we're fighting over some smaller country that's that's that's typical difference right yeah you know their stuff that's just called like you know uh Athens and Sparta fighting over Corinth or something right it's like uh that's that's why countries fight um why do we want to protect Taiwan so much well a couple reasons um the reason everyone talks about there there's there's a couple reasons why everyone talks about there's there's um taiwan's a democracy we love democracies we want to protect them and also they make a bunch of computer chips neither of those was the real reason the the real reason is two other things uh the first reason is because if China conquers Taiwan that completely compromises the security of Japan who is our major Ally in the region and that basically puts Japan at the mercy of China and Japan basically becomes a you know Chinese no maybe not Colony but yeah vassal right China Japan becomes a China Chinese vassal at that point at that point the you know the United States is out of East Asia but that's not even the most important thing the most important thing China rules East Asia and the you know Japanese and Taiwanese and of course South Korean as well Center of Technology then Falls you know China can then extract whatever Technologies they want from those vassal than vassal countries and those countries don't want to become Chinese vassals because you know China also has a very dim view of Japan but also of South Korea um and of course of Taiwan and so uh that's the first reason is because China then conquers all of Asia and becomes the Undisputed sort of Lord of manufacturing you know including high-end stuff that we current our allies currently have um but so so uh T Grier a tenor Greer wrote this uh although he goes by T Grier wrote this um really good blog post called losing Taiwan means losing Japan he's right about that and that's why Japan also despite you know like Japanese people being famously pacifist uh Japan has also pledged to defend Taiwan in a war um that is one reason we would fight uh China but that is not even the most important reason we would fight China over Taiwan here the most important reason has to do with Game Theory all right it's time for some Game Theory um if China launches an attack on Taiwan while American bases are still active America could very easily spoil it just by attacking because our bases are intact we just send our forces in and sink their Fleet or whatever right um in order to carry out a successful attack on Taiwan uh especially a successful invasion of Taiwan China Must Destroy the American bases in the region including Okinawa Guam and some other bases as well and so they have to take those bases out first for their Invasion to have or or you know or major attack to have a chance of success uh to have a not a chance of success to have to be not exposed to American counter-attack so if they don't want to be left at America's Mercy they must preemptively strike us and basically Pearl Harbor US right and if they do that we will fight you do not get to launch an unprovoked you know attack Slaughter thousands of Americans servicemen you know uh and and Destroy American bases you don't get to do that without starting a war okay that's a war if you say oh we wouldn't go to war we would just let them destroy our bases because we don't want to fight over Taiwan you are wrong countries when they get attacked like that go to war okay and so in other words if China launches an attack on Taiwan it can't afford to risk us you know it can't afford to risk leaving our bases there so it will attack our bases first and we will fight a war oh because they preemptively attacked us it's it's a Pearl Harbor situation it would be the same it would kill probably more people than Pearl Harbor and um and be it extremely analogous situation they preemptively attacked us because they couldn't afford to have our military forces there to act as a spoiler for their campaign of Conquest but that's exactly why Pearl Harbor was attacked and so if China attacks Taiwan they will attack America first if they attack America we are at War that does seem like a much more logical reason than the tsmc uh or yeah the other normal estated ones okay so you usually kinetic Wars happen after economic Wars and and Noah you wrote a blog post called what would sanctions against China actually look like how effective might they actually be and like the the world is starting to get pretty familiar with global international sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine so like we're starting to be able to like comprehend these things and understand them a little bit better maybe you could walk us through if we if we do get to that point which I you you stated that you think is perhaps likely and other people also have agreed uh that I do think that means that we're also doing the economic War too so what would the economic war against China look like uh essentially the only real economic weapon that we have that would affect China unless we want to do a blockade which is again that would lead to war um so uh is is computer chips so we actually waged economic war against Japan before we ever had any real war when Japan was conquering China we tried to stop Japan from conquering China for which they are China is still not particularly grateful to us for this but but we tried to stop Japan for con from conquering China by putting sanctions on by putting an oil embargo on them right which is basically sanctions of the time uh and so oil was the important thing that we sold to Japan because we were the biggest oil producer um and Japan needed our oil and um and with that with this embargo they couldn't get it and that's um you know that's why they attacked southeast Asia and conquered southeast Asia because the Indonesia had enough oil to prosecute their War in China which was what they really cared about their war of Conquest um against China are our key commodity that we sell them is not oil but computer chips um China does not have independently the ability to make enough computer chips to sustain its military machine or even its manufacturing machine to be honest um all that value added that you saw in that big blue column of China in my graph that depends on most of that depends on computer chips and China makes you know they do some of the low end parts of the computer chip supply chain but on their own they can't make nearly enough computer ships to sustain their peace time or wartime economy so what we would do and of course that may change you know but it'll take China at least 10 years really more like 20 and maybe never um and so for a while they're gonna have they're going to be very vulnerable in this one area so what we would do economically is cooperate with our allies Taiwan Japan South Korea and Europe and cut China off from computer chips like we cut Japan off from oil before World War II and that that would not bring China to its knees but it would really hamper them a lot that's interesting because that's a given by many historians as a reason for uh Japan actually bombing Pearl Harbor was the US's economic war of restricting Japanese access from from oil and so they they actually had to get that simple fund yeah no so what really happened was that our Oil Embargo meant that they had to take over the it had to take over Indonesia which had a lot of oil then um Indonesia um was a Dutch colony the Dutch were allied with the British the British were allied with us so Japan says we need so so Japan's first idea was okay let's get the oil by conquering Siberia from Russia all right then they tried it they sent some troops North from you know into like modern-day Mongolia and Russia brought in uh zhukov their famous tank General and they just kicked Japan's ass in a battle of opening battle of World War II that nobody knows about called The Battle of uh well there were two battles but the main one was the Battle of caulking goal in Mongolia um nobody remembers this now but the Soviet Union kicked the out of Japan's Army because they had much better armor and Japan then then the Japanese militarists were like okay so uh we can't kick the Soviet Union's ass so they signed a neutrality pact with the Soviet Union and um with Stalin they went to visit Stalin and signed a neutrality pack and they said okay instead where else can we get this oil to prosecute our conquest of China the only place we can other place nearby we can get it is Indonesia so they decided to attack Indonesia but they knew that that attacking a Dutch colony because we're still in the era of residual European imperialism here right um Indonesia Dutch Colony attacked the Dutch the British get involved if the British get involved the Americans get involved and the Americans have already proven that they take a dim view of our Conquest in Asia right um and so so they knew America would get involved by just sort of you know a friend of a friend of the Netherlands which who's so that's why they attacked Pearl Harbor they're like okay America we're gonna inevitably have to fight America so we might as well just take out their ships right now I've just reminded of that that Meme that you know the um the Domino meme where like just one thing one dominant Falls this chain of events and then you get to kind of World War II this is kind of what this uh what this feels like I um you have an absence the real war for oil right right uh that was the war of oil yeah no you have an absolutely like encyclopedic mind around these things it's so interesting to talk to you about it but let me before we tie off kind of this uh War economy section and move on to crypto and I promise bankless listeners there's there's a tantalizing link here between the two in in Noah's mind um but I got asked one question which is um it feels very much we like we have an Unstoppable Force meets an immune a movable object kind of thing here um like I've read people like dalio and Etc who think that uh China is absolutely hell-bent on taking Taiwan like they think it's theirs and they're held on taking it and they're happy to be patient maybe for decades but eventually they're going to want it and they're playing for number one spot here and if the US's position is Thou shalt not take Taiwan without causing a war with the U.S and its allies then we've got the Unstoppable Force meets immutable immovable object here and is there any way that this ends peacefully or are we like on a collision path to war I don't know I can give you a answer uh and dalio is happy to um spicy um no I mean like every everybody's happy to about these International Affairs things right any any any rich guy right like go ask David sacks yeah go ask this guy what does this guy know this guy knows dick all day you know Dalia like does the the the guy you want to ask is a guy named Bruce Bueno de mosquito he has some models that have been a little bit predictive and now he works for the CIA what's he he's a political scientist um he won't tell you the answer but he'll he'll know the answer better than anyone else um there's a lot of ways that could end without War um there could be some sort of agreement uh China could have you know internal conflict and instability uh which is not out of the con out of the question given that Xi Jinping is just screwing everything up so badly um there's uh you know there's a lot of things that could happen right um the United States could have instability we could you know Trump could return we could have another coup this time one that succeeds disputed presidential election causing a civil war um we could easily have instability as well and so one of the countries could just back off and you know then the status quo just goes to the other country by default um or both could have instability and then no one knows what the hell is going on right um and then we could um we could have a war that is basically like China sails some ships over we sink the ships China gets China yells a lot and then it's done they just stop or yeah or we could have a war where that we send some ships in to defend Taiwan they sink our ships they take over Taiwan and they win um and then no one uses nukes and so there's it's possible that there's a limited War as well in addition to the possibilities of no war at all um China could get different leadership that is less hell-bent on taking Taiwan the idea that when you say China's hell-bent on taking Taiwan they're going to do it um that's that's a proposition that is not a truism not a fact it's not a fact it's it's a thing that seems true if you look at like Xi Jinping seems hell-bent on taking Taiwan uh but we don't really know um we don't really know what the the pilot Bureau supports because they're very secretive right we don't really know what the Chinese people want you know maybe they want Taiwan but they would they don't want a war they just want Taiwan to love them and so hujin Tao uh basically said you know what we're not going to take over Taiwan we're just going to put it off forever we'll still say that Taiwan is ours we'll still make the claim that Taiwan is ours but we're not going to make any preparations to take it and we're just gonna you know sort of not do anything about it and it's possible a who Gentile like leader could come to power instead of Xi Jinping yeah that's that's fascinating uh kind of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for like country Conquest right as you actually don't have to you know have to take it over until you kind of um take it over trufi is d5's largest credit protocol connecting Global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities

your writings I can't remember which article I found Thomas and Noah was you actually said that you were more worried about the U.S electing an authoritarian at home more worried about that rather than World War II or World War III excuse me and maybe maybe that's something we can we can come back to but we promised our listeners we talk about crypto and I know you have a ton of thoughts about crypto and the tie-in to me know and the reason why we spent so much time on getting an understanding of your thoughts on geopolitics and wartime economies because I think you make the case in some of your writing some of your articles that wartime economy and capital flight is actually the case the strongest case in your mind for crypto before we get to that argument I just want to get your your high level thoughts here so um you've talked to vitalik I know you've been an observer of the industry for a while I know you've been at times bullish I know you're a holder I believe of ether and Bitcoin is that correct yes that's right yes correct so what do you think of this crypto thing what's your take well um so I think that there's you know there's several angles to it um one of the angles is just the original idea of Bitcoin you know the classic story of Bitcoin replacing Fiat money because Bitcoin is deflationary where Fiat money is inflationary um you know the the FED controls your money and they're devaluing your money blah blah blah with inflation blah blah that story is All Guff that's uh that's all it's it's a fundamental misunderstanding of how money works um and why money is money and what we what it is um and it is it is just um it's a it's a fantasy story that does help to sustain the price of Bitcoin uh which results in some notional wealth for a few people but it is not a real thing um it is it is what I call Guff it's just some some people say um that said Bitcoin uh could be very important in a world of conflict because it could allow people to sort of but it could allow people to sort of you know transfer money across borders more easily when there's instability in their home countries so you know we put sanctions on Russia Russian rich people want to get their money out they can get they don't have to carry a physical sack of gold over the Border or anything they can just transfer Bitcoin and so um you know even without the help of any bank right it's bankless and so then um so if you look at World War II and what happened then there was a lot of people you know rich people fleeing conflict and instability with physical valuables that they could transport which is really what gold was all about and so Bitcoin could replace that because the internet will still be up um and people can transfer Bitcoin although you know I would I might even bet on something like Monero you know is is less traceable than Bitcoin and so so actually that's the the other one I'm thinking of buying as Monero hmm um and so so I think that could be that that story could be interesting and important whereas the story of Bitcoin becoming like replacing fiat currency is the thing that used to buy pizza is not that's not real well that's not going to happen I think people are starting to realize that's not going to happen too um then on top of Bitcoin you've got the rest of crypto right which is I would say mostly based on ethereum there's some other things like Solana try to come in and do their the thing but it's mostly based on ethereum and it's web 3 other blockchain stuff and that can Encompass everything from Smart contracts you know daos to like um nfts Collectibles to the various uh you know web 3 kind of Ponzi scheme scams you know that are supported and so you know when um when Sam bankman freed went on the odd Lots podcast he's like yeah these are these are all ponzis you know and then everyone and the odd lots of just like did you just say that he's like yeah they're ponzis uh but you know I I provide a service if you want to do a Ponzi on my platform do it um guess what happened uh guess what happened next um Sam penguin feeds an interesting character because I feel like he's in the the business of facilitating other people's Ponzi schemes um and then and then using hedge funds to uh you know to make money off that in addition but then um you know but but uh he sort of he feels okay about it because he's an effective altruist right he's gonna he's like I'm gonna extract money from the world and then I'm gonna give that money away to good causes and therefore I'm acting as a conduit from people you know people who lose their money to like people who deserve more money and so therefore I'm good diving back into our conversation of like Global tensions we've been doing a lot of comparison and contrasting about World War II to where we are now with geopolitics except now there's a new player now there's a new player on the field which is this neutral internet-bound player of crypto uh and what you as you've labeled is specifically enabled for Capital flight and back in back in World War II it really seems like we had these like great leviathans going after each other it was the United States versus Germany versus Japan versus Britain versus France and all these were like big cohesive units that that's because they had like strong abilities of capital controls to force the whole entire country of you know say country onto like the same page right and now we have like the internet which is a democratizing technology and now that internet has crypto and so now like the people of the world don't necessarily have to go along with the leadership of a country and I'm wondering how you think about the crypto Force playing a role in a world of of conflict like how how might that be leveraged by by the people of the world and how my Nations respond to that well I think that um to be honest the the efficacy of crypto in creating a world of of no Capital controls is somewhat limited because um uh you know like if you look at the amount of that has escaped Russia due to due to crypto it's not that large right I've seen some estimates it's like we're not talking like 100 billion dollars or something right we're talking about like maybe 100 million dollars a couple hundred million dollars and that's not nothing if you've got a couple hundred million dollars more power too but but that's not it's not yet at the stage that I would say like we're seeing vast massive crypto enabled Capital flight the bigger Capital flight was really from China um and China there was this interesting you know sort of uh triangle trade that was going on with China using tether uh and uh and and uh you know as long as uh to to get money out of the country Chinese people using tether and as long as and then instead they be they they'd get a bunch of Bitcoin in their portfolios at the end of this trade and then as long as Bitcoin was going up they made money and they preserved their wealth but when bitcoin's going down that doesn't really work um so there's been some episodes of this but so far we haven't seen and we haven't seen anything like the collapse of capital controls from Russia and China and you know countries that are doing this uh and I I'm not sure that how important Capital controls were during World War II either I think that no one was really trying to get their money out of America and relatively few people were trying to get their money out of Britain um a few more in Germany uh almost nobody in Japan was trying to get their money out um a lot of people tried to get their money out of China and succeeded to some degree and often they got their persons out of China as well um Soviet Union people had already kind of fled from the ussrs and depredations in earlier decades in the Civil War and all that stuff so you didn't have you saw people like you know running across the border with a sack of gold or whatever right uh China was I think the the biggest case of this although you saw some in Germany as they it became apparent they were losing the war um now I think that we'll see more and I think crypto will be a part of that but I don't think I wouldn't go so far as to say that it just invalidates all these countries uh Financial systems and capital controls it makes them more leaky than before but that doesn't mean that they just go poof and um so so my college friend Balaji srinivasan um you know is your college friend yeah yeah did you know that yeah I mean we've had him on the podcast of course so you must know about his Network State thesis of course you know his views on crypto yeah exactly what's your take on that so continue I mean you know I think um vitalik had the best take on the network State his review is really good and so I would just Farm out my thoughts on the network state to vitalik basically but um but I think that the short version is that we're not going to see crypto be able to replace whole societies that can't happen um because societies are a lot more than just uh you know flow of funds right a society needs a lot more than Banks you know you need you need roads you need schools you need police you need uh you know um all other kinds of stuff and and that that Bitcoin will never replace and no crypto can replace that um you know you're still gonna have to use the roads and the trains and whatever wherever you go you know and the idea that yes you can have an international network of sort of like Footloose rootless Cosmopolitan rich people you know rootless Cosmopolitan was a the official government endorsed Russian slur for Jews so I love I love you know the calling myself a rootless god of the following because the Russians would have called me that but um and and Stalin eventually endorsed it when he turned against the Jews um anyway fun fact but um yeah so so uh but people who like travel all around the world you know I mean and are actually real rootless cosmopolitans right there's and then there's nothing necessarily wrong with that but you need a place to use the roads you need a place to use the trains and if you don't contribute to the public goods you know if you if you figure out a way to not pay taxes and if you figure out a way to just live this floating International ideal Balaji in life right where you're just uh you're a citizen of nowhere and you just don't pay any taxes but your your meat sacrosides somewhere and you eat food and you you go to places and you meet people in real life and you sleep somewhere and all this stuff you are you are essentially being a parasite on the public goods provided by your host country and crypto will never replace that um because it take you know maybe you could replace it and use crypto also but crypto by itself can't replace it because there's no way for crypto to create Goods in the physical world that you need um and so those will have to be provided somewhere so in practice a lot of the people who talk about this sort of you know like um uh talk about this like Network state are they just moved to Singapore right and it's it's very much like what people did during the Imperial age where they live in these sort of Gray Zone entrepo towns like Hong Kong was the big one back in the day Singapore was also there but but Hong Kong was the biggest and um or Shanghai During the pseudo-colonial period when you had like the concessions and all this stuff you had people like uh Sassoon going there and setting up his business and you had the blund all this stuff right in Shanghai um and so you had these like uh these sort of international gray zones um Casablanca remember that movie uh yeah the international Gray Zone uh entrepose where people would move and uh you know these rich sort of international drifting people but the end of the day they had to pick a country and um and the same is true now and in practice the network state is just Singapore that's a fascinating view right so so if in part of our goal in this episode really knows to pick your brain and see what you think of things see what you think of Krypton some of the ideas coming from crypto and I think it does hold thus far the conversation that your your statement in one of your articles that you're somewhat favorable to The Optimist view of crypto but you're not all in on this thing you don't think it's going to wholesale replace uh nation states you think it can supplement but like as long as we are meat sacks which we are for you know at least for the next few decades for sure yeah uh for for a while yes until we upload then we will need some sort of nation state and the best crypto can do is supplement that uh and and you think the way it's big use case it's killer app so far is in getting around to kind of nation-state capital controls and you did say this in one of your articles about smart contracts specifically because we've been talking about Bitcoin but I'll read a quote from you there might even be a way to use Smart contracts to Port whole businesses or other networks of formalized economic relationships over from China or Russia with their structure largely intact when local intermediaries Chinese and Russian Banks courts Etc can't be trusted because they're manipulated by the state or under foreign sanction or simply disrupted by conflict blockchains might be able to step in and provide the decentralized trust they were designed to provide so you think in a world of you know the war economy where trust is eroding with uh institutions whether domestic institutions are kind of international institutions that's where you see crypto kind of stepping up uh to the play not completely superseding nation states but supplementing some of the trust that people had in these institutions and diffusing that and I guess attracting some of that trust onto their networks even the form of smart contracts right and this is this is the the what I would call the weak form of the balajian thesis this idea event you know you're not going to replace nation states but but you're going to weaken nation states grip on some of the the important thing um and the and the grip and the Nations whose grip is weakened will be the totalitarian Nations more than the democratic nations the United States isn't going to implement Capital controls at all you want to move your money out of the United States just do it you know it's not wait wait wait you don't think so in a worse scenario you don't think the us will go like a 1993 FDR executive order sorry you can no longer have gold sorry you can no longer have crypto it's illegal turn your crypto in maybe but to be honest or some form of tax expression aligned with this idea there will be there will be just sanctions um no it's not that's not going to be so important I think at this point um so yeah because nobody's gonna like the at that point to be honest we didn't need to do that at that point we didn't we did not need to do that in World War II uh it was just you know we had this financial crisis that was more really for the depression uh than World War II itself um the United States has the the dollar right and the dollar is the safe haven people keep declaring the death of the dollar and it keeps just going up right like people keep moving their money into Dollars they're not moving their money into Bitcoin is the safe haven of the world it's just um uh sorry volunteer that didn't happen yet maybe someday but then um but yeah people moving their money into dollars to be honest like most of the capital flows will just go into America and and we won't necessarily even want those coming in um so maybe no I don't think Capital controls are going to be a big deal in America they're going to be a very big deal in Russia China especially China that's going to be the big one I feel like that's a a big win a big dub for the crypto industry if if that it allows for the citizens of totally and totalitarian countries to subvert their own Capital controls preserve their wealth and D Fang deter their totalitarian countries and it doesn't really do disrupt too much inside of the western more liberal Democratic countries that sounds like a huge PR win if we can as an industry Express that if that is actually how that big win for you know lowercase L liberalism there's goodness Humanity yeah yes as it should be and and this is where I have always disagreed with Biology um you know biology uh has often seen a threat to Freedom From America itself and I've been and I've always disagreed with that I've said biology you're you're misperceiving the threat here America is not you know biology is like oh my God totalitarian wokeness and I'm like no it's just you know a slightly more annoying form of the the same kind of things that liberalism always creates right we've we've had versions of wokeness before and maybe this one is annoying because it has like people making dumb Twitter and Facebook posts but like we've had like America is not a totalitarian state and we're not going to become a totalitarian state the worst case scenario is that you know we we have like coup and Civil War and stuff like that instability yes we could have that right but totalitarian totalitarianism we've never had anything close to it we're not gonna have it this is this this is another thing I want to come back to this no because you are an America Optimist I think and I've heard you say on podcasts that you're on Team America and this is so interesting and and I think refreshing in some ways or at least it's a different Vantage Point than we're exposed to in crypto because I do think part of the crypto and your question is hey you know America maybe the US is slipping towards more totalitarianism and we've had like even recently I don't know if you're following the tornado cash thing some suppression of uh what what we would say are like you know first amendment uh freedom of speech code rights right and allowing your crypto users not to use an on-chain privacy mixer we could talk about that I want to talk about America in in a minute with you but before we do a few more of your thoughts on on crypto and Bitcoin because I don't think we're quite finished here on this I want you to burst our bubble on some of the misconceptions make sure that they are cemented here so you wrote a post called the economic misconceptions of the crypto world and you said there are two misconceptions crypto people I'm here to burst your bubble number one um misconception number one is Cash is a form of long-term savings and misconception number two scarcity creates value can you talk about those two misconceptions that crypto people seem to have yeah um the first one has to do with what I was talking about before which is the sort of foundational story of Bitcoin um this idea that uh that Bitcoin it will replace fiat currency because it's a better store of value when you look in Wikipedia or take an econ High School econ course it tells you that money is three things a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value I've always been annoyed with this list because store there's actually two kinds of stores of value there are things that appreciate a lot over the long term and there are things that uh fluctuate very little in the short term and those things are not the same things because of something called the risk award trade-off in finance so let's compare uh instead of let's let's put aside Bitcoin for a second and let's think about uh let's think about um treasury bills versus Apple stock okay so Apple stock will go up in the long term assuming Apple continues to kick ass and sell a lot of products that people like but it is volatile sometimes Apple stock goes down sometimes it goes up blah blah blah if you get paid in Apple shares as Apple employees do if you get paid in Apple shares prepare for your um prepare for your paycheck to be volatile and no one wants to buy bread and gasoline and rent and pizza and whatever cocaine whatever you're into you know no one wants to buy that with Apple shares because it's volatile you'd rather hang onto Apple shares for the long term because it's a good long-term store value it's not a good short-term store of value what's a good short-term star value T bills which is basically you know T bills are no longer the same as dollars actually because the the interest rates got raised but for a long time two billion dollars are interchangeable because they were just zero interest rate government bonds um and so take like a US dollar you'd want to pay for your stuff in dollars instead of Apple shares because yes the dollar has inflation so it goes its value erodes steadily but at least until recently and and really still like it's it's not that unpredictable right when you get paid in dollars you know how much you're getting paid in terms of bread and gasoline and rent right you know it because the dollar is a good short-term store of value and there's this very deep principle of financial markets that say that says that there's a trade-off between these two and you can't be both at once in anything even remotely approaching an efficient Financial Market it doesn't have to be like perfectly efficient and blah blah blah zero you know profit it can be even like remotely like hand wavy slightly efficient and yet you still have a trade-off between risk and reward um hold on to Apple shares for a long term and you'll make for the long term and you'll make money but it's volatile in the short term hold on to dollars for the long term and you'll lose money but it's reliable in the short term to buy your bread and so those those are never the same asset because if you had the same asset you know the one asset that could do it all you know you it would be breaking the very fundamental principle of financial markets and there's a good reason for that which is that uh that um reward is the way that that investors get compensated for taking risk right the reason you talk you hold a volatile you're willing to hold a volatile asset like apple which may even be down at the time you need to retire or like I don't know pay for your kid's wedding or whatever like there's real risk in holding Apple shares you're compensated by the fact that on average it returns a lot over time um and if you know the math of Browning motion there's actually you know a a trade-off between the the um volatility and the drift right it's the same thing and um so options people will know all about that and so there's this risk reward trade-off where things that are good long-term stores of value are shitty short-term stores of value and things that are good short-term stores of value are shitty long-term stores of value and Bitcoin the idea that Bitcoin replaces Fiat money is predicated on thinking that that's not true and in fact we can be a good long-term store of value and useful as a currency okay so uh point taken and I think that distinction between short-term story value and long-term uh store of value is very good right um and I think more people in crypto should think about that but but also why not Bitcoin for the long-term store value but more broadly let me like um throw this back at you and kind of ether terms right yeah for example so uh Advocates of ether it's like David myself we actually think ether is an interesting money like Proto money of the ethereum economy and it can act as a long-term store value obviously for the ethereum economy volatility aside but then you can just make a synthetic out of it and you could put some Ethan a smart contract you can use a price Oracle and Peg that eth to a dollar for instance and create the synthetic called die which is a dollar pegged version of ether it has some other assets inside of it but but also ether and so this is ether from a store of value long-term story value perspective being synthesized and turned into something that's a bit better as a as a short-term store value and then can also be used as a medium of exchange and unit of account you also see you just reinvented reverse repo well maybe or maybe this is just kind of like the gold standard like backing uh you know nation state DOT maybe it's something else uh We've something we've already invented in a new we also see like ether as monetary unit it's like also being used as a unit of account inside of the ethereum economy which is a very small subset of the world but like you pay for nfts in ether that is the unit of account that is also the medium of exchange and so we see some saturation there what do you think about these arguments I mean Apple shares are a unit of account and Apple shares can be a medium exchange I can swap you Apple shares for you know whatever like a uh um yeah well can be versus is because there are many many diverse marketplaces where ether is the unit of account and like the Apple doesn't have and also the difference is like we would get I think that crypto Advocates would give a um throw another thing at you it's like the reason Apple could never be a money is because of its governance structure shareholder vote could like print more Apple shares at any point in time um could do all sorts of things whereas like the idea of a monetary unit in crypto is you have some immutability there there's some sort of you know governance guarantees that we have you know scarcity and I don't know if this gets to your second misconception here which which I I mentioned earlier which is uh you think that crypto Advocates have a second misconception that they have to deal with and that misconception is scarce scarcity creates value you don't think that's correct either so talk about that for us okay so the reason people don't use Apple shares as as their currency is has nothing to do with fear of dilution okay these people are not this this is not a governance issue with dilution the reason is because of volatility these is because stocks go up and down that's why they don't use it you could have a you know you could have no dilution you could have no dilution possible you could have some provision preventing that people still wouldn't use shares as money even without the possibility of dilution um and the reason uh and the reason people don't use Bitcoin is money is uh is well besides whatever like you know cumbersome Network I don't even know about that stuff assume that stuff's all solved by lightning or whatever um but then but the the real reason people don't use Bitcoin is money is because the price goes up and down right um and so so consider the guy who uh bought pizza with Bitcoin remember that earlier early in the days Bitcoin Pizza Guys Bitcoin Pizza Guys Maslow yeah so he bought Bitcoin pizza oh he bought pizza with Bitcoin that would now be worth what a couple hundred million yeah a couple hundred million dollars would you like to pay a couple hundred million dollars for pizza I wouldn't yes absolutely not I wouldn't do that because I could use dollars and I could pay twenty dollars for beans and that's that's better and so the reason there's a very good reason for that guy not to have done that and so as long as you expect Bitcoin to appreciate on average now Bitcoin is insanely volatile in its early days even more than now but but as long as you expect Bitcoin to appreciate in the long term it would be smart to not use it to buy pizza and that's true even once adoption saturates all the bubbles are done blah blah blah if you have a deflationary protocol that decreases the number of Bitcoins in the world that is going to provide a positive return right and that positive return that it provides will make people trade it just like gold right gold is in the same boat here people no one uses gold to buy things and it's not because gold is heavy and physically cumbersome and you have to carry on doubloons in your wallet people would do that actually but but no you could use electronic uh you know gold shares right electronic gold ETF shares you can do that that's possible and no one does it no one does it because gold is volatile because gold has a a positive increasing uh rate expected return over time because because gold is constantly being withdrawn from the market to become jewelry or industrial uses and because it's constantly being withdrawn from the market it has you know scarcity natural scarcity in the in the long term and because of that um because of that it has volatility because people trade it right and no and because people trade it it goes up and down nobody uses it for money when I'd like to throw and see if see if this is a curveball yeah I definitely agree with you that the normal economy the economy that already exists where I go into my coffee coffee shop is not going to be like hey we don't accept dollars we only accept Bitcoin that's just not gonna happen I do think I that this metaverse economy whichever like this weird metaverse thing like slap in some VR technology online digital items digital trinkets digital whatever whatever internet online economies gaming web3 pick your buzzword uh these economies that are brand new don't have the burden of a history of like coffee shops denominate in dollars and so and also they also have the fluidity of being able to choose a digital currency from Genesis which is why we see so many nfts priced in ether and so I'm wondering if like yes what you're saying is totally correct about the pre-existing economy but this new economy with a brand new blank slate might be more conducive to an internet native money regardless of the of the flux fluctuations of volatility of that currency in dollar terms because like I I own some nfts I don't look at them in dollar terms I look at them in ether terms so there might be this like weird corner of the internet which might become very large in the future that the volatility of the currency either crashed you'd probably start looking looking at them dollar terms like if they're just vaporized yes if yes in like all all correlations go to zero and it crash but also it works in the inverse all right way as well they go to 100 correlations go to one so um the answer is that you're you're pricing one long-term appreciating asset in terms of another long-term appreciating asset and that's fine um but when it comes time to buy things like um if you're buying so I I guess if you want to represent the meta versus like a world in which you're just buying and selling nft type things all day and that's the economy yeah maybe yeah uh yeah people might use crypto but I think what they're going to use is usdc uh you know you already see like you know I was talking to some some nft people in Japan there I have these friends who do nfts in Japan that I really love um they are the galverse people do you know those people no okay it's a it's like an nft brand they're basically like anime nfts and they're like they're they're trying to uh you know use nfts to to sell the pseudo rights to make to to intellectual property for anime and it's a great idea I love these guys I don't know if they're gonna make any money but I think they're great um and they said and I said oh did you get out before the crash like yes fortunately we exited to usdc that was great we exited to usdc yes that is how money works that is why usdc is money and so I think that uh and untether right I mean like I kind of think tether is committing some fraud still like they got dinged for fraud the usdc is not so I would I would trust more in usdc than tether but tether probably works fine too and um you know so but it's usdc and tether it's it's these stable coins that are money what these are is Money Market funds um the usdc is a money market fund it's just not regulated as a money market fund but it is uh because you know it holds things that make a little more than dollars but usually don't if it almost never crash and issues its own shares IE tokens that act as dollars in the crypto economy and are valued at exactly at a dollar you can look at the chart and so that's that's a money market fund that is dollars and so um people are going to use usdc and tether and I think that um what people need to understand is that the FED is not the only entity that that creates dollars that prints dollars it is one of the entities the FED can print dollars it has that power but it's not the only one with that power other private financial institutions including Banks but not just banks have the power to print money um and usdc the creation of usdc is printing dollars that is the creation of dollars not exactly dollars because it's not a usdc isn't exactly the same as a dollar but but pretty damn close if you looked at divisia Monetary measures that try to like add the dollar like quantities of all these different things you'd see usdc show up and you'd see tether show up right the the creation of stablecoin of dollar stable coins creates dollars you have printed dollars and you're not the fed you know usdc is not the fed and tether's not the FED but they've created they've printed dollars and so that's pretty cool um you can you can print dollars printing dollars is fine it doesn't like it's not some shadowy external like distant money menu controls your wealth blah blah because your wealth isn't in dollars your wealth isn't stuff that goes up is in the long-term store value your wealth is Apple shares or gold or Bitcoin or your house that's your wealth your liquidity is in dollars your liquidity is in usdc if you're in the crypto economy or in tether right and so that's why you exit to usdc that because that's your money that's your liquidity and so um basically uh that's working exactly as a well-functioning financial market economy should and if we do have a metaverse where people are paying in crypto all the time it's going to be in stable coins it's going to be in things whose expected value depreciates over time because usdc depreciates and tether depreciates at the rate of U.S inflation right those are those are depreciating currencies those are inflationary currencies because they're just pseudo dollars right and so um and that's where people are gonna have their liquidity and their long-term wealth will be in eth will be in Bitcoin will be in whatever um or will just be in in real assets you know like um like a house or a you know or uh or a company and so then um and that's how it should work this is all is working as it should right so no if I were to kind of summarize your thoughts on crypto and why you're kind of like um like cautiously optimistic on the space but not just over the moon you don't think it's going to do everything that it's like uh it's Eternal Optimus and impermeables think it will do right it's you respect the use case for Capital flight particularly in this kind of War economy maybe smart contracts yeah smart contracts I think that those the overhead to start a company across borders is just insane you know look how much look how much money stripe is printed with uh Alice right like the the overhead to start these companies is just nuts legal overhead regulatory overhead International blah blah just you know if we're going to create this seamless global cyberpunk economy where I can make a movie with some kids in like Argentina and you know Morocco and Korea in like an afternoon and sell that on some digital Marketplace if you want to have that kind of Creator economy you can't afford to have these people like make a corporation hire low is to navigate the laws of Korea and Morocco and Argentina in the United States all at the same time that's huge overhead no just make it Dao so you're bullish on this Capital formation use case the Dao use case of smart contracts as well it sounds like you're very bullish stable coins in in general and maybe think that's one of the crypto's killer apps and then also nfts but aside from that the things that you are not bullish on that you don't buy that you think are kind of BS from the crypto space is probably the biggest one is that crypto whether in the form of Bitcoin either some other cryptocurrency is going to come usurp the dollar for Reserve currency status you don't think that's happening anytime soon and you kind of call BS on that side of things yes and like web3 as well there's a there's a post that uh maybe it was a guest post but like web 3 culture is similar to Amway culture I think there's elements of the Ponzi economics that you probably don't Vibe with and you're pretty bearish on as well is this accurate sure there's a million web three ponzis out there and there's this funny guy uh lyron shapira who who just like you know you sort of this crypto skeptic he just like yells about ponzis all day and it's kind of fun directly you know I mean he correctly called like you know that helium and axi were going to be ponzis and uh that was just obvious um yeah there's a million ponzis um there will continue to be ponzis like ponzis are are natural to unregulated financial markets right they not they are a naturally occurring thing my dissertation was on that um you know that's I yeah like I but okay but here's what's something that sounds cool so so uh we think of like a bank list we think of um Bitcoin as a as a Ponzi too and not not a Ponzi scheme but like more like a Ponzi game maybe like a like a pyramid game it's like more a way to sort of think about things and you also wrote a post that said I think Bitcoin has room for one more bubble so you are also bullish on maybe this this Bitcoin Ponzi as well 21 million fixes and this is what Sam bankman freed was getting into when he was on the odd loss podcast me like yes I support your Ponzi he was using Ponzi in a much more uh expansive way than what typical Society is used to but if you come into crypto you kind of like see the world of Finance as like a set of ponzis built on top of each other with a dollar at the very bottom and that's a very like foreign concept yeah no what do you think of this Finance is it's like okay so yeah finances there's like you can raise Capital to like build a productive Enterprise but like High Finance and trading there's just a lot of who would think it would do that do that this World War II I don't know so like yeah you can do that no people people do that all the time there's tons of you know it's mostly in debt markets which is why the debt markets are so much bigger than the equity markets because companies just borrow um but then uh yeah I know it's this is this is finance Finance is full of ponzis um unregulated Finance is full of more ponzis most of financial regulation is just trying to stop these natural ponzy bubbles from just like frothing because people get mad you know like people are mad that they lose all their you know they're constantly like like just there's all there's just suckers there's just you know Wise Guys and and lucky guys taking money from suckers and and unlucky people right and so and that's we think that this volatility in financial markets is sort of bad um when it's combined with a lot of debt like in the housing bubble it can actually hurt the real economy if it's not combined with debt it typically doesn't matter for the real economy like stonks go up stonks go down one person makes money another person loses money all this stuff right um everyone can lose money at the same time of course it's not conserved but but the point is that like um the point is that like this is how this is finance right there's going to be a lot of these ponzis axes Ponzi helium was a Ponzi helium switch from like a real business model that wasn't really working to like a Ponzi and then you know they're like well we could just Ponzi and maybe that'll help boost us to like some kind of sort of scale where we can become not a Ponzi and no that didn't happen and actually is just like we could have a Ponzi if it's also fun but in the end it was just and then like because it I mean because let's be honest it wasn't fun um so then like all these people and making the making the money that's the fun as soon as as soon as that as soon as that doesn't happen anymore then then the Ponzi right right and and so you have all these ponzis and um what I'm so so the interesting thing about Amway is that Amway has a thing where you have instead of just the the overall value of like Amway shares or whatever people monetize the people that they on board and the people they on board right so if I onboard Ryan and Ryan onboards David whatever David crappy shitty Amway products David manages to sell I get a little bit of cut from that because I'm the guy at the top and then you all worship me because I'm the guy at the top and at the events I'm the speaker and you buy my book and that's Amway culture and what I'm surprised is that none of these web 3 people have figured out how to create a downline because you can easily do that it's very easy with nft you know whatever is to create a downline what do you mean a downline oh the downline is the the chain of people who you onboarder than they on board and then they onboarded it's the chain of scent it's like the lineage of onboarding oh that was big connect okay they got prosecuted they get in trouble yeah 2017. as they should but you know do it offshore I don't know you can just like scam people out of a lot of money but but I mean okay so it that's illegal I don't endorse crime you'll get arrested don't do that um but what I'm saying is when I say do this I don't mean you should do this you shouldn't do this I'm saying someone will do this right this is this is how unregulated financial markets work if people do like that and um Finance you know web 3 is the financialization of tech it's like tech people were like okay well we figure out how to sell people the internet and we feel figured out how to sell people's social media and Ai and all this other stuff and now what do we sell people well maybe now we're done selling people stuff maybe now we could just extract it's time to own let's you know like it's it's time I think it's purely do you think web3 is purely extractive no yeah well I mean ponzis are extractive if you start a Ponzi like if you if you fund a Ponzi and then you you know it's a Ponzi and then you dump the tokens onto retail onto retail idiots you know and then walk away with cash and but you know before the Ponzi collapses you have extracted you have cashed out you have you have taken a little like like hose you have stuck that into some Main Street idiot who was you know like uh some some Muppet as they call them in the traditional Finance industry you've stuck your hose into some Muppet and you've gone I drink your milkshake you know that is what you've done and you know I don't endorse that that's not I wouldn't do that as a living you know I write blog posts for living I would not figure out ways to use a combination of algorithms and marketing to just extract value from the masses as my way of life but someone is going to someone's going to do that I I definitely definitely see that and we've seen more than our fair share and a lot of the bankless work is actually kind of educating about like what are the sustainable things we're building here and what what are the kind of the ponzis Noah I feel like we could go on with this episode for a lot longer and what this means is this is a reason for you to come back sir because we still haven't talked about the us we haven't talked about like its place in the world and there's so much there so I think I've got two two more things one is sort of a serious question and and the other is just more of a fun question to kind of close this out but let me ask the serious question first and this is uh part of the conversation we're just having but also ties into America so all of these Ponzi games we're talking about in web 3 and Bitcoin being a Ponzi right ether beings maybe a Ponzi too they're all ponzis all the way down so it's Finance how about the dollar sir is the dollar a Ponzi game as well what would it take for the us to lose its Reserve currency status I know that's it's stronger than it's ever been I mean we kind of see how it's trading against the Euro and the pound right now but all Fiat systems come to an end don't they and how about the US and its Destiny well all things come to an end when the sun blows up and the world goes dark and the heat death of the universe but the idea that all Fiat systems come to an end is is that doesn't necessarily mean a lot right like there's plenty of Fiat systems around that have not come to an end like the number of Fiat systems that have not come to an end greatly outnumber is the number that have come to an end right so like every every country has its own Fiat system now right and the number of Fiat systems in the pre-modern era was relatively small because not many countries had the state capacity to create a Fiat system yeah the Mongols did it right you had a few countries doing it but then before the 20th century Fiat systems are relatively uncommon um and so to say that they always come to an end most of them have not come to an end well let me let me pull that back a little bit how about their dominance comes to an end their Reserve currency uh use status for for example most recently the pounds transfer to um the dollar difference on a gold the pound was on a gold standard that wasn't a fiat currency I mean it was on it was a fiat currency and that we're issuing pounds that are nominally pegged to Gold so but it's it was not you know you had a um you had fractional Reserve banking whatever but it was not the modern so so the the modern dollar is not backed by anything except the federal reserve's Promises to Keep inflation low like that's that's the only thing backing the modern dollar there's never been a reserve currency before that was like that we're the only one we're the only one ever unless you count Kublai Khan right and I don't even know what was going on there specifically um I mean I know a lot but we don't know we don't exactly so are you bullish on the future like Supremacy Reserve currency status of the dollar into the decades ahead until the heat death of the universe until the sun explodes no um I think if the if the dollar collapses and nothing replaces it we have a world of Global Financial Anarchy and a lot of wealth gets destroyed um your your Bitcoin will go down way down everything will go down um uh that's a that's a difficult world the real play what we need to replace the dollar is just a better fiat currency um and I don't know who's gonna make that and we we hope that the Euro would take some of the burden away from the dollar and then Europe turned out to not quite be a country and so they had the Euro crisis in the early 2010s and um and so the Euro has not been as good at replacing the dollar as it should have but it's it's in there and and the yuan is the other big Contender right and China just has to change its whole society so that it's not like this closed society that tries to control everything that everybody does and so Capital controls and all the stuff so that's easy a lot easier said than done we need to replace the dollar to improve on the dollar we need a better fiat currency um commodity money is not likely to replace the dollar uh the future the future is Fiat it's not necessarily dollar Fiat um and the reason the future is Fiat is because uh Fiat is just so incredibly useful for buying Pizza no one has ever come with a better system for buying Pizza than Fiat and you can tell because Americans eat a lot too much pizza um David I think we just uh George on Pizza I think we found our episode titled the Futures Fiat here with what Noah Smith uh yeah yeah this is what the future right the future really is just pizza yeah how about that that's fantastic uh no this has been a lot of fun I promised the the fun question too so why should we be bullish on rabbits sir what is your obsession with rabbits can you tell me about this well I always had dog I love dogs and cats and I always had dogs and cats and I had other pets like hamsters fish whatever but then I never had rabbits and um because I was under a misconception that you they they poop everywhere that they're not toilet trainable but in fact it's insanely easy to toilet train a rabbit you just put the litter box next to the hay feeder and they toilet train themselves within a day and um so rabbits are easily toilet trainable and once I found out that I realized that they're basically just like vegan cats like and so so if you want a vegan cat then get a rabbit but but how smart are these creatures I mean do they have the intelligence I mean they're dumb but a cat's dumb too cats you think they act smart because they like you know seem wary of things but no cats are dumb like if you have cats they like um they can't figure out basic stuff and are always like just like falling over you know like and they're dumb and I love rabbits and they're about equally dumb so they're rabbits and cats are about equally smart dog all right I'm picturing a rabbit like a cat but without all the pretenses without all the kind of the the ego maybe no no rabbits rabbits have the ego as well really like rabbits definitely like cats expect cats are like this is my house you just live here human right they're very much bossy and rabbits are the same one they're they're like I will say that uh I agree I grew up uh at a very very young age with a rabbit in the house it was my sister's rabbit I was like two to four or something that thing terrorized me I was it's I was very scared oh see you know what they're like uh personality wise they're they're actually really like horses if you've ever had horses or taken care of horses um you will recognize that rabbits have the same personalities as Horses and and the same digestive system weirdly Noah I learned a lot about Rapids today I learned a lot about the the future of the world the economy World War III the potential for that Taiwan crypto as well you taught us some some things so thanks for coming on this has been a blast please visit us soon all right yep see you again bankless nation here's a spin Noah Smith
