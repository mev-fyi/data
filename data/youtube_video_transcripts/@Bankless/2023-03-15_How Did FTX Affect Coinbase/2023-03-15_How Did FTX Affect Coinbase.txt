how has the FTX collapse impacted coinbase as a business we had an incredible Finance team who built a risk function within coinbase and they were essentially underwriting every counterparty where we were storing funds during the crisis we were actually underwriting some of these things daily that was one of the first things but I guess just zooming out how can we actually counteract this one thing is to say look we agree with it right people in DC who still to this day believe that everybody in crypto essentially doesn't believe in regulation how could this be true because for 10 years we've been working on this we've been saying this just even repeating the very basic messages like that on the East Coast or in DC when we interact with folks you can't kind of underestimate the power of that
