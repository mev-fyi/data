minutes go okay so guys um yeah again thank you for having us super excited to be here and chat with you I think it shows phenomenal um so I I'll talk about what Runner is from sort of like a storytelling character perspective and then I'll let the other guys kind of fill in and how that populates the web 3 space um fundamentally um this is a you know a runner is a it is a story and we're deciding to tell it in this web three space and and at its core uh it's a reimagining of another world similar to Earth but um we're starting from a place that you know Earth is all based in Warrior culture but if you go all the way back ten thousand twenty thousand years essentially every culture was like whoever was the biggest and most badass got to be in charge of their Clan or their tribe and then when tribes intersected uh whoever was the most badass tribe got to conquer the other one and so on and so to today to the state we're in today so uh when uh Cedric uh uh you know our co-creator who unfortunately could not be here because he's shooting in Paris um we started talking about this thing I said well what if the world was born out of the simple idea that speed was the currency of power so it wasn't who was the strongest that got to lead it was the fastest right and so the leader of a tribe would be called the runner because they were the fastest runner in this tribe and then when two tribes intersected and had land disputes or whatever they would run against one another and the faster runner would have dominance what if we take that simple idea and then we push it basically 25 000 years into the future to hyper modern racing and what does that look like and what if essentially uh to have to to to rule an entire planet in this case this planet is called Omega to be the ruler of Omega there's essentially one single race a 21-day race that goes through every nation on this planet uh called the Omega race and uh the winner of that race essentially is the leader of this entire planet so we take that simple idea we bring it to the biggest thing and then from that point we built out culture character Vehicles technology religion you name it all coming out of you know reimagining it with that one simple change uh at the fun yeah at the the fundamental seat of all culture and and and um and existence so that's really the that's the thing and then it was about what's the best way to tell this story uh we'll talk about you know Comics we we kind of took 12 of our sense Central you know 12 characters that that that Cedric and I built out and and told this and we're telling the story in the comics of those 12 characters which introduces our community to the world to the rules to the lore to the individual stories that you connect to and root for um but you know as we'll talk about more the opportunity in web 3 is for tens of thousands of individual stories to be told by our community stories that intersect uh with this narrative that we're telling in the comic book and stories that may be completely independent of that um and and as somebody who's been a screenwriter playwright book writer that's what's most exciting about me is bringing um you know our creative consumers if you will uh in much earlier than typically you would in this kind of a process so you're you're starting to touch on this but it fundamentally you have this very cool IP very cool story idea and I think people in the nft community are starting to get used to or maybe wary of folks from Hollywood who maybe can't get their story told or can't get the funding for the movie they want to produce in Hollywood and or like let's try this new nft thing to get the money we want for our story and and that's really the entry point at which people then come at the nft community why is this not that why did you want to tell the story starting as an nft project or you know fingers crossed not because you just want money yeah I know I think it's a really good question and I think we should start by saying in no way do we view this as the equivalent of a Kickstarter right where we need to get this uh project funded let's go to the nft community uh web 3 community and have them fund it um we are you know fortunate and that we're situated in a certain place within the um traditional Hollywood system that we have the ability to go through that system and likely get this funded it's not necessarily the most direct route because there are always challenges within the studio system um but it is very possible and we have the expertise to do that what what really Drew us to the web 3 community and tackling this story this way is is frankly we want to be on the edge of Storytelling and the way that and be entrepreneurial in the way we tell stories and blazing touch upon this but one thing that's really interesting about the story is that there's these pinches which are kind of essentially wormholes which allow people who are maybe not as fast or don't have the resources uh to creating like as highly Advanced vehicles to take this risk and this chance and write the playing field and compete which changes everything within the world of our story and we felt like there was an easy parallel to be made with pinches from our story into web 3 where there is inherently this kind of pushing up against traditional structures and doing things differently and in a way riding the playing field and we just like that the other thing that's exciting is Blaze is truly one of the best world Builders from a story perspective there is um and he's been able to create this amazing sandbox of all these different nations and worlds and cultural touch points and all this these things but what is really exciting here is that we can populate the world in a different way there's always you know these characters that you see around corners I always worked on The Hunger Games and I'm bright and birds of prey and have worked on these really big movies with big canvases and you always populate those worlds and but you don't really get to know them here we can kind of utilize the um the ability of the pfps to create different identities within that world and then also tell stories in a different way which is really exciting and so that's gonna we'll keep telling the story regardless it's not it's not dependent necessarily on the success or the funding from the nft sale we're gonna we have already Towing in lots of different mediums but we thought that there was real Advantage from a creative perspective to do it this way yeah and I just want to add on to that real quick Carl and Brian was hinting at it but the real opportunity that we have here is to involve the people that are are drawn to this content that are drawn to our story we get them evolved so much sooner than traditionally we do in me a lot of times like we we develop it we produce it we cut it together and then we show consumers and maybe we might have a couple of test screenings to tweak a couple of things but this is we're bringing them in way early so we can bring them into the creative process early and to me it's not about as Brian said this is not a crowdfunding thing we can we we're all pretty established in this world we can bring a show to a studio and Pitch it and set it up but we love the idea of involving the people who are going to ultimately champion and consume and love this material to get them involved sooner and give them a sense of ownership give them you know some degree of literal ownership of their individual uh pfps from the character collection and for me that's what became most exciting because that hearkens back to my experience of playing with Star Wars toys as a kid and seeing the characters in The Cantina and those peripheral characters and bringing them to life in stories that aren't told on the screen but that I can tell at home so this feels like a graduation of that and there are some predatorial as as players touched upon there are some producerial Advantage advantages to doing it this way the the further that we can push the story along and make it more fully realize the more that we can conceptualize the world the more that we have a community behind us and a fan base behind us the more that there is just an essential like ownership from a community on that uh story that is only going to help us later when we pivot into more traditional mainstream modes of telling the story from a like strategic and financial and creative perspective if you have more behind it it's going to allow you to dictate more later so that is definitely something that we have taken into consideration but we don't want to just use the communities um like funding to go tell the story that's that's something that is not the objective I want to talk tactically about what it actually means to involve the community in the storytelling process and involving them earlier and like really in in specific terms what does that mean but before we go there I know you I've seen this term media 3 that you guys have used in interviews in the past and talking about I I assume that sort of the next evolution of Storytelling and how we're going to consume media as viewers and what media looks like I don't know who's best positioned to speak about that but but sort of explaining this concept of media three all right Bryce I think it's you all right yeah no I'm happy to talk about media three I think um going back to the earliest conception of Runner and what Runner could be we were looking at other properties that you know we really admire in the world and for me that's like Pokemon it's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles it's these properties that exist yes as television shows yes as comic books yes as video games yes as you know merchandising toy lines and all these sort of like kind of Evergreen properties that can be invented you know decade after decade and really have this like long-term cultural impact now the question is how do you make something like that and how do you make something like that in a media environment where you have to sell your entire IP to a studio up front hopefully you get a movie made you know and then maybe from there you start to spin out these other sort of like tertiary um pieces of uh content and and when we talk about Runner really really early on it was like well Runner is all of these things right so we have a comic book that we're telling that Blaze is telling that's about a very specific set of characters a very specific story that's sort of showing people into our world but Runner itself is the world right like Runner itself is the universe that we are building that can hold yes this this comic story that we're launching but also it could hold a merchandising story it can also hold the video game story it can also hold a television show or a feature film um it can hold you know different types of fashion it can hold different types of product Integrations that can hold you know community events and things uh you know online competitions like all of that stuff can exist within the story universe that we've built and so what is it right is it a comic book yes but is it just a comic book no right like is it is it a television show yes but is it just a television show no um and what it is it's really this this thing that is a very new type of creation and one of the things that's so exciting about nfts um is that yes you can go and you can create something uh yourself and and put it on the internet but then once P once it's on the internet you know we're giving you know ownership to our uh or like uh IP license to the nfts to our holders they can go and they can create within this world with us um and they can have access to us on the Discord and help create within this world with us and that's just a very different model of creation it's a very different model of Storytelling than anything that you see in traditional College web 2 media and um that's why we you know use the term media three so it sounds like getting back to this idea of sort of collaborating co-collaborating whatever it would be with the community you're you're approaching this from the gecko as a as a as a franchise piece you know like we're building an entire kind of universe and franchise all of Marvel or whatever and um in the populating of that franchise you know let's let's have the community be a part of that from day one and that's that's where this three piece comes in you know in a what I'm sure is a not a web three is is that effectively what you're saying yes I say the only thing that clarify it is that I often think that the franchise is um will be sequential to the degree in their in their development and um often you know there's the there's the movie and then there's the game based off of the movie and in a way that one sometimes is like shortchanged right because it doesn't feel like there's the smooth Baton Pass OR enough time and product development time or what have you to kind of do each in the best way possible and so what we're trying to do is really centralize the development here and so that all of the different mediums can inform one another and that there's that essential Bible we call it that everything kind of works off of um and so it's a little bit more in the day-to-day development of it but I do think in in to centralize that but I do think it will have a better effect on the product for each of these different mediums to to add to what Brian's saying then how does that play out into the web 3 world um so we've seen obviously communities come out where you have ownership of your of your character or your pfp but generally that construct of the story uh doesn't exist yet and that needs to be created over time and a lot of a lot of communities are struggling now to create this universe around their story and we're going from Story down so we're saying let's create that universe and then it gives the scaffolding it gives the railings for everyone in the community to be able to build within that and that's why we see things like Star Wars being extremely effective and Fan Art because it has that scaffolding that people can then take a character and go and build from that and then beyond that what does it look like to actually bring in the community to tell that story so without giving away too much we are bringing in some of the most well-known nft artists to help tell the story of the pinch that Brian just mentioned so what does it mean to get artists to interpret the pinch and be able to talk about it in their way using their native form what it would look like if a generative artist did a collection that is about the pinch and what would that look like an interpreter or you get Brian Brinkman or someone else within this sphere to help us craft these pieces of the story and tell it in their way and that links it back to that media 3 approach where it's not just that you own a character and you can do whatever you want commercially but actually you can be a participant in creating this story with us using what this form and this format that completely revolutionizes how we can bring communities into understanding telling of the story called a mega Runner you uh you predicted my my question which I I sort of two back-to-back and the first was going to reference Star Wars because I do think this is something that um you know we see a lot which is like oh the community is going to help us create this story and it's like well why do they want to right they want to go tell the Star Wars story because they're already attached to it and they already love it why do folks want to go tell the story of a runner or be a part of telling that so you you basically just answer that which is to say hey we already have the rails of the story but maybe explain a little bit more like how you're getting the story out there you've had this comic book launch but but really spell that out for us uh I mean I can I mean I can talk a little bit about this please feel for anybody else to chime in I mean obviously the comic book uh it's not just I I also want to be clear the comic book is actually in issue one of something that we have the scope of a hundred issues so we have a long Arc of telling the story of these characters if you you could you mentioned Star Wars this is this is our Luke Leia Han chewy kind of like that's that's that's their story but of course as we've already seen as as Star Wars diversifies and you're selling you're seeing stories told that are like almost R-rated and stories that are almost like preschool level in that space there's there's a lot of there's a lot of room to tell different stories about different characters and different ways about that space you can also move you know through time and tell different about different errors the the racing uh on the planet of Omega like running you know the idea of the runner even though now the the person who's piloting these high-tech Vehicles is called a runner because of the origins of this thing we've seen this evolve from from foot races to horse essentially horseback to boat steam etc etc so you can kind of explore within all that space we're also again like as somebody who spent a lot of time in the theater the Discord becomes a place for storytelling you have you have characters that are leaking documents about conspiracies that certain nations are are doing against one another you're seeing the narrative play out on on Twitter as well you know and we have accounts of you know there's uh Omega Omega race leaks about the sort of like Wikileaks character that's spilling spilling the T as it were about the concept of the pinch which we can talk a little bit I know we keep talking about the pitch I'll dive deeper into it that's that's sort of the Crux of I think what was what was interesting to me and why I want to talk about this but so so how big is your community give folks a sense how big is the community right now on Discord or on Twitter that that's bringing this engagement yeah we we have so we did a our first comic book a comic issue dropped and sold out within like I think 24 48 Hours um which is really exciting um and there is like a I don't know the exact numbers but it is very fun and vibrant um but that 5 000 those original Comics it was 5 000 original Comics that you launched you can get into the specifics for the different levels and specifically we're talking about the first edition nft so the comic there's a first edition nft which is a kind of an all-access pass to the MIT universe that was 1000 comes with a comic um there will be opportunity to buy more comics later but I would say just to answer your question Carly is going back to like why do people want to um I would just answer it's really fun like it's really fun I'm um I have had to it's fun if you have a good story that people want to latch onto and build on to and I think that was the the point I was trying to get at is like you have a lot of I think projects in this space that are like we're gonna have the community co-create this story and it's like well why would they pick yours they could co-create Star Wars fan fiction right now you know exactly and and I think what differentiates us from um from that is that it is actually more sanctioned we are genuinely incorporating this into the long-term growth of the uh of the franchise and so that voice matters and um we have I think some of the best storytellers in the industry to work off of and you know I've I just made I love being in that process of throwing ideas back and forth and building something I think it's so satisfying and so but even if you put that aside even the the creative satisfaction of building something and the community that results around that it could be also very lucrative in in the long term I've been lucky enough to be a part of franchises in the past and I've seen how it starts something that starts in in a room and then with a little bit of a wider Community can literally touch the world and once it pivots into that mainstream uh Arena you know the sky's the limit as far as the influence the global influence but also the financial upside and that's what the name of the game is right now for all of these different streamers and content creators is to have something that can touch that nerve um and you all you have to do is go to Target after any Lego Movie and see the obvious merchandising amount of financial upside of what that all means and the and then the best-selling list for books that are made like um and how certain mainstream movies and TV series can can build that but to get in early on something that own part of that is a real upside as well and when you talk about going to the store and seeing the merchandising I think you're touching on the important Point here which is due to Securities laws and then any number of handful of other reasons the upside here for early holders is is um primarily as a collectible item where if this ID takes off you hold a collectible item much like there are Star Wars collectibles that are worth a lot or Marvel Collectibles that are worth a lot because you can't really hold an equity piece in the film itself without it becoming an illegal security and there's tight controls around how you can issue like real equity in a film for example yeah it's that that's the the most um essential um Financial website but we we take it very seriously to build utility for this community and to always give back and already the folks that are like participating and building with us like we have such affinity for and that's going to be something that will we are going to keep building with those folks um in a lot of different ways as well like people in the Discord being like oh here's a leak about this race happening in Omega you know I'm probably getting the specifics here wrong but they're they're ideating in a Discord or in Twitter about something they want to see happen in Omega it sounds like so when we talk about that the co-creation specifically is that something then Blaze you're reading this and you're like okay hey we're going to integrate that into Comic four that's a great idea or how does it practically look like this back and forth between you and the community that's great great question it's it's a little bit of everything it reminds me a lot of again I'm gonna it reminds me of being in theater and kind of playing an improv a lot of yes and right so so you'll see some people like create a character on the Discord and sort of or you know on one of the big things on the Discord is that you're able to you take like you know those Harry Potter surveys which house you sorted into early on we people were able to sort into like the nation based on on their Tendencies and traits and and people very quickly then had access to the capital of that Nation once they declared for that nation and then people just started riffing and and like really leaning into the culture and that would feed them more stuff and and see what they got into and then also like um so to me like to answer it is like it's a little bit of everything it's sort of like I start to play with them they start to play with me either through myself or through one of the characters that I'm sort of like working within this space and to see how much they're playing and I'll give you just like a a random examples I post people were asking about the concept of of Crews and mechanics in this thing and I said okay I'm going to give a little taste a little art so this character burn through Rama who features in issue two of the comic I put an image of them up here I'm like here's an example of a mechanic in this world of Omega now Brent and Rama happen to have a little pokemon-esque looking sand cat peeking out of the top of his overalls so immediately people zoomed in like what the [ __ ] is that what is this I need to know more and and I saw very quickly people got super excited about the concept of people having these creatures because all of the all of the um fauna on this planet is totally different because they evolved in a very different way so right from that I was like okay we need to lean into creatures more like people are responding to that not exactly like um you know like a a Daemon from the his dark materials or something but just like that they're in the periphery we should incorporate these things they should play a role just because people respond to it that's something I wouldn't have anticipated if we're not involving people early on I'm also seeing um what's really interesting is like based on personalities is how they're drawn to Nations so you it's really fascinating to watch people's person to see how much they engage in challenges and stuff because a lot of people want to go to this planet uh this nation of corn because it seems a little wild a little more fun but they don't do anything on the challenges whereas like sort of like the quiet more studious people ended up in maybe one of the Nations that doesn't on the surface seems super cool uh but they are so engaged and like it's been I don't know I'm I'm sort of rambling my point is it's it's Dynamic um it's constantly pivoting and I think as creators it's our responsibility to sort of like play and engage and be flexible and understand that things are happening yes I have very specific ideas about this world that I've spent two years building you know with Cedric and Brian and Bryce but I also like any good Creator you have to listen to you know the people in theater would be the the audience the audience is telling you if they're digging it or not you know if what you're doing on stage isn't working so you need to Pivot you need to engage you need to listen and that's that's sort of where we're at right now and we're coming at it a lot of different ways to bring it back to the media 3 at the side and how we're bringing in the community so part about part of our roadmap is to develop a number of mini games uh on the path to Omega and building out a fully featured game um but what we've done is on the 28th it's actually happening with the internet game we are taking one of the games within their world uh and we're turning that into the pinch race so we're calling it a mega pinch uh and their Community is able to go through the pinch and thread the pension and play this game and compete uh to be a runner to train to be a runner within this world uh and bringing in their Community into the story and seeing how do they respond to that in the Dynamics that Pub within there and what does it look like that if you win the race you earn a token to be able to join into a mega or our first edition Comics within their prize pool and how do you bring in all these different s aspects of web 3 into telling the story of Omega Runner that's something that's completely new that's never been done before of how do you take the story this IP all these communities that are out there and bring content to them in a native form but that's already been created without you that you know internet game is already going g-money is going to be streaming the game live he's going to be talking about these Runners that are training how are they doing and bringing and introducing people into uh that story together with us and those types of collaborations that bring in those types of communities is what is what it means to be a media 3 project as opposed to a traditional project yeah one of the reasons that this project initially jumped out at me is I've used the example of this on the show before and I I got it from feature I don't know if y'all are for me to familiar with feature dot IO their Studio they do the Huxley project with Ben Morrow um and they're also working on a hardware device with the premise of like how do we bring nfts to your TV in the example they've you like you know kind of a Roku like something you plug into your television like an over the top kind of streaming box that would be web3 native with a concept of they've used like the race car example of like okay if there's a racing show and maybe you have nfts and it's it's pre-scripted or something and then you know your car loses your nft gets burned or you know your your nft gets enhancements because your car wins and sort of in the live sports or category even if it's a prescripted live sports day or maybe you know live I'm using quotation marks like however you end up functioning that like the concept of having these Dynamic nfts that are evolving based on what's on the screen is really interesting to me and racing is um sort of an obvious thing for that I think also just like sudden death competition in gaming is is uh just elevated if you have an nft component where it's like you might lose your nft that might be worth something if you're going head-to-head with somebody in an arena I see you guys smiling and nodding like you guys have thought about this stuff yeah I mean all of the above like it's I mean it's the potential is is massive and I love you know it's like you pointed out um you know the heightened Stakes of of you know consequence of of actually you know getting into the arena as it were and and and driving um and running so yeah no I all all of the above all of those things are are on the table from from my point of view and we've programmed it into a Wednesday program but what we've done is on a technological level so there's the story level of what you just described and the potential possibilities and there's the technology to back that up that we can do that over time uh one of the things that we've done with this project is we've uh we've built it on top of uh on top of omni chain uh technology so that we are able to be able to port to different chains as the Omega race continues to grow so we spoke in the beginning Blaze mentioned it's a 21 day race that goes across multiple Nations uh so what does it look like if the Quorum nation is on Solana or if the avalonian nation is on tezos and what happens to your nft on those different chains and the performance of your vehicle in the game uh when it's race day on a home terrain or on a foreign terrain how does that interplay actually happen and now the technology for the first time exists to be able to start experimenting with those types of mechanisms built into these Dynamic types of nfts coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure

the fundamental concept where I was like all right let's have these guys on I want to talk about this and try and wrap my head around this a little bit so I know you're using layer zero which is a a protocol and folks can look it up I think it's layerzero.network ends up being the the website for them um that has these um is you know driving toward you know an omni chain future so I have been somewhat skeptical on this show like I've like voiced skepticism about the Omni chain future and I think that like when you when you first come into blockchain or for me at least when I first came into blockchain I was like no-brainer we're gonna have this multi-chain world obviously obviously and then I got a little deeper and I was like okay where do these where do these hacks come from they come from Bridges and they got like the security between chains is where things get very tenuous and dicey whereas on ethereum I feel like I really have started to have an understanding and a grasp of their scaling plan and if they can solve sort of a TPS throughput problem why not just build everything on ethereum where you have the ethereum security and then you have all the network effects et cetera et cetera um and now I'm coming back to opening my mind to the multi-chain Future and the technology will get there and and it was actually funny somebody in a response to me saying this kind of thing on the podcast previously had sent me layer zero as a protocol saying hey check this out I think this might be one of the answers to living in this multi-chain world so I want to get into how you're weaving the storytelling elements into this and you've you've uh already alluded to it a little bit but can you just help me understand Yosi like how does this technology work this jumping from chain to chain technology yeah so taking it back to our story Into the law when we've mentioned the pinch uh as this Wormhole technology that gives you an advantage in the race but it comes at extreme cost it may be extremely dangerous you may uh end up getting uh damage to your vehicle or potentially dying if you do it badly uh and we you know what you've just described in this multi-chain environment of developers trying to figure out how to communicate between change it's kind of like the world of the pinch where it gives you these types of advantages that theoretically we understand but right now it's still pretty difficult to do and we've seen has been exposed a couple of times and brought in some vulnerability so what layer zero has done which we thought was extremely Innovative and why we wanted to go with this approach is they built in a messaging layer effectively that's what it is so you're not necessarily using a bridge you're not putting your assets it's somewhere else and then it is moving from one chain to another it is a way to message the state of a asset on one chain and when you move it to another it is able to message that movement across another chain I don't understand the full technical details of how that actually works but in essence from what I understand um all you're doing is communicating that this asset was sitting over here and now it is sitting if um sitting over there so if you want to transfer an asset from Solana to some um ethereum to polygon you now don't need to use a bridge per se to be able to do that you can do a direct transfer and what's keeping track of that is what these call these relays and oracles and that messaging layer then says hold on this asset's no longer sitting on ethereum it is now sitting on tezos so what does that mean for us that means that we can have a nft that is State aware it can know what is um that it is on the ethereum Chain today and this is the attributes of the nft put on ethereum if we move it onto a Tesla's chain well this is the attributes of that nft on uh tezos simple example example maybe the background color is different to visually represent what chain you're on or maybe the strength of the car instead of being plus 10 is plus 12 because it's on this terrain and it gives us that type of ability that we can program into these nfts from the foundations that's why we've integrated with layer zero and that's how we bring it back to the story of the pitch so interesting again this is like what just felt very novel to me about this and I I really I like the the blending of Storytelling elements with technical elements I've talked on the show and had Blake fanucaine who can whose last name I pronounce correctly every time I bring her up I'm sorry Blake you know I think you're brilliant um and she's talked about this concept of staking a storytelling which is you saw we've seen a wave of like stake your nft and you get these rewards but like why the hell are you staking you know like staking is functionally for securing a network and then like all these nft projects develop staking as a way to just be like yeah I don't know just like lock up your nft and so but now you have these projects like 10K TF and and tally Labs has been doing this I think of it with Jenkins of La where you stake for 24 hours say and when you stake it it has something to do with the story that's being told and so there's this interaction between what you're doing on a technological level to the story itself um and and I just I find that fun in in you know the nerdy way that you know we're all here so so I really love that it's maybe worth mentioning this functions on evm compatible chains is that right like there's something about the ethereum virtual machine that is really what's enabling this um so give us you started to get specific there but let's let's go again so this race is happening I have a car and maybe it's power if I'm racing within ethereum is 10 but then because my car is of the current world or something that's I know not a good example because they don't actually participate in the race but and then I move on to Solana and now it has a strength of 12 and I have a better chance of winning because that's not actually like my home my home nation is Solana for example because of the the nation that I've align myself with is that what you're describing and you'll you'll host these games or events across different chains and your odds of winning or or performing will deviate based on or you know depend on the Chain you're on and the nation you're a part of that's since Bryce wants to jump in yeah I I think that's that's one way to think about it and I think that's uh you know one of the very exciting possibilities the other way to think about it is uh you know I'm a huge fan of F1 and I think about it like I'm hosting an F1 race right like if we can have the runner polygon Invitational right where everybody in the runner ecosystem which is a you know it's an eth native nft but say polygon wants to host a competition or say there's some type of uh you know mechanic that is available on a chain that's not available on Eve or runs better on another chain and so we decide hey everybody this weekend we're having this big contest it's over you know on Avalanche it's over you know wherever it is um send your nft that way we're gonna go play this game it's gonna you know require 500 transactions at no money each right no gas um and then when you've won you'll have a you know a champion nft whatever it is you can move it back to ethereum kind of live back in your native home base as you would um for any other you know nft in your Grail collection and I think that's like a a really fun sort of dynamic that hasn't been used across other projects yet totally do you need to have a wallet for every other chain that might participate in this like do I need to have my Phantom wallet to if I move over to Solana and now it lives there and it disappears from my Open Sea wallet like what does that look like you would if you were if you were moving so but but to start we're launching on ethereum so it will be a you can use your metamask wallet or whatever wallet you're using but when the races happen when we are doing these events and these invitationals you wouldn't even have a native wallet for the chain that you're on to be able to interact with the asset on that chain but you don't have to do you don't have to have um let's say Matic uh to be able to do the transaction if I'm sending my um my nft from ethereum to a polygon Invitational and I want to be able to compete on one element of it layer zero takes care of that whole process without you having to now load up medic put it on uh be able to run the transaction and be able to execute it on your side it takes care of that entire so it removes that complexity from you having to figure out all of those steps cool so to talk to us about timeline here so you launched the initial 1000 nfts which were the comic book nfts that gave you access to the initial first phase comic and then where do you go from here when does the second comic or third or whatever come out and how do these I think more Avatar pfps you can tell me your avatar pfp nfts play into that timeline yeah absolutely so the first um the first thing that's coming up actually starting on the 21st of September is we're opening the claim for our first edition nft which is um these have already all been sold but a number of people bought multiple so I'm sure there will be a secondary Market that appears um and this will be the first sort of like secondary um Market that will exist in the runner universe and that starts uh September 21st at 9 A.M Eastern there's a nine day claim period it will close September 30th um for the first 72 hours of that claim period we're actually reimbursing gas for all of our holders so um you know claim I think this episode is probably coming out at like 7 A.M Eastern on the 21st one of the first people listening to this if you're listening 92 hours in which gas will be refunded yeah and our our community is I'm pretty aware of this and I'm very excited to get their first edition nfts and then uh beyond that the next phase will be um we'll be opening sales uh for uh mint passes for the pfp collection those will also include uh a first edition comic that will be shipped to your door um that is uh something that's you know very important to us is that people understand the lore of this world and of this story and have access to the comics and access to the content that we're creating and that will be the that will be uh early October you need to have one of these nfts in order to access the comic or do you have are you trying to get just broad reach and Broad distribution of the comic and how are you thinking about that long term the goal is that anybody with a with an nft in the runner universe will be able to access the comic digitally um right now we're just doing the physicals because it's so fun to have a physical item shipped to your door I think there's something that's really like tangible and yeah the play's got a picture of it okay wait let me spell this out for folks because I don't know if this is clear so there isn't right now like you can't go online somewhere and read the runner comic you if you bought an nft you were able to effectively not redeem it but you were able to you know you put in your your address and every you mailed everybody the physical comic yes moving forward there's a plan to have them be accessible digitally in a token gated way so is the plan never to have people outside of the the token holders read or access the comic no we are also um not to show our hand too much but we're you know we've had conversations with Publishers and people like that um I would love to sell this comic in the traditional sense right to people who are simply comic fans who aren't necessarily FTP because um you know when we think about global content there's yeah there's a hundred thousand nfts users right and there's yeah 50 million comic book readers and so it's like how do you make something that can be like if this can be a success in the comic book space on its own right which is you know we've taken every step to make that possible that will only benefit the nft community um of course and so long term I would love to publish uh like a collection a volume um that could be accessible in you know Barnes and Noble that'd be great yeah I mean it seems like if if the your superpower is the is your world building and and the strength of your story and your world then and and if the goal here is Marvel right then certainly having millions of fans is is what you want and that that is ultimately beneficial to early adopters or that's the the bet at least um that actually brings me to circling back to community a little bit here and and how you grow it I I'm friendly with a lot of nft creators who don't come from the Hollywood world but who have built audiences and and fans of their nfts and their their IP and have started having conversations with big Hollywood Studios or big Hollywood producers and it seems like the conversation follows a very similar pattern which is they're like hey we have you know 150 200 000 followers on Twitter and we have this really active Discord and all these people so excited about our our story you know IP here you know usually there isn't really a story fleshed out and the Hollywood producer says that's so great how many like people own this thing and they're like you're like three thousand five thousand and they're like cool come back to us when you have half a million people who care about this and um I actually think I heard I think it was you Brian I heard you on an interview is saying something similar which is like TV shows are canceled um you know if you have less than half a million viewers a week or whatever per episode what are the steps to to your guys's mind going from from where you are now to either half a million fans or whatever that number is or going from where you are now to we have a television deal or we have a movie studio deal y'all are the folks that know how this works so how does it work yeah I'm glad you brought that up Carly it's it is something we think a lot about um I think first and foremost it really is important to have the right concept I think Runner is unique it's a kind of unicorn concept that is really hook conceptually hooky right and can have longevity um from a animation series perspective or a movie you can see how the people that we operate with regularly at the different Studios will like this this idea and I think that that is important to bring up because unfortunately there's many projects out there in the nft space that are amazing um and have so much they have some Singularity a singular look there's a Vibe but not necessarily the fundamentals um from a story perspective that will be able to build off of for what you know people look for in mainstream TV and movie space and it's harder to reverse engineer at so I do think that's what's really fun about having Blaze and Cedric here building it from the bottom up with the fundamentals so that that is part of it but again I think it goes back to just as we're not a um a Kickstarter where we're we're not entirely dependent only on the fan base that is built out of the web 3 space we're seeing this as a multi media web meet you know a media three um property so we're looking at this from all sorts of different ways and thankfully we're uniquely able to package this and strategically position it in all mediums just as you know at the highest level and so ideally that that compounds upon one another and it becomes something that will build into the um to eventually what what we would love to see was it's something like a major you know franchise and I just want to real quick I just want to add on that I think it's really important to know that Runner its whole origin was story first even before we got into look even you know because look I fall I mean I'm an art collector I love art but um but we were just like we really kind of ate our vegetables right you know because we didn't want to run into this problem where we create these incredible Aesthetics and then we're trying to shoehorn narrative into it we started with story and then and then you know Cedric really did a fantastic job because we have you know there's a slight variation on the looks between I mean slight variation on the looks between Comics uh you know the character collection pfp but he really did a fantastic job in designing these characters so that they're all those the Silhouettes the Aesthetics are the same across platforms it translates well to animation it translates well to games it translates well to to physical toys to vinyl toys all of those things so to me it's like the the real thing is like it's awesome to bring this community that we're built building to the studios when it's time to to set this thing up and say hey look we have this incredibly engaged active Community that's that's a plus um but for me the real power in that Community is is all the stuff that we're talking about is is is sort of like is building this together you know you know creating this thing together again all these people that have these that we're going to be minting the 21st to the 30th these first edition nfts they're they're going to be invited into the writers room they're going to be invited in to collaborate they're going to get to see the process and they also have the opportunity to kind of weigh in too so that's another form of Engagement um all of that stuff to me as a Creator is ex is just so exciting and we have this incredible resource of this community to inform our story and that's the real power not necessarily as much to say like look at we have a gabillion fans you have to buy this yeah well and I would say the the thing that is different is those uh different communities or the the producer that calls and says come back when you have this um you know we're that team that we're not coming back then we're doing it right now we're building it from this point so that it will get to that place and um that's what's really exciting is we're not waiting on that incoming call here uh you know we all have projects at every Studio around town we can get that stuff done but we want to do this in the right way and build it fundamentally up from the from and so that's that's sort of my question which is I'm with you I think the hook here is there and I do think a lot of projects lack that they a lot of projects have awesome visuals awesome characters that make you feel something when you look at them but they don't have a story with hook and this concept of like here's this world and it's and running and these races are the you know keys to power in this world like you can that immediately Clicks in the brain you know and you're like okay cool I could I could see that I could see that getting built out and the evolution as you pointed out from walking to running to boating to whatever you know as you kind of laid that out like you could you can feel that there can be a history to this world like all of that I think really connects and so you are in this and then given your your backgrounds and your the industry you work in you may be unlike others you don't you don't have to come to the studios with the same value prop you don't have to be like hey we're total newbies but we have half a million fans which is what you're getting at you can do it organically with the folks that love you and grow it organically as you want but it strikes me that like you are having these conversations or you plan to have these conversations with Studios on the basis of your backgrounds like what do the steps look like there like is this the kind of thing where you kind of start casually dropping it as you're talking to Warner Brothers and you're like by the way we're seeding the story we got these three people involved and here's the hook what do you think and then they're like oh we're kind of interested and then and then you send them a a screenplay for like an initial movie like how does this play out step by step yeah there there's many different ways to to do it um you know we've what you mentioning what you're mentioning about those early conversations we I field a lot of incoming already about Runner um from Studios and there's there's a different way to position it though I I think like if you hold on and really build it in the right way control it from a creative perspective control it from a community perspective protect the people that are there early and really look after them and to be sure that it's fully realized there is some discussion as to whether yeah you go as far as actually getting a screenplay actually you know making um a visual reel certainly we have a lot of conceptual art but there's a very it's important I think to do the work up front and not just hand it off to the Warner Brothers of the world much as I have a ton of respect for them that is a as a there's an easy way to lose the creative control and the ability to protect the community if you do it too early so I I I know that it sounds good from an Optics perspective sometimes to have that press release that you have X Studio or you have that star involved not always the best way to actually get the thing done in the way you want it to be done so I hope is that people will trust us that you know we've done it many times now um we we have the ability to execute on it but we need to do it in the right strategic way and the more we can build as a community now the better we're gonna have of the time later with with those big Studio Source streamers is some of the inbound about Runner because you're doing this nft thing and is there a curiosity in Hollywood of like how is this integrating or is there like a resistance to it in Hollywood and that's no no I mean I think it's frankly just our relationships um that we have working at all those places and there's the fluidity of conversation what are you doing how you doing oh I saw you're doing this it's really great like please keep me posted on it there's a jockeying for position for different properties um when it just because it's a relatively small community so that that type of thing happens are they interested in the nft stuff or like what is the vibe in today's DNA you know in this market in the bear Market sort of in like you know behind the scenes Hollywood I think I mean I'll I'll just speak for my own experience I think people are curious you know because I mean look I I'll be very candid you know a year and a half ago I had no idea what web3 was I really didn't I had a passing understanding of nfts and it really was Bryce that that that helped me learn and and as a Storyteller who tells stories across all platforms I'm always looking for another way to tell a story once I finally understood it and solved the degree of Engagement then I was like oh [ __ ] this is a whole new way to do this like this is no one's done this and it also changes the way that we can tell our stories the interactivity of it and all of that so that got me super excited and the other the only thing I want to add in terms of like the process of getting you know setting a movie up what's been amazing and I just have to you know you know shout out our partners yossi and everybody at metaversal what's been amazing is that we are actually right now developing you know in the active development process of making you know an animated or you know a a series about Runner all the things that we're doing from from Building looks to and the comic book is essentially storyboards and a script of something that will eventually be a series so it's and what's been amazing is because we have metaversal we're able to to do this together to develop this on our own terms intend with our community and when we get it to a place where like it's a PR we've proven it not just to our community but we have to prove it to ourselves every time like do we want to invest you know our time which adds value into this thing long term and that's what we're doing right now so that's what's been amazing so when we go to the studio we have front loaded so much stuff um which I'm so excited about and it puts us we can show them this is exactly what leverage in the interaction when you show up yeah and but I do think you're touching on an interesting thing Carly which is um there is this definite curiosity for the nft web3 space out of um traditional Studio system but there is this kind of difficulty of accessing web3 it there's it's a daunting thing for the layperson right and so I think I feel really fortunate that I had Bryce and yossi and kind of Orient um us into the world of it but there does at some point need to be that kind of more clear bridge between web3 and mainstream culture and like and not have it be as niche in order for its survival in the traditional space if that's the intention I'm not sure exactly what that bridge is but I do think and I I think starting with some of the fundamentals that come out of the traditional space like a good story that works there could be one Bridge because if people become impassioned about you know a story or and they feel a sense of self around it they will more likely navigate into new domains because that is their that is their the Trojan Horse in a way into it so the more of these big ones that can happen uh the better and I but I don't I do Wonder a lot about what other mechanisms are there to bring people like myself and employees who were a little hesitant to at first navigate into it and then even further how do you get my aunt my uncle into this space um if you want to but I think it would be something that could be valuable to the longevity of the space you've got Disney coming out saying uh we don't use the word metaverse I think uh Bob chapit called it the m word and he's like it's got two you know it's there's too many feelings around metaverse but we're doing next-gen storytelling you know and you're you know it's like okay so there's Starbucks they're all getting into it what they would for uh what is it yeah Journey stamps they're not nfts they're Journey stamps so as we look to rap here I would love to to maybe turn it to you yoc and and I've had Jake Brockman on the show before Jake Brockman founded coin fun which has been investing in crypto projects from very early on they were sort of like the seed funding partner incubating partner for metaversal which is uh like a ft metaverse project studio and an investment fund you helped co-found and um how did you get involved here and and why did you you know want to join on with Runner as a project with everything that's that's out there in the world yeah Kylie you asked kind of how does what's the process to take this to a studio to uh be able to pitch them on making the animated series and the way uh I first learned about Runner was I got sent the script uh from from Brian and the story of a mega Runner and read the script and was like Wow there is many layers here to what the the team are trying to build so the script being separate from the comic like you guys have a script that's not even the comic that you're like privately beta-ing to people you want as partners it it was uh it was a 10 pound I don't know if it's the full skip it was a 10 page kind of this is the world of Omega putting you into the scene of one of the characters uh and this universe that's being built uh and then some concept art that came with that and this idea that this world wants to be bold uh I know we're looking for a web 3 uh Studio partner to help uh to help support that and going to that Foundation if we talk about what metaversal does we talk about investing in the infinite stories of our culture really do believe that what we're building here with Omega and megarana has that uh capability it has different characters from different worlds it has um the underdog it has the authoritarian Dominator it has all of the different elements that people can identify with in telling the story so that's what got me intrigued about it and then I got to meet these fine young gentlemen uh and uh and be able to hear from them how they want to bring that to life and I was like well we definitely want to be partners uh in this production and do that into play of what does it look like to bring New Media out new films new productions in this interplay with web3 in the city to play with our community with nfts uh what does it look like to open up a Rider's room and invite people to be part of that process give them a little bit of the behind the scenes of what does it take to actually go down this journey be part of this fun world called Omega racing these characters and build out that type of production well you know that that was a no-brainer for us and why we got involved I'm curious just broadly as as you all at Runner have looked at Partnerships I think you work with sun creature in Denmark I think I saw which is an animation and creative studio and strv and Prague which I think is is a Dev Studio you have this like very Global team that you're working with on different parts of this project how do you go about picking your partners and and you know how did you sort of how you ended up where you are we pick a time zone that we currently get to sleep and we say what if what if we don't sleep and hire someone in that time zone um no I think you're like what if we tried to build this thing without ever getting a full night's sleep because our team was everything exactly we're on we're on five continents the Sun never slept sets on Omega um I think it was really always about finding um the people that kind of understood what this was both from a web 3 perspective but also from a traditional media perspective so for instance Sun creature is an incredible 2D animation house um they do a lot of 2D design they do a lot of work for uh runeterra and uh the the Arcane concept art we have a lot of those artists on our team um and I think when we were approaching this you know we came to them and we said hey we would like you to help us develop a world as if we're developing a television show but then we're going to take a left turn when we get through some of this early stage concept art instead of putting it into a television animation we're going to put it into an nft collection what do you think and you know they were incredibly excited to kind of jump into that challenge and figure out how that works and I think the results have been really spectacular um I think it's sort of a similar approach um that we had for picking our technical Partners which was like who can we work with that can help us figure out you know not just from a you know a web development perspective but also a web 3 development perspective but also a um you know kind of General programming uh challenge you know the way our nfts are are layered and even just the way our randomizer Works to build uh generative art is so much more complicated than anything I've seen from other collections we're talking hundreds and hundreds of layers and the reason for this is because the art is so much more detailed and like those there's things like that that are worth doing that take time they take a level of expertise um that you know meant we had to go to traditional animation VFX type companies to find the programmers who could handle that type of complexity yeah and just from the thrill of you know having these creative Partners having you know decentralized you know like film development that you can you can you can tap into you know for a long time it was like people you had to live in in town to be a part of this process to be a part of the Hollywood system and and the fact that like you know and I and I think you know covid as much of a nightmare as it was really accelerated a lot of that in in systems of of collaboration and and now we just do it seamlessly it's really it's incredible and yeah I mean uh Fabrizio who's Who's the artist in our comic is from Italy uh and you know we've never met face to face but we're you know creative Partners like we've you know this is our baby um you know like it's it's incredible so it's it's thrilling and and um yeah it's it's what gets me uh gets what gets me out of bed every morning uh is is this project and this team to close it out I think we have a fun offer for the audience which is we are running a pre-mint raffle y'all have been very generous and I believe are raffling off for um like or early edition nfts one for each of the nations in Omega that will be given to members of the overpriced jpegs community so we're gonna have a pre-mint link uh in the show notes I'm pointing if you're not on YouTube that's why I'm hesitating in the show notes you'll have we'll have a link to this pre-mint um thing you go in you sign up you do all the pre-mint stuff and you'll be entered for the raffle did I uh did I get that right you have 24 hours because speed is the currency of power so 24 hours from when the show comes out you are going to need to complete that premium link uh to be able to enter that raffle yes rewarding those who are Die Hard fans who listen to the show the moment it drops on your commute Wednesday morning that's what we're looking for you'll have two benefits now from this show you'll have the the pre-med link and you'll also you know have that 72 hour window to to uh claim gas free or you know whatever that I'm gonna get all my words tumbled here but uh you know because you just listened to this episode so yeah and we just want to encourage everyone you know like follow us on Twitter you know come to the Discord on the Discord there's a bunch of sneak peeks you can actually see almost all of the comic book pages in sneak peek so you can you know get in there our our website is very interactive it has an interactive map that shows different facets of different nations so so come on in see if this speaks to you if you respond to this material get involved and yeah coming up we're going to be doing more sales of the physical comic there's only going to be you know there's a thousand we've sold there's only five thousand in the world if you own this you are the only one of five thousand who's gonna own this and that's gonna you know the next round is gonna come with that uh uh that uh mint pass which we're super super excited about so yeah get involved learn about Omega learn about Runners and come run with us fantastic thank you guys so much for joining I really appreciate it I think you have some just really unique awesome elements to what you're doing so appreciate you sharing with It sharing it all with
