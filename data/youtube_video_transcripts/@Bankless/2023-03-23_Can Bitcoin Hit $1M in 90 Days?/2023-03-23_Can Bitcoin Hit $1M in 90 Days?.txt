how is Bitcoin going to become worth a million dollars in the next three months I don't think I've ever made a price prediction just not what I do but hundreds of banks in the US are insolvent they took your deposits and they bought long-dated treasuries and other long-dated government bonds and then the FED raised rates in 2022 and stuck the banks of this giant surprise this massive devaluation of bonds just like Sam Baker and free they book it as having not depreciated oh it's still worth what we paid for it we're good right it didn't notify you the depositor that the money was gone get whatever you can into crypto I recommend Bitcoin a lot of Fiat banks are about to die they all trusted the FED at the same time buying the same asset getting it devalued then all going bust at once that's basically what's happening
