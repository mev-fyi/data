iron is a system that seeks out yield in defy and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well bankless nation happy thursday morning we're coming at you a day early because it is thanksgiving edition of our weekly roll up happy thanksgiving david how you doing man it's a turkey roll up this week glad you guys are here hope you guys are having a fantastic thanksgiving and we are ready to get this roll-up underway i'm going to go through five topics get it injected right into your brain first we're talking about the markets what are the markets saying five minutes for that then we're gonna go into releases what got released that's this last week five minutes for that what's in the news five minutes for that and then we go in to what's on your mind and what are you excited about five minutes each ryan are you ready to roll up this week i am super ready guys grab a drumstick grab your morning coffee it's time to roll up as a reminder this usually comes at you on fridays on youtube you can catch it live with the visuals you also get on the podcast we're doing it thursday special today and i am ready let's get started david with the market what is the market telling us this week my friend let's let's open these bitcoin charts and see what's going on here bitcoin is at eighteen thousand and eight hundred dollars it's been poking around nineteen thousand the low nineteen thousands the high eighteen thousands really flirting with all-time highs so that's just an absolutely exciting thing to see with bitcoin ether is at five hundred and eighty dollars it got up to six hundred and twenty dollars earlier so both of these assets are really into uncharted territories with regards to their previous uh levels yeah it's been a long time coming for eth last week we were talking bitcoin had that big run up and now this week from from then till now it was eth's turn let's talk about bitcoin on ethereum because that continues to run up as well although it might be down a little bit from uh previous week it's up in terms of total val value probably but down a little bit in terms of bitcoin yeah it's uh we last week it was 151 thousand nine hundred and it's a hundred and fifty one thousand eight hundred i do think that it's interesting to see that that number go down i never really i always kind of thought that it would be easier for that number to go up but going down by a hundred is kind of inconsequential if you look at that chart it's still just perpetually up and to the right pretty much flat from week to week okay let's talk a little bit about some mainstream coverage of bitcoin it's starting to get attention and this will rapidly increase especially as we exceed all-time high which we assume is just a matter of weeks at this point in time this is the wall street journal uh price of one bitcoin made the front page of the wall street journal they have a nice little price chart here you know it's like they're getting the the mass media fomo engines running right yeah absolutely and if you think about the perspective of somebody who was paying attention to bitcoin back in 2017 they saw a 20 000 price tag and for people that aren't in the bitcoin world that compare that 20 000 price tag to that 10 000 price tag that was just present in bitcoin roughly four to five weeks ago 10 000 looks really just like inconsequential it's like bitcoin's never coming back to life it's not ever coming back to twenty thousand and then all of a sudden there's four or five weeks later it's back at twenty thousand right and so this is this is where people are realize that wow once again bitcoin is not dead and it's past all-time highs so this is when we start accumulating new people who are interested in bitcoin and for those of you who tune in and listen to people like jim crainer kramer on uh cnbc he tweeted this out it is not too late for bitcoin great alternative to gold which i've always believed in oh yes jim crater has always been a huge crypto believer i i think this is an example of of one of those individuals in mass media who is just like obviously sees the trend a little bit before it happened definitely not the bear market but a little bit before it happened he's sort of planting that seed out there but he's somebody that that financial folks listen to from time to time yeah i mean he's very entertaining he's the intersection of finance and entertainment and so like you know just another way for bitcoin to have exposure to eyes that don't usually see bitcoin yeah absolutely and as you said earlier the big story is this week jumping from wow the the the 400s all the way to 620 i believe it has something to that effect and now it's as we're recording this around 580. you know does the the the staking contract have anything to do with that david we're about to talk to vitalik in just a little bit but the big news is we are going to launch eth2 because enough eth was deposited in the eth2 staking contract to make that happen on december 1st does that have anything to do with price you know if if you ask me what is the most bullish scenario to come out of the east to it would have been exactly what happened right we blew the limit out of the water we got there at the earliest possible day which is december 1st and then in addition to that 525 000 minimum that we needed we got 200 000 more ether than what we needed however i don't think it was impactful on the price i don't think the people's trading ether and making the price discovery happen actually are paying attention that much to ethereum 2.0 so maybe there was like a little bit of of price action but not something that you could extrapolate from the from the the price run from 470 to 620 i think that was going to happen regardless and i think that that it was just it was ethers ethers valuable value that valuable that's a fair valuation for ether and and so i don't i actually think that this was not reflective in the price definitely a big moment for the ethereums who've been watching this the entire time though uh defy the d5 numbers total locked value is about flat this week but we're approaching that 15 billion number of uh total value locked it seems astounding to say 15 billion but that's that's what we're looking at pretty crazy here we also have the uh d5 pulse index which is an index of defy tokens that's gone up a little bit this week from 104 to 108 so that's kind of hanging there really the story has been eth's big run over the past week and let's pull up this this tweet from from spencer noon our friend who talks about eight signs that we've entered in each bull market we should go through these super quick david what but what are the eight signs that spencer's pointing out that we've entered a new eth bull market here yeah the first one is the number of daily active addresses uh is this is a pretty safe metric to see the trend for unique people that are using ethereum the trend is up and to the right we're flirting with all-time highs of 500 000 uh daily active addresses uh so that that's that's a really big number um and so that that's up and to the right you want to take number two ryan bank accounts absolutely that's what those are every ether address is a bank account ethereum is also dwarfing everything else in terms of average fees paid this was not the case in 2017. it's distinct it's different at that point in time bitcoin was dominating but ethereum block space is now the mvp the most valuable block space and it's looking pretty good from a productive asset perspective when you think of ether as an internet bond as well why don't you take number three yeah number three the gas being used on a daily basis so 8 billion gas is now being used what that means is that the network is being used at its maximum capacity gas being used on a daily basis or a time unit basis is just a measure of how under load ethereum is the more gas being spent the more transactions and more uh you know complex uh transactions that ethereum is doing is that an all-time high no we've got into the 16 number four we've got uh 16 billion in stable coins issued on ethereum i i don't think we have to go into that in detail it's been a theme on bankless it's been parabolic since the beginning of the year so that is huge all those crypto dollars are on ethereum why don't you take five yeah according to dune analytics we are basically at one million total defy users which is up 10x from the start of this year and we're just getting started david i like to compare these two uh cities now we are a major american metropolis we've gone from like a few city size of you know 100 000 and now we're in the the major metropolis area um definitely huge growth there okay number six i'm trying to load it here okay there's now 14 billion total locked in d5 we already talked about that number seven all of the bitcoin on ethereum there's 150k now we report on that on a weekly basis why don't you take this last one number eight yeah indexes dexes have done over 20 billion dollars in volume over the last 30 days meaning that at the entirety of this entire year we've seen 86 billion in this this last year and 20 billion of that is over the last 30 days uh so indexes are in and they're going to be really hot especially in a bull market where people like to trade and speculate guys that is the market let's talk releases what got released last week can you explain this one to me david i know you've got a fantastic video with andre from wire and yfi about it but what is the tldr dr on dara swap this new project that he's working on yeah if you want to learn more about this check out the bankless youtube i did a quick interview with andre to get down into the details about what this is andre is obsessed with making things capital efficient on ethereum and one thing that he is definitely not doing is staying within the confines of traditional finance tools and instruments and he's trying to take like three or four different instruments and see if he can slap them all together into one single contract and so dara swap is uh a swaps like uniswap it's loans like uh compound and ave it's options like like darabit which doesn't really actually have a d5 correlate at the moment that's something that's lacking in the default world and and um and then also futures which is the same thing as options but just with a time delay on it and so andrew has the thing that he calls dareswap that is just all these things all at once so when that gets uh you know slapped up onto a website with the front end i'm really excited to tinker around with that is this all going in the wiring ecosystem is this all part of wi-fi somebody asked me how to get uh exposure to andre's brilliance around a darus swap how did they get that exposure yeah so there's no token so it's not to my knowledge or maybe there i don't think there needs to be ever and so it's not something that's investible as an application it is something that yfi could tap into and utilize because what andre after andre you know was done working on on wire not that he's done but he's building out like uh hubs uh spokes away from wifey that make urine more useful right and so this is a place that makes wiring more useful why aren't confined healed here last question because i think this is big eta when's that shipping david uh well i'm assuming the contracts are up on mainnet uh when is the actual project up and running no clue okay all right let's go to our friend anthony cesano the daily gray so uh anthony is a repeat guest and visitor what's anthony doing yeah so he's always on the daily way which is the daily newsletter which talks about like the subject of the day and kind of distills and analyzes it for you anthony is like into the source code of ethereum both on a technical level and on a media level and so when he uh analyzes something it's it's almost always the correct take it's always the correct take i've never seen a bad take out of anthony he's doubling down on the daily great ecosystem he's going to do daily video recaps he's going to build tutorials he's just really into the idea of like capturing all the people that come into this space confused and then educating them and so i think that's going to be a really valuable thing for the ethereum community and then the ethereum ecosystem we need more knowledge people we need more people spreading out knowledge and anthony's i'm sure anthony's going to do a great job with that absolutely friend of bank list if you like bank list you're going to like anthony's stuff so connect with the daily guy all right this defy database i'll just i'll just mention it great resource that someone came up with but there are hundreds of projects in here if you're looking for a project just an index of some project you've heard of we don't know the link you we will include a link to the d5 database in the show notes you can click here you can find the project it is astounding david to see the vast number of d5 projects that have just seemingly popped out of nowhere like i can't keep track of them you know like it's impossible for us to keep track of them at this point in time pretty amazing stuff you want to totally glad that that effort is happening before the bull market so yeah right really useful website absolutely all right you want to tell us about slingshot yeah slingshot is the rebrand from dex ag coming out of the concourse open team that's uh scott lewis over at d5 pulse really just big friend of etherium big friend of defy uh and i'm really excited to see uh this slingshot there's a dexa ad for those that haven't used it it's like a dex aggregator uh and it's there like i said they're rebranding to slingshot i'm assuming that there's gonna be some spiffy new features coming out of this release check them out at slingshot dot finance it's a pretty spiffy looking website and it's kind of a ux you or a brand identity that i think is like really cutting edge and i think would be really attractive to all these new people who are trying to come into this uh sci-fi world of defy so nice job scott and chad and everyone at concourse open i love the branding and slingshot guys just raised a whole bunch of money so i think they're putting it into this it's going to be like one inch if you're familiar with that um it will be like that maybe with some enhancements too pretty exciting stuff hey last thing we got to touch on just on the releases side is of course proof of stake is released but the question on everyone's mind is why the heck did it take so long our friend jeff coleman put together a fantastic tweet thread on this but what's the tl dr on this tweet thread david yeah the tldr is that proof of stake is hard and the reason why it's taken so long is because ethereum didn't cut any corners it did it right it did it methodically it didn't rush anything the whole like move fast and break thing ethos of ethereum is totally just wrong uh and so like jeff coleman kind of gives the historical account of just like the process of developing proof of stake ethereum if you are just and the reason why we're talking about this right now is just it's a really good resource to get up to speed with what happened over the last three years in proof of stake so if you just want to know a little bit about the history of ethereum uh jeff coleman summarizes this really really well in this thread i'm involved in other ecosystems too and other chains that have talked about proof of stake for a pretty long time but what jet like the money line here is basically all of these other proof of stake chains are doing something that's more akin to delegated proof of stake right so this is not like delegated proof of stake is not anything new you have a small group of permission validators eth2 is doing something completely different it's launching with already 16 000 validators that's never been done before in the in these numbers so doing proof of stake is easy doing it in a decentralized way which is what ethereum is trying to accomplish very hard that's why it took so long but we're here now right at the very beginning exciting stuff because of the efforts that jeff is talking about we all get to stake at home and that's that's why we get to say on the bank list program it's your patriotic duty to stake you don't have that duty in delegated proof of sake that's not a thing no you can just outsource that duty to someone else all right let's talk news news is always exciting these days let's start with uh blackrock cio so blackrock for people don't know manages eight trillion in assets these manage like all the world's assets there's a few other renaissance technologies we we talked to nick carter about this but the cio something you would have never heard in 2017 that's why this bull run is different you just said bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent can you imagine that in like 2015 or even 2017 this is crazy yeah oh and this is just indicative of bitcoin is just becoming more mature more financialized much more of an accepted asset like people that thought it was rat poison in 2017 are starting to come around to it in 2020 and again like the 2020 was a year that kind of blindsided everyone and so i actually think as a just an ability to be adopted the threshold for adopting bitcoin is just lower like you know it's 2020 like all bets are off yup absolutely all right so something else that's happening we always talk about this is a recurring theme of uh government in crypto coinbase a crypto bank as we call them is suspending all margin trading operation tomorrow this feels like it's to get on the good side of the cftc right like what's your take on this this action they just recently opened margin trading now the bull runs here and they're closing it why else would they be doing this yeah coinbase wants to offend the nation state not at all it does everything crosses across all the t's dots all the eyes so when when the regulators come and say something coinbase follows uh and this is just the burden and of crypto banks of legacy institutions uh and this is not something that you would see on d5 this is the opposite of defy so let it be known that you know margin trading on defy is up and running and margin trading on all crypto banks or or usa crypto banks have been paused right and so if you want to margin trade your bitcoin you've got to come to a defy or go to some offshore exchange absolutely it always is the case that if you present some surface area as a centralized crypto bank does you're going to have to interact with regulators and this is the case by the way i don't think it's all bad that coinbase plus uh regulators are interacting they do a lot of work on the lobby side of things to push the nation state in favor of crypto so that is definitely a benefit and i think brian armstrong and team are doing some good work here here's another maybe outcome of some of that crypto industry pushing in the u.s office of the comptroller of currency just proposed a rule prohibiting large banks from something they've been doing for a very long time through regulators which is basically disfavoring certain industries right so if you are uh say the marijuana industry you can't open a bank account for instance if you're in crypto i've gotten kicked out of um crypto okay like banks i've gotten kicked out of banks from bank of america sent me a dear john letter one time because i had a tra uh a um transfer from coinbase to my bfa account they shut me down they just said uh we don't do anything with crypto sorry see you later and office of comptroller saying sorry you can't do that anymore everyone has an opportunity there should be no disfavored industries what's your take here yeah this is really good i think just for society like if you are in a legal but perhaps um stigmatized industry banks still have to serve you regardless of the stigma and we ran into this at realty where paypal kicked us off the platform uh for i mean they didn't actually say why but like obvious reasons obvious because we're doing stuff in crypto uh and that that's just like that's just bs like no the marijuana industry like you said the crypto industry like the hell the porn industry like all these things are like stigmatized but should be offering banking services so this is actually something that is like nice job nation state like you got it right good job this is coinbase's influence too i mean they are getting people like this i think like this industry they're getting people like this in these positions where they can do things like that okay the long-term the implications of this is that new companies new startups can access banking services which is really important it's really bullish on innovation in the space absolutely the banks are also this is our next uh news item here the banks are also entering each staking apparently so bitcoin swiss is depositing almost a hundred each a hundred k e hundred thousand heath into e 2.0 they've already done that i i believe almost all of it at this point in time what's your what's your take there my take here is this this is just indicative of the gargantuan industry that centralized staking as a service providers will be that is going to be a massive industry there's just the the demand to just charge fees on staking is just going to be so high um so you know competition is good for the consumer it's interesting because it's it's not something you can do with your bitcoin you can't turn it into a an internet bond so this is definitely going to be like a big industry entire industry is based around solely ether the asset we're going to include a link to i think what was uh staking rewards put this out it's a super useful table so you can get a sense as a consumer of what the end destination options are going to be to stake your eath right the top is these custodians and exchanges that's the crypto bank option but that's only like one of you know six different options here you could also do a lending platform we talked to liquid stake about that we are super bullish about staking pools particularly ones like rocket pool that aim to be decentralized also there's validator as a service solutions where you're just paying for infrastructure but you're not giving up your private keys that's a fantastic option as well um there are pre-configured validator nodes hardware we wrote a guide on the best hardware that you can buy like dap node and avato you just buy it in a box and stay from home and then of course you can run your own validator nodes in the cloud so just because the crypto banks want a piece of this doesn't mean you as a consumer aren't going to have the slew of options available which is super exciting because i do think we're going to see a mix of both centralized and decentralized people running in like big data centers and people running from home staking providers is something you don't see in these other proof-of-stake networks yep david you ready to talk about what's on your mind i i've got stuff on my mind looking for the front page of defy look no further than xerion.io xerion is your home base for managing your d5 portfolios xerion offers a central place for you to engage with all of the d5 protocols and assets that you

that uh that this bull market is different right um this bull market is new there are new dynamics there are new things to consider uh one of those new things is is ethereum media also bankless like mainly bank list bank list wasn't here last bull run like we're putting out like three or four videos a day like a two podcasts a week like we have a daily newsletter none of that was here in 2017. and like when i was getting into ethereum learning was hard like that was a hard thing to do and like not not only with bankless but with anthony's daily guay and eth both of those things weren't around in 2017 uh d5 dads yield tv not around in 2017 like ethereum media wasn't around in 2017 and that would have been really useful for learning and so i'm kind of uh really optimistic and just excited to see like what happens when we have a bull market when ethereum media is a thing right and so listeners viewers when people see a a when when you see a question when your friend has a question just know like remember how hard that was for you to get into crypto and do your duty and send them to the source that is helpful like people get people will get lost in the wrong rabbit hole in the wrong youtuber and then that's how they end up investing in xrp do us a favor do your friends a favor like send them to bankless we want them we will we will get them on the right path we will nurture them on their journey and like david said we're not stopping we're just getting started here so more content more participation from the community uh i'm super excited about that too david you're right it was completely bleak there was nothing just a bunch of technical documents back in 2017 to wrap your mind around we're trying to make this stuff easy remember white papers too many white papers right white paper it's terrible a terrible time in history ryan what's on your mind you know what uh one thing that's on my mind is this bull market is just getting started and i don't think retail is even here yet right so most of the the the price increase that we've seen uh has just been i think this is my sense of things bulls doubling down and institutions getting and coinmetrics has a convincing article about this where they're sort of dissecting who holds the bitcoin and um like how folks are entering the space and they seem to indicate to you that retail hasn't even entered the party yet so what happens when retail enters here's another here's another graph from uh larry from the block who is looking at um this indicator of retail mania this is an indicator of weekly follows of twitter accounts and you can see over here in 2017 weekly followers of twitter accounts for binance and coinbase were just off the charts people are like how do i get crypto oh like i'm gonna follow binance i just open an account completely off the charts right now what's happening we're seeing price increase almost all-time high bitcoin massive price increase for eth this week but there's no twitter activity following it's pretty flat for binance and coinbase i don't think retail has entered the game at all i think this has mainly been institutional demand and current bull demand so that all begs the question today what do you think's gonna happen when retail enters the game when when retail's finally here we are seeing signs of retail coming like the first people are starting to download tick tock because tokens are being shielded tick tock right now and i'm getting god i don't even know are there's a tick tock to it there's going to be there's there's there's tick tock like investments right and so ima imagine what happens when you mix together zoomers tick tock and illiquid  coins that pump a hundred x's it sounds it sounds terrible it's good that's what's ahead of us okay should we be on tick tock we are not going to do it we are not going to take them guys bankless nation you tell us if we should be on tick tock and david and i no if you want to run the bankless tick tock let us know yes please all right um oh you know i've got another take too not only one but two takes running okay so this is about on-ramps and it's kind of nick carter in our conversation with him earlier this week sort of it like inspired this but the first i want to talk about two on-ramps the first is institutional on-ramps okay like think of on-ramps the ability to move from liquidity from traditional fiat assets or stocks and those sorts of things that exist in legacy finance to crypto that's like a pipe right and the pipe was like this it was like very small very near 2017. very narrow pipe it was like a you know a 14k modem or something like that right it's like we were we were not we didn't have broadband but now the pipe has like 10x increased right so now we got a big pipe a big pipe we got a floodgate right and this is true in institutions how do we know this like we talked to nick about now we have futures cme volumes at all-time high these are regulated futures we have options we have crypto banks providing custody right so the pipe to institutions is this much bigger it's like no wonder institutions like the cio of of blackrock are becoming bullish because last cycle they didn't want to be bullish on crypto because they couldn't buy any of it right like these asset managers are smart they're not gonna start shilling an asset until they actually have a position in that asset well now they can get a position that's why you're hearing paul tourer jones talk about it not talk smack about it because he's owned some right they're all bag holders just like us let's be honest okay so that's the first pipe that's gotten bigger you know the second pipe that's gotten bigger david is is the pipe to retail which hasn't even opened up yet so here's what i see happening is fintech is going to totally betray the banks okay and they're gonna start building on crypto rails right if you take a look at these are the top five apps right now um in fine in the finance category i think this is like um itunes or something right i'm gonna read this that's cash app number one paypal app number two venmo app number three robin hood number four coinbase number five guess what they have in common david hoffman they are all if not now then later they are all onboarding ramps for crypto all of them every single one so the only one that's not right now is venomo and that's coming in q1 2021 all right so what happened here these are all fintech apps fintech has spent the last 10 years completely optimizing user interface because like you go into your wells fargo account online it sucks it's a terrible user interface but you go into something like venmo hey they have an app it's super easy for friends robin hood like it's an easy place to trade it's very millennial friendly the ux is fantastic fintech does that really well guess what they've built on crypto banks so far on that or excuse me they've built on traditional banks so far on that infrastructure but what's happening they're slowly bifurcating they're starting to enable pathways and bridges to crypto well what happens when they completely abandon the traditional bank legacy infrastructure and they go completely into into crypto i don't think the banks are ready for that but that's gonna be the the team up of fintech plus crypto is going to eat the world fintech ux on top backed by crypto backend database money infrastructure d5 protocols protocol sync thesis yeah you know this image just bleeds protocol sync thesis because after number five coinbase there's number six zell number seven chase and number eight capital one like huge losers to all the companies that integrated crypto like you know no one no one wants your stupid banking app give me the app that lets me buy crypto totally it's inevitable they're just falling into the trap so it's playing out like uh just as you know we might we might predict that's gonna take time that's not but like again back to that bandwidth the pipeline so we saw the institutional pipeline 10x well the retail pipeline has has 10x and we're not even seeing it active yet but i think we will sometime in this full cycle that's exactly right and nick carter on our video with him on the bankless youtube which everyone should go watch he talks about all these different pipes that are built and the important thing is is the the title of this piece was called nine bitcoin metrics that are at all times highs not only are the pipes built but they're just being used at maximum capacity at the same time so like it's not there's not there's just that the option is available the options available and being used well i think they're being used like they're being used at more capacity than they've ever been used but their capacity for even more is like increased right i think cme can do another 5x another 10x at some point i'm sure of it i'm sure of it what are you most excited about let's spend the last few minutes here my friend keep an on theme i am most excited about how unique that this bull market is going to be for ethereum specifically we've already talked about how like you know ethereum media hasn't seen a bull market like that's that's cool so that's going to be new but you know what else hasn't seen a bull market d5 d5 hasn't seen a bull market like maker dow his contracts got deployed in ethereum in december of 2017 which was the peak bull market and only like a hundred people started using maker dow uniswop didn't come around until 2018 or 19. uh compound didn't come around until 2018 ave wasn't a thing until 2019 like the the protocols that have all of the money in them that are responsible for that 14 billion locked in defy none of them have seen a bull market the the number of 14 billion dollars in defy that number hasn't seen a bull market right we haven't seen a bull market with applications on ethereum that collect capital right last bull market capital came in bought some icos tried to make some money then they left in this bull market like we have sinks we have we have uh basins for value to go to ethereum and then collect at the bottom of these basins and those basins are like you know swap like maker dow things that attract capital and then and then there's reasons to stay there's reasons to settle on ethereum right and so they're just gonna get lured into the ecosystem and then they're gonna stay there and then they're gonna become bankless and that's just that's what i see ahead of us and that's what gets me real riled up it's all been entrapped this whole time you know what tyler winklevoss tweeted right before we're recording here yeah yeah he tweeted yeah we're gonna go for it yeah i'm gonna read this quote this ethereum youth bull run is different you know i gotta notice like tyler winklevoss one of the winklevoss twins of course uh he got a bit more bullish after am i imagining things or did he get more bullish after our show with him in june of this year we talked about defy and eth i don't know if this is a little bit like i don't want to take credit for this tweet we shouldn't take credit for his tweet but let's also take credit for this tweet we're taking credit for it because that's exactly what we were hammering on in this week's state of the nation so i'm pretty sure tyler wrinklevoss watched the uh the ethereum side of the bullish part of the state of the nation well we know he's the listener tyler if you are listening right now nice tweet my friend keep him coming keep him coming very exciting times all right ryan what are you excited about you know i'm excited about i think this goes back to what you were saying is uh really the community coming together people forget crypto for all the the self-sovereignty that we talk about all of that's true but crypto's not a single-player game like we need a whole community to come around this almost everything that we do in crypto is is social from agreeing to consensus on what money that we use to um like auditing defy contract protocols you know what we saw in the last week is the crypto community coming together to really launch eth2 right part of the the social layer the investors kind of the the meme layer the media layer that you were talking about but also the the engineers and the developers and the brilliant people who actually uh built this stuff and spent the last five years uh thinking through a decentralized way to do proof of stake so this is like the community coming together and you know what because it's thanksgiving david i'm i'm like thankful for that like that's the one thing about crypto that i am most thankful for i'm i'm thankful also for people in the community who helped me along the journey so today six years ago today is when i first like had heard about bitcoin i'd heard about crypto but this is when i first jumped down the rabbit hole i had some extra time like holidays right like you're hanging with your family but like you're you know pursuing your hobbies and i i read stuff from andreas i watched his talks i watched some documentaries um later on i started getting to chris breninski i mean these are folks who left a breadcrumb trail for me and um i just wanted like thanks like thanks for doing that guys like thanks andreas thanks chris berninski a close personal friend of mine jeff he was running miners in his basement he told me about this weird crypto thing and those people set me off on this journey and i'm thankful for that i'm thankful for this community and i'm thankful for that art who are you thankful for do you have anybody that you're like really inspired you to start yeah i guess i have to give a tip of my hat to um carl floresh who he didn't he didn't um he was somebody i discovered after discovering crypto i i kind of discovered crypto on my own but one of the first people i discovered that was truly helpful for me was carl florsch and his cryptoeconomics.study website that's when i when i was like battling with between like do i go off to physical therapy school and or do i like figure out how to get a job in ethereum uh it was it was just the ethos and energy and vibes that carl flourish exuded that i that i thought he was just representative of ethereum at large and so um i have actually haven't spoken to him about this but he's like one of my big inspirations for like you know ethereum as a culture i resonate with and ethereum as a technology i also resonate with and i see that represented by carl uh so carl thanks we gotta get carl on the show talk about optimism that's what he's working on right now and he is an optimistic fellow that is for sure lots of energy all right david uh we we've taken a little bit of time over but i think that is it oh last thing i'm excited about is black friday deals maybe we'll see a few crypto but we've got the ledger deal going on right now 40 off a ledger and i like that shirt you're wearing david what's up that feels like it's going to black friday deal too tell us what is that the zero shirt the the sale period whatever we're calling the sale period wraps up the day after thanksgiving so for those who don't know what we're talking about there's a balancer pool that is a weighted between die and this token called bap zero bankless apparel season zero you purchase the token you burn the token you get a sick t-shirt the one i'm wearing right now uh and the cool thing about this balancer pool was that over a one month long period the weights changed and so it started heavyweight bap token lightweight die and then it flipped and that's kind of like a rever reverse dutch auction so price goes down over time it goes up when people sell up when people buy down when people sell like uniswap and a day after tomorrow day after thanksgiving is the last day prices change and so it turns into a fixed 90 10 unit swap type pool and so if you are interested in buying baths uh know that the the prices stop changing the day after thanksgiving and they've never been cheaper i don't know 393 right now they've been like okay so they went up okay i saw them drop below 200 but you got to keep monitoring that guys um all right that that's it everyone happy thanksgiving enjoy the time with your family if you guys are are doing that and of course if they ask about crypto you know what to say you know where to send them wait whoa whoa whoa you listener you are bringing up crypto you are bringing it up that is your duty that is the action item that we are leaving you with bring up ethereum bring up the cryptoculture uh people people need to be informed yeah it's a revolutionary at least we're uh you know your t-shirt or something bankless team all right get them to ask you know make it subtle whatever you whatever your style is guys thanks so much for joining us for the weekly roll up uh this has been a blast wrists and disclaimers none of this is financial advice defy bitcoin they're all super risky but we are glad you're with us this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us
