foreign [Music] explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless we have CZ on the podcast today CZ of course is the CEO and founder of the world's largest crypto exchange very influential in the crypto industry today and this episode is mostly a lot of questions we let CZ speak we ask him things like how can we tell what's fun and what's real about binance number two what happened with FTX did the events of 2023 change binance how did it change crypto overall number three we ask about the mood in crypto right now what's different about today's bear Market versus previous bear markets he's been in will we actually get another cycle is there a future bull market on the horizon and finally we end with questions from the community questions from people like Justin Drake djen Spartan many others and we ask those directly to CZ David why is this episode significant to you it's not often that we are able to talk to CZ um the binance world the binance ecosystem it kind of seems like a black box it seems like it's got many different parts especially to us in the west who uh we are just not binance's customer base like what's going on over there it's always it's always a question as to like what's up with Finance what's up with CZ uh and so this seems to be our semi-fregular check-in with CZ we had him on about a year ago last July 2022 right in between uh ethereal's Capital liquidation and before FTX liquidation so kind of before all of this [ __ ] hit the fan uh and now uh we are in a much different part of the crypto world of crypto Market cycle and so what's Finance up to what's easy up to is always an interesting question no matter where we are in the world uh and today we get another snapshot in time is to answer that question yeah I think it's it's hard to overstate the importance of Finance in the ecosystem and even if you don't believe that because you don't use B Finance or or whatever else in many countries binance is crypto to them and it's it's kind of their first entry Port so we really need to know what's what's going on uh in his mind and I think this is going to be an interesting debrief for you and I and of course the debrief guys is the episode after the episode I know you have some thoughts I have some thoughts too and I I should let people know a lot of people didn't want us to have CZ on the podcast they they they thought um that he shouldn't we shouldn't even have this conversation that that we shouldn't host them so I think this episode is is controversial and uh I want to talk to you about that during the debrief what were your actual Impressions our strategy is that controversy Justified I think is another big question I'd like to unpack I think going to this episode we really just let him talk and asked a whole bunch of questions because um look man I don't know who's the Arbiter of what's true in this particular case it's just kind of like well we'll see right let's let the Lindy effect anyway I want to talk

and founder of binance which is an organization so large I I feel like it's not quite right to call it a centralized exchange I think it's much more than that the last time we had CZ on was uh June no actually July of 2022 that was almost a year ago my how things changed since then it was a whole different world FDX was still in exchange back then uh I guess Bitcoin was was going down because this was post three hours capital and Tara but we were in a whole different stage of the market cycle so we brought CZ on to talk about 2023 where we are today CZ welcome back to bankless how you doing well yep I'm doing all right thanks for having me yeah it's great to have you um I uh I'm hearkening back to a tweet that you put out that that hit me in January or early January 2023 and you said I want to try to keep 2023 simple spend more time on less things here are the do's and the don'ts number one education number two compliance number three product and service I imagine those are the dues and the don't number four ignore flood fake news attacks Etc in the future would appreciate if you can link to this post when I tweet four I want to ask you CZ how how's it going all right have you been able to keep 2023 simple actually no no um keeps coming but now we have got like every day I could have tweaked four uh every day um but then luckily now I don't even have to tweet for it if you look at the if you look at the news comments um on their Twitter comments everyone else is tweeting for so I think the article that post worked out quite well but it hasn't gone to what I hope that we don't really need to tweet for just focus on the top three so for me I'm trying really really hard to just focus on product Building Products education compliance Etc but you know the [ __ ] keeps coming but after a certain point the flood loses its marginal impact right so no after a media writes 40 art negative articles about you the 41st is not gonna have much more um this so the the marginal impact is lost and we don't respond to them anymore so um yeah so I think the mentality is still there you have the reality is not as good as I would have hoped in terms of the number [ __ ] but we keep building yeah yeah the four meme is a master class in how to uh incept a meme into the world of crypto Twitter uh it is now thoroughly inside of crypto culture there's like a handful of things like this like binance that seem to just be flood magnets like tether also comes to mind just absolute fud magnet like why do you think what about binance attracts so much fun uh yeah so what first of all number on the floor I didn't think it was going to be a meme and then people turn into meme which is fantastic and then we kind of filled up on it a bit I've posted a few photos so I think a lot of the fun in the industry just targets the size right tether is Big um it's probably one it's probably the biggest company in crypto now um in terms of like value locked in the platform the revenue Etc um buying is actually if we just look at the centralized exchange we we're probably smaller um so but uh but we're we're relatively big um tether is less public um their CEOs don't are not in the community and we are public right so we we get on podcasts uh we we engage we entrenching the community we are a more TC platform we have made like we today we have about 140 million retail users and they're all over the world so we feel like we have to engage um and I think I think it's mainly just share size and well there's a few things size I think is probably the biggest one that you know people just like to talk up if you write a negative article about a smaller exchange nobody cares you don't get clicks but if whatever article you put binance name on the in the title and hopefully some something negative people click more when it's positive you say look bonus did this thing that was great nobody cares right so like so to sell news uh has to be negative and also the crypto right so anything that's crypto um they want to associate a negative spin on it and the third thing is um unfortunately like I look like I'm Chinese ethnicity right so one of my friends in the U.S he told me that no in the U.S they they care about three things right now inflation crypto and China and China so just because you look just because I look Chinese I may you know just draw that much more attention on it so yeah it is what it is but um we've been trying really hard to keep our heads down and just just move forward yeah here's the thing CeCe I I would really love your input on um in general is because I think we're at this time in crypto and it's not just a crypto problem okay this is this is a a problem that we have on the internet today all modern societies are facing this in that it's very difficult to know what's fun and what's true like we have no truth finding mechanism and just to like because I want you to weigh on on this the state of the crypto Market it it feels like to me we almost have to in order to understand it now we have to go back to 2022. back to um just after the last time we talked and what happened to FDX right and like so uh Sam Bank been freed was calling a lot of things FUD at the time that turned out to be very very true and so crypto is like we're reeling from that and we don't trust anybody anymore I mean there was a big blow up last week with Ledger right and like I understand there were issues there were some problems with Ledger um maybe maybe you think it's like uh crypto went too far with it but that that has been a beloved brand of crypto that has protected people's private keys for a long time and now I feel like it's it's somewhat tarnished at least the conversation is tarnished and so I guess what I'm saying is it feels like crypto is not trusting anybody but maybe with good reason I mean we've been lied to take us back to 2022 and um in your own words I think people want to hear it from you CZ what happened with FDX then we'll talk about fud how we can like determine truth from flood but take us back to 2022 what what do you think happened in that whole story so to be very Frank I don't know what happened in inside FTX right so we we our business have uh are competitive in nature so I try not to pry too much in inside there um so from what I know is basically from what basically what everybody else knows is that they took customer funds and used that as uh to trade trying to make money and they actually did a poor job at that and then they lost money and then to the point where they lost all the customers money pretty much so that's basically it and through through it throughout that whole time he was lying about it right he didn't tell the customers that he was doing this Etc so there was so it's serious um and um the situation was made worse by being how public he was how much how much time he spent in Washington DC right and how much time he spent talking to Senators he sponsor he sponsored a third of the senators in congress in the U.S right and then um so and then he was going to be the biggest donor for Biden campaign next year um so now he's no longer um so all of that actually backfires when people discovered this guy's a fraud right so before you know everyone's loving this child he's a young entrepreneur um he's no he's well educated he's white he's American so he's got that everything every box ticked but then now he's defined his fraud and they their trust is betrayed they be they turn around they come much harder on crypto so they missed the bad guy and now they're punishing all the remaining good guys and the bad guys together in crypto they just slot they just they're just slaughtering everybody in crypto right so um so uh it's it's bad um so and I think with the so that's that's bad that's that's just pure fraud scam like that's made of right um in crypto um Ledger was a different thing Ledger no one has lost money on Ledger yet right so they didn't take customers money away it was just they repositioned they repositioned their product which violates their fundamental principles of people using that product we use Ledger because we want we we were told that this is a device that keeps your private key on the device it never leaves the device now suddenly there's a way to for you to leave the device I think even just having the API available breaks the trust right so now like it just increases a hacker attack surface um that itself is not fraud it's just representation repositioning the product in a very abrupt way um I don't think that's all about that starts through this very well so as you said um we need to as an industry we shouldn't trust with the the industry is supposed to be a trustless industry so we shouldn't blindly trust people and we should we should try we should learn to risk control and we should we should deal with that ledger you know um if there's plenty of other Hardware Wallets on um on on the market people can switch if they I do believe many people will switch uh because of the fundamental principles are not different for Ledger if people wanted to use an online uh backed up wallet then they would use an online backed up wallet you don't need a hardware anymore so I think they mixed up that positioning um a bit but overall though the industry is early in early in in such early Industries there's always fraud there's always bad players there's always failures um and over time the industry will work will sort of accumulate around a few large successful players but then that's this that's centralization today I think minus is too large finance.com the centralized exchange is too large so I actually want to invest more in D5 projects and make them grow I think the future is D5 and they're more there are they will be more decentralized but at the same time even if you look at D5 units what takes 70 of trading volume in D5 right so um so their natural Network effects there but we still want to diversify and so as an industry we we which is better to have multiple players um and uh at roughly equal sizes more competition more Geographic uh distribution so all of those will be will be better and the more choices users have um the more competition they are the stronger players will emerge eventually so I think that's got to happen well it is happening but in the process it's never smooth there's always it's always going to be issues speaking back to the um the kind of the Zeitgeist that was around crypto in 2022 uh the bear Market didn't really come fully uh embedded into the into the market until FTX came and it was really FTX was like this climax this culmination of a much smaller series of liquidations right first we had Tara Luna and then that was like a for a 40 billion dollars so nothing to scoff at but then uh but people were worried about Tara Luna for a long time prior to that and so it wasn't totally off the table before Tara Luna collapsed and then uh ethereal's Capital was liquidated and that was a big surprise and shock to everyone and much bigger and like they were super systemic right uh and then fast forward you have FTX go under and no one saw that coming and we saw these dominoes get bigger and bigger and bigger and then it then it came to Genesis and and grayscale and in dcg and that contagion spread into uh into Gemini and so I think like why perhaps there's so much fun going around is people saw this this crescendoing dominoes getting bigger and bigger and bigger which puts uh binance in the conversation as in like we didn't know we didn't see three years Capital coming we didn't see FTX coming wow now it's all the way at dcg uh anything is on the table look it even got to the uh to the crypto banks in in the tradify world in America and so I think this like helps us understand why there's so much fun is like oh anything could be on the table and one of the worries that I think people have is like it's actually kind of hard to see inside of the black box of binance like we we could in this agenda like we could have added like the last three bits of fun that have come out about binance right like co-mingling of funds regulatory fund like we don't know which one which one to talk about and all of them is like addressing all of them is kind of pointless but it's it is that that black box nature of binance and so I'm wondering if you could like reflect on what lessons have you as the leader of binance learned in this last year or so understanding that like there is this very like rock and a hard place that all of this crypto industry is in like what strategies uh have developed as a result of just all everything that we've learned in the last year uh yeah I think there's quite a few different things there so I think well if you look at the fundamental principles right if we use the centralized platform like tether like binance um they we want to be as transparent as possible but there are limits so in the last year we've done proof of reserves uh we and we actually did a new mechanism of proof of reserves using zcast Knox um it was actually suggested by vitalik and we worked with their team to do that there are limitations to purchase a proof of reserves uh the limitations to everything so and um as a private company we also need to make sure our privacy is protected right so if we publish all of our wallet addresses that we use um and you will be you'll be very clear which vendors we use and those vendors maybe maybe attacked by hackers um our SMS providers which has been attacked by hackers before our email providers which has been attacked by hackers before so they are privacy security and other consider and competitive considerations we we we're not a public company we may not want to open our books so that our competitor knows exactly how much we spend on HR exactly how much we spend on security how much we spend on marketing and then so there are considerations there so business businesses are not complete transparent boxes right so they so they will and tether right so which bank do they use and you know four four five years ago every time they they release which banks they use that bank gets shut down right so um they are they are real operational considerations um I'm not saying that I do think that Tesla is too much of a black box as a you know as an outsider so um there are those considerations and then there are this flood that that comes in and then there's what do the users believe right how do we find how do we find truth so fundamentally it's risk management um if you if you're using a new exchange platform um don't put oil money on one platform um you know and don't put oil money in one D5 project um so that's risk management don't put oil money on in one wallet um so this diversification and that's learning about different the projects you interact with learning about the platforms you use learn about The Ledger Technologies understanding those Concepts um education I think is the best uh is the best is the best thing and then um they are fraud which are very hard to differentiate you know FTX we didn't see that coming three uh Luna we could have seen that come in to be honest the design was flawed um you can't mean Luna to uh to to try to push back the USD that doesn't work minking doesn't increase value seems so obvious now seems obvious now but you know some people actually did point that out but nobody listed one very few guys listened um so now we're learning that lesson um three arrows was was a mismanagement of funds they lost a bit of money on Luna and then they went a bit crazy and or they went very aggressive they lost more money over time and then three arrows probably brought down Voyager and Genesis um because those were they moved a lot of money to them it was a very convoluted web of loan loans borrowing going on I actually don't know the full story I've seen bits and pieces of it and then you know there was Genesis and then even Gemini is somehow involving there and then FTX happened which really exaggerated all of those things uh all of those things so the industry does have systematic risk right so um in this last four years the cycle this defy cycle there's a lot of boring there's a lot of loans there's a lot of high yield apy um all of those are high risk so if you want High returns you're gonna deal with high risk so so and also we people should learn to judge businesses for what they are right so they are businesses that are very simple that make money tether is one of them and they hold a large amount of reserves and they just make money on interest rate that's billions of dollars um Finance we run a slightly more heavier business we but we just our business model is very simple people trade we charge commissions people can people can get a feel how many users we have uh just by the amount of fun that we get just by the amount of news articles that cover us Etc so people can get a sense and we run up we run a simple profitable business model and we don't need to do that and we also don't have loans right we even put out our tweet saying whoever whoever can can prove that we actually have any meaningful amount of loans from anybody can claim a fifteen thousand dollars no one came forward it was actually posted by by a friend of mine uh the founder of beef Fury uh George um and no he's a friend of mine but he's he's very independent from us we don't have any business related so um you know um we have we have done our part to be transparent but the businesses have limitations on how transparent we need can or or will be um there is always a level of risk with any product you use with any platform you use uh with any contract uh even using a bank right we've seen Banks fail um and and actually we now know many of them fail um so um yeah so I think it's really the fundamental risk management and reability to research and not get simple mining just read one article and believe everything in that article both good and bad um all of those things needs to come into play but um we don't teach our kids in school about this right so we don't like those two students are young young kids are taught in school to believe what they read and that is not good we need to teach more about critical thinking uh challenging challenging everything so we need to we need to drill those skills into young Generations but I think you know us the technology are providing more info Nation more access to decentralization I think all of those things are coming are coming together yeah I think that's a really good thought and I hope listeners take away from this that um I mean risk management is the is the key thing you have to do in crypto and if there's one thing crypto has taught me through everything all the Cycles is is the importance of risk management and that's a balance right so you you know you could go as far on one side of the spectrum as don't trust anybody right um and I don't think that's right I mean but you should be on the side of the Spectrum which is which is you don't trust anybody fully and I think that's like the best place to be and uh it's certainly a Learning lesson for many in the 2021 to 2022 cycle we have a lot of trust I think in this industry uh to actually bring back and repair so I'm glad to hear you talk about proof of reserves and defy and some added transparency um and I also recognize that there are issues for centralized exchange even in just getting bank accounts I mean like bankless has been kicked out of bank accounts how ironic is that right it's just like it's it's um it's a it's a challenge all around one thing I would Point people to is that this has kind of been most of my Benchmark for things is is Lindy effect how long has The Entity or the project been operating without like fail I think that's important you'll you'll notice the block files of the world and the Celsius of the world and the ftxs of the world well they sort of formed in like the 2018 time period a very small Lindy effect when you compare them to the kind of the Krakens and the in the in in the coin bases and maybe even the finances who've been through a few Cycles without uh taking all the funds but let's leave 2022 in the past shall we CZ let's talk about 2023 right now what is up with crypto right now like what is the what is the mood that you're feeling it's a mixed mood right now it's an interesting mood right now I think so um from my experience uh from I joined like I got into crypto from 2013 right so that was one bull market um that year um so it went from 100 to a thousand dollars and then you know there's a one year of drop in 2014 and then 2015 we started to recover and so it's one year sharp drop and the one year recovery and then while two years of all-time highs so that's 2016 2017 2017 21 000 um That Was Then everyone's rushing at the 2013 was like a Bitcoin cycle everyone's like well what was this new thing about Bitcoin 2007 he was an Ico year so ethereum erc20 tokens anyone can issue a token a white paper you know a fundraising um and then so and then you know 2018 happened crash and then 2019 was paying for recovery and then um 2020 201 again the sort of all-time high years again and you know that was D5 nfts gamify metaverse all of this stuff and all of this stuff are still quite new but a lot of money put in and then 2022 you know um there's three arrows there's Luna uh there's FTX so it was Crusher so I think now even even if we look at the price chart we're kind of recovering so now it's kind of a recovering mood and people are still very cautious it's not like fomo yet but now there's like meme coins which I don't really afford which I don't really fully understand um but that's also at this stage is unclear in wow two years what's the next drivers that would cause explosive growth right um uh is that is it I don't think I think I think it might be something new right I think nfts D5 they'll continue to grow but those those were inventions of the last cycle um they will continue to grow um and they will be they may actually be more realistic realistic use cases Etc but from the the from the from the angle what's going to drive the next one is I think the the mood is everyone's looking for that right now we don't we're not sure and this is why and when we're not sure this I think this is probably why a lot of people part into meme coin and they couldn't figure out what exactly is the next one meme coin sounds fun and but it shows that they are funds uh that are ready to be deployed right so people people want to buy stuff and they look at meme points they Pile in so that's my read um uh so if we are at uh I believe we're at an interesting inflection point um again I could be I could be very wrong um hopefully we are at a we're past the bottom of the of the bear market and hopefully we are in the start of a bull market but again this is not Financial advice this is just a feel a mood thing um but you can I could very well be wrong yeah one thing that we've discussed on Bank list is that crypto markets tend to go in Cycles but is that always going to be true is it so definitive definitively true that we get another cycle absolutely not right so there's nothing says we have to get another cycle um history uh the history pattern is quite clear if you look at it but you know all ones were white until you saw a black one so um and so history doesn't predict the future and um um we can't we can't just say because previously there was fairly distinct four-year Cycles that's that's gonna be a new one so I think we got to take uh take that into into consideration um maybe it might not and so the way I usually uh at what the way I would position businesses are we should be prepared for a bull run so we just gotta make sure like our systems can handle another 10 20 30 x volume um but we should also be prepared financially for bear for for another 90 crash right so we gotta have the we gotta have the stamina to last so that's how that's how we would run a business that's how binance is structured today um so we can we can survive on both sides for people um I would usually recommend similar I similar situations and first um so um yeah I mean uh everybody is in a different situation so it's very hard to give advice to individuals by business for that's how that's how I usually structure things there's this the this famous quote from that one Brazilian race car driver um you can't overtake 15 cars on in sunny weather but you can when it's raining um the idea is that in a bear Market it's easier to progress you can you can pass people now in binance is already like number one in in global volume and so there's not really anyone left to pass but there's a lot left to grow the pie in the world of bear market and crypto and so I'm wondering what is what's Finance the strategy in the bear Market to pass 15 cars during rainy weather um actually in in the bear Market um I suppose that driver said if you can just drive normally if you're just not scared and like now going to the ditch um then that's like so in Bear Market is basically about survival right so about stability uh survivals uh Etc um so in in a rainy day you don't you don't drive as fast as as you can and you you want you want to you want to you want to make sure that you stay on the road so I think that's basically our strategy it wasn't it wasn't that it wasn't that you know fancy um uh when other when others were failing we just have steady we said secure there was a massive um uh uh Bank Run on us people withdraw like 14 billion dollars within a week no there was basically no issues uh other than one Bank didn't open for like six hours um that was a bank issue and then crypto was there was Zero issues we actually told our team make sure there's zero issues right so um yeah so like so we had so uh it was that was the best proof that you know every coin is about back to module one so we were tested so this back still it comes back to the to the Lindy effect right so the more you tested the the the the more the more secure it could be and um uh doing bear markets there are more consolidations um and even we're still seeing that today right if you look at the Canadian crypto Market there's more consolidations for for the players just merged and for the local exchanges just merged um so uh and uh we didn't really intend to overtake 15 cars we just said look let's let's find a path that we can we can drive and stay on the road um that's all we did really yeah learning about crypto is hard until

opportunities ahead but we haven't quite painted that vision for the world you talked about the big thing in 2021 and 2022 and it was very clearly nfts and defy and then you were talking CZ about not knowing what the next big thing would be you know obviously defy and nft would continue they very likely have another large adoption cycle is there something more than that like we don't know what in your mind are what is the biggest opportunity for crypto how do we begin to recast a vision for the world of what this this industry what this technology can do in 2023 yeah so um I think the question should be changed uh it should be not singular but multiple so um the ques if we talk about internet right we wouldn't say what's the next big thing that would drive internet adoption there's so many different things there's video conferencing there's you know social media there's um Google as an information um hive mind there's a lot of different things going on um so in the early days you may say like what's the next thing I think for crypto blockchain is beyond one single thing now so 2017 there was icos right that was erc20 tokens basically um and 2020 even 2021 there's multiple things going on the next one may be multiple things it's no longer a single thing that drives adoption I think because the industry is bigger there's more players so there's different sectors we should be looking at what's the next big nft thing and what's the next next big D5 thing what's the next big new things maybe social media for crypto has not been invented yet right so uh and there's some old use cases that have not taken off but our slow are starting to a payment right payments was one of the most obvious use case but there wasn't stable coins there wasn't lightning Network there wasn't a real-time fast payments uh and now the faster blockchains there's been you know there's there's been many new developments and then we also have technologies that allow users to pay in crypto and the merchants except just Fiat uh and it's the transaction the transaction happens in real time like balance pay bonus card a few other credit card Solutions um on in the market so and we're seeing uh um the global economy in turmoil so there's a lot of uncertainty in traditional Financial Industries uh in the in the global economy uh we're seeing like uh Africa you know now the the the the mobile phone smart the smartphone penetration is getting there uh and now they're latching they don't have Banks um only lastly less than 11 of people in Africa have Banks and they're just latching on directly onto blockchain so all of those things can be potentials um I don't know which one I think we'll see multiple um I will I guess you call them unicorns or however you call them multiple successful uh new startups new Concepts and plus old ones um together that will shape the industry so I think we'll see a lot more successes CZ I feel like the the crypto industry though coming out of 2021 and 2022 has this reputation fair or not of being just a whole bunch of meme coins and and fraudsters and scammers right let's say you were invited to speak to the United Nations the entire world all of all of the nations of the world and they said CZ give us the case for crypto we've heard all of the fun about crypto I've heard all of the bad things um tell us why crypto is actually good for the world what would you say to uh yeah a group like that make the case for crypto yeah so actually I did do a talk in um United Nations in Geneva I think four three four 2018 um maybe 2019. um so I did do a talk but that was more about how to use blockchain to enable um a transparent charity philanthropy efforts um but I think today if I was gonna do another talk I would say Financial inclusion Financial access um if if that was if you were talking if the audience is United Nations there are many nations many many people uh without uh Financial access um people in less developed countries take them days to pay a bill um they don't they don't they don't have access to loans they don't have access to uh many many of the financial tools that we we in developers are quite used to so that would be the message I will stress and blockchain is that right technology um there was this uh fund that I just in that just gives loans to women that need loans to run their businesses in Africa um they have the lowest fault rate of any loan business on the planet so this is a real woman that want to do business but they have no access to financial to financial tools um and they run very simple businesses that do make money and they're able to return the loans in a period of time and this really helps their lives so I actually the name of the of the fund is just on the tip of my town but I can't recall it so those are these are great things and they can do this with blockchain they can do this with much bigger scale um using the new technologies so all of this can be done so if I was doing a talk like that I probably research this a bit more financial inclusion and just stress use cases in those areas there's always been a theme in crypto of the exchange Wars um this was a big theme I remember in 2017 because there were so many more exchanges than there are now and so the exchange Wars was a very big topic of conversation um there's always will be exchange Wars I'm assuming um but the players have Consolidated uh and uh it's uh it makes sense for the leading exchange with the most volume to just focus on staying on the road during uh during the times of a rainy season in the crypto world but I know that your competitors both uh Kraken and coinbase who I think are number two and three in terms of volume are probably looking about how do they how can they pass 15 cars uh while it's raining um coinbase is doing coinbase International they're also are spinning up um their own Layer Two which starts to be looking like a BNB chain but for coinbase uh Kraken uh aligned with the metaphor of race cars is literally sponsoring F1 which is an international uh an international sport uh and so like they are trying to also fill the vacuum that FTX has left in the international Arena and I'm wondering just like your highest level thoughts about the new international fight in the in the exchange Wars the crypto Wars uh what was your what's your take here yeah so um I think the industries evolved from pure competition into actually I think there's a lot of collaboration going on um maybe not directly um I'll explain it um okay so historically even today there's always been more exchanges than projects so every day coin market cap gets 200 applications for exchange listings on their on their website the coin microcat lists all the exchanges and they are the highest volume website and they drive they they send their volume to exchanges so every day there's more than 200 exchanges trying to register on coin market cap and there's less way less than that new projects trying to get listed on coin market cap um so just that's stats and this has been for the last however many years you can go you can go back five ten years so there's always people wanting to do exchanges and I think that's partially because exchange is a very transparent business you can calculate the revenues you can estimate the looking the trading volume you can estimate the revenues they say wow look at the biggest exchange and they make a lot of money and people want to do it and people think it's a very simple business but exchanges are so very difficult businesses to do uh security um customer support regulatory uh stuff it's just there's so many different aspects um and uh so so that so uh just because the business is more transparent people want to do it and um but if you look at traditional business Google works 100 times more money than we do um because they're the largest uh in the world um and um there was a lot of competition there's always a lot of competition between exchanges um getting new getting users on listing coins quickly providing more products Etc I think buyers have done a really good job making our products uh Diversified and have a very complete Suite of products and also the global coverage to the point where our products are over complex um it's scary for a new user to like you know having so many numbers on the screen um but then more recently um in the bear Market that's consolidation and then there's also regulatory pressure challenges uh environment Etc so uh coinbase uh Kraken they've been in the U.S for a long time and you know they they deal with the U.S regulatory issues a lot more than we do um binance does have a U.S arm but you know it's much newer um and it's less vocal uh and so those guys are handled those guys are dealing with the U.S regulatory environments whereas we deal with the rest of the world uh and now I believe coinbase Kraken they're kind of moving more International is to say look I I couldn't comment on their motives um but you know it's good to have more competition in in this environment it's better to have multiple exchanges uh or or working with regulars or working with Regulators together if it's just one exchange dealing with regulators and The Regulators will think well you're just one business whatever they will they will question whatever we say the motives Etc but it's multiple exchanges say we gotta regulate this industry way here the pros and cons sometimes they match sometimes they don't and then The Regulators get more and more information from from the industry um those are there are other exchanges that that operating very they're also many exchanges are operating very different ways um the large exchanges can survive on commission fees and we actually survive pretty well and the smaller exchanges they don't have the liquidity um they would they will tend to survive on other things like you know listing fees um and they'll list every coin on Under the Sun they'll try to negotiate um they uh some exchanges may may involve in much crazy behavior instead of trading for profits on a principal trading um they trade for for profits on their own um they could be running Futures platforms that trade against their users and the platform wouldn't know where the liquidation points are um there are smaller Futures platforms that were rumored to have to do that so um and they're also Geographic differences they are there are exchanges that are based out of China and they service much more wider user base um than what the US exchanges are able to serve they also exchanges that based on specifically targeting Russia for example right so all of those things um uh all of those things happen um and it's actually good to have a diversified and distributed uh uh many different players many different exchanges in the ecosystem um so I think all of those things are great and many of them are pioneering new things um you know DFI wallets um other things so I think that's all of those things are great so having more players is good um but there's also Network effects in the industry people gravitate towards what other people trust sometimes too right so the and liquidity gets more liquidity so all of those things all of those things are in play and we as the largest player today we get a we guess we we get so much um we get so much scrutiny we every regulator talks to us every regulator put us under the microscope and we tell them look we have the best kyc AML program period globally and um they may or may not trust said like we have Auditors that audited and we provide audit report and we said look there are other small exchanges that don't even have a kyc program and they don't care but they only care about us so having more exchanges that spread that load then we can then more then there's more education to towards The Regulators there's more dialogue today we're we're handling quite a big chunk of it and we would like to spread that load to other people as well so this pros and cons but overall though the industry will is is healthier for the industry to have many many exchanges so a lot of exchanges and obviously there's a lot of regulators around the world and you're number two on your kind of your 2023 goals was was compliance I I want to ask you give us kind of the global perspective so you've talked to a lot of regulators been in a lot of jurisdictions what jurisdictions are actually doing this well with respect to good crypto regulation because I'm looking around I feel like we haven't really seen it yet maybe you could point to like Mika or something like that maybe maybe that's a start what what are the best practices that you're seeing who's doing this really well um I think Middle East and Europe Mika Mika's not kicked in yet right so but so um I think those two regions are doing well um I think we gotta have realistic expectations the first draft of regulatory Frameworks for crypto are generally generally going to be more restrictive uh they're going to be overly restrictive um we've seen that in Japan now they had a fairly restrictive framework five years ago six years ago and now they're loosening up some of the stuff so and now bonus is going back into Japan so um um and Hong Kong is now opening up but I think many many places opening up and we also just got a we together with a local partner in Thailand just got a new license in Thailand so many places are opening up uh we're working very closely with friends and Italy and Spain in Europe and span France is putting quite a lot of effort into Mika and we think that you know Mika is still restrictive but it's not too bad it's pretty good um uh the Middle East regions Dubai Bahrain Abu Dhabi they're all coming up with new uh with real they're all revising their regulations over time and it's it's going um there are some negative Pockets you know while Hong Kong is positive China just banned crypto completely right so there's no crypto payments like no change there um not yet not not that we can see so that's not good um us is a slightly different situation um there's a lot of lawsuits in the US so it's you know Americans yeah so um it's it's regulation by enforcement um they don't give they think you know they they want to use the they want to use the guidelines for Securities for commodities for whatever that was there 80 years ago they want to use that and we don't think that's the smartest approach to be very Frank um so it's better to make new regulatory Frameworks for new Industries um but you know us have uh no so us was good for a while um the back it was very good banking support for crypto and but now that now that's gone um so um different places are different um and it's important to have multiple players in multiple places trying to push this forward but I do think though uh almost every smart leader will recognize this is a new technology for the future and they will they will come run to it it's easy it's not often that we get to have you here on Bank list so once again thank you for for coming around we asked our community um if they had any questions for you uh and we've got three of them are you ready to go sure yeah yeah all right so this first one actually comes from Justin Drake uh Finance currently only has 10 of its validators connected to non-censoring relays uh so he requests that binance use more relays especially non-censoring ones so binance staked eth can get a higher yield he napkin math calculated that binance staked eth is missing out on two million dollars of yield a month and also if binance does uh accept and connect to more uh relays uh for its uh staking validators uh ethereum would become more censorship resistant so here I guess this isn't a question but he requests can we get 100 of binance's stake teeth validators pointing to a non-censoring relay I'll throw that one over to you okay uh okay actually okay I understood the question much later in the in the question initially I thought he was talking about BMB chin I was like I don't even know what relays are in BMV chat um and I'm not that involved in the DMV um ecosystem technically um on the technical level um I guess he was talking about the binders taking on bonus.com yes uh how we use user funds to delegate to different nodes again I don't know the details on top of my head um I will take his advice and check um so binance we do offer a earned program and allow people to uh to to stake their coins on binance.com and then we stay we stay here for them on blockchain uh we historically don't use that many nodes we just like pick one and then we stake it and of course that looks like that that note is going to have a lot of uh coin staked on it and that has four different coins they have different implications on voting um all this other stuff uh we got better at it but we're still not perfect so uh I would I would ask the team to to look I know the rough Concepts that maybe issues ETC I don't know the details of this if or relays Etc yeah I'm sure Justin Jake would be uh stoked to hear that uh and uh if they pointed that they're The Ether validator nodes to connect to the ultrasound.money relay I'm sure he would be very very happy I'm sure the the team managing this would know what that means uh this next question actually addresses something you brought up earlier about crypto Banks this one actually comes from Dijon Spartan uh so we've actually got a cast of characters asking questions here uh can you please buy a bank and make it crypto friendly we did look at that um he did say please um but as anything the reality is much more complex than the concept um you buy One Bank you only works in one country and you still have to deal with The Regulators or the bank Regulators of that country it doesn't mean that you buy a bank you can do whatever you want to do if the banking regulator say look you can't work with crypto then you you you're not you they're going to take your license away if you do so buying a bank doesn't prevent The Regulators taking your telling you no you can't touch crypto so that's number one number two is uh then Banks usually work only in one country is the new corresponding Banks all over the world and most of actually all of the corresponding banks in the US and the corresponding banks are no longer the cost the corresponding banks will tell your bank say look if you touch crypto we're not we're not facilitating your International transactions so that happens too and then um you have to get banking in every country basically and banks are not cheap banks are very expensive for very little business very little Revenue just because everybody thinks that banks are very profitable if they're the money printing machines Etc so the amount of capital required is quite High and the regulatory approval for buying a bank is the same or more as setting up a new bank which are very onerous so it's not just like because you have money you can you can buy a whole lot of banks um and uh many banks don't have very strong business models uh they're they're they're very risky businesses um they take your customer money they loan it out trying to make money if they don't take it if they don't get it back they declare a bankruptcy in many countries the government will uh will save them but I don't like to run those kind of businesses those are not businesses that I I like to run businesses with no debt um so um it doesn't fit our model so there's multiple multiple reasons we did look at it but we may make small investments in a few Banks just become minority investors et cetera so that hopefully that influences them to be more crypto friendly it doesn't guarantee they will never cut crypto off so um yeah It's Tricky it's not it's not that simple maybe when we bring you on during next bull market the same question will be asked can you buy a country and make it crypto friendly but we'll save that one for later uh last question this one comes from lido.eath uh shout out to Lido have you ever considered making BNB chain a roll-up on ethereum uh uh yes and no um so those those topics came up uh those are those discussions come up um and I think they also Roll-Ups on bmechan um so uh I think uh having I'm I we support many projects which are roll ups layer twos um ethereum Bitcoin or other or BNB Chan um we also support many Native layer ones I think the more options they are the better BMB is already already a two native layer one blockchains um so BNB is the negative token on two different blockchains now and the third one is coming uh Greenfield which is a storage uh focused blockchain similar to filecoin they're trying to do a little bit better or we'll see um and so I think look I don't limit their options I don't say look you can only do one thing um we do we are only a participate in the BMB ecosystem um they do respect my voice so if I say something really strongly they probably will considered very careful fully but I don't try to do that I'll try to let them develop where are we my I view my and or even balance.com's contribution is mostly contribution we we help we fund projects uh we give them money mostly just grants no strings attached like not even Equity um no no tokens um so we we we found the developers a lot of let the developers figure out what they think they want to build and that's the best way to build a decentralized ecosystem I believe and today even though many people accuse no by being BJ may be too closely associated with binance.com the centralized exchange but the developers actually have a lot of leeway um and we want to I want to increase the funding uh support on on that on in that ecosystem whereas we don't want to dictate Direction so we want to let them develop themselves um and the progress may be slower it may not go in one country or one one as one person likes so this this he likes us to be a he's like the whole BMB ecosystem system view to be a roll up I don't think that will happen um so but there are multiple roll-up Solutions in that ecosystem and also for for ethereum too so um yeah in a decentralized system some feedback is slow but the economics eventually will take care of it if you build a product nobody uses then eventually you're gonna have to stop because you're gonna run out of money but if you build products people use then you're gonna grow more so it's much more organic but much slower but much healthier growth so we just want to support that one to fit in one non-crypto related Community question uh what do you think of Twitter post Elon Musk um I think so I again we are a very minority investor in there so I don't know that I don't know that I have not gotten any information that's not public um so but overall I think he's doing fine he's doing great um he cut that Workforce significantly but the platform seems to be no issues no uh there's no downtime the new feature releases seems to have picked up uh the space of new features coming out is faster uh now there's edit buttons um there's blue ticks there's a bunch of other things um so overall I think is and and he um his personality is perfect for running Twitter I think because he doesn't he doesn't care about what about other people's things well he said he doesn't care right that's exact words he said and um uh Twitter's so influential and that any you know every every party wants the other wants content of the other party being removed um you know there's a lot of uh there's a lot of he's getting pressure from every side I think but you know he doesn't care so he just wanted the neutral platform which is good I mean everybody have their subjective subjective views right so um he will have his neutral will be his neutral which may not be other people's neutral but you know I think he's doing a great job for anyone that can handle that amount of pressure he's he's probably the best choice so yeah it's it's going well I think well CeCe it's been great to have you on today in this uh this check-in uh it's been a year we hope to have you on again maybe in another year time maybe we'll be closer to uh the bull market we might still be in the same Market but I want to uh bookend this episode with with this uh question to you so there's a lot of 2021 2022 uh entrance here they're just new to crypto that's when they entered that's their class and they just feel like they've been through hell like they've been just absolutely punched in the gut and can you blame them I mean if they're still here I gotta say even from the Vets perspective you guys have earned your stripes all right you've made it this far um I want to ask you though CZ what advice do you have of for people who've felt wrecked by this recent bear Market what would you tell them um I think for anybody who feels uh uh wrecked pressure depressed Etc reduce the size so reduce the reduced exposure to crypto so um the fundamentally if you feel that if like if your investment performance affects emotions then you probably invested too much uh half it or 10 or reduced by a third or or fifth um and if you still feel that way do it again until you no longer feel like that you feel like okay this is Meaningful money I want to make money on it and then but if it if it drops by 20 10 20 50 I'm or even 100 I'm still fine um that's that's the right size I think that's sizing is very very important so instead of listening to people on Twitter oh it's going to go up it's going to go down people don't tell about what percentage of the of of the of their assets that they're put into that trade so um that's super important and then the risk management we talked about earlier don't put everything in one basket don't put everything in one trade don't put everything in one coin um all of that matters but fundamentally if people are feeling stressed um they invested too much reduce the size and then try again so also if you want to start start with a small size start with a hundred dollars with a thousand dollars whatever comfortable to you if you lose it no it's gone it's and you should be fine with it if you if you if you make money out of it then maybe double the size maybe slowly increase that over time so don't go all in um so I think that's a very much risk management but very specifically sizing issue if you're stressed out about this investment and you know it's it's going to wreck your life it's going to change your lifestyle um you're not going to be able to pay rent and then the the investment size is wrong if you're stressed size down that's what CZ says and you know I can't help but notice this was spoken like somebody who's uh had some like personal experience with this like have you learned have you uh learned these lessons the hard way CZ like the rest of us haven't we all yes I've learned this lesson the hard way years ago so I worked in Bloomberg and then after Bloomberg um so 2005 I tried some trading on some some stocks everything I trade it just feels like anything I touch it goes down and at any time I say anything goes out so and it was just so hard and then even crypto into when I first got into crypto in 2012 2013 2013-ish I've tried trading crypto a little bit and then we're like okay no just buy and hold it uh just buy and hold um so I I so um I'm not a Trader and not in 90 something percent of people are not Traders and that's nothing wrong with that um trading takes a very special skill um it is and the professionals are honed over multiple decades um per person right so they they they they they learn this skill over over many years and they have many special tools uh for most people trading is difficult for most people use it as a tool it's buy hold it uses for payments Commerce Etc don't trading is not for everyone um so for most people I always say don't trade but yeah and for the emotional aspect of it but I'm also in this industry right so I see a lot of Traders um I see a lot of guys who do well who know who don't do well um and the emotional aspect is very very uh tense so uh if you can't if you can't handle that emotion then then you got to reduce the size there you go good advice to end with and of course if you're not a good Trader you can do what CZ did and start an exchange for Traders that's the best way to do it CZ it's been a pleasure thank you so much for having it for coming on Bank listen and chatting with us today yeah thank you Ryan thank you David yeah it's a pleasure talking to you guys hope to see you guys next year see you soon uh risks and disclaimers bankless Nation gotta let you know of course none of this was Financial advice never is on Bank list crypto is risky Bitcoin eth you know the assets all of these things are risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
