four weeks from now we will be in a post-emerge world and this is what that world will look like so if you look at the Fiat issuance rate from the 1970s until now it's been about 12.8 percent 12.9 percent ethereum has been under proof of work 4.2 percent right so already significantly less than Fiat but ethereum under proof of stake coming in in four weeks from now at .18 and if demand recovers to the fees that we're generating during the bull market or over the past year or so it will be deflationary at negative point four three percent pretty stunning numbers here David yeah we've been talking on previous Roll-Ups of like man Ryan we might not be deflationary post merge but then if you look at this graph right here and it's like oh it will be point zero but we'll be point one eight percent inflation areas like oh like the difference between point one eight percent inflationary versus negative point four three percent is like actually relatively small
