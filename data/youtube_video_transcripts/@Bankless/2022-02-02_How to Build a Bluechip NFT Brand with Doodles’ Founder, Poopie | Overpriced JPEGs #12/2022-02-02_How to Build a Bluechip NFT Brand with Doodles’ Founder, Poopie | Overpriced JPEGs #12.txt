the art is the hook the art gets people to look and explore but like my goal is to like trojan horse millions of people into blockchain through you know through our brand how do we do that [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show we have poopy one of the co-founders of the doodles project the it project of the season i feel like doodles has absolutely exploded if you're following this space at all you probably have heard of them if you're very lucky you hold one or two or many their floor price has skyrocketed to 12 eth at the time of this recording not that we want to overly focus on floor price but it is an example of how this project has just really exploded over the last several months and talking to jordan poopy as he's known i really understand why i am so excited for you guys to hear this interview i think you're going to love it i think if you are a doodles holder you're going to love it because it's just going to make you that much more excited about what's happening in the doodle's ecosystem i think if you're not a doodles holder there is so much you can learn jordan poopy i keep calling them both has been in this space since 20 i mean really 2012 2013 in in terms of crypto but in the nft world since its very beginning he worked on the cryptokitties team he led cryptokitties for a little while he's worked on the dapper labs team so he's a true og in this space and there was just so much i was fascinated by in what he was saying so i think he'll feel the same way he also drops some uh alpha some announcement some information that has never been heard before so you if you're a doodles holder you're going to get some doodles alpha that you have not yet heard so really i'm like very bullish on this episode and i think you guys are really going to enjoy it i hope share it with friends if you like it because i think there's there's a lot here we will definitely have poopy back on at some point to digest the space more broadly and um just a pleasure talking to him and learning more about this project so before we dive right into the podcast here's a word from our sponsors polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes midan nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto.x or nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts login to web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is

username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com okay i am so incredibly excited for our guest today we have poopy also known as jordan co-founder of the doodles project i mean y'all are the it project right now so i feel very grateful to be getting some of your time today jordan poopy i'll call you poopy for the conversation uh given how busy you must be thank you so incredibly much for being here on overpriced jpegs i mean it's an honor carly overpriced jpegs is you know a great potter and i'm looking forward to giving you some some leaks some alpha man let's get into it uh i want to start just with your background because i think you're a huge draw for people especially in the beginning who are into doodles given your your history in this space so for for the few folks out there who maybe don't know why don't you give a little bit of your your background and how you got all this i'll give the scenic route um so in early i would say like 2012 2013 i got into the bitcoin and dogecoin communities and i built a prediction market that allowed users to bet on the future price of bitcoin um in sort of like futures type of way um i mean yeah some people say that you could have just like bought the currency in order if you wanted to speculate but i wanted to like kind of gamify it and the tldr there is like we started with bitcoin went into dogecoin then we you know got hacked learned a lot of lessons in security and had to refund a bunch of users um that kind of turned me off uh from building in the space and then the mountain gox like hacker kind of like just really yeah really turned me off as well um since then like i kind of you know always been fascinated with what was going on in blockchain um but it wasn't until cryptokitties came out that i really like dove into ethereum read the white paper um and really understood what you know smart contract programming could enable cryptokitties took me like by surprise and you know i'm a gamer and i love playing um massively multiplayer games that have you know in-game economies and part of the tos on almost every game imaginable is you know if you real world trade we're going to ban your account and you know i was the type of person to you know create online gold stores work with suppliers source you know buyers of virtual currencies virtual items and you know i always had to like evade that that band with my operations as as a kid um but when i saw the cryptic ideas i was like oh my god you know we could this is completely open and it's actually encouraged to create your own marketplace um and not just use the cryptokitties you know first party marketplace that is out there um so i kind of like completely abandoned gaming and went became a full-time cat breeder this was in 2017 and i saw like a gap in in in cryptokitties breeding the genetics code was solved by kai who we both know and you know no one really kind of made it easy from like a usability perspective to understand how to breed better cats or how to breed the cats that you want so i partnered with um alan falcon um who's you know the co-creator of topshop and um we took his spreadsheet and we productized it you took kai's cryptokitties genome project spreadsheet is that what you you is that the spreadsheet you're right there so kais was like the genesis of any development that we made so we took kai's learnings and knowledge expand allen expanded upon it and created a spreadsheet that made it easy to like read a crypt of kitty's genes through a bunch of inferior calls and just like insane and um we took that together and we created a web application that made it you know easy to i guess get the probabilities of breeding certain traits based on the genes that the crypticity has um it was kitty calc and you know more than 50 of breeders like used it um and that kind of got rohem to like look and see like hey what's going on over here like come out to vancouver so we can talk to you rohan being the dev on cryptokitties and you know really the the behind it rohm being the ceo of dapper labs yeah would zap or did dapper exist at that point or was it still in axiom zen it was still axiom zen but they were forming dapper so they were undergoing a fundraising round uh too yeah and um you know alan and i were like oh my gosh like maybe we could get some resources and tools or maybe they're gonna let us know about the road map for cryptokitties if we fly out there and we flew out there for two days the moment that we got there they handed us an itinerary of like 20 different meetings over the course of 48 hours and we're just like what the heck is going on are we being interviewed against our will without having realized it at all um that's exactly what happened um yeah we basically got interviewed by you know the entire team at the time there's only like what 20 people uh or 20 30 people and um yeah it we left with with an offer and um you know it wasn't we didn't have to mull it over or anything like absolute yes like this is our passion and uh we wanted to join crypticity and um you know since then like alan and i have worked on a lot of experiments and products within dapper labs um we both led uh cryptokitties at one point and you know i've sort of led cryptokitties like after allen went over it into top shot and then um top shot blew up and you know we needed um as much support as we could get from the wider team so i ended up going up over to top shot inevitably but in the back of my mind like i always wanted to create sort of um i always dreamed of the scenario where the breeding revenue from cryptokitties was kind of like funneled into a sort of like community treasury a dao and we gave some sort of um we allowed players to govern a few levers of the breeding game um maybe not the entire thing because you know the infrastructure still needs to stay up um but like it would be really cool for players to kind of vote on which fancy cats get added into the game or vote on which breeding events happen and breeding revenue was like yes it was small at the time but it was you know enough to keep a small team from the community like going incentivized and you know have enough of uh have enough capital to be able to pull off events or activations um so that was always in the back of my mind we had like a lot of different priorities in the company and um went over to top shot and you know as i'm in top shot i'm like talking to evan this is about 2021 like beginning of 2021 and um we came up with uh like an idea just to work together on something we didn't know what that thing was and um yeah when i decided to to move on from dapper and we dreamt up um nft dow project we didn't know what it was at the time like i was pushing for full decentralization right off the gate right out of the gate and if we get rugged or if we rug ourselves it just that that is the way the cookie crumbles and and as we're talking to more people you know talking to kai we're talking to lawyers or talking to we just realized that it wasn't it's a stretch that's a that's a real big stretch and we ended up meeting up with burnt toast and we shared our vision for it and um he kind of added the missing piece the um the he had so much more like intrinsic motivation for us he added you know appreciation for just the art itself and his process and i think um that's when we kind of had this paradigm shift to like really understand that we're trying to build a brand now and not just release an nft project so there is so much there i want to dive into the decentralization piece the building a brand how you go from sort of being a developer product person to being like you know the next lucas films like you know like or you know whatever it might be whatever the comp would be there so i want to get into all that but i think i want to start with this community side because it is obviously so central to your project but i want to push on something because you all were in a twitter space the other day with hypebeast they sort of being interviewed and her first question i think was a really legitimate first question that is sort of the obvious one right which is y'all are this very it project right now but i think in general and i think very rightfully so you've had explosive growth i mean you were popular from the beginning and you're one of those maybe rare projects that were super popular from the beginning and have only gotten more popular you know by the time i saw you guys i think day after minute it felt like the floor price was like one eath and i was like oh that's so high and now you're at like 12 ether or whatever it is and so she asked the high piece reporter was like what makes you guys unique why have you had this success and i think y'all said you know community and i'm like that's a great answer i think it's true your community is obviously really important but it's also what everyone says right beanie will tell you that what he cares about is the community right or you have blitmaps approaching community and saying hey it's totally cco owned by the the the whole project is owned by the community entirely there's no copyright so that's all to say the way you all have you've made certain strategic decisions and intentional decisions you and your co-founders about what community first really means and it's clearly paid off and it's whatever you're doing is working well so i want to dive deeper on the what makes you all unique what drew people to you and specifically on that what have you guys done and how have you thought about community that has worked so well and been so distinct and special yeah i think um i wish we could have expanded on that one a bit more um do it now baby it's it's a stool right like it's a three pronged or three footed stool like community is one of them um the next bit is that attracts people's you know the artwork it's universally like appealing i feel um it's extremely inclusive like you know we have drag queens in our collection we have like just an entire spectrum of uh colors that exist in the in the doodles palette um and i think the third point is like just experience in the team yeah like we've learned so much adapter labs on how to run a successful project how to build hype how to not build hype how to like over promise and under deliver and the inverse of that um like evan between evan and myself and even with scott's experience like we've we've been here before we know how to grow um a project into a larger ip that was pretty much what we were tasked with at cryptokitties like when we got into cryptokitties the viral bubble popped and you know now we had to take a step back and understand how to make cryptokitties like the next mario and we have a lot of failures on that path everything from you know the partnerships that we were shooting for the markets that we were trying to enter new products that we're trying to build and games that we were trying to prototype so for us like i think that our early advocates like the first you know thousand people that entered our discord really got to have a lot of one-on-one time with us through you know just us commenting in the discord or through random discord voice calls and we were able to like instill that experience and vision into them um so now it's like we don't need to explain this to you know 100 000 people we have a thousand people who are on the same people who understand our experience our successes our failures and what we want to do with the brand um who are kind of like mobilized to advocate for us in that way so when i say community it's like yeah it's super broad it's like you know it's a cop-out answer almost but like we were pretty intentional about how we created that early supporting community and like what we wanted them to to celebrate and what we wanted them to like um deflate in a way and i mean a simple example is like you know floor talk you know everyone loves talking about the floor um everyone hypes each other up and creates like this crazy expectation you know what about the new person that just joined who's like oh my gosh it looks like the discord's taking off i must buy now and like that is um while we're happy for people that you know are made out well um that's not something that we want to celebrate and we've even made like emojis to like you know kind of deflate it like we have past the rainbow emoji that just like completely occupies the entire discord channel and everyone just gets distracted and they're like okay now we're gonna pass the rainbow instead of talking about reaching a 128th floor great um so yeah that's um it's a little bit of how we think about community we think about them as you know extension or we think about our advocates as an extension of ourselves and um we have a lot of experience of managing communities the wrong way the right way and we're just taking all those learnings that we're super grateful for into into duels and what i hear you saying which i think is really important is in those early days of the project you spent a lot of one-on-one time with the people who were following you and you had a lot of value to add to them already because of your experience in the space so you could tell them those stories you could get them to really trust you because of everything you'd gone through and the value you could kind of give them in terms of your your knowledge and experience and if i'm not mistaken you made sort of a an interesting and critical decision which is you locked your discord down essentially before launch without a whole bunch of warning because you liked the community that was developing tell me if that's right and maybe share a little bit about that decision specifically as part of that early community building that that's right um there are two motivations there like to be truthful like the first motivation is like man we've been asking our friends and family to join us for ages and no one seems to give a damn so we're like okay we're just gonna lock it and create scarcity there and you know that will create demand because we know what we have um and the second motivation is for us to not lose control over the sentiment and also um the like the zeitgeist or the conversation that's you know ongoing because it's so easy for a discord to to ship and you know 10 000 people join like on mint day and now we just don't know like we we don't know anyone and uh discord general is flooded and we need to enable slow mode in order to be able to see people's um comments and i think nate alex's chain face arena project is a good example of just completely losing control over over a discord um and at that time was there like a thousand like how many people were in your discord when you decided to lock it down it was like 1100 and like 13 or something like that it was a random call that i had with evan and i was like you know what like we're just talking like you know would be really interesting if we just like turned the discord off right now and just disabled all invites what would that do like i don't know demand scarcity let's see it worked and then since then like there's just so many like like white lists and you know just invite only discords and i kind of like i i understand some of the motivation is to avoid gas wars um but i also feel like there just needs to be like a better completely better model for this it shouldn't be there shouldn't be gatekeepers and you know maybe when the design of these pfp projects changes away from the 10 000 model you know that might be an opportunity there for to have more accessible uh like communities and more accessible nfts are you saying you almost like the model you helped to usher in but which came about for you guys very authentically because you felt like hey we love the people in here has become now a tool that's actually being used for sort of artificial exclusivity and is and you kind of don't like that is that something i'm hearing yeah yeah i mean it's used to create fomo now yeah right it's used to create fomo it's used to trade i mean cross pollination is always good in communities and projects but like yeah it's it's it's now the thing that people seek out which is like um i i don't i don't know and there's just like people who go around and just try to like mass whitelist or just join as many whitelists as they can maybe sell their whiteless spots and i just i yeah i think it should be better i think there should be more like yeah more intrinsic motivations there let's dive into what you learned from cryptokitties since you've referenced it a couple times and like i would love to hear you talking about how to build hype how to how to over promise under deliver how to under promise and over deliver do you have any anecdotes or like failures that you felt like you had at cryptokitties that have been hugely instructive for you what are like the two or three big things that you're like when you were talking about early community in your discord building trust with them what were you telling them about so cryptokitty is like it kind of well the biggest lesson there is you know under promise and over deliver but like let me just get past that and talk about something more specific um figuring out the motivations of collectors and understanding you know the personas that exist in your community was very very like important for our development um there are people who join just to speculate and there are but there are also others who join just out of pure joy like they love the intricacy of the genetic design they might be breeders of other things in real life like plants you know and they find they're fascinated by a digital cat reading game it's important to understand what those personas are and what the makeup of your community is um and so that you can create like in the product features or you know experiences that cater to more than just you know the hardcore speculator if we that was our only focus like we would have shipped a token we probably would have launched anon um and we would have just with every release we would have done things to pump the floor price of the project you mean with with with doodles that's what you would have done based on the lessons you got from cryptokitties if you've been like we want to just cater to speculators exactly exactly i mean we know exactly how to do that we could have done that from day one we could have had that included in the roadmap and but like with cryptokitties taking away um really understanding your community and the personas like it helped us suss out who the collectors were on day one and you know we had a lot of decisions to make in week one where it's like do we do we um like launch rarity tools like do we let third-party projects ascertain the rarity of you know the collection and the decision that we made is like like no like we already released ahead of the project what the makeup of the collection was you know how many custom hand-drawn doodles there are how many of xyz traits there are and we felt that was enough like what we didn't want is to create this sort of like um new dimension of speculation just for that little artificial pump that you get when people ask you know when rarity tools when rarity tools because you know they want to trade against it they want to trade on it so you know we just came up with an answer like one doodle is one doodle yeah and um that's kind of uh it kind of helped like our community move away from only focusing on speculation and just appreciating the the collection and their dude a little bit more so in cryptokitties like we tried to do the same thing um but we we kind of like over indexed on collectibility to the point where we're completely ignoring speculative motivations and in the product like people were just wondering like why why new feature to collect xyz or why new feature to do this what we really want is to look at the floor price of certain trades and we didn't we didn't have that and because we focused too much on that collectibility um so i think that the learning there is like finding that balance and you know that's just one of many like takeaways i mean there are launches and cryptokitties that we've had that went you know terribly wrong um give me give me one more because i i do think it people okay we'll be fascinated to hear what the learnings are and the takeaways and it'll be so instructive got it um this may i mean well okay there's like three that are in my mind right now but from an optics perspective i think i'm gonna go with i'm going to go with the china line okay there's like three three big chapters in cryptokitties is like um first year history like there's china launch there's oh gosh steph curry cats and okay we'll start with all of these sound great start we're trying to launch them we'll just move through come on we got time man it's a podcast it's a long form um so the channel launch china always comes up in crypto or blockchain or nfts it's a new market that very few understand clear where the community is you know almost completely isolated from the community that we we we interact with i'm not sure if it's because of you know firewalls or just like um people are in that area being more accustomed to using certain social apps um or just you know language so with the china launching cryptokitties there was this insane expectation that um we're going to have you know 100 000 more users and people are going to come in and scoop up everything on the market that has some sort of this is very ignorant some sort of cultural uh significance with their their community so we saw people really studying chinese numerology and collecting cryptokitties that had um auspicious you know numbers um we saw like in the product um but this was i think this was before i joined we had um kitties with chinese bios and we just like quadrupled down on this idea and did not set proper expectations for ourselves and for our collectors and you know ultimately when the china launch happened it really was just like it really fizzled out and you know we expected or the community expected a thousand x of what we actually saw and um that was you know key for like under promise over deliver or just like uh yeah what did a china launch mean i mean this was a platform online so what does it even mean to be launching in china if it's right it meant um collaborating with um phone manufacturers in china to be able to um to to deploy the cryptokitties mobile app in chinese um on like on on every device basically so regardless of whether you know if you have like an htc phone or something like it'll come pre-downloaded cryptokeys will come from download with it and that was like one way that we entered the market um and um there are other ways too and like we just i'm actually like really digging into my memory because this is 2018. um yeah just the the entire go-to-market strategy just you know wasn't there we had one big angle and that was like uh installing the cryptokitties mobile app on you know on phones on many devices that were very common in china and it just ultimately like just didn't convert i mean we still have the same problems as we see today like what are the crypto on-ramps um how do you explain um a non-custodial wallet to a user like these are all the challenges that some teams are solving right now that were the same hurdles that um that cryptokitties users had in early 20s or late 2017 the difference with november 2017 or december 2017 in the china launch is there was a viral bubble with cryptokitties and everyone you know saw the new york times headlines and they were willing to go through the gauntlet to be able to acquire crypto and breed cats um with the china launch we didn't have that viral bubble to drive that sort of demand and like with cryptokitties conversion rates there during the uh viral uh bubble it was like three percent out of all users that went to the site and then after that you know it dropped down to like 0.2 so like people were more than 10x more motivated to go through that gauntlet because they saw the headlines and everyone was talking about it's created that cultural buzz and that cultural the culture side of it that it feels like it is very hard to do in a country that's across the globe from you if you don't have people on the ground and and the people sort of you know doing that work what so what were the the big the big takeaways now when you think about doodles is it partly a don't put all your eggs in any one basket thing is it like hey we're not gonna over pipe hype any one thing because it's hard to predict what's gonna hit it's going to be the thing that you don't expect to hit that will hit and catapult things has that been part of the the what you've pulled from that i think just being more intentional about what's going to do the most to build the brand um like with doodles we have an nft track for product we have um a consumer goods track and then we also have like a live events track as well so each track is you know in service to one another um it's intended to create more demand for doodles the brand but the product should be able to like cross pollinate the you know customers in a very cohesive way so like with doodles you know we have that 10 to 10 000 nft collection um the reason why we're creating space doodles um which is our next feature release is to experiment innovate learn something but also you know give additional value to current collectors and to current existing doodles that that is um that's kind of in support of like flexing our technical ability maintaining our position as you know one of the top teams in the space from like a innovation perspective um but you know space doodles isn't going to do anything for the million fans that don't even own you know an nft oh you're touching on so much i want to touch on sure go for it jump in i want to talk so much about space doodles and you're doing some innovative things there the community has reacted really positively to those announcements and and the ways you've you really innovated around that but i want to step back first and and talk about you know you're building this intellectual property and i think something you said in that height beast conversation was you know in five years you want to be the peanuts and in 10 years you want to be disney and i thought that was a really cool oh it was very helpful it's ambitious i love it and it's very clear sort of what you're trying to build you're laughing but i'm assuming you you continue to stand by that and you're laughing hearing your own words put put back is that is that the reaction i mean i that was definitely off the hip but like i spent like five hours in the charles schultz museum a couple months ago and just reading the history and kind of understanding you know the the inclusivity of peanuts the characters the and um how they went from you know comic strip to a brand um that was i saw i drew a lot of parallels and as i've been talking to more and more people who are from you know that that space um sharing those experiences like i i'm starting to see it i'm starting to see this is like the making of that sort of like iconic um brand that started with you know a character started with a few characters um but we have much more ambition than ending with that if that makes sense like 100 and my question is actually i think it's awesome and i think it's totally doable and you know i've talked to other projects in the space and so i know you're not alone in that sort of being the hope or the end game and i'm wondering how does it work like there's you we there's cool cats there's dead fellas like there's so many uh projects all that i think are amazing that are all sort of shooting for that and you know to some extent the goal is your uh you know apple tv series or your netflix series or your show with your characters i'm sure you're gonna give a very diplomatic answer here but do you think about that like are you out pitching netflix knowing that cool cats is next door doing the same thing or you know knowing that eventually that'll be the case like how do you think about all these other nft brands that are that are also uh sort of shooting for these same goals yeah um that's a really good question i don't think i'll give a diplomatic answer oh good i was hoping for a non-diplomatic answer but like i think frankly like we really don't give a damn whether or not we sell something to netflix or we just release it on youtube for free like we're the type to test an idea in the market in the quickest way possible and if it means like we we want to create that animation for ourselves to understand what you know what what we have what this what story can we tell how much depth is there into into our universe that we're creating um whether we pitch that to netflix or release you know something that's like a series on youtube like it's really up for discussion like i think um i think that it starts with the character like well traditionally it started with a character like mickey mouse with disney um but then like we have so much more like we have you know the community we have a successful product we have fans like we don't need to go the traditional route um and just go straight to the netflix's yeah it'll be great because that's distribution to millions of people but it's really about maximum eyeballs and and in part in some ways the world is changing right and so we're seeing all sorts of gatekeepers tumble in all sorts of industries in the world and uh it's not impossible that you see some of these other media gatekeepers be less relevant as well um and so it sounds like you're saying it's not about prestige for y'all it's about reaching people and making the brand relevant to people and that can be done wherever people are yeah i think i think it might be you know a bit too early for any nft brand to just be like we're going to put this in front of 100 million people or 20 million people and see what sticks like i really feel you should know your audience first and before you even do that you need to know your story um so i mean there's that's not to say that a bizarro version of doodles of what we create in the next year could be released in the following year um something but i i feel like like i want to know the story and that's what we're working on right now is um who are the main characters in the collection you know we don't want the main characters to just be at doodles doodles that we own like we're talking to collectors right now to be able to understand what their vision is for their doodles and kind of see how we could incorporate that web into the universe that we want to build um but i mean there could be a world where we create um an animated short and you know we we just release it to the community or we release it to yeah and we just get feedback on it and iterate on it there could also be a world where we just find the right partners who have the same passion and vision that we do or just a different vision that you know we we kind of can relate to that want to take us into this you know netflix streamer hbo max sort of route um it's very early i think for a lot of projects um i'd be really curious to see how you know cuphead does with their animated series on netflix that just got the trailer just was released yesterday because that's a good example of having a highly successful product built-in community making its way into a different you know form of media the flip side to this question where i was sort of asking you know are you out there pitching all these are you out there pitching and realizing that cool cats is next to you pitching the same thing is what i'm imagining is happening which is you're having a tremendous amount of inbound like everybody in the world is like trying to figure out this nft game and are looking at a handful of sort of the major projects and i'm guessing doodles is one of them how are you managing that inflow and what are you looking for in people who reach out wanting to be partners or wanting to work with you all i think um at the very highest level like within the context of not releasing a new product but let's say fundraising because that's just you know every startup has to deal with that at some point or i ignore that at some point like we're looking for very strategic partners in terms of you know people we hire or in terms of advisors um we don't we kind of want the best of the best like we want people understand that we have that bootstrapped community product that's successful but we want people who have like a longer term vision than someone who just wants to create something with us and sell it i mean if we wanted to we could do it you know eight nine figure drop like at the push of a button almost but like that doesn't really achieve anything for us building a long lasting brand um so going back to the previous question it's like what i don't understand why it has to be like a rush race to the market you know 20 million people who are going to watch this probably have no idea like are not on the same level of understanding of nfts as we are like it does not need to be race between you know cool cats dead fellas and doodles to make the first animated series on netflix i just if you have a successful like engaging like you know anime animation it's going to do well if you find the right audience for it um but in terms of like who we're looking for um people with that sort of like founder mentality willing to wear multiple hats um but who also have experience shipping um like i personally don't want our team to grow larger than you know 20 people for the stage that we're at right now um how big are you right now how many people do you have on the team we're eight eight people in total yeah and like you have contractors that you work with that are sort of outside of that eight so yes we we do um technically we're all contractors okay doodles has zero full-time employees that that is going to change because of um [Music] the you know labor laws and health insurance yeah i know because i do want health insurance finally you're like all right i'm sick of this this is yeah this is this is like um it's important but it's also like kind of draining having to navigate all the um you know just equitable and like labor laws in different countries et cetera and it's like yeah so that's an entirely new beast that we're just trying to figure out right now um but going back um gosh i lost my train of thought now i was asking about how you determine who you decide to partner with all the project ideas and partner ideas and higher ideas and vcs and everybody who's coming at you wanting a piece of this how do you sort through that that noise and you were saying you want somebody with a founder mentality who's like thinking long term and knows how to ship yeah yeah um willing to be on the frontal lines but just a more direct answer is like like okay vcs on the topic of vcs there's you know many people many organizations that just want to throw money at us like that's silly in dumb terms like we don't need that right now like we we really don't we can self-fund almost anything we want to do and we could also build with the community and use tap into the doodle bank as well um but like the average like the vc needs to be able to bring more than just capital money like yeah not not even connections like we can reach almost anyone we we need to reach right now at this stage through our you know our advisors that we have we're looking for more strategic like in a scenario where doodles did need to raise a lot of capital to do something like we would want someone who owns manufacturing end-to-end but also has distribution relationships with the biggest retailers in the world like we're looking for people who can we can bring an idea to and they can and they have the resources to be able to produce it in-house um we're not looking for connectors and that's you know since the growth that's what we've been seeing it's kind of frustrating having to navigate through people who could connect you to this or person or that person like we've had a paradigm shift recently to where it's like you know instead of just like licensing our ip to xyz toy manufacturers very successful in walmart um why not just build it ourselves with the right partner who has you know millions of square feet of manufacturing and who has decades of experience doing this in more of more than a collab more than a partnership so what i'm saying is more like thinking more in a joint venture mentality so that we own most of it like end to end and we have full control over what chemicals get added into it or removed from it you know what type of uh work environment the product is built in um everything from that to how it reaches you know the shelves so that's very uh yeah i might have revealed too much no i mean i'm eating this up i i i think this is fascinating and i think it's so helpful so important for anybody who's interested in nfts to see how the minds of i think project founders work and i think you're so thoughtful about what you do with this project and it's it's really fun to to kind of hear what you're thinking and going through in real time and i think it'll bring a lot of value to people let me ask you too so that was sort of talking about the vc fight side or taking outside money or those kinds of partnerships you talked about you you sound like you almost have departments within doodles you talk about the nft side this uh like consumer good side the live event side are you thinking about that like here are our departments are you gonna you know down the line you'll have the animation studio side and and and you're building up people with the right expertise in live events and in building consumer goods is you know it feels like that ties together we're talking about with manufacturing etc is that how you guys view it yeah that's exactly how we view it we we have advisors for every single like vertical that you just mentioned uh people who have you know done really incredible things um i'm not sure if we yeah we haven't released their names yet or shortlisted them i mean todd kramer was and geronimo jahan was on the hypebeast call but that's kind of what we're looking for we're looking for people who you know get the vision but could also help us scale out either a team internally or figure out how to structure a joint venture with the right partners for each of these things like we're not going to build a 50-person animation studio at doodles instead we're going to work with um you know the best to be able to do that um the same thing with consumer goods and you know live events as well like we're trying to keep the the team relatively small right now and i think we can stay very lean you know indefinitely as long as we structure these partnerships or structure these joint ventures like in a good way is there is there one department you're most excited about are you like i'm a concert guy i want the live events beefed up or is are you just like you're loving are you loving like all of it and the the business thinking about okay biased answer is the nft yeah yeah okay i should have thought so um okay so this is news nate alex is actually jumping on as our smart contract advisor and i'm just gonna like say that's big news dude that's amazing um like nate is trying to build you know a team of world-class smart contract engineers um so it makes so much sense for us to align with nate and you know give and take at the same time yeah and also leverage their you know future ideas for our internal like nft product track so like i'm super excited about that i think that's huge because i think it's so clear i don't i don't know nate but i think i've actually talked to him a little bit in group discords and things like it's so clear he's got such a brilliant technical mind and that he's so excited about innovating in this space technically and that he doesn't care as much about art like if you look at jane faces arena or jane you know you're like what that is not is like you know breathtaking art and so to kind of bridge those makes sense because you have you know you have the folks in your city you've got burnt toast who who do care and you know put so much thought into the art side so to have him just focusing on what he loves and does so well is that's so exciting that yeah that's definitely the thinking like we're focusing on what we're good at which is usability um art animation just creativity in general and we want to bring in partners like nate to help us with you know the heavy lifting from a very smart contract technical perspective but also like help us roadmap what we want to experiment with um i mean for me i'm just i'm a product person but i can't have my ear to the ground in every you know sort of like niche of blockchain development yeah and that space is evolving as fast as anything else and you can't keep track of all of it yeah yeah and then and then hiring you know hiring doesn't make sense when we have like friends and allies who are the best at what they do um so nate's team right now is himself and kane wallman who actually won sam seesy's sons capture the flag um tournament and sam cz sun if anyone does not know is one of the best white hat hackers like in the space and their documentation is incredible about what they discover and i i enjoy reading it like a lot of it can go over my head but i just that's that's the quality of talent that like we want to like align ourselves with um and also like offload that that burden too at the same time oxy infiniti is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their axes there are and will be many varied gaming experiences for axes many of them having players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted

universe is a player-owned economy where the players can truly own buy sell and trade the resources they earn in the game through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem it's a digital nation where people come together globally with their axes to play earn and live join the axi revolution at axioinfinity.com bankless everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axi infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse i want to get into what i see is like almost the biggest thorniest question that any nft project who's really looking to become a massive global brand has to contend with and i know you think about this and i think it'll probably lead us to space doodles and to a whole bunch of other things but how do you scale a limited supply nft project something like doodles where you have you know 10 000 of them or whatever it is and how do you reconcile that you have 10 000 of these things but you want this to be a a brand that reaches millions of people how do you think about making that happen and and how you go from where you are to to there and like keep these people engaged when they don't own one themselves so the cop-out answer is merch okay like i think i i think that's the cop-out answer um you know merch could be um print-on-demand it could be you know whatever it could be scaled easily if you're we're talking low quality um but but scratch that entirely like i think that um we we're in we're in blockchain like we're in web 3. like there are you know pillars of the technology that are always like underlying in everything that we do you know the transparency um the trustlessness um the ownership and when you're trying to scale your brand and you kind of like i feel it's true to the space to be able to share those values at the same time and for me it's hard to share those values when i'm if i were to just sell a doodles t-shirt with the doodle mascot on it um this is my motivation as a blockchain builder to be able to share those values and you know onboard people into the space the art is the hook the art gets people to look um and explore but like my goal is to like trojan horse millions of people into blockchain through you know through our brand um how do we do that right now we can't do that we're a vanilla nft project you know with 10 000 nfts with you know snapshot multisig wallets etc like that experience is daunting for the mainstream like user like how how does one even buy crypto like i was talking to my parents the other day and they still don't even have coinbase i don't even know how they got their ethereum so like there yes i always want to push forward to centralization um but i don't feel like that needs to be the only thing that we focus on or work on for doodle specifically like you know we have 150 000 fans on twitter um not all of them own nfts a lot of them in for the ones that do own nfts they definitely don't own doodles because we only have you know 5 800 unique holders what we're trying to to think of is like how do we leverage the existing collection in a way that's equitable to the collector um to be able to scale nfts to 100 000 a million 10 million people um we think we have a way to do that but it requires the right partners in the space who have built the technology to be able to you know one um have fiat on ramps credit card purchasing to build a very slick native experience that is very familiar to people um metamask wallet is not familiar to people um and three like be able to build at scale not just from like even from more than an ethereum perspective like you know ethereum has a bottleneck with how many how much transactions can or how much computation can be included into a block that you know that is a bottleneck so i think um for us we want to get our nfts out to millions of people but we don't want to create new new doodles new doodles um we're trying we're trying to do that through cross-licensing doodles back to us that are owned by you know collectors to be able to create not derivatives but to cro to be able to create new nfts that they can sell to our fans so now we have this supply oh i think i'm this is starting to click but spell this out yeah now now we have the supply to be able to sell our job is to create the demand for that supply um and it's a way that this way does not dilute the you know collectors and their their doodles in any way instead it lets them you know bootstrap a business if that makes sense totally so let me ask well let me let me ask and this i think does bring us to space doodles but so is it is the the concept here is if i hold a doodle i could license it back to like doodle llc you all and so you pay me some like royalty or some little licensing fee and then you take this doodle that i've licensed back to you create something maybe you put it in a spaceship or you kind of you do something else with that doodle which now creates a new asset that you can sell so now you have more than 10 000 you know sort of doodle products out there but you haven't undermined the initial holders and in fact you've gotten their explicit permission and you've paid them a little something you've given them some sort of revenue stream for that is this what you're describing exactly and the context of it can change that's cool i'm gonna get front run yeah guys uh i'm launching you know toodles and i've got a sick idea um but to dive a little deeper like you know the the thing that's amazing about space noodles is like the context right it's doodles in a spaceship that that's just like how we want to experiment with that technology um but like for this idea that we're speaking about like you know think about like a digital funko pop you know funko pop has its own distinct art style with the big heads black eyes um what if you know there was a digital very or a variation of that doodle interpreted in like a 3d art style or like a community um a community modelers like art style community artists art style things like that like um and all of this could be enabled through smart contracts as well like you could you know totally stake or escrow or wrap your you know your doodle to be able to participate in this um but i think we're getting into deadheads have you followed the deadheads project uh about all that they not deeply they basically they have folks stake their deadheads into a casting pool they choose from that pool who to cast in their show and then you get rewarded for that staking and the idea being that you know if they become the next star wars or something like you own r2d2 but you've you've basically leased it to them to use but you still own own it fundamentally and could go lease it out for other purposes so i am going to buy a deadhead i don't know when i literally just did an interview with them so i don't know whose interview is airing first but and they have a whole concept called the green room where it's very cool what they're doing technically is very cool um and it you know you're doing something similar just not only in the context of entertainment and shows right you were talking about a very similar mechanism for expanding the collection uh and i think it's awesome talk about space doodles and the rapt it's a wrapped nft and maybe give people a little primer on that and um i think like the who's who i feel like of people that i respect in nft world were all freaking out when you announced space doodles and the mechanism so i feel like it's worth taking a moment for you to talk about why this is so um sort of amazing it ties into what we're saying now of course but so wrapped nfts i've been completely fascinated by rapping for like since 2019 since it you know existed um the history behind wrapped nft starts with um the cryptokitties community there was a developer named cab sion capsion they were toying with the idea of adding toying with the problem of nfts not having liquidity of nft being a liquid so their solution to that was to allow users to wrap their nft their cryptokitty and receive a fungible token so what this created was you know like now now these wrapped cryptokitties can be traded on uniswap an investor could come around and get exposure to cryptokitties by just buying a basket of wrapped cryptokitties um collectors can don't need to spend the gas to list each cryptokitty well individually sorry sorry collectors don't need to spend the gas to list their cryptocurrency on the market and wait for a buyer to come around there was immediate liquidity through you know uniswap for example so in summary like it enabled new functionality on on an existing nft through um giving your crypto kitty to the smart contract and receiving that fungible token in return that was in 2019 since then like nate alex came around and you know toyed with the idea of wrapping specific cryptokitties so gen zero cryptokitties now um the value of the wrapped nft or the fungible token is much higher so people can it makes economical sense to trade it on uniswap or to to even wrap it to begin with um fast forward a little bit you know punk's uh unique token that predated erc721 could not be traded on openc so i forgot the name of the team but they use the same tech wrapping nfts instead of wrapping an nft into a fungible token they wrapped a punk into a conforming nft yeah that's how i feel like most most people if they've heard of wrapped nfts like i think of wrapped strikers right think of it as these projects that predated sort of the erc 721 standard you know now wanting to be on open c i didn't know the full history so keep going it's it's very interesting got it um and and that was very very popular but you know with i i i don't know where that project ended up i think people still just ended up using larval apps's you know zero feed marketplace um since then you know the nft explosion happened in 21 and you know mooncats got um got dug up from from the archives of nft projects and you know acclimated mooncats came around um there are other projects i think that are experimenting with wrapped nfts um the way that we're doing it a bit differently is instead of just letting you wrap your nft into another nft we're actually reinterpreting its art almost completely giving you an entirely new piece of artwork from burnt toast but also giving you on-chain stats and properties that allows your you know space doodle which is also your doodle to be used in let's say some sort of experience that makes use of those stats in the future and like hypothetically speaking because it seems like you're clearly implying there will be cool experiences yeah and so the mechanism here is i have a doodle i can now wrap it and it will change its look into a space doodle it'll be a doodle in a spaceship for example with all the new art that comes with that from from burnt coast and then i can also choose to unwrap it again and bring it back to being my original doodle so it's a way to evolve the look of my doodle or change the look of the doodle but it's non-dilutive is the term that you know keeps coming up right because it's not actually adding more nfts to the collection and therefore diluting the original 10 000. and so it it's non-dilutive in the sense that there are it's not adding more energies into the circulating supply um there are new nfts being created but you know one can only exist in a user's wallet at any time you can't sell the space doodle separate from your own doodle they are the same person changing outfits exactly exactly and we caught some flack around the coupling of it um you know some people are expecting an air drop from us they're expecting to receive this entirely new nft that they can then liquidate um we have our reasons as to like why we did not go that route um i think um just taking a step step back the for from the non-dilutive aspect like to me what's really interesting which i don't i don't know how this will play out is you know how does the circulating supply affect the the marketplace like now there's two there's two collections that exist there's the doodles collection and the space doodles collection as more doodles are getting wrapped into space doodles less doodles can you know theoretically be listed on openc or any marketplace because they're escrowed by a smart contract like what what happens then i don't i don't really know um but like the space doodle always has a pointer back to its pilot which is you know the original doodle so in its on-chain properties like pilot will always reference you know it's it's doodle um i'm just like thinking right now and getting a little bit into the weeds but um like what happens in a scenario where your space doodle can be wrapped into you know a planet or your space needle can be sent into a planet to do something now we're like three layers deep so that's an example of scaling it vertically what happens if we scaled it horizontally so instead of going into a spaceship you know your doodle was going into a brick and mortar business in the metaverse to do something um now your doodle can jump into your spaceship or can jump into xyz business in the metaverse um it gets really interesting it's like yes if gas allows it can we can do really exciting things but i think it's a i think it's a it's a innovative way to extend like the experience and introduce new content without having to um dilute the collection the brand the characters themselves um yeah there's so much there and i almost wanna i'm like debating if i wanna i wanna push deeper but i also wanna be mindful of time and i know there's a couple other there's probably one more big concept we want to get to but so let me just ask this when you talk about the how it evolves horizontally hold on i have two different thoughts and i'm they're competing for top building right now um when you talk about it going into the metaverse what is the rapt how does the rap component factor into it going into a brick and mortar metaverse building because you're not necessarily evolving the doodle nft at that point or am i missing something yeah no that was me just like brainstorming and shooting off the hip i've never actually thought of that um until like a minute ago um but what i was trying to get at is like what if they're inside of you know xyz metaverse there is a bakery and you know your doodle has an apron somehow and um or a chef's hat these are not traits that are in the collection i'm just giving you an example um you could possibly just send your doodle to work in that you know in that bakery or wrap your doodle and have it wear a chef's hat and an apron so that it can be used in whatever this bakery is um it's pulling on a lot of threads like like composability for example interoperability um so i'm like totally glossing over that but um i think that just enabling new functionality through rapping is like could be one direction that a lot of projects take in the future absolutely and that's what i was going to say is my takeaway of one of the reasons this feels like a big deal and impactful is is because it does you know it allows for different forms of self-expression that nft collections up to this point or pfp collections at this point haven't really allowed for to your point i mean your your bakery example is perfect right like i can express myself now as part of my digital identity you know as a baker or in a spaceship and as an astronaut or you know i can any number of those ways that we want to morph ourselves online just in the ways that we morph ourselves in real life to have different identities it feels like you've sort of presented the first example you know of of how that might work um and i think that's why the people who were really excited like kind of blew their minds i think i think that's what it is is understanding that and seeing that long-term potential however it plays out um does that feel right yeah it does um it really does i just on the interoperability composability piece like just imagine like nothing is stopping another developer from creating a racing experience that lets you know an ape a cool cat a dead fella a doodle get their own spaceship like i'm not saying this is like a in a vampire attack perspective i'm thinking about this in like a composability perspective like why not like that could be an entirely new you know project that's kicked off that has four boots strapped for n bootstrapped communities right like i think i think that's cool really cool yeah very cool um okay i want to turn to the question of decentralization because i know we're a little over time as it is and this feels like a big topic to dive into you mentioned at the top of this episode that your initial dream was like we're launching this fully decentralized project that's it you know and that realistically that hasn't been exactly how it's been able to play out i would love to talk about what you've learned and about what's what's maybe feasible or not and and and how the decentralization question has played out for doodles i think um what's changed is the motivation um initially we wanted to launch a sick nft project that's fully decentralized that can implode at any moment and it's kind of our like our um entry into the space as individuals um that uh yeah that really it didn't get deflated just the motivation changed like when we started talking to scott and we started seeing you know the concepts the art like we just realized that we and we started getting getting to know scott as well like we just want to create something that's lasting we want to create legacy together i feel like the motivation matured like that feels like a more sort of mature approach i want to build a lasting brand a legacy something i can really sink my teeth into rather than like let's do it bra i know i know um but like the decentralization bit it's always a balance like in anything that we do there's always like you're you're sacrificing or you're balancing decentralization with usability you're balancing decentralization with you yeah user user experience um they're balancing decentralization with the ability to interact with meat space too at the end of the day like it's it's um we for us to achieve our vision we need to have more control over how you know doodles operates we need to have more control over the treasury um and to be protected too at the end of the day like one example is um when we created our multi-sig i wanted to implement this reality reality gnosis module what that would allow is execution of code after a proposal gets passed and that execution of code is typically like transfer eth to this address so you know that could have made it trustless almost um but at the same time like there are that could have also like rugged the entire doodle bank if you know something were to happen and like when we had that mind mindset shift to actually create a brand you know in your words like we have a more like be more mature about where we want to take the project we cannot like have that as a risk at all in any way um so we we made a very intentional decision to be centralized um and i'll say it like we're centralized and our community trusts us with a lot trust us to be the stewards of the brand and to continue growing you know the ecosystem but i think there's a point in the future where we give back control and i don't know if it looks like you know an experimental fund that goes back to the original like idea where it's like here's a thousand yeast go ham but i think that's interesting though i think that's really cool um and yeah i have a close eye on like projects like nouns and just like other nft dao projects just to see like what they're doing and you know i talked to kai as well and like i see the hurdles that you know me bit style was going through and i try to learn from them um but i just think that we're just oh go for it go ahead no go ahead finish without you think well i just think that we're we're just not ready for it yet and it would be a detraction from what our you know north star vision is which is get the brand in front of millions and to millions of households yeah this is something i've been talking kind of a lot about on the podcast really over the last couple of weeks talking to the dead heads project i talked to a kind of intellectual property expert on today's episode and and really um you know understanding what these different models look like and what bet you were there for making you talked about if you're making a bet on doodles because of the the centralized nature to the extent that it centralized and i know you're saying it is but they're also or you've got the doodle bank you have some serious decentralization components um you're making a bet on you guys as a team as opposed to a blit maps or cryptos and that there's also a lot of legitimacy to those projects but you're making a very different bet when you buy into those projects you're making a bet on the collective you're making a bet on a mozart emerging from somewhere and then choosing that particular art to to drive it and make it relevant like and understanding the different bets you're making i think is is really important um and i think you know i work with me this down with kai and i think we've made similar decisions which is um trying to be decentralized as possible while shepherding a vision um you talk about it with with you know hiring you you do put it to the community to approve funds for different hires and and salary ranges i think but at the end of the day you have a team of you that are making the determinations around who gets hired et cetera um i want to talk just say a few words on the doodle bank and sort of how that functions and and i think that's your your compromise on the decentralization centralization piece yeah um so the doodle bank is a community treasury um you know it its purpose is to help us scale the team but also you know fund creativity and ecosystem development around doodles um you know we have 2 000 plus people subscribed to the snapshot and um you know some of our votes have a turnout of like you know 20 percent and it's really like it's really been used for many things and it's evolved over the last 90 days like initially you know the types of proposals that we would see or first let me speak about the process so the process is you know a community member ourselves the collector puts forth an idea you know they try to farm dissent among the people on discord or the forums and once that idea is a bit flushed out once we know how you know it how who can champion it how it could be held accountable how it could actually realistically be shipped and what the value is to collectors doodlebank and the brand then we can like put forth the proposal or the collector can put forth a proposal to unlock those funds we work with the best proposals the proposals that actually pass that initial round of voting to flush out a more final proposal that actually does unlock it and transfer the funds into wherever wherever it's going um early on you know we saw a lot of ideas that were just pie in the sky we should build a game we should build this we should build that and um we really had to like work with the community and kind of help them understand that we need like we have a lot of talent in doodles people who have experience from production to um coffee roasting to just just everything imaginable we need you know a champion we need somebody with subject matter expertise somebody who has you know done whatever the idea is before and we've tried to make the proposals a bit better and more fleshed out to go so one of the questions that people ask is like who could actually run this like who do we nominate and we go to the person we're like will you be willing to to do this anyways so like a couple of the proposals that have passed are unlocking funds for scaling our team um in that proposal we listed out the roles that we wanted to hire for the amount of money that we needed we're a little ambiguous about the makeup of of where those funds are being distributed and all i you know would say to that is we have to pay market competitive rates to get the best talent um so that's always dynamic um but um yeah we we've tapped into the funds um community developers have tapped into the funds as well to create their own you know inspired nft projects and um just even artists have tapped into the funds to reinterpret the art style to be able to like create pixel doodles you know that are animated that can be used in you know world wide web um or other like 2d you know metaverse experiences so it really is a fun for creativity and you know it's all but it's also a fun for helping us grow and scale the team like one big learning that we kind of screwed up on is um we did not allocate a percentage of the royalties into doodles uh the corporation or the llc so like half of the royalties you know go to doodlebank half of it goes to founders as royalties so we're trying to figure out how to restructure that right now um so like like in in meat space like on the balance sheet for the corporation there's like zero dollars is broke you heard of your first yeah exactly exactly so that's alerting but we're fixing that for 2022. um but uh in in with that sort of like dual purpose comes a lot of confusion too so it's like you know some community members think that this fund is for only ecosystem development why are you hiring and not using royalties um and um so that's something that's one of the big problems that we want to like you know clarify fix for 2022 but i mean today we have like four successful proposals so far that have added a lot of value um that people just genuinely just really love like pukenzas shipped three days before christmas and the holidays and um yeah it's you know something it really is in support of our own internal product roadmap like i think it's great it's like it's a very heavy like incentive layer for this sort of development and um while we're building space doodles for example like you know four or five doodle bank projects will ship like that's yeah yeah it's it's it's awesome and so as part of this whole conversation decentralization centralization and um you talk i think you reference noodles like a derivative project and and you know thinking about all this is obviously the question of of licensing and i think my understanding of the doodle's license is basically you you obviously own your own particular doodle and you can commercialize it up to a hundred thousand dollars but if you you know build a million dollar brand or want to build a million dollar brand out of your doodle that's sort of off the table and that's that's where you guys are more centralized is that am i properly reading what your the terms are and what you own when you buy a doodle yeah that it's exactly that there's no promise for any future you know tokens any future yields stake in whatever the revenue is generated by doodles uh the corporation but like the reason for that license is because we were learning a lot from board apes at the time on how people are going to use this very permissive or their very permissive license yeah and we feel like we can always give more but we cannot like add more restrictions to it yeah so we started off way exactly exactly so like the whole hundred thousand thing like you know we forked nifty license and we created the nifty license while we're at cryptokitties and we felt like you know rather than say this is the the license forever like let's use this as a starting point let's see what ideas are coming from some of the collectors that want to you know make more than a hundred thousand want to invest more than that much money into building out their doodles brand um and let's kind of craft it from there so like we're like super open to you know extending the license we're super open to cross licensing we just need to see more of the use cases and like actually have visibility into you know how an alien gets animated because we have great ideas too on how its head should turn or how it raises it raises its arm and we want to be able to talk to these people and like help them out at the at the end of at the end of the day um so yeah it's a it's a jump off point for sure um and we're looking at um creating like a you know first pass at what that extended license could look like i think it's smart i agree i think i think that's how meebitz is i think it's commercialization up to like a hundred thousand dollars or something and but and i think in your case probably more so than larval labs like there's an there's a open line of communication there where i think if you know you wanted to somebody wants to build a bigger business i think you're saying you guys are open to having that conversation but starting starting a little bit more restricted uh okay i wanna do maybe call it a lightning round or just a couple kind of ending questions that are probably not actually lightning quick but you know it kind of boom through them hopefully um i'm curious where you think the space is going in from a chain perspective if you're super bullish on l2s obviously your partners and ex you know ex-colleagues are built flow and you talk about a fiat on-ramp you know they're doing that uh what do you think is the future of of the space from a chain perspective oh gosh um i'm like lightning round now here's the biggest philosophical question about ethereum have you read vitalik's post about multi-chain i have no i've i've heard sort of summaries but i have not read it myself okay yeah i've heard summaries too i've always thought like the future is multi-chain multi multi-wallet i think some chains are going to be better than others at you know certain things um i feel like right now you know it's super fragmented people are competing for market share chains are still trying to find their use cases and not go down um i think that ethereum will exist as a settlement layer for very important things you know in perpetuity like i also think that it's highly inaccessible right now like to me like i just ethereum is a chain for people with some money like or a lot of money like that that's just how i see it i think um in the next year or two i think another you know another chain might actually come up as a competitor for entertainment for nfts um do you have a hypothesis as to which one is there a specific one you have in mind ah i don't i don't actually i don't i just i think it's ripe though i think it's ripe for the taking um i mean i've been waiting for proof of um proof of steak or eth2 for like four years now so like i i don't know this year right we're getting it right it's so funny because like because i think i made i made a joke like that when i first joined after labs to dieter who's the architect of flow i was like are you sure it's this year like or something like that and here we are four years later yeah not a dig like i love ethereum like i'm very much like planning to build almost everything on ethereum because you know doodle is worth so much right now it makes sense um but yeah i just want to see how they ship faster and kind of solve that problem if they can't i think another chain is going to come to market or take more market share from away from them are there other projects you're eyeing right now or drawing inspiration from or are you still like a traitor of nfts or are you like so heads down on doodles do you really don't have time so i don't dj anymore i mean earlier this year i used to degen with evan he goes by tulip my co-founder and like since starting work on doodles like i just stopped entirely but i am looking at like some of the hand-drawn nft collections from artists like you know like low volume like a thousand two thousand et cetera um i've been looking into that and just really really reading more about like their stories and actually meeting up with some of the artists in person and like hanging out with them and yeah so i'm kind of like bullish on like i'm not going to say names because i don't pump backs i don't want to actually own it don't want to move markets too hard yeah yeah um just just finding art that resonates with me and learning more about you know the artists and their stories like that's that's been my jam lately and also to like the random nfts that are trying something innovative and new from like a smart contract or technical perspective like they're i'm not going to say the project name but there was one nft project that i like fell in love with in my little circle of friends of like 15 people since 2017 like i've been trying to shill it to them and nobody listened or cared and it was only until like one of the recent events to where i found out that one of my closest friends launched it as an anon project and like everyone thought that something happened to the dev because like the money is still on the smart contract it hasn't moved the dev disappeared and the dev came out of nowhere too and i was like like opening up to them like man like i'm actually kind of worried that something happened to them because i checked the contract the money's still there blah blah blah and they told me like i hate to break it to you but that's actually my project oh my god wait and you won't tell us anything more about it i can't i can't i think i think i'm the only person that knows this uh wow oh but like what what uh what validation that like you have you know your right group you know like that you guys admire each other's work you know obviously like like it's proof you really do uh you do hang with with the right people for you uh okay last question do you have uh like one main big piece of advice you give to new people in this space coming up either as investors or as folks who want to launch a project i'm sure you get asked that all the time but like everybody wants the success of something like a doodles what's your what's your big piece of advice oh um okay so for me when i my my own um i guess heuristics for assessing out a project that's going to be completely different than anyone else's i feel but like i really just look at the road map i just look at how many buzzwords they're using how feasible it is in my head based on my experience you know adapter labs with doodles etc and i can just like get when there's just over promises like and so the inverse of that is like definitely um from a project creator perspective like any single word that you say will be read between the lines people will hold you to it nothing ever escapes the internet and there will always be that one user that truthfully believes it or just believes a stretch of whatever it is that you said that does not make any sense so just being cognizant of that because like everyone has different circumstances and you know we're dealing with real money at the end of the day so it's like be very careful with what you say and i learned these hard lessons that cryptokitties like alan is kind of reinforced um falcon is reinforced into me like words do matter like the difference between this word and that word can mean something entirely different from a collector's perspective and they have like a pretty significant stake vested stake in the project too so um but from like a a degen or collector's perspective like everyone says this all the time like team art community but like breaking down you know team just really look at like experience and you know one of the hardest questions to ask somebody who's a project creator is like where do you see this in five years ten years and as a project creator like who's trying to bring on advisors or you know managers partners etc ask them where do you see us in five years 10 years and if they don't have that you know that vision maybe that's something of concern but it also doesn't apply to everything too because like you know like nate alex's projects a lot of them are just one-off experience experiments um so really just understanding what the creator's vision is and then you know going going from there well i love it this has been awesome i honestly wish we had like another two hours to go but i i want to be respectful of of your time and i just cannot tell you how much i appreciate this i really like

grateful to you so thank you for being here thank you so much for having me carly this is great i had fun too i'm like okay good well and uh you know i'll hopefully see you in texas for some south by southwest i know doodles has big things planned so uh would love to to pop by and maybe we'll we'll have we'll get to meet irl for sure for sure cool thank you so much thanks poopy [Music] hey we hope
