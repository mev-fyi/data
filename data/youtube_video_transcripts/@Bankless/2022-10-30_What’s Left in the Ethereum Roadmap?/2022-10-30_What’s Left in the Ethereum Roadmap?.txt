now ether is ultrasound but I don't think that story ends here what's left in the road map for ether the asset right I think a big one is going to be scalability in my opinion we're gonna over the next decade go from 10 transactions a second to 10 million transactions per second so that's going to do a couple things like one is that it's going to dramatically decrease the per transaction fee that's pretty obvious but there's this other maybe less obvious thing is that it's just going to create much more value and there's this notion of induced demand as you improve things ethereum will be providing more and more utility and therefore in Aggregates when you take all the transaction fees together if the historical Trend continues we'll be in a position where a firm is able to capture a lot of that value and therefore become more useful with app developers because that means more Economic Security and more connect bandwidth
