visa bought a crypto punk nfts are mooning crypto regulation is a big deal it's time to rally around a game plan liquidity and memes are the key tools to succeed in the metaverse all of this and much more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the headlines and important narratives from around bankless this week uh as always there are going to be links down in the show notes for you to do a deeper dive into any of these topics before we get going i want to quickly shout out tracer dao which just dropped its light paper over the weekend they're building decentralized derivatives products and are kicking things off this month with perpetual pools read the light paper to learn more and it looks like the world of d5 derivatives is just getting started to kick things off ryan selkis came on the podcast this week to talk about regulation and this conversation pairs really well with last week's episode with jake travinsky because you get to see two different but equally valid approaches to the crypto lobby uh these two episodes really feel like a good cop bad cop routine jake is the good cop he's disarming sharp friendly and knows how to play the game and as bad cop ryan brings an intensity that can rally the troops and play hardball and the big takeaway of all of this is that now is the time to start caring crypto has the resources brain power and conviction to play offense uh so it's time for us to get out in front of it and start dictating the pace of some of this and the big question here is whether america's two-party system is equipped to handle the biggest problems heading our way in the next couple decades if it is i think jake travinsky is a name you'll be hearing a lot and if it isn't i'm gonna let ryan tell me what to do for many decades now we've had a two-party system that is really just one big government party with different policy goals libertarians lose elections because they always say vote for me i'll do less work and it's probably what we need but it's not a very good message because people want to know i'm going to vote for someone powerful they're going to advance my agenda they're going to advance my interest well i'm going to get this this and this from from this political leader and really what we need is is just you know a greater degree of of decentralization that's where crypto has been pretty powerful if you think about crypto basically being like an opt-out political movement in many respects it's a way to play that thesis proactively and i think that's pretty powerful because it's techno progressives um and it's you know classical liberals and and it's like all the libertarians molded into one but playing offense instead of just defense and and basically saying you know what we're all screwed what i like most of that these two approaches are compatible and this part of crypto's narrative is just getting started so visa bought a crypto punk which is an absolutely insane headline and i think big money institutions see something legit in cryptoculture and they're here to play ball this could also just be a 150 000 marketing campaign probably a little bit of both uh either way that bet is paying off as the floor for crypto punks at least doubled in the last week and we've seen that kind of energy across the entire nft space this week we had deez and andy come on the state of the nation and shed a ton of light on the things driving the nft mania it's memetic desire it's a creative revolution it's setting precedence for what the metaverse looks and feels like it's probably the dawn of a cultural renaissance and it's also raw speculation on scarce pictures if you want to play this game do your homework know what you're good at and get things that you like i don't have a collector's mindset so i am enjoying this from the sidelines and cheering for the people who are in this for the right reasons so godspeed to the nft bulls i think about the most valuable artwork that trades in the real world right now or the most valuable trading cards and all that stuff and think about how incredibly inefficient those markets are and how the amount of middlemen that are taking up a ton of time and money and effort and like to me it just makes logical sense that all of the really high-end things that are going to happen in nfts are just going to like the orders of magnitude larger than what's happening in like in like the current real real world art markets because it's just it's 24 7. it's completely global there's no barrier to entry unless obviously you have to have the money to do it um and so i think that all those things combined it's creating this really intense necessarily like land grab for the really high-end stuff we also did a tactic on the fractional protocol which splits nfts into a bunch of pieces and allows for shared ownership of these tokens this is an immediate level up for the space and it makes nfts far more widely accessible by giving them more utility and liquidity and making them more affordable speaking of liquidity we covered liquidity protocol tokamak this week with founder carson cook aka liquidity wizard aka cosmic brain if you can't tell tokamak has memes but tokamak is also working to build a key primitive in d5 which is the liquidity layer tokamaki answers a simple question where do we put our capital well we should put it where it's going to be the most productive this is already happening to a degree in d5 but if you're a yield farmer or liquidity provider you know that it's not optimally efficient there's chaos things are raw disordered it's a mercenary economy it's been described in this week's article tokamak aims to turn that chaotic energy into efficiency by aligning the incentives of stakeholders and shareholders that is one side provides capital the other side decides where it goes such that when liquidity goes to a productive place everybody wins over time the the utility or the value of of uh toca is not just that it's tokenized liquidity but also that it's backed by this sort of growing black hole of assets and internally we talk about the moment of the singularity which is when that grows big enough to where you actually don't need third-party lps so eventually you you can actually have the system have all the self-contained assets it needs to basically run itself it's still governed by the toka the token holders and they're still routing this uh liquidity utility uh and directing it basically with uh with their toca but at that point you don't need third-party uh lps and you can do really really interesting things and eventually that should mean spreads can go to zero or near zero and that's when this thing really starts to uh approximate uh sort of a broadband moment and bandwidth tokamak is definitely a newer project and there's a lot of building to be done but their goal is a salient one and they've definitely gotten off to a good start uh liquidity is the blood of an economy and efficiently moving capital to where it needs to go is vital to the health and resilience of that ecosystem also layer 0 is a new podcast coming out of the bankless ecosystem focusing on the human side of ethereum and d5 and crypto and the first guest last week was dimitri biederin the founder of vitalik who's the founder of ethereum and dimitri's a really deep thinker to say the least and there's a lot of amusing on heavy topics like consciousness and communism in ethereum it's like yeah you know we have people with all kinds of values and desires and tendencies but then still our foundational thing is like you know how can we still understand and accept them right and for me it's a very important aspect of also what being a human is being a human and our compassion towards ourselves doing toward all the sides that we don't might not like in ourselves like oh i should not be this impulsive or it should be you know more kind of whatever it is right but well i am what i am right can i as a community as we can we don't have to deny all these different people with different opinions and somewhat different values but as long as like there is a hierarchy if you will right and again they're at the very low level of this hierarchy is this openness inclusiveness right and for me that's really kind of the most important aspect of ethereum community and thinking through the big questions is always a good reminder of why we're here in the first place nobody has all the answers but leading with virtues like kindness empathy and mindfulness will definitely point you in the right direction the next episode with eric connor comes out on tuesday and it's a good one for my final thought this week i'm gonna pull from our article the holy trinity for adoption the idea here is that there are three main things that drive adoption of new technology three things that are required to change society at a fundamental level this is technology liquidity and memes when you're trying to understand deep socioeconomic change well you have memes on the social side and tech and liquidity on the economic side and i think you can reduce tech and liquidity even more to just capital efficiency when you're trying to understand the world see where the memes are and where the capital efficiency is when something has both of those things it can become an unstoppable force for change if it only has memes it's a hype phenomenon and probably doesn't have staying power and if it only has capital efficiency uh well then it won't reach layer zero the human side of things memes and capital efficiency don't exist in a vacuum and they're definitely codependent on each other and this was a really cool article and my final thought is to seek out memes and seek out capital efficiency to understand where the market is going and more broadly where society is going so with that none of this is financial advice eth is risky defi is risky but we're headed west it's the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us here on the bengals journey and before we go i want to quickly shout out our sponsors arbitram matcha ledger and unisplop it's cool to
