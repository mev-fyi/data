we're not live streaming now are we uh we're about to be i hit the button okay okay now we're now we're live streaming on periscope youtube usually takes it okay here it comes all right new link um ryan say something hey it's ryan we look forward to starting this can anyone verify that was it that was it funny should we wait for should we should we give a few minutes for people to scuttle in here let's hang out let's hang out with gary while people figure out what we just did all right um do you have a link you guys have the link that you can share with me and you're you're sure this one's uh working there david yeah spam it out yeah perfect you just give this go ahead david yeah we got a hundred people in the chat so i guess we can go ahead and get started for the first time thank you everyone for bearing with us turns out i just you know restart my computer and things fixed it's the best fix ever but also the most frustrating but now we are here ready to go already got 200 people back into the chat if you know someone who uh was in the chat and is no longer in the in the youtube stream uh go ping them tell them we finally got things fixed usually we're not usually we're more tech savvy than this but uh today the gods were not on our side until now um but now we are back with everyone so ryan shall we uh get started again we shall and you know that's a great intro david because i feel like we've got somebody on our side on the side of crypto and that is garyvee we're going to be talking about crypto nfts a surprise launch that is v friends it's super cool we want to tell you all about it before we begin we want to just give a shout out to our fantastic sponsors these are d5 protocols crypto protocols themselves uniswap gemini uh quenta and metamask find links to them in the show notes garyvee of course is a serial entrepreneur you know him you love him he is a podcaster nft aficionado an educator a community builder and now he is debuting a brand new nft platform that we're going to talk about uh we're told he was just on bloomberg actually just doing an interview so we're going from bloomberg bankless gary how do you feel about that transition man i think it's the story of my life uh you know uh i think you know the emerging is going to be the theme of this conversation and let there be no confusion for anybody who's watching bankless nation these men are on their way to doing the bloomberg things uh i have been lucky enough to be aware of what you guys have been up to so i was honored to be asked to be on and i'm extremely excited to chat with you i i'm very aware of the strength and education and oh genius of your audience the newsletter uh i'm i'm just honored to be here thank you for having me look man we're honored to have you because this is all about communities doing the old like emoji handshake with with each other and you've been a big proponent of uh nfts for a while we want to talk about how um how you got into that at first but before we do guys i just want you to know bankless nation that gary v is single-handedly responsible for onboarding thousands i'm not sure tens of thousands maybe more to technologies like metamask to ethereum addresses to getting them on board in the nft space and this whole movement is about onboarding people into crypto so gary dude thanks for what you're doing i appreciate that and you know it's funny i have a very broad audience um and when i started telling some of my inner circle of what i was building here with v friends um when and especially with top shot you know success and with all the things that are going on when they heard that i wasn't going to do fiat they were surprised because i'm a big fan you know this was a little bit of a contradiction i'm a big fan of do not create friction for the consumer here yeah on the flip side you know i i've got more great haters than you youngsters i remember really trying to teach people that putting a credit card into a website in 1997 for winelibrary.com was not going to be the worst thing in the world and their identity wouldn't be stolen forever i remember telling parents and friends that it was okay to have a social media account that your you know daughter wasn't gonna get kidnapped at the mall if she had my space and so i have a lot of compassion for the psychology of human beings around new technologies and i'm one of the most important parts of this project by a country mile for me was to give back to the ogs that have been playing in the nft space from 17 to now and i thought one of the more significant ways i could do is through my strength around education i've spent months now educating people on what a non-custodial wallet is teaching them to never give up those 12 words to anybody i will never ask you for them i will never ask you from aetherium you know like i will never ask you for your metamask password teaching them what a rainbow wallet is if they wanted to see cool versus you know like and it's been a great joy by the way it's been a fun one for me because i myself am going through an education journey right learning different chains learning you know proof of work proof of stake you know custodial not custodial like it's been an incredible journey because over the next several months i'm sure drock and i will start showing tons of content of me in 2017 and 18 talking about ethereum i've been watching i just don't like to talk about things i don't know i've been doing a lot of press like you said everyone's asking me about doge i'm like me and aj got a lot of it the first day came out years ago we lost it because it was that way back then and that's all i really know other than i know why it's happening human beings getting behind a mission but you know for me the ethereum thing on chain i mean i built this with the nfl t42 guys like og on chain jim you know like it's very important to me to be authentic and um and i i i'm excited to see some of the tweets from people this morning or getting some discord dms that look like the following hey i thought you were charlatan i thought this was going to be a piece of i can't believe how many people are learning what a meta mask is this is good for all of us thanks for showing celebrities and i always reply i'm not a celebrity but thanks for showing celebrities that there's a meaningful way to do this not hire a digital artist and put your face on it and just sell a bunch of and you know this was a very ambitious project for me a i want this to be my harry potter my pokemon my smurfs like this is a very big ambition for me i will spend the rest of my life building this intellectual property b i wanted people to get educated on what the smart contract can do i have 555 gift goats you buy this token it's a rare token in my world but it's also a token that allows you to put your address in it and literally get a gift from me randomly six times minimally a year over three years when that first gift blows people's brains out of their head i have a funny feeling the market's gonna adjust and obviously the underlining conference the super conference v con that i'm gonna put on once a year over the next three years when i throw that first conference and the keynote speakers and performances are some of the biggest names in the world i have a funny feeling the token owner has the ability to decide what they want to do in 2023 right uh so you know i've given this a lot of thought um and i'm very excited to be in the space at this level look and for for the crypto natives watching those who are familiar with with bankless like two things to me that scream legitimacy about what what gary's what gary's doing is one the ethereum address you're holding these on chain in an ethereum address so use meta mask use you know whatever crypto wallet you have by the way on the record i'll predict it right now because i know what i'm going to do so i want to give some bankless exclusive he actually just walked in watch this you want a real bankless moment i want a real bankless moment watch this i'm doing the interview people i'm doing an interview people but oh what's up hey people 69 million brother can you can you please tell these people that i begged you to keep all the ethereum can you just tell that i'm live can you i'll come with you in a minute but can you please tell them the truth that i did say to you how much i wanted you to keep the ethereum is that true people did you keep a little you got to keep some distinctions this is the most important artist of our generation look how handsome he is okay all right let me get back to my interview i'll be right there it's great to see you guys i'll be right there love you pal um yeah i mean i i believe in it i don't know what else to tell you what do you want from me there's a the other thing is like you you actually purchase the the nfts with eth as a reserve asset right so one thing we talk about yeah it's eth it's all youth good david yeah so there's a there's gonna be two audiences i think watching this live stream there's going to be the the gary fee uh friends and family right like your your community your your clan and then there's gonna be like the crypto natives who i think have kind of been have gotten some nft exhaustion and they are they're they're and i think they might come into this uh being a little bit skeptical it's like oh just like another celebrity another nft and i want the the crypto natives to suspend their disbelief because ryan and i got a little bit of a sneak peek of what's uh going on with with v friends and uh it's it's it's not just another you know here's my nfts like and here they are this is a a brand commitment it sounds like and gary it sounds like you have very strong both opinions and convictions about the future of nfts and it seems to be that you're putting a ton of your weight behind this particular your this this new nft ecosystem behind that and so but before we go into uh specifically uh the the v friends ecosystem i want to ask you a question as to why you think why you think the nfts are this brand new revolution that they are why are they so powerful and why are you leading this charge into nfts um i may be leading new eyeballs into it but the you know the larva is roham with kitties before top shot there's so many real ogs that have led us here i i think a guy like me represents a different thing which is the next moment right because it's happening with me currently in vr i'm spending a lot of time looking at what's going on in the oculus ecosystem and the metaverse and things that nature but it's i at least the way i move need it to be like on the precipice of mainstream david the reason is because it's time it's just time you know like it's time like it enough there's enough smoke people are getting enough comfort with it right top shot deserves a ton of credit um sports cards deserve a lot of credit you know just people getting caught up into alternative investment reddit doge bitcoin i mean and let me go another place how about fortnite you know i'm in the business of helping people understand things telling parents i win all of my nft debates with 55 year old parents that are friends and acquaintances in four minutes here's what it looks like do you want a blue check mark on instagram yeah i'm like does that actually exist that's just a little blue checkmark why do you want that because it's social currency wow and then i go oh by the way so that's one but let me put the finishing touch on you did you give your kid 50 bucks on your credit card this week to buy a fortnite skin yes why he doesn't own that outfit digital assets so my big play let me tell you when i went bananas and why my brain decided to tell me oh my god everyone's going to have a public digital wallet socials going private crypto's going public and this is east thing oh my god unlike the internet and web 2.0 there's an internet at scale now supporting communication around the blockchain oh my god oh my god oh my god and and and then it was 500 hours of larva labs crypto punks why you know pepe on bitcoin um discords reading listening ogs on chain gas non-custodial education education education you know i'm a i'm a hyper dude so what when what ends up happening one of the reasons your audience here is like i actually understand i'm also empathetic i understand that they might think i'm full of because my energy can come off that way i'm a jersey east coast i'm like you know what you know some people aren't able to see my they don't know me they don't know my humanity they don't they see my energy they don't see the words out of my mouth they don't hear me say 98 of nft projects are going to be a bad investment during this era they don't hear that they they feel this so they think i'm saying it's insane to me i'm saying way more conservative things than people that are that people think are conservative but it's still it's you know it's the way i say it that will throw them and by the way i'm gonna stay me i'm comfortable being me you know i have the receipts and so i'm uh i'm excited about this and i think the reason is just timing men you knew others knew they were right like and by the way vr is gonna happen like let's take it to the bank there's no reason this is all you know this is all a precursor to that totally is i mean ready come on it's on its way i hope that i can stay healthy enough to see some of that crazy i hope i see something in 40 years that does confuse me because right now this has not confused me all right gary we're gonna get into the friends like last thing before we do this so we had blau on the podcast um you know great grammy award artist and he talked about nft is giving him the ability to connect directly to his community in a way that he's never had so previously it was you have to go through middlemen you have to go through record labels but this is a direct connection to the community can you talk about that is that some of the power that's being harnessed in what you're doing and is that powerful for other creators other communities out there yeah and and by the way let there be no confusion you can you can be connected to your audience without nfts you can just call them and they can come over like you know wow's the best but like you know i'm like incredibly you know selfless i have an incredible you know mother and luck of the dna of who i am as a dude but this is an economic aspect to those artists as well you know you know blau is talking about two things one not having a dopey record label telling him he can't put that song out or this is when we have to release because we have this other artist so that's huge control but it's also economic value i mean this is an incredibly one of the biggest reasons with my project i made a conference was i didn't want it to be a just about me but there was there's obviously many tokens in there that aren't just about me and so yeah it's a structured economy around the most valuable asset in the world which is time and access do you know how much money i'm going to pay for the novak djokovic golden racket nfc how much are you going to pay 100k because i've done well in my life and i want to play tennis with novak you know the week before the us opened in new york and have dinner with him and if that's what comes along in the smart contract but then stick with me men but then is novak gonna do what i did which creates a multi this is where i really think i innovated a multi-year level and then i can do something with that token i can go back seasons seasons which gives you assets or even if it doesn't if it's a one-time which i think will be the far majority well guess what novak snowback and if that's his first ever golden racket well why can't that be like this 150 thundercat behind me why can't my one i pay a hundred thousand for that experience and in 19 years i sell that golden racket as a collectible derivative for you know 300 000. or by the way 18 000. let me tell you something about me that always always confused people and i think it's now going to end up being my biggest strength i have been garage sailing for years i have like literally you're talking literal garage sailing right have you seen trash talk my five episode youtube thing it is yeah so i learned a lot about pop culture i bought this at a garage sale for a dollar i learned a lot much more my fancy friends make fun of me they think i'm too dirty i like the dirt right to me this is the dirt this is the emerging with bloomberg right so oh it's definitely i mean we're not mainstream at all yet and so and so for me what's really exciting is you know what i learned about garage saleing is that i would argue that garage sale memorabilia purchasing is a hidden trillion dollar industry what i'll explain i go to garage sales i look for nostalgia 80s toys and i pay 31 for this action figure but i watch another lady buy key chains that say iowa on it and marbles and old atlantia the reason nfts are so powerful is every business and every person is going to issue an nft for everything because they should it's going to be functional as the ticket or the thing it's also then going to be a derivative marketing material because it's going to be in your public wallet and it's going to show people affinities and social uh expression and then finally it's an asset so if i throw a music concert and as a or a little i play a little club as a comedian and my ticket and i'd go on to become kevin hart and now that ticket is selling for 97 because it was my first stand-up appearance in philadelphia that i'm making 9.70 on the 10 royalty every single time in perpetuity are you kidding me dude this is what's so exciting man because like people don't understand this isn't just digital collectibles this is not just a jpeg that you're selling for like millions of dollars we're talking about programmable digital collectibles you can program access you can program experiences into these things at some level with like cryptokitties and that sort of thing is cool but that's only like generation one this is where i want to get into like v friends gary so let's pull this up because i think you've embedded some of these ideas in like a another iteration of what a an nft can be and the first thing you've got here is sort of different types under v friends of of tokens admission tokens gift tokens access tokens just tell us about v friends and tell us about this organization what you get beyond just buying the nft on chain uh first and foremost i'm going to say it again because literally yesterday it was all about the art and now today that i put out the information everyone's like but what happens after three years is it worthless i'm like yesterday you were talking about the art being like people are very very very funny uh okay admission tokens remember the other thing i launched if you go to vfriends.com right now uh hopefully we'll launch the auction very quickly here i'm gonna give plenty of hours but if you go to it well and i appreciate you pulling up this is fun um as you can see when you go to it and you don't need to play this if you scroll down you know right there vcon let's click that first so every token is a token to this super conference i'm going to put on every year so the admission tokens are admission to this conference all of the tokens are i'm even going to clean up i was just looking at what you were sharing on the screen the framework of the tokens so coachella meets south by southwest meets davos i'm trying to throw the best conference in the world and if i do that in year one well what do you think's gonna happen ryan and the only way you can get it is v tokens dude it just gets better right it gets more valuable it gets better if you go back my favorite one just you know i think we're all allowed opinions is mine that's why i did 555 my favorite number five is gift code because i'm gonna have fun with it this token gives you a ticket to the conference but drock let's make sure this shows an admission to the token because i wanna make sure everybody knows all ten two two five five so this also gets you into the conference but the 555 of these tokens also get you the ability before july on the website it's clear that we'll have this up before the first gift goes out you put your address you connect your meta mask or your custodial wallet you confirm your address and i send you surprise gifts six times a year aka 18 times over the course of this project real physical stuff you're talking about that's going to make your head spin right wait you're putting in your phys your physical address or your into your or your theory address your physical david or your p.o box because a lot of people so you david buy a gift goat right so you buy it for 15. real money cute guys thank you i drew everyone um because i probably you know again i am providence right big part of of this so i wanted to draw it i didn't rent out a digital artist like a bunch of influencers or celebrities would this is all me um anyway nonetheless um gift goat and that comes with um those gifts but david as you can imagine what do you think is gonna happen with the 555 people that get the first one get it in the mail or in their driveway social baby instagram twitter what do you think starts happening and then finally 300 access tokens the big ones 210 of them are virtual a 125 of them are hangout hawks i think you can scroll down very cool here's these are the access ones this is cool well yeah those are google hangout group of 125 people right there on the right that's virtual access the other are literally a 10-person dinner i do once every three years with all the 10 people that own dinner deer physically my time the biggest thing i've got so all of you can't get i always like to remind people this is time is literally the world's most scarce resource that no one can ever get back and so correct the the value of garyvee's time is being instantiated in dinner deer or hangout rock that's right and i built this with the i used to think like what if randy the macho man savage did this what you know and was still alive i would buy it immediately oh for sure now the other thing i did hear ryan though was i created the economy because it's not a one-year thing so again you buy a facetime fox on the ipo on the launch tonight tomorrow hopefully we'll get it you get the ticket to the conference you get a five minute facetime with me we execute the facetime on chain ryan and david it shows that it's been punched we did a lot of innovation so it shows that there's two more in the future you come along and you go on open c forget about friends.com and you see it and it says this comes with a five minute facetime of gary's with gary 101 and it's you know like so like there's this incredible layer and then if you keep scrolling down it gets really crazy these are crazy if you go back up i apologize like podcast panther you buy that token i become a guest of your podcast what ryan yeah we don't even you're doing it and we don't even have one gary i'm listening listen i'll continue to be a kind generous human being but but some people are gonna be smart enough to be like okay wait garyvee's trying for the rest of his life to build ip so i'm gonna i'm starting a new podcast i'm gonna get him on my podcast but i'm gonna keep the token even after it's been punched even after the second time because i'll have him two years in a row and then he go if he pulls it off well my token becomes an art and collectible this is a random guys a very random thundercat it is a hundred fifty dollars on ebay all day if i'm able this is my rookie cards this is my first this is it this is it do you know where you want to get we might have to get a uh a podcast card yeah for sure podcast panther yeah and like what's lunch with you worth david i want to figure that out man oh no i'm not sure i'm ready to understand that you know how um warren buffett every year gary he like he does this right something where he he auctions off a lunch with him for charity i think people in the crypto um space have purchased that from one year or another this is like that yeah like experiences with warren are worth 5 million 10 million 15 million this is like that except scaled correct i mean wait to athletes and musicians figure this out and i can go in studio with post malone i'm going to do that become friends with post and then i'm going to have the collectible and in 12 years potentially sell for a profit yeah that's hot i don't think i don't think people realize where this is going you know what kino koala does if you scroll up kino koala literally literally is a key is a ticket to travel to any public keynote i give and get a vip uh seat and get green room access to me you want to treat me like the grateful dead and fish let's go you can i mean that's it's different it's very different poker pirate you and three friends get a poker night with me being the fourth or the fifth like it's just amazing i'm really excited about it mainly because i'm trying to inspire people that i want to buy these from to not do nfts and gouge people and stop already yeah these have something backing them like so let's talk about this not only does it have the experience backing it it's i am trying to build gi joe what do you mean by that i mean i've spent the last 12 years building garyvee i'm gary vaynerchuk i'm not gary vee i have been the strategist the creative director the chief executive officer of building it's not that i'm faking garyvee that's just how people know me they don't know me they know me through snippets of content that's like nothing of actually me i've been the chief architect of that and i think i've done it as well as you can do it in the last 10 years i've done it way up there especially when you consider i've also built a 300 million a year agency as my actual job i've done this as my side hustle my building up patient panda my building these facetime characters i'm just going to visit them on the spot i could go and make the deal with samsung and have these characters represent the facetime button i could i don't know if they'd have me but i'm going to try like i'm going to build this intellectual property right like so yes it has something underneath it it has a human being who has an incredible track record having the ambition to build a literal intellectual property that why in the world wouldn't i aim for marvel or barney or gi joe yeah i may fall short but i promise you this i'm gonna fall a lot further along than any other person with the real audience you know i i want to talk all about how you've built this community up because i think that's so important but before we do we're getting a ton of people on on youtube just asking about the mechanics of this they're like i want i want a keynote koala how do i buy one so tell us about that is there's some sort of a batch auction process going on right now or coming soon yep hopefully tonight maybe early tomorrow my intuition says probably early tomorrow but we'll see i'm literally going to hang up from here and get to qa and working the site um i'm going to do pro probably a 10-day event in launching these probably gonna put out 25 percent on the for day one and day two and i'm going to do a dutch auction i know that there's a lot of people i have a lot of goodwill with that have a lot of money and i was scared they were gonna buy everybody out and create derivatives second you see what's going on with the good projects in nft land so i did a dutch auction first and foremost i capped it um i also only released 25 on day one and so i'm gonna batch them out that's awesome and when's that coming asap asap i'd love i'd love for it to be tonight or tomorrow morning gary i gotta ask you so what's the sale platform i built my own custom platform with the team at nft42 that's why by the way if i was will if i was doing this on wearable or openc or bitsky or some of these great places this would have been launched already we're doing a lot of innovation here with the multi-year with the you know the the website you know gift goat is not so easy to execute on wearable yeah i've gotta you know like i've had to build my own platform right can you comment on how you've uh tried to work around any like gas issues is this is this going to be done in like a kind of an off chain uh just kind of centralized website and then it delivers on chain how does that work it's it's on chain okay you know um i i wanted to go og i love the immutable guys i love what's going on with a lot of the level two stuff i love what's going on with a lot of other chains you know i like learning this i again i think people get a little more aha as they start seeing my content drip over the next couple of months where i'm like ethereum ethereum ethereum this has been something i've been watching and i'm very ambitious about future forks and other aspects but yeah i mean it's gonna cost me a little bit here on the minting this from the gas standpoint and there's going to be a little bit of that big when people purchase so this is cool it's going to cost you and yet you are pricing these things out in eth so eth is the reserve currency for this we just saw beeple uh here earlier and of course he he got some eth uh and he uh he he sold a lot of that i'm hopeful that he kept some of it gary what are your plans man are you gonna are you gonna hold some eath or are you gonna sell some fiat to fund all of this or what are you doing there so obviously there's a tax event so you have to sell some eth because you can get murdered i mean i'm not in control of eats pricing i'm really not interested in the tax bill if he collapses you know that's that you know i don't want to go out of business on just what i'm getting going so yes i'll be thoughtful on the tax part of that then i have some real expenses because i'm looking to throw ridiculous conferences and i've got gift goats and you know i've got things to do that to be frank with you i'm going to try to find vendors that are interested in taking eath because i think they'd be smart too and then for me personally i'm going to keep eat you know maybe you know who knows some you know you know i may need to do something in my life i might have to do an investment but like i'm i'm enthusiastic about ethan you know i'm not uh i'm not worried about how hot it's been the last two weeks you know whether it's three thousand thirty five hundred two thousand twelve hundred i need to see something to stop me from being optimistic about it that's how i work so are all of these i still have by the way i still haven't sold a share of facebook that i bought in 2007. uh share yep because i need to see something mark resigning right but all the hoopla around politics hasn't stopped me oculus oculus if facebook ink wins oculus what instagram is the most powerful social network in the world i work with the biggest brands in the world i see how much money they spend on you know advertising and how it's shifting like i use my brain not my ideological overreaction to a headline right on and you had to not have that ideological reaction in order to see crypto in the first place because there's a lot of like you know crypto is a scam this will never work digital scarcity these these are just jpegs on chain they're not worth what they're worth you have to see past that in order to see this opportunity and david i think gary is uh talking a little never sell gang here a little bit like you yeah hoddle man and hodlin then steak and so gary i'm i'm curious though like so zooming out for a second obviously you're bullish on digital scarcity everything with nfts what's your take on uh defy in general or like crypto currencies in general i don't love talking about stuff i don't know i i bought bitcoin in 14 i i did a little chatting in the bitcoin peter some great uh podcast pop like i my big thing is bitcoin's so big if you're like this is the currency that gets into sovereign nation talk which has always been the big heady thing but i'm not you know paying attention to litecoin you know i'm i'm very good at having a pulse i can i can speak to litecoin having a moment last night but i don't know what's going on there i know what's going on with doge but i don't really know what's going on meaning i know why the human psychology is happening but i don't know the details i've spent my time on eth because i understood that people were going to build on top of it and i unders and and for me the second eth really crossed the chasm into social currency aka social media itself i knew that people i know people brother that's what i know i know people i'm a human anthropologist i understand them cold i'd i am not a financier i'm not going to run hardcore numbers i don't get enjoyment do you know that the far majority of the stock i own like 90 of the publicly traded company stock i own on wall street is because i invested in the company years before it went public wow it's not where my passion lies i'm not doing things to make money i'm doing things that make me super happy that happen to have the potential to make me money and so defy currency is not in my blood social communication collectibility trading i mean me bits has my brain going nuts i'm so pissed that i can't trade some of my bits right now because i have to focus on be friends launch all i want to do is go to me bits and make some trades i'm like i got the pig give me the elephant like you know like i this i understand well it's always been our bold case for ethereum is that at some point there will be something for everyone and the nft like part of ethereum that has really surged in in the last like six months has brought in a ton of attention uh there there is an unceasing amount of uh levels or requests for more details in the youtube chat and one of the questions that i briefly saw was if a if a so if somebody wants a specific v friend are they able to bid on a specific z v friend or is it more of a random randomized uh it's not like me bits it's not randomized you can my concern is this project has absolutely gained more momentum than i anticipated tokens tend to do that now um now i'm communicating and giving more i wanted to drop it like without obviously all this press i didn't want to cancel on everybody so i decided to late last night when i was like oh we're not going to launch at 8 a.m um i just wanted to launch so that there could be a little bit more fairness the more don't forget dutch dutch's upside is i'm not gonna let people get priced the hell out dutch's downside is in essence it's by it now right grab grab grab you know there's not that many characters you know there's all even the most max thing there's 40 of each of the core access to you know the the those tokens um the the problem with not the access excuse me the the uh conference tokens um the issue there is there's only 40 of them 20 of which are core right the white but there's five spectaculars gold lava bubble gum diamond right and hollow and there's only one of ones of those things so like if you're like really set on getting patient panda against a diamond background that becomes a luck of like did you grab it right and then you know what's gonna happen because what happens i was watching me bits very carefully i didn't realize it was so cool that they launched that way so it gave me a preview it's gonna you know it's gonna happen and people are gonna try to wait because there's a lot of supply at first and then there's that tipping point moment at you know mine's at three mine starts at three goes down to point five does it stop it 2.6 and then somebody already resold one open fee for five and then everybody freaks out it's gonna be fascinating to watch how it happens i have no idea gary let's talk about this i think one of the most uh the coolest things about your story and about your entire journey and this is just the next step of it is about like this this one word and to me that word is community right so many people when they start going into the nft space they do the nft first before they have the community right huge mistake other people's other people you might see sort of the celebrities jumping on the the bandwagon they try to create an nft and appeal to a community that they're not really a part of so they end up with sort of a just a crappy um illegitimate unauthentic nft and they make that mistake but like you've built this thing with the tech that's available uh to you for your community and i want to ask the broad question here which is like tell us first because the the common denominator across everything that we've been talking about is community that is the heart of it how do you build a community by giving your community more than you ask for in return wow you're mutated which is devastating yeah can you also elaborate on that it's a simple rule of thumb uh and it makes a ton of sense to give more value than you ask for how have you how you've done that by thinking about every single thing i do by never looking for a quick buck by the people that have gone at the discord that don't know me and saying are you serious what the and then 600 you guys are going to buy this and 600 people replying i can count the times that gary in the last 12 years has asked anything of me and usually it's to buy a bottle of wine or a sneaker and this is a way for me to invest in gary are you kidding me you know by being thoughtful by trying to provide value by putting out content that act guys i do you know why i haven't talked about let me give you an insight to how my brain works do you know why i haven't talked about that much about ethereum and things of that nature or other things and by the way actually while i'm on the show probably the most exciting thing for me is to look at all the other blockchains you know one of the things i'm excited about in helping people learn how to get a meta mask or you know or or portus or whatever they're gonna play with here is to me this is not even just about ethereum it's the one i'm comfortable with and i've been watching but i'm very aware of what people think about gas fees and things that nature um scalability all that you know i just wanted people to get comfortable with the game and so if they want to go you know you know polka dot flow we'll flow scott god obviously um fiat but you know like cardano and solana like you pick you do you you know you do you um but i wanted this to be authentic and and really honest to the whole ecosystem but as far as my community it's consistency i i give one of the reasons i don't i i never talk about being smart i watch all these people put out content basically talking about i'm smart my crew drock shaking his head right now pisses them off that people think i'm a motivational speaker because they're seeing the smarts in real time always constantly i don't think me saying i'm smart brings any value for my audience i'm teaching my audience perspective insights hey this is what's going on in audio this is what's going on on tick tock do you know many people are tweeting right now this second garyvee is the one that got me into nba topshop even though i never talked about it i got him into cards we talked about top shot i'm trying to bring value and by the way that is why this is going to be such a significant launch there is an ungodly amount of people that have reached out to me and my brother in the last 48 hours with stories that are mind-boggling hey gary you and your brother aj just gave me one you and your brother gave me all this time when i was an idiot kid had not no value to bring you guys were always gracious you always helped by the way i got into crypto real early in 17. i'm living in puerto rico now rest assured i'm coming in heavy tomorrow you know like that comes out of being a kind person that came out of me giving more to that kid than asking i think people are confused by my energy and my alpha and my jerseyness and my aggressive communication style i think i i think people will be stunned if they saw my word cloud they would think it's hustle and money business it is not it is empathy and kindness and patience and perspective and that you know i you know i'm happy about that and now i'm building a whole universe of characters because i know that i can't be the deliverable do you know many people are watching right now who wished their plus one their husband or wife liked me but they hate me because they hear the cursing or the aggressiveness and the reason they want plus one to like me is because they know the things i say can really be beneficial to their kid but they don't have the agreement that i'm a good guy well i'm gonna fix that because i'm gonna make patient panda a superstar in tiktok because i'm gonna turn you know uh some sort of character that talks about candor candor cat into a winning street wear brand like or i'm gonna turn you know like optimistic this you know or you know i'm just gonna do it i know exactly what i'm gonna do i know exactly what i'm going to do gary this is something we repeat so often about everyone in their life journey but in their crypto journeys long-term games with long-term people that's what you have to do in order to build a community and what's crazy here is crypto and nfts give you a whole new palette as a community creator to deliver value to your community and i you know i see that's what you're doing here hey last thing we know we got it you got to wrap it up you got things to do you got a whole product to ship my friend we're super excited about it do you want to say anything to either the bankless community or to others that are in the position that you are in that have sort of a community and uh they're they're trying to figure out what their what their strategy should be just just say something to the people now that's uh that's on your mind 50 hours of homework that's what you have to do 50 hours of homework uh you know like i just i just i'm stunned by people's fomo buying things just because 10 people on twitter said so like do not buy a single thing i talk about ever for the rest of your life until you do your 50 hours of homework there you go there's a infinite statement of mine not a damn thing i think i'm an extremely smart good businessman with an uncomfortable track record you know what those things are right there about the wrestling belt that's twitter and tumblr stock from 2006. i have receipts i know what i'm doing and even with me and everybody else that looks like me and there are many smarter and better until you do your 50 hours of homework don't do a thing there you go guys couldn't leave it in a better place than that 50 hours of homework that's what you should be doing on the crypto
