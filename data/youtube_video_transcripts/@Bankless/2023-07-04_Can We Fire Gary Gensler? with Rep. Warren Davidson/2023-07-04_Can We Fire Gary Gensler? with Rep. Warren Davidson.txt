self-custody is one of the things if they can't cancel all of crypto they want to make it account based because then they can control the companies more easily than they can control millions of individual people I think self-custody is really at the key to that bankless Nation we have an episode today with representative Warren Davidson he's an outspoken member of the US Congress and an advocate for cryptocurrency and hey it's Fourth of July in the United States Americans call this Independence Day so it's a good day to ask the question how do we gain our independence from unelected bureaucrats who want to stifle this industry who want to stifle cryptocurrency in the United States which is at its core of Freedom technology a few questions that David and I raised today to representative Warren Davidson why is Warren Davidson trying to fire Gary Gensler what is the SEC stabilization act can we stabilize this institution number three is the U.S losing ground to Europe Japan and Hong Kong how can it catch up number four does Congress care enough about crypto to do something about all of this how can we change the course is there good legislation coming forward in 2023 and 2024 and in these divisive times I feel the need to say another reminder before we get in of course even though we have a congressman on today's episode bankless is not a political podcast that divides on red blue lines we have no party Affinity in the United States or in any other Nation what we do care about though is the values of decentralization autonomy and power to the people that underlie this crypto technology and so to the extent these values are political we are also political but we don't divide on party lines we'll continue to give voice to crypto values no matter what political party they come from we've had Democrat Representatives like Richie Torres on the podcast and we've had Republicans on the podcast like representative Tom emmer and we'd Hostess Cynthia Lamas a Ted Cruz they're welcome here so is AOC and Elizabeth Warren we just want to have the conversation and for my own part I have to say I see massive value in this crypto movement for both conservative and true Progressive values so with that said we're going to get to the conversation with representative Warren Davidson but before we do we want to tell you about these tools to help you

are super excited to introduce you to his first time on the bankless podcast representative Warren Davidson he's a member of the U.S House of Representatives from the 8th congressional district of Ohio and he's been serving in Congress since 2016. you may know him most recently as the guy who created the hashtag fire Gary Gensler and proposed that SEC stabilization act representative Davidson welcome to bankless yeah thanks for having me on big fan of your podcast oh well thanks so much you know what um I'm kind of a fan of this hashtag I gotta be honest and uh want to start there it's been a frustrating year for us in the in the crypto industry uh for a lot of reasons and one of them is the intention intense pressure from unelected Regulators it seems like the US is squandering an opportunity here and it seems like Gary Gensler the leader of the SEC is the lead of the calvary there in squandering this opportunity for the United States as you can tell representative Davidson we are crypto advocates we think this technology is important for the world and uh maybe let's start here with this hashtag fire Gary Gensler seeing this come out of a member of Congress was uh interesting to us can you tell us what prompted this SEC stabilization act in your initiative here yeah I mean it's uh caught on pretty widely with the crypto Community but it's a broader range of things that Gary Gensler has done uh that highlight we don't just have um really a Gary Gensler problem I think a lot of people are paying attention to that we have a structural problem with the Securities and Exchange Commission so you know he he clearly has been bad for crypto I likened it in hearings to Hotel California a little different because you check in uh but the commonality is you can never leave people check in they stay stuck forever they go into endless Discovery uh and there's never resolution and Clarity at the end of this uh there's no escape and so that's something that this community's experienced and the other thing is while he's been super aggressive in rule making on average two per month I mean the only time that the SEC has been this aggressive in rulemaking was right after Dodd-Frank passed and that was a major overhaul of the U.S financial services space so clearly there was a need for rule making at that time time the only thing that happened here is Gary Gensler became the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and he just went on this really aggressive agenda and then he coupled that with really short comment periods sometimes as short as 15 days on rules uh and normally you know under the administrative procedures act that's like a 90-day period uh where you solicit feedback and uh I think everybody's kind of caught on Gary doesn't want any feedback he's working to front run everything but he's put all these rules out on other things but he's done nothing like that for crypto and digital assets so that's kind of the Paradox here between the two and he's done things on the one hand where he has no legal Authority like the ESG rule whether you think we should have reporting requirements for environmental social governance models for publicly traded companies or not um you know there's no underlying legislation that provides Clarity for that and he's just claimed it and the Supreme Court recently ruled the that agencies can't do that so the EPA was trying to regulate carbon whether or not we should regulate carbon there's no underlying legislation that gives the uh the Environmental Protection Agency the ability to regulate carbon they regulate air quality they regulate water quality they have authorizations for all sorts of things in laws but not carbon so they they uh had the clean power plan struck down by the Supreme Court and I think the same thing would reign in uh you know these some of these aggressive actions from Gary Gensler so um with all of that he's kind of front-run Congress where he he pretends like there is legislation for uh all the clarity that he would possibly need to regulate crypto for example um and and we're trying to pass a law right now but he's actively working to block it and you know the the enforcement mechanisms that he's used have been selective as well so the example I use is you know he reached a settlement with uh you know the cardiac Kim Kardashian for promoting an unregistered security she paid a one and a half million dollar fine what the alleged unregistered security ethereum Max had no enforcement action against that so it's been incoherent uh on that so he's front running uh you know Congress in that sense and and not providing Clarity for the market so uh he should probably uh you know lose his job for just that but the fact that he can do it and Congress can't really do much about it uh ultimately only the president can fire him is like well I don't think that's the spirit of why we have a whole commission uh so are the other Commissioners kind of redundant or irrelevant you go back to how the SEC was originally created it was created as a commission and then they gave the chairman extra powers and I think that was a mistake so you know we have less than five percent of the world's population we have almost 25 percent of the world's GDP but we have over 50 percent of the world's invested capital in capital markets so why would we want to mess that up by politicizing it uh so the the reform I've got makes it so that there's three Republican Commissioners three Democrat Commissioners and they have to work together in that sense if they want to change something you can't just have somebody uh one person come in and kind of dominate it I'd like to dive into the question of where where you think Gary's anti-crypto motivations are coming from because this is what it is very confusing to us in the in the crypto industry and maybe the the fact that Gary genzer is able to express certain desires about the crypto industry unilaterally without the whole SEC support is is part of the problem but we as like representatives of the crypto industry are like holistically confused as to why Gary is treating us in the way that he is treating us it seems to be coming from a place that is just lacking Integrity to us but then you also gave some accounts of other places that the SEC has engaged with that are outside of the crypto industry like the the EPA and environmental uh rules and regulations that perhaps tells a very similar story in in different Industries so maybe you can talk about like why why do you think Gary Gensler quote unquote you know has it out for us and maybe you could also illustrate like why you think that that um illustrates the need for the SEC stabilization Act yeah so uh I I think he does have it out for the sector I think some Regulators broadly do uh I think there's a war on crypto Barney Frank alluded to it in banking right he's like Signature Bank didn't have a solvency problem uh they had a problem with Regulators who were trying to Target the bank because they banked crypto so you see people literally being debanked because they'll do something with the space um you know there was under the Obama Administration a term for that they called it operation choke point and they're essentially rationing capital and you know this is kind of goes through Elizabeth Warren's office you'll see Gensler kind of coordinate with Elizabeth Warren a lot of the you know kind of democrat dominated uh Financial Services space really is uh tied back to Elizabeth Warren and you know motives are always hard to uh pin down uh but what we can say is it's certainly bad for the sector and it's wrong to say uh you're going to pick winners or losers on behalf of the government you should provide uh you know my view is Mark you should make markets function and you know kind of like boxing it's not boxing when they're over hugging in the corner or the ref just picks whoever he wants to raise the hand no matter how the fight went uh boxing is you break them up and you make them fight according to the rules everyone knows the rules uh and and the ref just basically makes sure that it's a competitive uh competitive fight um I think the government needs to be doing that and instead uh you know what you see is gensler's very much saying uh you're not one of us and you're not going to get there he may have done a delaying action long enough to say all right the winners we want are now in the ring and that's one of the fears as as BlackRock who's like uh you know like 500 to 1 uh ratio of getting ETFs approved uh ways in and and here says hey we want a Bitcoin ETF uh where you know others have been trying to get one for 10 plus years probably yes so you know this is this is just crazy uh you know situation so uh like I say motives are hard but the one thing about Gensler is you can't say that he doesn't understand the space people still go back and watch us MIT coursework where he was teaching classes and go oh so he actually understands it so what is the motivation he understands it very well it certainly seems apparent um so could you give us just a 101 for people who aren't familiar with political governance and in the US and sort of the the powers that each group has you know we've seen some action recently in the judicial branch in the court system of course um Gary Gensler you know reports up through the Executive Branch the Biden Administration we have with Congress and the legislators right the separation of powers uh of course Congress does not have the ability to actually fire Gary Gensler is that correct but you do have the ability to maybe pass some SEC reforms can you just share like what sort of abilities what sort of governance power each of these entities kind of have in this situation because it feels very much like Gary Gensler is over stretching his power leaning into things he shouldn't be and yet the boundaries and the borders are somewhat gray somewhat unclear uh can you just give us a sense of where the power structure is and and who has the reins here yeah that's a good point and and you'll see uh similar stresses across uh our government right now so you know the United States constitutions supposed to define the government were supposed to have and I always say we need a government small enough to fit back within the Constitution we could actually afford a government that size we have too much government it's oozing out everywhere and that's why we can't afford it uh we're going you know we have uh you know nearly record high uh revenue for the federal government uh as a percentage of GDP normally we average about 17 percent of GDP uh in taxes and fees collected and we're over 20 I mean so this is this is a peak uh the trouble is we're spending about 24 25 of GDP on a on a baseline basis net of surges like covet so structurally we have a problem uh and and most of us view it as a spending problem where is a lot of that money spent now we've grown government massively and it's kind of like an invasive species if you don't trim it back and prune it it tends to grow and choke out everything healthy and I think that's the problem with a lot of our agencies and you know the SEC is is one of them so what can Congress do um well Congress has the power of the purse so no money gets spent unless Congress does it uh in some ways the most uh problematic thing there is but we just don't fund the government you know we can't agree so there's got there are government shutdowns well that doesn't really work Congress ultimately loses that because uh everybody but the precise Target um you know needs funded we operate a government because we need a government uh but but some parts of it we could probably do without or do with it differently so it is harder to precisely Target it and we have this thing called the Holman rule where you can Target uh you know individuals or job positions and uh limit limit pay so um that may happen during the Appropriations process we have another tool that's very targeted called impeachment uh you've seen that come up and get politicized at times uh and you know people have a difference of opinion about you know when you could use impeachment uh and when you can't uh but but fundamentally it's a fancy way to say You're Fired you don't like go to jail if you get impeached but the house says you're impeached then there's a trial in the Senate and uh at least for the president it takes a two-thirds vote to remove someone uh and you know it's a healthy debate some people say it also takes two-thirds to remove anyone else I think the language says that a simple majority would fire anyone else uh in the Senate but that's not the path we're on with Gensler I think the other thing that we can do and this is what my bill does is it just restructures the agency I mean we we created the Securities and Exchange Commission with legislation uh it was revised and the chairman was given more power with legislation and so now we can kind of restructure it with legislation the challenge is uh the path for legislation is tough so how does that work um you know we draft a bill um in the house in this case and then you will notice the bill for a hearing that hasn't happened yet so hopefully this bill will get noticed for a hearing soon so that people know hey you can comment on this bill in this hearing because we're thinking about moving it forward and then it'll get marked up in in the committee Financial Services in this case so the members of the financial services committee will weigh in on it potentially amend it and then if it passes the financial services committee then it's available to the House Majority Leader to be scheduled for a vote on the floor once it's scheduled there uh the rules committee considers amendments then it's on the floor subject to amendment by the whole house um and then you know say no amendments pass and the bill passes or all the amendments are then incorporated into the final bill then it's available to be scheduled for a vote in the Senate and if the Senate passes the same language that the house passes then it goes on to the president for Signature if the Senate passes something that's you know somewhat different then you have a conference committee between the House and Senate and they kind of work out the differences and agree this is what we think will pass the House and Senate but it has to get a vote so the house votes on the conference version the Senate votes on the conference version and once you have both houses agree on the text it goes for the president for a signature hopefully the president signs it if he doesn't sign it uh Congress can uh override a veto not signing it is a veto uh well avito is a veto not signing it lets it move into law so he could do no action but uh if it's vetoed then it takes two-thirds of both houses to override The veto so that's a that's a tough path to make a bill become a law and uh you know some some uh people my age will remember a Schoolhouse Rock video that still survives to the day on how bill becomes a law uh but but uh under the Obama Administration there was a less widely known uh Saturday Night Live skit that made fun of the how bill becomes a law and it's uh how an executive order uh happens and it's uh you know to get some chain smoking guy pretending to be the bill all grown up now the Bill's a little kid in the in the cartoon but in the Saturday Night Live skit it's like some old chain smoking guy and he's like yeah it pretty much just happens [Laughter] it's easier path metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the

uniswap wallet today on iOS there is a link in the show notes so there is a whole obstacle course that A bill must go through which which you just laid out but really the the big hurdle appears to be the actual president's signature or the president actually allowing this thing to go into law and why that seems like a big hurdle is because currently the president is Biden in the Biden Administration and Gary genzer seems to have the you know moral support of the Biden Administration so if we're going to get this SEC stabilization Act passed do you think it has to be under a different presidential Administration no I don't think so I think uh you know when uh the other things that make a bill pass you know so for for members of Congress you know I mean the downside for a lot of the crypto Community I mean crypto isn't a top issue in any congressional district I mean it it won't break the top ten it's important for the market um but you know I just use like rokana as a proxy I mean Rose uh uh got a huge part of Silicon Valley uh this probably isn't on his top five issues you know so um in in the markets it's a really big deal uh and obviously for the people whose livelihood depends on it and see massive Economic Opportunity it's very important but that doesn't mean that every member of Congress is going to pay for it pay attention to it and then I think the the uh the challenge is how do you make that a bigger issue for the public part of that's like educating the populace and you know you've got members of Congress and massive portion of the public that if they if you ask them the difference between Bitcoin and Central Bank digital currency they wouldn't really be able to differentiate them they would say Well they're both digital they're both bad I don't think we should be going down that path it's kind of creepy China surveillance stuff uh maybe a handful of people would say oh well that would be more convenient uh but but I think a lot of people will be like oh stay away and I think that's the challenge for the industry is people don't really understand it so you you know really need to be a Grassroots education effort and you know Twitter isn't really a good proxy for that you know there's a lot of activism on Twitter but it doesn't necessarily mean the the guy that's uh at work on a on a you know shop floor or out in the field right now or you know stringing up uh telephone wires somewhere is paying attention to that discussion representative uh Davidson I'd like to actually go into the details of the SEC stabilization act and I think for context any bankless listener that has listened to the couple of times that we've had Hester purse on understands the very different voice that Hester purse adds to the SEC and also simultaneously our frustration that even as great as Hester purse is her voice doesn't seem to produce any sort of guidance towards Gary Gensler so I I want to share this tweet from you about like your announcement of the SEC stabilization act and maybe also scroll down to this one which kind of shows the structure here but maybe you could walk us through the details of what the SEC stabilization act proposes and how it might elevate a voice that we find resonating with our industry which is Hester purse and how that might add her voice to the leadership of the SEC yeah so she's a commissioner and uh in a way it's like if you think about the Supreme Court which people are probably more familiar with um you know some people maybe they grew up liking Ruth Bader Ginsburg uh and thought she was great but sometimes she was the dissenting opinion right it didn't really change the outcome but you could read the dissent and go oh well you know she gets me in my case I was a big fan of Anthony Scalia and I would read scalia's descents on a lot of things I mean I wouldn't uniformly agree with them but some of them I go oh thankfully he made a good point you know Clarence Thomas has kind of become that for a lot of conservatives today um but until you have a majority it really doesn't change anything um in the Supreme Court's designed to have um you know nine nine votes so that there is uh some balance of power that shifts when you have parody uh in a way that's more like the federal elections commission you know both sides want to have a clear set of rules and in general you don't see a lot of drama coming out of the federal elections Commission because they're they're at at 50 50 between Republicans and Democrats and if there is a law that changes it really does take Congress so the commission often will come and say uh we actually need a law and Congress will you know either say no we don't and they'll be disappointed or they'll change the law and if you look at Hester she's kind of been that descent you know so if whichever Justice you want to compare her to she's been The Descent that says I think there's a really big problem with the way that Jay Clayton is looking at this when Jay Clayton was the chairman or a really big problem with the way chairman Gensler is looking at it now that he's the chairman Hester's been there kind of pointing a path uh that's certainly better for crypto and frankly broadly for a range of issues use in my opinion so historically um you know she's a republican Republicans would say we just need to make Hester the chair of the SEC or Brian Brooks or somebody like that the chair of the SEC our problems will be solved and now we'll have our strong Champion instead of their strong Champion that's posed on the other side and what my bill does is say maybe we actually need to do more collaboration and and sort of have a truce on the power struggle and politicization of the the commission and make them say well all right let's talk to Congress and that's where the politics are supposed to take place we actually get elected so if people are unhappy with us they can fire us pretty easily it's hard to fire Gary Gensler it's harder to hold him accountable but every two years you can fire a member of the House of Representatives and uh six years seems like a long time but at least every six years you could fire a senator so uh you know the idea that that Congress uh you know should should deal with the more thorny political issues that's the system of government we have that kind of aberration that we're seeing consequences for is these things that aren't truly in uh the Constitution and let's face it all of the bureaucracy everything from the attorney general down to the Securities and Exchange Commission over to you know the job fauci did for 34 35 years at the National Institution health or cdc's director all of the Power for that is an extension of the power vested in the presidency that's the executive branch and think how much that's grown meanwhile the ledge branch has been somewhat static and while the courts have grown they've kind of been somewhat static and it's like I think we're at a point where we have to rein in you know you know executive branch agencies and maybe the most noteworthy on those um isn't the Securities and Exchange Commission you know coming off of covid there's a lot of concern about how much power or influence if not over power they exerted uh and when you look at the intelligence community uh there's a famous clip uh somewhat famous clip where uh Senator Chuck Schumer is talking with Rachel Maddow and in about 20 seconds he sums up uh part of uh what's gone on over the last seven years is like if you cross the intelligence Community they have six ways of Sunday to Sunday to ruin your life I think uh that was an understatement they have far more than six ways and they're always asking for even more power so kind of adjacent to some of the listeners on on Bank list would be the restrict act this is a bill that would essentially turn all online activity into like a police state it's the Patriot Act on steroids uh and it basically creates a surveillance state for every activity and criminalizes uh downloading software that the government doesn't approve of it doesn't give you a list of software that they don't approve of but using a VPN or software uh without that crosses the line could be a million dollar fine in 20 years in jail and it's not even subject to a foia request uh by by journalists so it really is kind of creepy how much power this administrative State continues to seek and already has absolutely and and crypto I think is um we think is a freedom technology one of the antidotes to that that is a technology that brings power back uh to the individuals back to the citizens back to the people and so I guess at some level no wonder why some in the kind of uh the administrative government section are kind of resisting this um when you list some of these battles ahead though I I do think representative Davidson it it starts to get a little overwhelming for the typical Bank list listener it just seems to keep coming at us like attack after attack we have to defend against and as we bring this to a close I'm wondering if you think there's hope here like what can we do in 2023 and 2024 we look around we see Japan making strides on this in the UK just passed some legislation last week we got Mika in Europe feels like the US is very much falling behind as a result of this executive branch in the these government unelected bureaucrats who are stifling this industry as we draw to a close here are you optimistic that we can make progress here and if so how does that happen for the rest of 2023 and into 2024 yeah thank you for the question and yeah that's why I ran I mean you know there there's people that have surrendered on the whole system and like yeah I'm just gonna go offshore I'm done and uh that's disappointing and that's a real risk to our economy because you know uh people people are mobile and I'll just say I got to be in Germany when the Berlin Wall came down and people were able to come over to our side of the wall uh and experience freedom I met people who were doing it for their first hours like first hours across the border and they were not asking for more government they were wanting more freedom and uh it is under attack so the people that want to grow government that they see a government as the solution to everything they are somewhat hostile to the space they're hostile to cash they're hostile to things that would promote freedom and and so that is kind of a common denominator and so I created a a leadership pack the defend Freedom pack defendfreedom.com uh to try to raise money and help other candidates who are helping me defend freedom and and that's not just um you know Financial Freedom uh but it's also you know speech so people on the other side of the Berlin Wall they didn't realize this guy asked me he's like is it like this everywhere and I thought he meant like a big city like Berlin and he and I said no yeah we have small towns he goes no the stores are open at night and there's fresh milk I'm like yeah of course and I'm trying to explain like a 7-Eleven kind of concept to him and he goes well like the shelves are always stocked and like everyone can go in I'm like yeah they want you to go in so like you they sell more stuff they were trying to explain stuff to them he had been lied to and told you know we had two blocks per show like they did and we were even more poor than they were because they had this beautiful uh utopian communist state and the whole key to him growing up believing that was the control of information the control of speech and and I think that's where if you think about it self-custody is one of the things if they can't cancel all of crypto they want to make it account based because then they can control the companies uh more easily than they can control millions of individual people I think self-custody is really at the key to that so we've got two bills that are coming up this summer one is on um stable coins and one is on Market structure and so we are working to move legislation through our committee maybe as early as July um through committee so that they've been these bills have been drafted they've been noticed and now they're going in for markup uh so hopefully both of them will make it in July but if not you know at least one of them probably will and I think things to look for in the tax star does it protect self-custody I.E Freedom you know they it's my asset I private property is really at stake here it's a property rights discussion and I think you know the other thing when you look at Market structure the brightline test has to be so clear that even the workers at the SEC go well okay it's on the other side I can't really touch it it's not a security well we are certainly behind you in that fight for self-custody and you know what we call a self-cussity on on bankless we call that going bankless no intermediary between you and your property you and your money so representative Davidson we wish you great success and great luck thank you for pushing these values in Congress and uh for being with us today and educating the bankless nation on this yeah thank you for everything really appreciate it and I look forward to continuing to watch and listen to your podcast well bankless Nation this episode comes out on the 4th of July if you are in the U.S uh happy Fourth of July and as an action item I just want the bankless nation to remember to use its voice to vote look up the candidate in your jurisdiction call them tell them you are pro-crypto write to them this Grassroots education effort is a very important uh and with that I will end with usual risks and disclaimers of course this whole crypto thing is risky none of this has been Financial advice I don't even think it was political advice we've got some work to do that is certainly true you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign
