there's just the bridge risk people understate the bridge risk and events like this kind of highlight what a mistake it is to understate the bridge risk bankless nation happy first week of august david it's friday morning what time is it oh ryan it's the friday bankless weekly roll-up time where we cover the entire week of news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere on into the frontier nonetheless to the frontier that's right and uh i gotta remind you enjoy this roll-up with a cup of coffee david you said you got a coffee upgrade yeah earlier this week and i forgot to ask you about it so uh you know how's coffee at the apartment in in new york you know coffee's coffee's a tough thing i was making my coffee with an aeropress which i love that's good but uh it's time consuming it's a little time consuming it's a little laborious uh it's really meant for like camping or just like things when you're in a pinch so i got a chemex which is you know definitely like a standard it's not nothing special uh but it's just that drip chemicals yeah it's a it's a pour over yeah um more suited to like the particular ground that i have and then the kettle that i have um so def definitely got an upgrade but still still lots of work to be done on my coffee setup so i'm looking forward to that i'm glad you're in better shape and i know it's a continuous improvement just uh dave's got to remind you just like all things coffee or it becomes a beverage uh all right we're not talking about coffee today we're talking about crypto and a lot happened as usual what's uh the first thing we're going to cover today uh yeah it's a bad week for for crypto this week some some exploits uh another bridge hack uh so reset the clock on that one zero days since our last accident uh nomad was hacked for almost 200 million dollars on a smart contract exploit uh so we'll go into how that happened because it's very unique actually the the hack first of it's kind of a hack and so we'll talk about that and kind of what it means for the whole like multi-layer one thesis speaking of hacks all right uh almost ten thousand solana wallets were just randomly drained this week as well also also that's not supposed to happen and a lot of the week was spent with people trying to figure out how in the world this happened uh so we're going to talk a little bit about that and the uh the conclusion of what happened with this wallet hack pretty alarming what's the other thing we're going to cover and lastly there's just been a bunch of hubbub a bunch of drama about the eth pow chain the eighth proof of work chain that is probably going to come out of the fork once we merge we're going to leave a proof of work chain behind and so some people are descending upon that proof of work chain as a shelling point are you listener about to get some free eth pow pow eth uh please yes yes well i personally i wouldn't get your hopes up we'll talk about that i don't know i'm a little more bullish on it so we'll definitely talk about that and of course if you like the weekly roll up you like bankless content make sure you like subscribe rate and review if you are listening to this on a podcast channel on spotify especially you can now get this in video format which is always better in video seeing faces along with the words david before we get into it gotta relay a quick message from our friends and sponsors at florida uh did you know in 2021 that was just last year speaking of hacks we were talking about hacks in the intro there's 2.3 billion dollars in crypto web 3 related hacks and forda has something to help with this what is forta doing david ford is a live smart contract monitoring service and so what they do is they monitor the mempool uh and so you know there's plenty of things that you need to do as a smart contract dev like you know go through audits do formal verification but there's still plenty of stuff you can also do while your smart contracts are live you know in in the wild live in production uh and there are types of transactions that can be detected that are incoming that are known to be like malicious like they drain treasuries they hack bridges you know they mess with your governance or whatever uh and so florida there's that like video game that uh way back when uh in the 90s like this meteor game where the meteors were coming in and they were like you gotta shoot them before they hit the earth right so like they would zap the incoming meteors this is what florida does for incoming militias transactions and so you can identify a set of transactions that if they do this then you know they're malicious and florida will zap them before they get into your into your smart contract and so there's over 36 billion in tvl monitored by ford's decentralized network uh including uh protocols and applications like dydx compound balancer maker lido yuma uh not not nomad not nomad um maybe they could have used use florida yeah uh there's a yeah in the show notes if you are interested in learning more about getting a smart contract uh exploit zapper on your on your squad one one thing i know is you don't want to find out that your smart contract has been hacked on twitter you want to receive some alert and have a defense a system set up so ford monitoring is is there for that and of course florida thank you for sponsoring this message ryan shall we get into markets yeah let's do it what's bitcoin showing us this week i'm going to show some charts yeah got some new charts on the screen bitcoin we are down a whopping 0.9 which i would consider flat i would consider that flat on the week uh started the start of the week at 23 100 ending the week at twenty two thousand nine hundred dollars flat on the week thought in the week just flat on the week okay neither up nor down just tepid just flat how about you same thing yeah start of the week at 16 40 ending the week at 16 20 down 1.5 percent again i would just consider that flat that is a flat week all right david how about the eat bitcoin ratio what's that looking like on the week yeah super flat on the week down half of a percent at .0707 so nothing nothing market's still deciding bitcoin or eve bitcoin bitcoin blue chips are flat tokens ryan up bigly we'll talk about that later in the show but tokyo wait wait wait wait wait wait wait like tokens defy tokens yeah they're on the move yeah they're on the move uh well we will cover that in what i am bullish on at the beginning is it time to bring our dpi chart back oh god i'm not toast i'm not ready for that not just specific tokens please how about a global cryptocurrency market cap are we at a trillion yet yeah we've been at a trillion for a while we ended last week at 1.14 trillion we are at 1.11 trillion um so down 30 billion dollars again less if it's less than one tera of downwards that's flat less than one tara wow yeah too soon david um gas markets gas markets in real life kind of suck price at the pump but price at the ethereum pump is still kind of good is this ninth way this week yeah it's low as gwen nine grey yeah you can scroll down to get to get that chart a little bit yeah so last week it was keep going down every single time you missed this there we go okay green green chart green chart in green top right yeah so the p the the average well we'll start here the the average total transaction gas distribution the peak was at nine grade this week down one way from last week seven ryan is the number we gotta beat to be deflationary in the merge and we are at nine that's too close for comfort yeah all right i ca that would be so disappointing but let's take a look at bitcoin and eth from all-time high uh perspective bitcoin down 65 percent from all-time high this week eth down 64 and the difference between eth and bitcoin from their respective bottoms is east is up 76 from its bottom and bitcoin is only up 26 so uh eth took a harder crash harder dip than bitcoin but it has recovered much faster and now it's kind of neck and neck on the the percent down from all-time high what do you make of this yeah i mean this is definitely the merge trade like i it's very infrequently that i feel like we can confidently say what is making the market do the things that it's doing but right now i have some of the most confidence i've ever had that this is the merge trade this is what this is this is yeah yeah it merges bullish um let's look at the other uh percentage tokens down from all-time high so besides bitcoin and eth how about um binance chain what's that looking like yeah binary bmp always does very very well and and honestly one of the reasons is because it's one of the few tokens that actually has cash flows embedded in it like it's kind of got this like manual eip1559 buyback and burn uh because that's what binance does with this revenue is it buys bnb and bernie it's a massive exchange which is a cash cow in bull markets and bear markets it's still a cash cow that's still sort of backing the finance chain always has sorry b and b chain b and b chain yeah so it's down 56 compared to bitcoin and ether is down 66 so definitely better than those two xrp down 88 percent cardano down 83 solana down 85 percent polka dot down 85 dogecoin down 91 uh polygon down 69 nice avalanche down eighty four percent unit swap only down twenty eight percent wow uni only down and twenty eight percent that's pretty good that's pretty cool i gotta admit david i look at this chart and i see a little bit like nature's healing yeah i mean this makes more sense to me than the bull market um doesn't make complete sense to me but like it's still more reasonable than things in the bull market let's talk a little bit more about the bullish eth narrative it's kind of going mainstream you know joe weisenthal right from bloomberg big time yeah yeah he uh has a podcast i listen to you occasionally also has a newsletter and in his newsletter this week joe weisenthal who's never really been an eath bull at any point in time any of my reading of of his he just wrote why eth is taking over the narrative and why bitcoin's narrative is busted and um yeah i i think this is starting to escape into mainstream is probably the the takeaway here that eth like surpassing bitcoin on the narrative front is a is a real thing that's happening right now yeah and there there's two reasons for this i think if you're inside of the crypto industry you are bullish eth or if if you are bullish etho over bitcoin then it's because of ether being deflationary post merge but if you're outside of the crypto industry you think that ethereum is going to be in a better place than bitcoin because of the esg like green energy narrative um so like it's kind of pic pick your reason but we got two of them as to why people are trending in favor of east lately ryan really quickly i just talked about how uni swept was only down like 28 29 that didn't feel right it's actually down 70. it's like it's down 80 percent i just checked on it yeah that's weird yeah it's actually it's uh the massage i don't know where that came from yeah thanks for that correction yeah um yeah but but to your point and the two reasons to be bullish when you're inside of the space you're kind of bullish because of the um the the structural cell pressure right that just decreases and my mind is the correct reason for being bullish i think so yeah i mean like the narrative we i mean the narrative side we knew proof of stake we knew proof of work was going away and ethereum was becoming esg's like for kind of forever right but i think this is less well-known but this has a greater more immediate impact what is the chart that we're looking at on the change in theoretical annual structural cell pressure with the massive issuance reduction all the proof of work issuance it's like 4.1 percent something like this it goes away completely the day of the merge what are we looking at in this chart yeah so we are looking at a bar chart that's titled reduction in theoretical annual structural cell pressure and what that means is that some chains some some bigger chains have gone through changes in monetary policy throughout their history uh ether ether used to be issued five ether per block at genesis that got reduced down to three in 2017 that and then it got reduced down to two in 2019 to where it is now um other other blockchains have also done similar things like the bitcoin happening famously there's a 2016 bitcoin having a 2020 bitcoin happening and the sizes of these bars are a function of how much cell pressure is getting reduced so when bitcoin goes through a happening you take how much bitcoin would have been issued in a year multiply that by the usd price uh and then and then take away like how much how much is not being issued as a result of the happening uh and so uh the the 2020 bitcoin happening reduced three billion dollars in theoretical annual cell pressure that got reduced from the happening uh the ether uh reduction from three eth to two eth and the proof of mining uh proof of work mining reward in 2019 removed 500 million in yearly annual cell pressure but reminder that's when ether was like one one or two hundred dollars and so if you multiply that by 10 or 20 to get where we are now that's that would that would control for that on the very far left we have two upcoming changes we have the bitcoin uh happening in 2024 which if you again multiply the amount of bitcoin being issued versus its current price where it is now at 23 000 you bitcoin will receive almost a four billion dollar reduction in annual cell pressure this is why bitcoiners like love love the happening right we've reduced cell pressure this is why they haven't celebrated like scarcity coming in and it's scheduled every four years so you know it's coming right and and then in the ether merge the eth merge which is upcoming very very quickly uh is going to be a theoretical reduction in 7.5 billion dollars of annual cell pressure and so almost double the annual reduction in annual cell pressure from uh to bitcoin which is also saying something when it's when it's double a reduction in us dollar cell pressure but the difference in market cap between bitcoin and ethereum is about 2.5 x so the bitcoin uh market cap is 440 billion the ethereum market cap is 195 billion call it call it 200. and so the bitcoin market cap is 2.5 times larger than ethereum's but the ethereum us dollar cell pressure reduction is twice as big as bitcoins and so this is why like this this is so incredibly bullish it's such an outsized reduction in cell pressure versus this much smaller ethereum market cap yeah another way to say this too is pot in a post merged world ethereum is going to have to find in order to stay flat in order for prices not to explode upwards ethereum is going to have to find 7.5 billion in new sellers right and if it doesn't find it here ryan if it doesn't find those new sellers it has no choice but to go up has no choice but that's why the the economics of the merge are so interesting and so attractive and i think why the market is is starting maybe to price this in though i don't think they've fully priced it in um you know of course the emergency like checkmate sellers i just don't why would you sell there's like there's two times you could you can uh you know buy or sell eth right one is before the merge and and the other is after right nine i'm definitely a buyer before the merge i think it's a historic opportunity anyway not financial advice okay but the second reason the the reason maybe mainstream thinks this is interesting as well is the whole esg narrative so this is the energy reduction narrative when uh ethereum transitions to proof of stake and gets rid of all of the energy inefficient mining that happens what tweet are we looking at here david yeah so we're looking at just a chart of google searches for esg over time and it's like a hockey it's a on the beginnings of a hockey stage hockey stick it looks like uh popularity of google searches for esg over time i don't really know what this x-axis is maybe it's arbitrary um but we are roughly three times higher than we were in 2020 if that is any sort of an indication so we're extrapolating here and saying just like esg as a concept uh which is just like in sustainable investing both in in ecological standpoint but also like a political and governance standpoint uh and so implying that esg is in vogue and so a reduction in energy usage by a leading blockchain will be very a very popular move with people because because esg is in vogue now personally i don't really enjoy the esg i think it's just adding a political element to investing but that is just a political take i guess like i think i think there's better ways to uh optimize for investments but it's what the pop is what the people want and the people want things that are green and that's what ethereum's doing when it goes to the merge you definitely have to track it as a narrative and the bottom line here as the tweet says bitcoin has decided to ignore the esg issue entirely whereas ethereum is unlatching itself from proof of work and that's the narrative going forward and i think people are buying into that narrative as well david people are also buying into ens uh we just got the july 2022 stats and ens is an nft that just is doing very well in this bear market what are we looking at for these high level stats here yeah let's go through some of the numbers 378 000 new dot eth registrations bringing the new total to 1.86 million ens names that have been minted that's 6.8 million dollars in protocol revenue going to the dow that's 5004 5400 ethan revenue with 48 000 new eth accounts new ethereum addresses that have at least one ens name in it uh and greater and i never have understood this last metric greater than 99 of open c domain volume does that mean ens is is dominant dominating open c volume by 99. just domains there are other domains besides youths and ens they're dot cryptos okay so it's market share like ents well that makes sense i mean yeah like mark the domain space is like a monopoly game so that makes sense enos definitely has one that won that game it's kind of feeling like it's the dot-com right yes yes yeah this is uh this is really interesting and all of that protocol revenue goes to the dow yeah 6.8 million protocol revenue that was 6.8 million for the month just one of the month for the month yeah what yeah it's a cash cow right and like i i can't imagine the dow has all that many expenses okay what is the what is the um token price of ens uh that's a good question how's that doing remember that yeah enos token you got some air drop a lot of people yeah which i couldn't claim because my argent wallet lost my private keys my art is still pretty it's it's it's uh off the bottoms here yeah it's off it's still closed it's still climbing yeah um bottom around nine the ens it's like is a good buy it's a good box stubble from the bottom yeah but i mean if you put if you go to crypto fees.info uh for just talking about the dapps uh uniswap 1.5 million dollars in revenue in one day of a uh 0.6 million dollars of revenue in one day gmx which is uh an app that's spitting out eth to its token holders 0.2 million sushi swap 1.16 million ens coming in in one two three four coming in fifth at 1.15 million dollars per day 150 000 per day in revenue uh still three times more than solana it's not a fair comparison because solana is like explicitly like we won't collect any fees we will not have economic sustainability and that's how we'll just like onboard everyone by collecting zero money yes but i think it's more of a fair comparison than people actually think people should think this yes if we actually get into this conversation with um i was going to say paulina pullen yeah so david and i um did an anon interview with polenia last week we talked a lot about previously known as the anon previously known as paulina it turns out we have not been pronouncing that name correctly at all anyway it's uh it's not coming out this monday but the next monday we talk all about alternative layer ones versus ethereum and layer twos and where the value accrual is going to lie and uh anyway that don't miss that episode is all i'm saying we we get into this discussion around uh fees and how it impacts valuation uh david what else we got here speaking of ens names openc bought openc dot heath for a hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars wow yeah so nice payday for whoever minted openc.e congratulations oh that's basically 100 eath hold on i'm glad we got bankless uh eath back in the day david yeah before this could you stretch how much we'd be gouged if we hadn't gotten a bankless audi it'd be so sad i don't know if i'd do it what did we pay for that we paid like two thousand dollars for that like goodbye we paid e for it so you have to translate that into eath terms maybe maybe it's worse than that who knows but eat this down i don't know no we're probably i'm gonna go i'm gonna go i'm gonna go find this out right now ryan we bought bankless.ed august 2nd 2020 for 5.15 each that's that's that's 2 000 sad yeah that's that's very steep what is that uh right now yeah that's like uh 85 000. yeah 5.15 yeah you know under 10 000. 8250 yeah i mean steal over the long term yeah over the long run i mean we would have paid we would have had to pay a lot more for it now an egregious amount and by the way we caught this when it um somebody let it expire so somebody had purchased it and then they let it expire we came in and sniped it in the bid process wait how did we if it expired why did we pay 5.15 there was like this there was like this big process that they had in place with some expired domains where it started very steep and then over the next 30 days like it descended in price but anyone could buy it anyone could buy it but like we bought it right away oh yeah yeah so we bought it kind of at the top because we're not taking the risk anyway guys uh coming up next we're gonna talk more about the hack season that seems to be happening it's sort of a bad week for hacks across crypto especially if you are using the bridges to some of these other ecosystems a 200 million dollar hack and then this solana private key hack i'm going to talk about that and then also david you're to tell us whether proof of work eth a fork of ethereum if that's a real thing or fake news and i'm still hoping for my eth forked tokens that i could sell for more eth don't hold your breath we'll see guys we'll be right back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it d5 maker dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mince die directly with maker the power to mince new money is in your hands and there's something new in the maker dow ecosystem every time a new maker vault is opened the owner can claim a poem which contributes funds to one tree planted an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side soon maker will be present on all chains and layer twos bringing the biggest and best d5 credit facility to everywhere there is defy today you can mint die on oasis.app defy saver or other d5 protocols that you use so follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to each so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there all right guys we are back with another big bridge hack this time a bridge called nomad was drained of nearly 200 million dollars in an exploit this was a code type exploit so a technical exploit david you want to tell us what happened yeah so crosstrain bridge nomad it goes to a number of different ecosystems avalanche ethereum ev evmos evm os cosmos and so like you said it was a smart contract exploit as opposed to like an economic or oracle attack uh we lost almost 200 million dollars and the person that really unpacked this uh the best is a sam c sun who put a thread together uh and so we'll go ahead and read out the thread because it's not too long so sam says nomad just got drained for over 150 million and one of the most chaotic hacks that web web3 has ever seen how did this happen exactly and what was the root cause allow me to take you behind the scenes please do sam uh and so he says it all started when uh uh somebody a twitter a telegram account shared another telegram's accounts or twitter accounts tweet and an ethereum security telegram channel although i had no idea what was going on at the time the sheer volume of assets leaving the bridge was clearly a bad sign and he shows a tweet of 100 wbtc leaving the nomad bridge like transaction after transaction after so 100 wbtc 100 wbtc uh and somebody says nomad bridge getting rugged looks very very sus uh sam says my first thought was that there was some misc uh configuration for the tokens decimals after all it seemed that the bridge was it was running a send .01 get 100 wbtc back promotion and then here he's showing a tweet where somebody was sending in literally .01 the btc but hundreds of bt wbtc were going out that's a bad promotion sam says uh however after some painful manual digging on the moonbeam network i confirmed that while the moonbeam transaction did bridge out .01 btc somehow the ethereum transaction bridged in wbtc uh further the transaction bridge in the wbtc didn't actually prove anything it's simply called process like a function process directly suffice to say being able to process a message without proving it first is extremely not good uh and so what they mean is like by proving it is that this is a there's a thing called a prover maybe this is what we're talking about but basically like anybody can send a message to a bridge but the message needs to be correct uh and that's part of like the functionality of the bridge at this point there were two possibilities either the proof had been submitted separately in an earlier block or there was something extremely wrong in the replica contract however there was no absolutely no indication that anything had been proven recently again this is like terminology about like how like uh contracts need to be uh receiving messages about that are correct uh to whatever degree that the smart contract in that bridge deemed something correct it's like kind of up to how the bridge is constructed but a correct message would be something that is like coming from one one chain to another and like a proof is generated that is correct or so um sam continues and says there's only one possibility left there was a fatal flaw in the replica replica contract but how a quick look suggests that the message submitted must belong to an acceptable route otherwise the check on line 185 would fail fortunately there is an easy way to standing to check this assumption i knew that the root of the message which had not been proven would be 0x00 because message brackets underscore message hash bracket would be uninitialized all i had to do was check whether the contract would accept that as a root uh and then the next one is uh oops that's the only thing the tweet says it says oops and basically for sam just put in 0x000000 as an address and it comes back true meaning that every single thing will come back true meaning that like the bridge is like an open vault everything is true the contract returns everything true uh and so that means anyone could go anyone can function and pull funds out more or less yeah off the bridge yeah uh and so sam says it turns out during a routine upgrade that the nomad team initialized the trusted root 2b 0x000 to be clear using zero values as an installation values is a common practice unfortunately in this case it had the tiny side effect of auto proving every message so every message every possible message was approved as in like hey can you send me 100 wptc approved approved uh and so sam says and finishes this is why the hack was so chaotic you didn't need to know about solidity or merkle trees or anything like that all you had to do was find a transaction that worked find and replace the other person's address with yours and then rebroadcast it so not every single transaction works but how you have to have a certain hash but it's just you need to find a transaction that starts with 0x00 and you can go find that by going to a previous bridge transaction and then copying that transaction and just replacing it with your outbound address and then sending that uh and so tl dr a routine upgrade marked the zero hash as a valid route which had the effect of allowing messages to be spoofed on nomad attackers abused this to copy and paste transactions and quickly drain the bridge in a frenzied free-for-all so once one person realized it everyone realized it that their the the gates to the vault were open there was an open vault and all the money was just like sitting there well somebody realized it and then as soon as one person realized it everyone realized it that's the analogy right so that this nomad bridge had code that essentially vaulted off massive amounts of money hundreds of millions of dollars in value here so like close to 200 million dollars and then they issued a update to this vault and the doors swung wide open and they didn't even realize it and then no one realized it for 43 days so this vault has been open for 43 days in a row only only like uh two days two or three days ago that somebody was like hey there's money there there's money everyone stopping me from going and getting it and so they went and the the first couple people grabbed the money yeah and then an entire crowd assembled to go pick up the money from the vault and like you know stuff it under their their trench coats and run home with it yep wow uh are these white hats david yeah so i mean so not everyone who's doing this is evil of course there are a number of people that just went and grabbed the money because if they didn't grab the money then somebody maliciously grabbed the money so like if you're a person saying well that money's free everyone's taking it i'll be a good person and i'll take the money and i'll return before someone else does before some an evil doer does it and so like it's kind of like a little bit like game theory if you know that you are going to return the money then you can safely go get the money and return it to the people later so somebody who made a transaction to go get this money and knew what they were doing they they write in the message field in their transaction saying i'm returning this money fbi please calm down no i didn't plan to seal it and yes i know this address is docked that's amazing just leaving a message for you it's just like my hands are up my hands are up like don't shoot don't shoot um david that was a super funny tweet where somebody says accidentally exploited the nomad bridge for seventeen thousand dollars will return the funds did you see this clip of like the monkeys yeah so so this is a tweet from a haska trade saying the nomad hack explained and here's just like a plastic bin of a bunch of bread and then there's like a hundred monkeys coming in they're all grabbing the bread out of the basket i mean this is uh this is kind of you know of the 190 million dollars apparently nine million has been returned so there's nine million dollars worth of white hacks that are actually doing the right thing and returning these funds but that's quite a gap man that's like 180 million that has not been returned and was that five five percent it was captured by white hat hackers yes so it's not zero i mean the big question is do you remember the wormhole hack that happened man it feels like another lifetime ago but honestly it wasn't that long ago but that got a bailout from jump capital yeah the question is isn't that a billion dollar bailout yes uh something like that it was a lot of money uh i can't remember it i don't know if it was quite a billion but um i don't know if the deep pockets are coming to rescue the bridge this time right what do you think right well there's also a lot less money in the ecosystem now um 320 million dollars is what it was 320 million yeah so so this is a pretty big one plenty of people have hundreds of millions of dollars in the top of the market fewer people have hundreds of million dollars in this current state of the market i mean i think nomad has recently been been funded as well by vc so yeah you know yeah but not for 190 million they don't they raise like 22 million even close not even close so what are you going to do like operating money they have to pay employees with that what's also interesting is uh this was a bridge to many kind of of the like alternative layer one ecosystem so as you said uh avalanche the cosmos milk milk is um that's cardinal it's card uh cardano and what's moon bean you know what i do not know what moon beam is yeah neither do i um very powerful uh dragon fly a dragon type attack from pokemon really okay your pokemon lore exceeds my friends um so the question is are all bridge all are all bridges susceptible to this so you know like banklets we're very excited about um layer twos obviously yes uh options also also have bridges arbitram the zk evms you've heard us talk about these before and they also have bridges to david's point these bridges are not susceptible to economic attack which is one category of attack and probably less susceptible to oracle attack we haven't got delved into that in all the details but is susceptible to this to similar kinds of technical attack as we saw with nomad so does that worry you uh that like hey anytime we bridge from maina ethereum there's some smart contract risk here on any of these layer two ecosystems you think that'll be an inhibitor to scale yeah so layer two layer twos are bridges that have less attack surface area like you said there are you can't do an economic attack on a layer two bridge uh and you also cannot do an oracle attack on a layer two bridge if that bridge has an oracle but you know smart contracts are smart contracts and bridges are smart contracts and so a layer two bridge to optimism zk sync you know arbitrarum these are all have bridges that all have smart contracts that and those smart contracts can be exploited um there is one major difference for optimistic rollups and that optimistic roll-ups have a seven-day withdrawal window and so if you have a bunch of ether on optimism or arbitrary and then and then you like exploit that bridge it's gonna take you seven days to get back to the ethereum layer one but that's i guess that's only true if that smart contract exploit happens on the on the layer two side because that ether does exist on the ethereum layer one inside the bridge contract so if the ethereum layer one bridge contract is exploited i guess you could just get it out immediately so smart contract risk is always going to be smart contract risk the the spicy hot take that i'll have is that if you are building a layer two on ethereum one of the core reasons why you would choose to do a layer two on ethereum rather than alternatively or one is that you believe in you prioritize security up utmost like if you are doing your own blockchain you're only one blockchain you have to build your security from scratch and you're going to be inherently less secure than in the ethereum layer one uh because that's what the ethereum layer one has optimized for so if you are a layer 2 you are prioritizing security that is in your culture as a team so if you are a team that prioritizes culture security in your culture you're likely also doing a much higher effort on securing your bridge in your bridge smart contracts than you would if you are a team that doesn't prioritize security as much and teams that don't prioritize security don't build roll-ups they build alternative layer ones is that a fair take i feel like that's a fair take i i think that's a fair take but but also at the same time i mean it's nice to say right but like i don't know it's kind of if verify don't trust sure it's it's not great to be in the position of having to trust the expertise and the skill level and the security um like um the considered security profile of of devs of a particular bridge um so yeah i would say i am moderately worried about this and it's not something that um we should take lightly like the good the good news i think with with all of these um you know bridges in the roll-up ecosystem is they're upgradable so we haven't like turned off we haven't removed the upgrade button from any of them so if something goes wrong you know patch could go in quickly but yeah i think there is some risk and um we should be real about that when people are bridging to even layer two ecosystems uh they have this risk now i think that risk will decrease massively over time there was a time david where i i was too freaked out to put any funds inside of a multi-sig like the gnosis multi-sig wallet for instance and do you remember there was a gnosis multisig wallet kind of a v1 and then they they created a v2 and you sort of reset the clock back to zero when a new upgrade is kind of issued and now i'm not like the gnosis multisig uh holds you know tens of billions of dollars at this point it's been around for years has a very strong lindy and i think the only way around kind of um the bridge hack concern is you have to have bridges that have been in place without being touched for a long period of time securing massive amounts of money and this is going to take time so i don't know i i'm not putting all of my funds on a layer 2 as a result of this because it's still in the early phases do you think that's a fair take i i definitely think that's a fair take and just to the i think we should definitely take some time on this on this topic because bridges is you know always has been a huge theme of the last 12 months this is a bartex thread from layer two beat layer2b is doing a fantastic job just putting in risk frameworks and helping to define the risks of bridges and layer twos so bartek puts this thread together and he says with the recent hack of nomad i think it's time to reflect more broadly on bridge security as by now they have become far more the most critical piece of blockchain infrastructure here are some things to consider externally validated bridges as in bridges that require a kind of multisig to process messages can obviously be drained by the key owners and the keys might be compromised but the smart contract there is very simple simple to implement audit and independently verify as in you're trading there's a trade-off here your smart contract is more simple because you've uh exported a bunch of risk to the multi-sig and sometimes especially in the beginning stages of a bridge i would definitely advocate for this model let's just like like remove all the complexity and just trust the founders trust the multi-sig for the beginning stage this week this is similar to the polygon bridge to the previous stake chain granted polygon has an extra layer of defense because it has ethereum side matic staking which is a very meaningful difference than like your typical side chain or cross layer one bridge bartek continues and says there is downside of course with that bridge you need to trust the off chain code which is completely opaque who knows what's going on there shout out ronan ronin bridge with theoxie network bartek says nomad is way more complex and it fell due to an obscure bug and a smart contract code not an architectural flaw compared to nomad optimistic roll-ups are still more complex compared to optimistic roll-ups zk roll-ups are insanely complex you do the math it makes sense to let the bridge code ossify with time before you move bigger funds but after the upgrade the off ossification timer is reset to zero as the upgrade may introduce a critical bug as it happened with nomad this is this is what happened they upgraded their bridge contract it was fine previously right and so yeah it was fine and they're like okay cool let's let's up the security let's up the hands-off nature of this this bridge and that upgrade was the thing that introduced the risk whoops bartek says nomad is also permissionless anyone could process messages and bridge the bridge could not be soft no central actor to trust which like yay we like that in a bankless world but also ooh scary in the early days this removed power from nomad team but also left them helpless watching the bridge being drained as noted many times before this space critically needs a solution for design that is trustless and secure against critical bugs at the same time seven day delay windows in optimistic roll-ups gives an honest actor an honest operator plenty of time to stop withdrawals hence it makes sense virtually impossible hence it makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to exploit the bug in a smart contract so the operator could pause things operator comprosings and i actually think that that actually does protect against ether deposits on the layer one from being revoked or like exploited from the bridge contract because that contract has a seven-day window on it on the ethereum totally that that actually makes me feel better about optimistic roll-ups yeah um therefore it may be and so what he's saying here is there there's a balance here with like the seven day window we can make things trustless and smart contract base without it being a multi-sig but you see but you also have like the if if it comes down to it like an operator can step in and do something inside of that seven days famously this is what saved ethereum during the dow hack right and same with the upgrade ability well that is like a knock against you know it's more centralized for its optimistic roll-up team to have upgrade ability the fact that they have that sort of makes the funds more secure if you you know have some trust in them to be an honest actor yeah uh last few tweets from bartek uh hence it makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to exploit the bug in a smart contract because of that seven day window zk roll ups if they contain the bug might not be so lucky as there is no delay windowed there fun fact about zk rollups you can go in and out of zk roloffs instantaneously but then you lose that seven day window protection bartek continues and says therefore it may be good to have a delay for big withdrawals and a cap on fast withdrawals to limit the potential damage this is the approach that maker dao is taking with its teleport for canonical multi-chain dye um they're making maker dallas making wormholes for diets across layer twos uh so this is relevant there bartek says if the fast withdrawal infrastructure is breached maker dao not die users will take the loss but up to a predefined limit it's a risk that the dow may be willing to take the risk is no different than issuing a bad loan if this is one bad loan out of a thousand good loans this is okay you can be even more fancy and have more complex risk framework taking advantage of architectural properties of a given layer two to which you want to bridge to check out this proposal if you want to dive deeper and then last last couple tweets uh one prominent project that limits deposits is stark net openly admitting to still being alpha is one thing but users typically ignore that deposit limits keep stocknet's tvl artificially low but this is good and responsible we still need to look for the perfect bridge design and the cost of mistakes for the whole space is massive in the meantime users should be reasonable with how much funds they are moving out from the blaze layer i just want to go back to my culture statement bartek previous app maker dow which which is one of the dials that has been optimized for security since before this whole like multi-chain like world like maker dial has been so risk focused in its culture and so like that has now extended to bartek and what they're doing at layer 2b and all their risk frameworks for layer 2s and now all these layer twos are like uh uh also focusing on like the layer two beat risk framework coming from this very conservative layer two beat team that's optimized for security the most i will ask you if you are if you consider yourself a citizen to be a citizen of a different chain layer one chain whether it's avalanche solana like you know pick your chain is there a culture of security in those chains that it resembles the culture of security that happens on ethereum because this is the thing that has saved ethereum from all of these bridges uh from all of these exploits that you see happening elsewhere there's a reason why so much exploits is happening external to ethereum survive only the paranoid survive that's a great way to put it uh so this culture of this culture of security is why is why so fewer exploits happen inside of the ethereum ecosystem but also knock on wood there david oh i know what i mean we can also we can also compartmentalize out parts of the ethereum app layer like wonderland for example uh very risk taking there's many defy apps on ethereum that are very very not risk adverse but that's different it's different from being risk-averse on the app layer versus risk-averse on the protocol layer you definitely want to um prioritize projects that um or you you definitely want to lean into projects that prioritize security over over speed right in this case and there are many shortcuts tile and the speed of things mr casimani but um we're dealing with a lot of money that this reminds me to what we always you know end bankless with which this is the frontier you could lose what you put in it's not for everyone the frontier has kind of moved from mainnet ethereum into the layer 2 space into the sidechain space so now in order to bridge funds to a sidechain you know what david i need to receive a bit more return on my investment because it's a bit more risky over there than on mainnet so these are all considerations as as you're thinking about your journey your bankless journey and your journey into crypto i'm confident though over time these you know kind of like technical challenges the code will become trusted cemented ossified and that's really going to save us kind of similar to a gnosis safe i was skeptical of that in the early days now i'm not like i'm fine putting my you know a lot into inside of gnosis safe um but i do think this is back to kind of a sad prediction that uh we made bankless made the beginning of 2022 that there will be more of these monster bridge hacks uh so this is what we said there will be some monster bridge hacks in 2022 we're starting to see them that will make quest people question their multi l1 chain thesis and here's also what i mean because over time you can get rid of and reduce the risk the technical risk and the code risk but you cannot reduce the economic risk and the oracle attack risk okay and unless you're on a layer two unless you're you know uh um doing some level of a roll-up strategy in the side chain strategy where you've got like you know networks of side chains you will always have the economic risk of bridges you will always have the oracle attack risk of bridges and that ain't going away and so this is a reason why i am much more bullish on kind of the ethereum roadmap uh pooled security vision than on kind of like there will be many chains and like there's no real settlement platform of shared security between them and because because there's just the bridge risk people understate the bridge risk and events like this kind of highlight what a mistake it is to understate the bridge risk anything else on this story david yeah just to finally tie it off like this industry is built on top of settlement assurances which is basically property rights uh are you are you in a bankless paradigm where you own your own assets and no one can revoke those assets from you like that is what this industry is built on everything is built on strong settlement assurances uh and so this is by the same way same vogue that uh the strongest most secure layer one will always end up winning out the most secure and strongest bridges will also be winning out and this is why bridges that have the least amount of risk surface area will win over the bridges that have more surface area and those bridges are always going to be roll up cryptographic bridges there there's your bridgication there i think we've covered that thoroughly let's talk about the uh mysterious solana wallet hack too that was created to bridges however unrelated to bridges but it was crazy this week it's something there's like 5 000 wallets upwards like maybe closer to 10 000 wallets basically solana wallets people looked inside of their wallet and they were like oh my god my money is no longer there how could this happen and i'm not talking about a centralized exchange wallets i'm talking about sort of you have the private key to your wallet it's in you know phantom or some sort of you know metamask for instance and then all of a sudden the fees are like the the the funds are uh withdrawn how could this even happen yeah so like a lot of the solano users for those that don't use solana it's like they opened up their metamask and like there was no money there anymore yes like it was all good it was all gone and so big question of how does this happen uh and how did it happen because there's kind of like a sherlock holmes uh you know the entire community ethereum solana the entire crypto community was trying to figure out how this mass wallet drain actually happened fortunately not a lot of money but um it was like six million dollars or something like this but a lot of wallets were affected right you want to tell us the story here david yeah so here's the tweet thread i'll just explain it better than i can uh it says six million dollars of soul in usdc have been stolen from over 8 000 solana wallets the hacker used private keys to drain user funds in what has been one of the craziest and most mysterious hacks in recent times it all started when a few people noticed that some unusual outflows were happening from phantom wallets on solano phantom i think is the most popular wallet on solana numerous reports started to pop across twitter and discord of users having fun drains from their wallets phantomwallet was quick to issue a statement saying that they do not believe that this is a phantom specific issue interesting interesting uh and so developer and auditor x fubar uh found xerox vubar found that the attacker was stealing both soul and usc tokens from people's slope and phantom wallet slope another wallet in the island ecosystem the most logical thing to do like this is to revoke any access to any depths as in like you know undo all permissions but avalanche co-founder emin asserted that it's likely that the attack acts acquired access to private keys how did they do that how'd they get the hands on 8 000 different private keys not supposed to happen not supposed to happen uh and so this means that the only way to protect your assets is to move them onto a hardware wallet or onto a centralized exchange so this was a hot wallet exploit solana finally responded after hours of speculation that stated that over 7767 wallets have been affected by the exploit so far but what was soon made matters worse was that rpc nodes started pinging as offline this indicated that the solana network was down causing more panic across twitter it was theorized that the nodes were being uh purposely ddosed by developers in order to slow down the hackers this backfired as it caused additional confusion oof uh supposedly the ddos attack was aimed at the hacker which uh subsequently resulted in rpc nodes failing oh god what a mess uh okay keep going uh the the most concerning part of the of the is the lack of clarity surrounding the root cause of the issue even solana co-founder anatoly um uh couldn't offer verdict despite uh despite alluding to ios imported wallets being the key target he and other key solano figures surveyed their audience for data trying to get to them to the bottom of the exploit almost attempting to conduct an uh on-the-go horse modem this indicates to me that we are dealing with a highly complex exploit as of now the issue is still being investigated so on his latest update says that they continue to investigate the roots cause and it does not appear to be a bug within solana core code we do know the root cause though now i think we do have this tweet this tweet thread kind of trails off at a time when we didn't know the the root cause do you have any information on the root cause david so in a different tweet xerox fubar who is apparently really good at producing stuff like this says it looks like the slope wallet sent plain text seed phrases to external integration partners i'm sorry what what they're not mysterious at all just like another noob they just sent they okay so that's like if you know metamask it gives you your your seed phrase and like it lets you it makes you copy it down that's like if metamask was sending that same seed phrase to like infuria and if euro was just like logging that uh and so that's absolutely crazy um compromised phantom wallets came from seed phrases importing imports used in slope compromised eth wallets were also from seed phrase reuse so i guess some some ethereum walls were even compromised for people that generated their wallet using slope this is not a blockchain or a random issue randomness issue this is a terribly irresponsible service provider issue fubar then later issues a correction saying the slope wallet did not send seed phrases to external partners but may have logged them in their own centralized servers okay well then they're the external partner uh apologies for getting a bit ahead of myself whether they sent it to a third party or not the fact that they were logging seed phrases in the database anywhere in plain text where it could be hacked that is a massive problem that is so that is terrible don't like saving other people's seed phrases nothing mysterious here it's just a really bad uh wallet provider yeah basically extremely bad wallet providers i mean people were worried that you know there was like a blockchain issue a randomness issue it's like quantum computers it's like hacked people's private keys uh something like this it was so mysterious and it turns out it was just average every day sharing private keys via plain text and that's what screwed it over so mystery solved i guess david do you have any private key advice for us though uh i do i do have one but actually before i do that i would like to actually just shill the coinbase app uh i i don't i'm not logged in because i don't have a coinbase account um but like they have a multi-party computation wallet so you can go and like use your coinbase app as like a centralized uh you know exchange like as everyone does but you can also go and like trade specifically on uniswap or do stuff on maker dow or pull together because coinbase has a multi-party computation wallet built into their app so not only is it like a centralized custodian with you know exchange built in like like we know but it's also a self-sovereign wallet with multi-party computation meaning that they have a shard of your private key your phone also has a shard of your private key so they can restore your private key but they don't have your private key that's crazy so like coinbase doesn't doesn't get enough credit for that uh and so coinbase coinbase app this is and this is not even coinbase wallet this is the coinbase consumer app so like but i i want to go find out more about that wall because that is a really cool feature oh we talked about it on a rollup like remember they they came out with it at the permissions conference yeah i didn't didn't realize they had already rolled it out to the main core consumer app yeah it's great it's great it's it's like um you know there are some pieces of the design that are a bit more centralized than say a smart contract wallet but it's like this nice place in the middle where it's a cool compromise and as you said they're getting it out to uh to users uh right away it's much better than a completely custom custody centralized wallet provider but anyway what do you do wait before that though we had a guest on and who is like uh they were explaining maybe it was mark cuban yeah it was mark cuban he was talking to his friends and like i downloaded coinbase and like i couldn't find like the defy tab there's now literally a d5 tab in the coinbase app and you can do d5 things and from the user perspective they get private keys but they don't even know it it's and they can't lose them it's great it's great anyways uh so here's what i say um i don't this isn't the best advice but it definitely works it's a little bit of a brute force method i say every six months or so i generate a new set of private keys and i rotate my walls and this removes all buildup of smart contract approval risk uh and so i generate my own private keys using using like the my ledger and then every six months ago i just take my assets and i plop them into the new address uh there are ways to achieve these same results if you're worried about approval risk you can just manually unapprove things um uh but also this is another thing to worry about it's not at play in either of these two racks it's just yet another thing you have to worry about yes if you approve a contract that sets permissions to all like that contract can do whatever you want with all of your money um but you can manually revoke those so you like you can get security that way but this also removes like any sort of like accidental internet exposure to my private keys there's been one times i have like a piece of paper i don't have it with me i keep it elsewhere careful opsec sir i have like a piece of paper with every previous seed phrase that i've ever used ever whether i've generated it with metamask whether i've generated it with ledger uh it's got all my historical private keys on it and it's somewhere in the world i'm not gonna say where it's not with me it's not where i live but but like and i the reason why i keep that is for like air drops right like sometimes some air drop happens and i'm like  i have to go like type in all of these like old seed phrases to go check out which one of these addresses is relevant to the air drop and i typed them into metamask and so what was previously a ledger seed phrase becomes like a metamasking phrase making it a hot wallet uh and so like hell hang on i'm basically like putting all of my previous ledger seed phrases into my metamask making it exposed to the internet and so what i do is then i generate a new set of private keys and then you know in the appropriate way not released to the internet and then i make it find a new address and i send all my assets to that brand new address and so it's like always like a rotation of just like you know you can't find me can't catch me can't catch me i do not do any of those things but i'm not sure if your method is like better than what i do um what do you do well yeah i'm not going to disclose that david um but this is the beautiful thing about this is like i can tell like about my uh private management because it doesn't matter because it's always changing yeah so uh i i do think we should have an episode that is just all about like best practices for opsec and private key management like on the bankless journey just you know it's not somebody that needs to disclose what they're doing but it's like what are the best practices 10 best practices different methods practical real world because like this stuff's hard as we call it the bankless journey for a reason like and bad things can happen to you like bridge hacks uh like oracle attacks like economic attacks you have to be careful what you use and suddenly one day if you use the wrong wallet all your money gets stolen like this is not easy stuff right and the rewards are great on the other side as we always say with you know kind of going bankless but um so are the risks the risks are great as well anyway uh that's your strategy that's david's strategy it's a nuclear of a strategy and like there's definitely other ways to achieve the same ends but it's what it's interesting yeah it's definitely cool um all right are we gonna get any tokens david last thing are we gonna get any tokens from a new eth proof of work chain do you think uh some free forked eath before the merge no no you will not yes yeah i mean yes you will have ether proof of work no it will be worth pennies uh there's like a bunch of like people on twitter talking about oh the proof of work chain the proof of work chain we're gonna fork ethereum and get all like this extra tokens an extra eth like no no you're not some what's going to happen is that some people are going to are writing already writing transactions right now that are going to be sent in that very first or second block on the ethereum proof of work chain that sells all of their tokens for ether and uniswap it removes all of their ether from compound and maker it basically there's going to be a massive run on the bank except the bank is proof of work ether so every single token is going to go to zero and there's actually a thread that we should read uh so let's go to the thread by lemonscape and this is mark zelda from ave and goes a short thread about eth proof of work and what is quite like quite likely to happen overnight with a fork a carbon copy of the full ethereum ecosystem appears you have 10 eth well you also have 10 eth proof of work you have a position an ave now you have that same position on proof of work ave so let's begin with the big simple consequences eth proof of work means no proof of stake so stakes eath is now worth zero because it'll never be redeemable because it's on the steak teeth chain on ave proof of work that means there's a 1.5 billion dollar hole in the book because the ave accounts for the value of staked eath but the proof of work sake to eat is goes to zero on maker proof of work that's 100 million dollars of dye backed by zero absolute mayhem by the way that's absolute mayhem yeah all of a sudden all the collateral and all the lending apps goes to zero you can't have any fiat back stable coin doubling the supply obviously overnight so uscc and usdt proof of work supply goes to zero so also collateral maker dow and elsewhere circle and tether can perhaps later support each proof of work but the only way is to issue new erc20 tokens and forget the old ones that's an additional 1.7 billion dollar hole in ave proofs of work that also means that seventy three percent of clador maker dial collateral overnight is worth zero uh so sorry to say but this means that die proof of work and mkr proof of work are now also worth zero because mkr needs to get minted to cover debts in the maker dial system but when your debt is billions of dollars and that that brand new mkr token on the proof of work chain is already worth zero so like you know you have to inflate your token that's already worth zero by infinity making it worth zero even more and so like just massive holes in collateral because like none of these tokens are worth anything on the proof of work basically what's happening is like the token ecosystem the d5 app layer is going to be complete the application layer of the proof of work chain is dividing by zero it is imploding uh on on block number one uh and so uh this also happens for like unit swap sushi swap all your favorite protocols all tokens become worth zero because there's nothing there and so if all the tokens are worth zero what what happens and this is where like the whole run on the bank metaphor comes from uh the agenda for uh yes in conclusion d5 proof of work is dead on arrival uh and so here here's what lemon skate says the agenda for eth proof of work shills amm liquidity will still be around because there will be like uni versus eth pairs on the proof of work chain but if you have any uni tokens you're just going to like remove them all and buy as much eath pow as possible you have stakes tokens pow is the new ether it's kind of the leftover ether yes not unofficially this is what people are calling it so do you have any staked east tokens because those are worth zero so you go to curve proof of work curve and you dump those for eth pow until amms are full of tokens and empty of proof-of-work ether so all tokens are being immediately sold for ether proof-of-work ether because it's the only token that has any like feasible semblance of having any value whatsoever the plan is to collect as many eth proof of work tokens as possible while shilling it on twitter as like the one true eth because that's what people do that's what our like opportunists do and then they wait for tier c centralized exchange listings like polonius deposit it there and then try and dump it on like victims trying to buy buy this shill that's the plan everyone knows it people have been talking about this for years we've known this is gonna be a thing for years and so if you are a listener who's like oh yeah i get like proof of work ether i get some extra ether are you going to be the bot that writes these transactions because this is there's going to be a war on the first and second block of the proof of work ethereum chain to do all of these things and it's all going to be over in two blocks are you the listener capable of fighting that fight and getting your transaction in first ahead of the bots because if you are not then you are not getting anything that's the end of story i still think so yes that is one get out of here what are you doing what do you still think what i still think that uh what could happen is some narrative spinner rises up you know the craig wright of uh pow eth the roger ver some religious figure how jesus rises up and says i will bring you a new narrative for this for this uh asset class this is the true thing and like we've we've just seen this happen so many times david yeah there's been a lot of bitcoin forks um previously most of them have completely failed but a few of them have had some actual like multi-month multi-year shelf lives and those are the ones that are led by kind of some benevolent dictator cult figure you know sort of religious figure there's ultimately i don't know about in roger vera's case but craig writes kids very clearly um manipulating the community and trying to kind of like exit exit scam exit dump them i know it's more complicated than a bitcoin fork because ethereum has this massive defy app layer right but as you said that's going to sort itself out it's going to be completely drained it's all going to go to eth powell there could be a figure that rises up and says i'm going to take this narrative i'm going to push it forward i'm going to create a developer roadmap i'm going to gather some funding i'm going to get the help of eath powell miners and the narrative could have a shelf life longer than a week maybe multiple months ago i really don't care in either case like if that happens then maybe there's some eth pal i can later sell and that's a great thing but i all i would say is i think that is also a possibility possibility this thing fades out in like a day or a week it's also a possibility because we've seen it before some cult leader rises and uh brings a narrative to this chain and gives it some some level of life because we've also seen that before is that gonna be you ryan you're gonna be that cult leader i it's not working it's not me i mean like i do not have that will and uh no interest in doing that but um so there's a there's a video that i like that i think resembles what's going to happen in blocks one and two of uh the proof of work chain and here's a video of a san diego fire fourth of july where they accidentally had like a computer exploit a computer bug uh and instead of having a 45-minute firework show every single firework just went off at once so we had like 45 minutes worth of fireworks all going down in like 30 seconds and that's basically what's going to happen to this proof of workout player you think it's just gonna be short very short show and then it's over yep david what's coming up next all right coming up next uh sailor stepping down as ceo of microstrategy to do what to do what perhaps to buy more bitcoin probably and also tiffany's selling crypto punk jewelry i have a crypto punk will i be getting a tiffany's crypto punk necklace stay tuned to find out but i think you already know but if you don't stick around to find out uh we'll be right back right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change

for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrary or boba networks all right guys we're back and speaking of bridge compromises again ave seems to be stepping back from its multi-chain strategy and why because of some of these bridge compromises that have been happening so um ave stepping back from phantom i believe which is sort of an evm fork uh chain uh mark zeller who we were just talking about um said this yeah lemonscape is the rationale is after the harmony bridge event the recent nomad bridge exploit the ave community should consider the risk benefits of keeping an active ave v3 market on phantom as this network is dependent on any swap multi-chain bridge zeller actually uh in the tweet thread as well he he said he was wrong he said hey i was wrong to be so aggressive on kind of the multi-chain strategy uh and uh yeah that was just really really interesting to hear from him it's like not wrong in a big way but maybe a bit more aggressive during the bull market and now seeing that um hey some of these risks are real and by the way kudos to anyone who ever admits they're wrong in crypto certainly because that is a rare event in and of itself yeah i mean basically this is a classic cost benefit calculation uh is how how much uh fees is avei generating on phantom and how much is that risk of that multi-chain bridge and ave governance this hasn't this isn't a formal thing this is a governance proposal uh but the proposal saying hey the cost to casa rewards is just not there so let's just trim phantom i mean make sense in a bear market where like you know some chains don't really make it so phantom not doing so hot all right moving on sushi swap new head chef is asking for one of all the tokens that are paid to the staff which is a very contentious proposal but there is a dow debate with sushi swap about how well compensated the sushi swap head chef should be i kind of think that sushi swap needs some sort of like highly competent highly centralized leader to like kind of steward this ship especially as we're seeing things kind of like drift off in the bear market uh but sushi swap going through some governance debates right now that's like executive compensation debate in dallas right now that's kind of interesting here's a great thread out of optimism about optimism bedrock which is optimism bedrock coming soon tm and when it does it will change the roll-up game forever it will lay the protocols foundation for years to come and serve as the model for knit roll-up architecture its name is bedrock for good reason there are a few awesome things that this bedrock architecture does for optimism it reduces the l1 to l2 deposit time by 4x and also slashes the cost of data submission by 20 making uh fees 20 cheaper but those are all really cool things that all the users can understand but really the really bullish thing is this third thing cuts the difference with geth down to a slim 500 lines of code uh and so uh kevin fit uh filchner who is on the optimism team he puts this tweet together and goes optimism's bedrock design is the most advanced roll-up architecture ever built it's not a competition bedrock is close to a theoretically optimal on every front optimal transaction fees optimal diff difference optimal networking optimal block production and what what they are mean by optimal is related to this 500 fee difference between optimism bedrock and geth they're trying to get as close to ethereum equivalence as possible and so when we talk about bridge risk and all these smart contract risks when you reduce the lines of code down to something like geth which has been tried and true in ethereum for eight years and running now then you have a stronger and stronger assurances that there's less and less attack surface area and so when i see these words like theoretically optimal on every front i get like really hot and bothered ryan because i love things that are theoretically optimal and so the fewer lines between geth and the layer two the more secure you can feel about using these layer twos uh and the other thing i'll say about this is when you have something that is closer and closer and closer to guess the software that we've already been using ethereum for years you can like bedrock can become like a foundation for a thousand roll-ups to bloom because it's not that complicated it's so simple it's so close to this infrastructure that we've already had so the forkability of bedrock to allow a thousand secure layer twos to bloom is like off the charts so i'm just super bullish about that yeah i am glad that uh optimistic roll ups are innovating and of course uh uh arpa trims nitro is coming up too so it's like bedrock versus nitro and they're both kind of competing for attention and nitro also also something that is trying to emulate guest as well these are the same same design structures yeah very very very similar design structures and patterns and i'm just happy to see them wearing it out for users um david did you know the ethereum chain is seven years old happy birthday eight happy birthday to ethereum yay okay here's a picture of italic and his dad unrelated actually from his birthday yeah definitely related father son uh sure yeah great to see them on something somebody's birthday um bitcoin stuff yeah michael saylor leaves the ceo rule role to assume executive chairman role so michael saylor no longer the ceo of microstrategy has stepped down while a different individual um uh stepped into the ceo of microsoft which makes sense i mean he's become so interested in bitcoin he's much less interested in like you know mike strategy is a business analytics company like you know kind of software for like business dashboards related to bitcoin yeah yeah so he's he's very interested in bitcoin he has like uh 70 percent uh voting majority over microstrategy it's basically he governs microstrategy now has decided to step down to pursue bitcoin initiatives um so don't buy more bitcoin i guess i guess that's what he's doing there's a take from naseem to leb here what is he saying yeah naseem to lab who's all famously anti-bitcoin says how much of the 120 000 bitcoin will they have to sell another nail in the coffin to the will never sell i actually don't think there's any precedent like no like actually they're leaning into buying bitcoin not trying to sell but it's just funny microsoft ideas microstrategy yeah you don't think um like sailor was kind of like asked to to leave or something and go focus on bitcoin if that's what he's so interested in and i think that is what happened they're like sailor like this micro strategy company still needs to do its micro strategy things you become like the chairman of buying bitcoin yeah bitcoin ceo yeah but no nicholas just wants a grave dance even though there's no grave to dance on we'll see anyway i don't know they might sell more bitcoin as a result of this but um hopefully not in the bear market i still i still contend i think microstrategy's bitcoin buys are gonna pay off for them and like these kind of tweets will not hold up well because bitcoin is going to go up in price that's still like the bottom line to me and just people are impatient they always like to point when things are down and say oh it'll never work out and then they never come back and correct themselves right but tiffany's what do they do in the nft space uh they are doing nf tiffs nf tiffany's i guess releasing on august 5th is that tomorrow yeah that is tomorrow uh uh 250 i believe tiffany's crypto punk nft necklaces jeweled necklaces are being released at the low low price of 30 eth 250 limited edition crypto punk necklaces being sold for fifty one thousand dollars at the price of thirty eight what's a crypto punk necklace uh it'll yeah so here here's the video it'll play out wait how much is this what are we looking at fifty one thousand dollars so like a bunch of just an nft so you can't have no no no it's a real necklace it's a real necklace it's a real necklace it's a real oh this is a real real diamonds real rubies yeah it's a real nft part it's it's yours so so you you can't mint any of crypto punk you can have an uh tiffany's necklace of your crypto punk for for 30 eve is this something that is wanted like what's the market for this david well there's only 250 of them and it's one of those things where like if you are somebody who's going to buy one of these things you're going to confuse all the other people who are like why the hell are you buying it like oh it only takes 250 people to like yeah fine i'll buy one of those fifty thousand dollars uh here's a take from audrey aubrey strobel imagine your boyfriend gives you a tiffany box and you open it up and it's a crypto punk i'm sure that they would just love that that would be so great for them i'm sure they would just be overjoyed there's someone out there though that's gonna buy one and be happy to receive one uh maybe just have to find that special someone david yeah right yeah all right keep on looking magic eden oh my god they changed their twitter handle to magic ethan first of all what is magic eden and yeah it's a solana nft platform it's like the open sea of solana what are they doing they are now becoming the magic eden of ethereum so they are integrating ethereum into their nft platform uh it seems like wise expansion strategy yep um what do we got here david it's shaq yeah yeah so this is like of course i am sure triggered some of like the solana maxis out there i was like oh you guys are abandoning salon are going to ethereum even though they are just trying to make the best nft platform that exists uh and shaq replies to the sweet shaquille o'neal replies to the tweet and says i wonder and people wonder why i took dot soul out of my name i didn't even know shaq had soul in his name um right ryan commenting saying but you didn't add dot eth um 1700 likes on that um is shaq wearing a what it looks like some sort of like ape as his profile picture what do you think he's saying this is not clear to me why did he take that soul out of his name is it because you can scroll down and there will be a little bit more of a conversation uh he says there's no point in picking a side anymore everyone needs to stop tearing each other down well and then evan van ness says no one needs to tear solana down it's always down cheese man burn culture in encrypted twitter is great uh what's rainbow doing it's the wallet and nft speaking more nft stuff now supporting nft's on mainnet polygon arbitrage and optimism uh for some reason saying thank you treasure dow for the gift i'm wondering oh they got they got a little um some small uh the treasure dow is an ecosystem nfc ecosystem on armatrom anyways nfts on a rainbow wallet that's cool uh optimistic nfts arbitrage from nfts on rainbow wallet uh and what do we got here aspect uh mainnet is this nfts for starknet yeah nfts on starknet the uh the uh generalized uh zk rollup platform out of starkware uh so cool that means super cheap nfts super cheap super fast uh regulation let's talk about this really quick so robin hood was just fined 30 million dollars from the new york state department of financial services nydfs and why were they charged for this it looks like some sort of money laundering um issue what did they do yeah they said the nf nydfs charged robin hood because they were inadequately staffed didn't have sufficient resources to address risks risks and failed a timely transaction from a manual transaction monitoring system to one that was adequate for its user size and transaction volume basically not adequately monitoring like aml and money laundering um shenanigans i have no takes on this kind of you know new york state department's always a bit um you know crypto unfriendly i would say so i wouldn't be surprised if they're blowing a big small thing out of proportion but also i do not know uh but this is cool david a senate bill that would hand bitcoin an ether oversight to the commodities regulator the cftc basically institute by law and say that ether and bitcoin are commodities it's kind of a reigning gary gensler in the sec back i know there's like the sec's never given us a super straight take on whether ether is a commodity or a security or how they view it they've been a bit more um clear on bitcoin as as being a commodity but we sort of need this legislation it's a bit of reigning in from the sec to at least say these two assets we know clearly are commodities right and this follows from i think hester person a few others takes of saying like good crypto regulation is ultimately going to come from congress not these three-letter agencies that we do not elect uh and so if congress could go ahead and please approve this one that would be great gary gensler nina booboo get your hands off our commodities and yet uh i gotta give credit where it's due the sec this this week charged uh charged a um group called uh for such forsage force forces force i don't know forsage um this was a 300 billion crypto ponzi scheme and i vaguely remember this it was just blatantly a ponzi so kind of big connect level stuff and this is the sort of thing that we want the sec to do it's like there's so many bad guys and clear scams in the crypto space please help us go catch them right right like go after them give us clarity give the the good actors in the space sandbox a playground and go chase after the clear scammers because there's enough of that work to go do and this is an example of them doing that doing the right thing going after a clear ponzi scheme well done thank you gary uh you did something great david can you believe this is still happening so like insult to injury what's happening here celsius admits customer emails linked in third party data breach so not only did you lose your money but you also lost your privacy with celsius two for one punch oof thanks guys babel financed 280 million dollar loss people finances a c5 crypto lender we've seen them before uh lost 250 uh dollar uh 280 million dollars in customer funds doing trading they're trying to trade their way into profit but they traded their way into losses with their customers funds with their customers another c5 company uh more popular in asia david uh some good news on the releases front coinbase prime is now offering ethereum staking to institutions in the u.s more staking uh heating up what is the swell network here david yeah swell network is also part of the ethereum staking world uh lido rocket pool stakewise a few others but also swell network soon this is a kind of a highly anticipated staking as a service uh uh like dao kind of like kind of like lido but also a little bit like rocket pool uh main net release uh candidate uh is now live uh which means that they are only one step away from mainnet go live uh so i'm very excited for swell also we know that gamestop has been working with immutable but now that relationship is formally intertwined with a gamestop wallet and so the gamestop nfc ecosystem and the immutable layer 2 system are now integrated and so you can only imagine that like the uh immutable x layer two is going to be facilitating the marketplace for gamestop getting a little bit closer to that here i think the wallet has been based on loop ring so it looks like they're using multiple layer twos as their strategy not just loop ring but also uk roll-ups though yeah absolutely uh david on the on the raises front uh variant fund this is a fund um from jesse um who else is on jesse walden legion yeah yes lee jen of course 450 million dollars to support the leading founders in web3 this is kind of the the the creator economy type of investment and they just raised 450 million dollars so uh impressive raise yeah um garyvee from v friends just closed a round with a16z crypto so this is a 50 million dollar round that's what i believe that's a lot of money that's a lot for gary vee's nft project um yeah kind of impressive valuations happening during the bear market still too so i guess there's money there's raises what does that mean for jobs david that there are jobs if there's money and there's raises then there are jobs that's how it works let me read a few out the first from boardroom labs they're looking for a software engineer over dow governance manticore games a manager of crypto marketing that's on top of this we're looking for thread orders you can write a good twitter thread uh yeah like as as we are but apparently we don't have time to write enough threads vertex protocol a marketing coordinator that's not technical bank list we're looking for a ux ui designer bank is also we need a senior newsletter uh engineering crypto streams a financial analyst steak fish smart contract software engineer also a back-end software engineer also a blockchain marketer also a devops engineer and the bankless academy is hiring a product manager there's a ton more jobs here you can go find them at the bottom wait wait wait there's a head of marketing at pleaser dow i just want to shout that one out uh also got to be a very very cool job 100 to 200 000 salary head of marketing at pleaserdale come join the dow uh a willy wonka pleaser dao is the people's louvre and the 21st century and a willy wonka willy wonka factory combined that's very attractive only in crypto only in crypto all right when we get back some questions from the bankless nation what's the safest token to dollar cost average into over the next 12 months also the best advice for actually getting a job in crypto and some hot takes from crypto twitter as usual we'll get right to those things but first we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave brave dot com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started alright guys we are back and just a reminder if you have a question for dave and myself to read out on the roll up make sure you follow banklesshq on twitter every wednesday tweet goes out and asks for those questions here's the first question from madge80.eth if you had to monthly dollar cost average into one asset for the next 12 months what would it be except eth i'm thinking rpl that's the rocketpool token and uni of course gotta say none of this is financial advice it's asking david's personal opinion from an entertainment perspective myself entertaining answer i want yes i want the real answer but also it's fine if it's entertaining david i actually genuinely want to know what would you buy besides eat right now you know i i think madge is on to something with uni i think that is if we're not talking about ether and we're not counting stakes ether which i'm assuming we're not uh then the uni token definitely comes next and the reason why is i feel like very arguably the safest is because it's generating the most fees and so that i feel like is a great definition of safety like right now uh uniswap generated one point million dollars today in 24-hour fees uh and there's already discussions on the unswept governance forum about turning on the fee switch so like we're getting there and so if we're going to find like what is the best asset for the next 12 months to buy it's the one with fees the ones that come after that like ave gmx also surprisingly up there um and so like you know tokens with fees are bullish uh and so there's probably some analysis to be done about like how much fees is the protocol generating compared to how big that market cap is with a with a controlling function of how much revenue how much percentage can that protocol capture as a result of those fees some analysis to be done there um rocket pool great token because the the merged trade but is the merge trade gonna last for 12 months i'm not sure but unit swap fees will definitely last for 12 months yeah i i kind of agree so it's like i'm gonna ignore a bitcoin because i actually think i would still prioritize defy tokens right now over bitcoin and maybe that's for the first time ever i would have generally my answer is ethan bitcoin those are the assets to dollar cost average into but if like you're gonna ask my personal opinion it would probably be some of those blue chip defy assets like i like uni and ave know they're gonna be around very strong although i also like a lot of the strong layer two projects that have tokens right now i feel like that's a decent bet uh and i would pick those over the alternative layer one bet even though like yeah salon is gonna survive uh obviously cosmos they're all going to survive but i still feel like layer 2 is being unappreciated so you got matic token you got op some of those things as well i would consider dollar cost averaging into some of those as well but you know this isn't necessarily the question that's like what's the um the token the asset that you're going to make the most money on over the next right 12 months this is more the one that you're going to kind of buy and hold yeah risk from a risk reward perspective good question i do think that even it's like rpl and like lido and stakewise are all benefiting from uh like the merge trade yeah i think general defy tokens that like uni swap and synthetics are also going to benefit from just like the beta of the merge like ether goes up staking as a service tokens goes up but then ethereum apps are also going to go up just it's going to be like an ethereum rotation so i think the the beta is in heavily favored of the ethereum ecosystem at the moment yeah i would say that too and i do like some of those staking tokens as well and start to classify them as close to blue chip um all right here's another question david from patrick dudley what advice would you give a college student looking to get a job in crypto after they graduate i'm going to my senior year at sdsu and really want to pursue a career in crypto yeah the definitely the unequivocally best advice for getting a drop in crypto if you want to get a job the formula is as simple as this write really good threads on twitter people are doing this if you want to get a job at a fund funds will like notice you on twitter if you want to get a job at bank list we are literally hiring a tweet threader people that can write threads and get like a thousand likes and just generate a following and capture capture attention on twitter if you can do that you will be handed a job on a silver platter okay so for people who aren't on twitter though like what what does it take to actually write a thread david what does a thread do on twitter right so it distills information down and like the the reason why twitter is what it is in this crypto space is that it forces big ideas to be like condensed and collapsed and concentrated down to into a very short a single tweet 280 characters and so what you are doing when you are writing a tweet thread is you are learning how to communicate and explain things with extreme extremely small packages uh and so that's just good efficient communication so it's basically like a litmus test for can you communicate very very well if you can thread well you can communicate well if you can communicate well that's like the meta skill and so people are judging other people's like abilities to like do good work by their ability to write threads yeah i'm gonna plus one that also forces you to go digest some complicated information and break it down uh atomically so you have to really understand it if you're going to publish a thread and then of course because twitter is a social network it's basically your online resume right you can tweet people to do it yeah get off of linkedin get onto twitter totally uh that's where that's where crypto is that's where you're getting noticed i've seen so many people launch their career by doing that is um you know becoming threatened and then you you start to write in other areas or you get hired by a vc company or you know whatever your whatever your main skill set is um that's the way to launch both me and ryan like launched our public personas on twitter and then we found each other on twitter and then we started bank lists on twitter and now we're hiring tweet threaders for twitter it's yeah it's like there's just such serendipity to it um you got to be part of it you can't you can't ignore uh twitter right now um all right david let's get to some takes first from balaji this is uh i'm going to read it out from balaji srinivasan actually podcast episode coming with him on monday that is a do not miss episode we talk about concepts like this but here's what he's tweeting the real lining from red versus blue to orange versus green decentralized network versus centralized state internationalists and capitalists versus nationalists and socialists the cloud versus the land and bitcoin versus the dollar and he's showing that political compass square maybe you can describe this image for us what we're seeing here david yeah the political compass is on the left you have the left on the right you have the right so liberals on the left conservatives on the right yeah politically but top to down you have authoritarianism versus libertarianism uh and so like we've what we've said on bank lists bankless isn't a left or right movement but it is an individual versus like uh versus authoritarian movement so we lean down towards like the libertarian side of things uh although we do appreciate structure uh it's definitely like prioritizing the individual over like the state uh and so what balaji is saying is that what is previously like a red versus blue left versus right phenomenon is slowly turning into a a 99 versus one percent which he's resembling as bitcoin versus the dollar the dollar being the state bitcoin being the people uh and so i i think that makes sense especially as we've been putting this into a context of uh of um uh the end the end of a cycle of nation state power where like the nation state is no longer concerned about like do we want to be conservative or do we want to be progressive we are now just like all right who's capturing all the value is it the individual or is it the the incumbents uh and so uh this is this is the instead of left versus right bilaterally saying it's top versus down yeah and this goes into his idea a book he recently come up with that we as we talk about at length is a book called the network state and he's really pinning this is it's kind of the authoritarian nation state versus the people's network state uh anyway really fascinating conversation with him uh stay tuned for that on monday uh david a tweet from sassel anthony cesano what's he saying yeah first he says first layer twos won't work and are useless technology and now it's if layer twos get big enough it will become its own layer one and abandon ethereum if this is the first time you've heard this take it means you need to get on twitter when and saswell finishes saying when you see the goal post move like this it means the critics never actually knew what they were talking about in the first place do you know what else do you know what this also means i think is i think the rotators are rotating into layer two or they're getting ready to and that's why they're seeding this as the next kind of narrative i think the alt one trade is somewhat dormant right now somewhat over for the time being and now the l2 narrative trade is on so what do you have to do you have to um prop up layer twos and their value accrual mechanisms from a narrative perspective and and put down eth uh in order to get that trade going so i think they'll probably be effective and i'm starting to see some of the rotators rotate in of course stator's going to rotate oh he's going to miss suzu in three hours capital the ultimate line rotators um not going to happen this cycle though this is a vitalik tweet what's he saying yeah vitalik says call out scammers you get hate in the moment but time vindicates you even if you're some ceo with quote reputation and need for quote professionalism do it anyways and be savage people look up to you and your warning will be taken seriously is this metallic speaking be sad this is metallic yeah be savage yeah so vitalik called out the force age people the people that just got charged with the sec forever ago uh and so and then he got attacked probably this i think this is a chinese community chinese project maybe i don't know um which is why i didn't really hear about it but uh he said he's alluding to how he got attacked by the force age community probably uh but now now they're being charged with running a ponzi scheme so who's laughing in the end he said this about forsake back in 2020 please leave and don't pollute the ethereum ecosystem in the future thank you thank you very metallic thing to say what do you think about this is it incumbent on the community to call out scammers more often well one thing i struggle with about this david is um sometimes the term scammer gets overused right right i think in this case it was like very clearly a scammer so maybe it's maybe when something is very clearly kind of black in the black category there's no there's no gray about it that's the time to pile on but it was not clear to me for example if we if we start putting like luna and tara into that category whether luna and terra was a complete scam at the time i thought it was like a flawed mechanic and like a like a very risky broken thing to invest into and i didn't think it would work long term but i can't necessarily call that a scam i don't think that vitalik is talking about that category of things is he i think so like it was definitely one of the things that i learned out of 2020 is that like my intuitions are better than i thought they were and so like you know i got into that fight with danny sesta from wonderland uh and then like his army like descended on me and like made me put my tail between my legs because of like twitter drama and then and then he blew up and if i had been like had a like a little bit more like confidence and conviction it's like yo this is not right i might be would have said something same thing with do quan just repeat it it's like got attacked by dokwan it's like damn this their army is really loud i don't really wanna don't really wanna like pick my head up and then boom they blow up if i had a little bit more of just like i don't really give a about you i'm gonna be proven right in the long term then i think i would have gotten more credit than we did even though we did like call out uh call out tara i think decently i think we could have done it better all right so maybe dave is gonna lean into that a little bit more i'm still probably gonna veer a bit more conservative like i think i think uh vitalik's right for calling out something like this but sometimes i am wrong right like sometimes it's not like the mechanic does actually work in the in the long run anyway i think there's time for me at least me personally like a period of skepticism before i start using the s word but then there are things that are very clearly scammed like for example celsius some people are saying celsius was a scam i just didn't have enough information to know whether it was or not right but like it turns out it was i don't know stuff like that there's a lot in the gray area just a scam egregiously mismanaged i think it i think that verge is on scam of like alex machinski calling himself a uh d5 bank and then yeah calling himself yeah right yes calling himself yeah that makes sense yeah yeah um yeah all right take from me i say this it's true people don't care about decentralization there's a lot of talk about that this week a lot of talk about people not caring about decentralization and i said it's true people don't care about decentralization people don't care about decentralization until they get mount goxed or suzued or dokwand or machinskid they don't care because they're new and haven't been screwed yet eventually people care about decentralization when i got into crypto very beginning i didn't care very much about decentralization you know what i cared about david number go up number go up like it was like i cared about other things this idea of bitcoin you know um sovereign money but i didn't understand the intricacies of like why decentralization matters until i started see to see things in in the crypto space i you know read about the mount gox um see kind of the centralization vectors and i do think people start to care about it over time but they don't start with that position as their default they have to kind of learn it uh sometimes by being in crypto for a period of time of course as one does that's my take what's yours uh i think this was my take last week but uh here's my take the best thing that could ever happen to crypto a fees driven bull market aka a sustainable and rational bull market is that like too much to ask is a rational bull market why is that more rational because if it's fees driven it means it's revenue driven i mean if it's revenue driven this is how we've been like uh like measuring assets since like the beginning of time is fundamentals it's it's asking for a fundamentals driven bull market can we have one of those please real people are paying for the service yes and it's actually providing real problems not based on speculation owners of the asset yeah that would be pretty healthy that would feel pretty good i would like that you think we're gonna get it i have this please is it that crazy david only wants one thing for christmas driven bull market yeah some people think it's cringe ryan that we read out our own tweets as takes of the week no really yeah well maybe some people think it's great whatever we do is cringe i should i should read out your tweets and you read out my tweets that's what we usually do yeah and they're called takes of the week so all right we have takes sometimes yeah yeah i feel like we have good takes sorry for the cringe guys uh ooty i'm sorry for the cringe uh david people don't know that metaphor what are you excited about this week uh i'm excited for tokens ryan there's a bunch of tokens that this is my uh coin gecko watch list uh and so uh these are the tokens i'm currently looking at and there's a bunch of them that are up bigly stakewise up 107 percent in seven days optimism up 90 euler up 69 nice yearn up 51 again about fees gmx up 42 i don't own any of that but perhaps i should look into how much fees it's making because it's making a bunch of fees rocket pool and lido both up 32 and 37 percent immutable x a layer two up thirty percent uh you know swap up ten percent i just feel like it's eth maxi token season right now and it's just making feel really good and like there's like a almost an oxymoron about ethmaxy token season because like if you're an ethnoxy then you only buy eth but that's not exactly true because if you're an eth maxi quote unquote then you also must believe in the tokens in the ecosystem so when i see all of like these tokens that are heavily aligned with the ethereum protocol going up i'm like nice are you gonna like how much of these would you sell eat for in order to get in though that's the harder part right fiat's easy but which of these are going to continue to go up in each denominator terms it's always hard that's the hardest part it's always hard i don't know whenever i get to that point i'm like i don't want to sell my right ryan what are you bullet john uh i am bullish on the ethereum road map so we obviously have like uh if you zoom out we have the merge coming up right that's an economic upgrade so we get 90 issuance reduction more security we talked about that um our discussion with polenia uh around eip4844 this past week made me excited about kind of the the next upgrade of ethereum so first we have an economic upgrade with the merge but hopefully fingers crossed the hard fork after that will get something like eip4844 which makes roll-ups a thousand x cheaper potentially when you add all of the roll-up compression techniques with um eip four eight four four you get a thousand x cheaper roll ups this according to polenia um that's big so we got first economic upgrade yeah and then we got a scalability upgrade and then david we just had a conversation with um stefan from flashbots this week about mev that's maximum extractable value mitigations and that is kicking in right after the merge it's a long story but flashbots has a project called mev boost that all validators will use that also generates more returns for anyone who who uses it as as a staker but i'm actually really excited about the mev protection that's going to be baked into ethereum at the protocol level as well this is called protocol builder separation pbs and that is coming sometime after eip 4844 in the future all this to say i've probably never been more excited about the ethereum roadmap and the reason i'm most excited is because um i feel like we finally got our together on it like from an like actually defined there was a while where like honestly ethereum didn't have it together right from a very long perspective 20 late 2019 was when it finally came together yeah we didn't have like kind of the monetary policy was like i don't know we'll wait for proof of stake we have that figured out with the merge scalability i don't know plasma state channels what's it going to be no now we have a path roll-up centric uh roadmap eip4844 like that's within sight uh how are we going to solve this mev problem mev boost pbs like the roadmap's looking good these days i'm pretty bullish on it yeah no it's looking good and it also makes like fundamental sense kind of like going back to what kelvin finchner was saying about the three theoretical like maximum like there are things about the ethereum roadmap the design philosophy that is just like the theoretical best way to execute on an idea um and i don't have enough time to go into that right now but i'll tease an article that i think is coming out next week which is what you're alluding to which is about the blockchain supply chain as in like how a block becomes produced on ethereum and where the value goes in that supply chain and how it ultimately always converges down to each stakers um and so i think we are bullish on the same thing brother all right what's uh the mean of the week this week what are we looking at name of the week meme of the week we are is a top gun poster uh top gun maverick but instead we got nancy pelosi in this f-18 zooming her way to taiwan why like for people who haven't been watching the news what's the context for this yeah nancy pelosi went to taiwan of her own accord interestingly after her husband bought a bunch of calls in taiwan semiconductor businesses right before a bill went to congress so that's a different story but then nancy pelosi of her own accord not as a part of her job as secretary of state or whatever she is speaker of the house decides to go to taiwan and thoroughly pisses off china who is now now as a result doing military exercises in that region as well so nancy pelosi just going rogue top gun maverick style getting her getting herself into taiwan and pissing off the two biggest super powers or one of the biggest superpowers in the world nice job well the 2020s geopolitical tension that's going to be fun um i feel like we need that guys uh as always it's been great to have you of course crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not
