[Music] hey bankless nation happy first week of november david what time is it oh it's a friday weekly roll up time because like always it's always a crazy week in crypto and so we are going to roll that week up in the friday bankless weekly roll up david you're on the road right now you're in new york city nft nyc that's a nft conference how's that going man what's the vibe been like uh i actually don't know because i never went to a single nft uh conference event i've only been going to the peripheral satellite events and those have been absolutely fantastic uh we'll talk a lot about a lot more at the end but uh yeah i listened to the famous wu-tang album that got bought by pleaser dao oh my god how was it at this uh i mean i wasn't i'm not really the biggest wu-tang fan okay uh the first song pretty good next two songs whatever did you think people liked it the wu-tang people really liked it and then like there's like the fourth song that had this great like trumpet riff and the whole entire room was just like five into that song by the way this is playing off the same like this is a cd right it's a compact yes it's a cd yeah okay it's like what happens if that thing gets scratched okay so it is scratched because freaking shkreli used it as a coaster he used the cd as a coaster so he scratched the out of the face sorry uh yeah dude why would he do that because he's and and that's his brand cartoon villain yeah see it's it's literally just a the perfect level of a villain so it has some like uh i guess some scratches in it does the the the track skip try to remember it sounded great yeah no like and the the acoustics in the room were phenomenal yeah yeah overall it's been it's been a great week seeing seeing a lot of people like like always at all conferences that i i only see online but got to see them in uh in real life uh met cami russo in in person so that was great chatted with her for a while uh yeah always always a good time at the crypto conference are people feeling like um bullish on nft still is like i i mean it's been a phenomenal year it's got to be feeling bullish right but what's the volume people were people were just like oh guys is this the top remember in 2018 coin desk where we had the lambos outside of the conference like there's like toppy conversations going on but there have been toppy conversations going on in crypto for like i don't know a year and happy conversations in like for nft specifically like march or april remember and you know people felt like and then there was kind of a lull and then it came back even stronger i don't know what's your personal take on this yeah apparently at the conferences there are a lot of people like pitching terrible nft ideas yeah i heard some some person was trying to pitch somebody else about um uh supporting uh afghan women oppressed by the taliban using the stellar network like when's the last time you've heard about the stellar network ryan like oh like the things that it doesn't make any sense yeah that always happens there are some weird shenanigans going around apparently that was closer to the actual nfc conferences not the not the satellite events so i didn't i didn't get the the full face of that but there was a number of like parties like uh the the audience party i was at and a few other the like related nft events i didn't recognize a single person it was extreme and like that that was a common through line of all the friends that i've known in crypto for the last few years different a lot of us completely different crowd like brand new brand new people and we have a take to talk about yeah we do have to take here's your brand new brand new people that are no one is familiar with like getting into into the world for the first time yeah i feel like that's especially true of nfts anyway guys we have a fantastic show for you today on the roll up we're talking about a few things first of all facebook with the name change pulling a prince on us actually not changing their name to a symbol but uh facebook becomes meta what's up with that a pivot into the metaverse also some airdrops coming your ways if you are a dot eth have a dot eth domain ens we're going to talk about that also there was a crypto punk that sold for 500 million dollars not mine sadly half a billion that wasn't yours that's right david would sell his crypto puck i was that you know gonna ask that but we talked about that a few roll ups ago you would sell for 500 million dollars i would sell for five hundred million dollars okay i would and uh if there's any takers out there mcdonald's with the mcrib nft that doesn't feel toppy at all does it quentin tarantino as well we mentioned that the matrix releasing nfts as well and read it with the biggest web 3 pivot ever we're going to cover all of that in more on the weekly rollups as you know this comes at you every friday morning we try to pack as much the week in crypto into your mind as possible david before we get into the main show gotta talk about a couple of things the first is this permissionless conference tickets okay this is a big d5 metaverse conference that we are putting on next year with our friends at block works website's just been updated the tickets are now released there might not be any left i gotta i gotta warn you so tickets were released maybe a little earlier this week and i'm not sure if they're going to be left by the time you listen to this uh every two weeks could they get they get released every week there's always a new cycle yeah yeah batch release so if you didn't get it this time uh get them next time but the thing is they increase in price every single two weeks so you want to get them early if you can i think the price now is 418. when we started the price was 15 15.59 you might recognize those digits 15.59 but now it's 418 okay this is just going to keep going up if you are a bankless subscriber of course a premium member you get a discount on this a 30 discount what's the value of that it's a 100 100 and something dollars hundred and it also keeps on going up keeps on going up as well so make sure you catch that um the the speakers are gonna be hot the tracks are amazing david and i are helping to plan all of this so uh check out that conference also another thing to check out is the dharma wallet david you want to tell them about dharma wallet yeah dharma wall is the easiest way to get you and your friends into the world of crypto into the world of defy uh if you guys have gotten into crypto without darmra you probably went the route of sending your money to coinbase or gemini which takes a while takes like seven days then you have to buy ether send that to your to your metamask or your ledger and then if you want to go onto polygon you got to send it to make an l1 transaction to polygon then you need to get gas on the polygon network that's a whole mess then you have to prove it the old days the old days but no longer for because the dharma wallet will do all of this for you in just two to three minutes you can connect you with your actual bank account with plaid which again is just like logging into your bank account and then you can send money into the polygon network uh it's a smart contract wallet it's connected into polygon and they have a ton of cool features so it is the fastest portal to get fiat money into the world of crypto where it belongs download dharma no no gas fees there's a link in the show notes uh and i believe that if you sign up with the link in the show notes uh you'll get airdropped 50 worth of ether on the polygon network to get your life on an l2 started so go check that out yeah you got to make a purchase but if you make a purchase above five hundred dollars you get fifty dollars in free eat on polygons so check that out using the link in the show notes all right david you ready to get to it man yeah market time market time let's talk bitcoin what are we doing bitcoin had a flatish week up a little bit up a little bit started the week at sixty thousand dollars which was the low hit a high of sixty four thousand dollars and currently at sixty two thousand dollars so up roughly four or five percent on the week good job bitcoin four or five percent not too bad but eth another story all-time high week for eth a few all-time highs were hit this week i feel like celebrating every single one of them where are we right now and what was all-time high david yeah e started at four thousand two hundred dollars the new all-time high of four thousand six hundred and seventy-five dollars was hit a little bit more uh more than 24 hours ago but roughly 36 hours ago the time of recording we are currently clocking in at 4 485 next milestone is 5k i feel like uh you know that that's coming right up but are we up how much are we up on the week we are up uh 15 on the week it looks like we dipped a little bit before i wrote that number down so maybe about like 13 or 14 why do you think this is like the facebook meta news not to front run that we're going to talk about that in news a little bit but do you think there's a metaverse story connected here or do you think this is just uh the market kind of catching up to what eath should be there are so many stories about what you should be there's nfts there's the metaburst metaverse there's there's defy there's scaling there's the merge ultra scalable ethereum like people are getting that wrapped their heads wrapped around that there's so many stories to tell you to tell why this number is going up uh and uh you know a lot of stories means a lot of reasons for a number to go up i still think it's low to be honest i still think the price of is undervalued even at these prices um but you guys know that if you've been hanging out with bank lists for any time soon we are ultra bullish on this asset the listeners are like we know guys it's like shut up already okay we know we already have our bags back all right uh eat bitcoin ratio what that what is that looking like david yeah again three green weeks in a row for the east bitcoin ratio clocking in at point zero seven three four uh and so ever since the bitcoin etf the bitcoin ether ratio has done really really well uh and again that has has not spent very very little time higher than this especially in the last six months but also definitely ever uh wow david are we getting close to we're getting close to like the two year three year maybe yeah all-time high for the ratio exactly yeah so that's a lot a lot of people i know i know anthony suzanna pays attention to this ratio a lot and like i know he's like he's like waiting for that to break through he's frothing at the mouth yeah he's like he's like just don't tweet don't don't yeah this is one to uh continue watching but like this is also an indicator i would say of the um continued crypto bull run right if this ratio is gaining steam then it means bull run in full effect um this is another bull run indicator but dude wait this number is way down today total loss value i'm gonna go with it that's a bug pulse broken graph oh you know actually you know what that was uh go down to ave that might have been a lot of people withdrawing from ave no way uh yeah because they're always number two now uh uh ave had that bug exploit which got fixed so nothing bad happened but a lot of people pulled funds look at this this happened from november third to to the fourth right and we went down 105 billion to 87 billion for those who you can't see on the screen um obviously i'm going to go with that so that's a bug does feel like a buggage but so let's call it we're still above i think we're still above 100 billion let's say that that means we can make up these numbers right we want it to be over 100 billion so therefore it is this week how do you feel like it should be ryan i feel like this should be a trillion to be honest but you know i'm going to be conservative on today's episode we'll wait we'll bite our time how about the d5 pulse index this is an index of the top defy tokens the blue chips as it were up or down on the week up up up on the week finally the dpi had a great week this week up 9 on the week started the week at thirty 330 end of the week at roughly 375 dollars signs of life david are you liking that some signs of life here uh how about this like ether has way more signs of life than dpi so we're still going down on the dpi to ether ratio huh yeah yeah i mean it put it put a little bit of a bottom again not a bottom bottom but like hit point zero seven eight uh climbed up to point zero eight five but again it is a nice linear slope down but just remember folks david reminded us last time if you swap out those d5 tokens for another set of defy tokens and retrofit the data then david was still right about this ratio exactly right david's never wrong that should be the takeaway here uh not d5 season yet or at least it's more east season than it is d5 season so uh to the extent that remains the case this ratio continues to drop a little bit but let's talk about the best of all worlds which is the bed index bankless bed index that is bitcoin eth and the dpi all inside one token that's a third a third a third what are we looking at on the week yeah bed had a good week because it is the best uh index in all of d5 start of the week at 172 hit a new high of 192 dollars currently clocking in at 181 overall up uh how much percent on the week uh i don't know five percent five percent percent call that five so guys of course you know you can get into bed get with this index it's a simple purchase go to the index co-op dot com website slash your bed and uh purchase that it's actually up 60 over the 90 days in terms of close to 60 uh in terms of um you know the 90 day increase in this index so it's starting to get closer to being sort of a staple type index of the crypto markets which is awesome to see all right let's look at layer two beat as well this tracks how much value is locked inside of true layer twos those are chains that are backed by the economic security guarantees of the ethereum network david just added a cool 1 billion dollars in the past week from last week to this week getting close to 5 billion dollars pretty crazy clocking in at 4.93 billion dollars up 21 on the week arbitrarum up 20 in total value locked in layer two's optimism clocking in at plus 85 percent on the week almost doubling the value loss and optimism a lot of cool things are happening on optimism optimism breaking through that 500 million dollar level so congratulations to the team also loopering clocking in at a doubling and 98 off yeah i think speculation yeah because something to do with a uh gamestop and loop ring integration oh they did make some key hires right yeah yeah so that's that's interesting and also my again my one equity uh that i don't that might the one thing that i own that's not crypto gme stocks it's all related isn't it it's all it all comes back to crypto what's cool about this i think is particularly with arbitrary and optimism we're seeing this growth without a token incentive right so we're seeing so many other layer one uh communities different layer ones not ethereum giving away like millions hundreds of millions of dollars in token incentives to come yield farm uh on their um on their chains all right and optimism in arbitration are not doing this and they're still getting like massive growth uh week over week so that's good to see wait till they dial up the tokens if they ever do we'll see what happens there um also ultrasound money eth is becoming ultrasound money and just passed a big milestone what is that david three quarters of one million ether has been burned as of this week seven hundred and sixty one thousand ether that's more ether than i have closing in on the one million ether mark a little bit more huh just a little bit just past just past uh david's bags here um this is cool too i wanted to actually correct this because i think i said that last week i think i said that um eth had 10x the transaction fees over the past seven days with bitcoin and i was actually wrong and someone reminded me of this um ethereum actually had 100x the transaction fee revenue of bitcoin over a seven day period of time so i was like you know 10x off on that number i knew it was a lot bigger but um over the last seven days look man ethereum had 50 almost 50 million dollars worth of transaction fee revenue and back to what we said last week what do blockchains do blockchain sell blocks this is their transaction fee revenue and um i guess a year ago two years ago um it was like a fight between bitcoin and eth like every day like who's kind of going to have more transaction fee revenue here's bitcoin a very distant um number on this chart uh not even not even a million dollars in transaction fee revenue over the past uh seven days so it's super interesting to see right the thesis for ethereum has always been you make black block space more valuable then the asset becomes more valuable and of course eip1559 kick that into into high gears so that there's this immediate feedback loop but it's it seems to be the case that this is happening um revenue numbers going up for ethereum block space any other takes on this david yeah there is a direct connection between the amount of fees your blockchain collects and the soundness of the money and if you uh have not yet learned how to articulate that association there's a ton of stuff to go and read on the bankless newsletter letter ultra scalable ethereum ultrasound money with justin drake tons of things so make sure you understand the relationship between block space demand and soundness of the money it's really important concept the only one that's closest is finance smart chain and like i don't even know what they do with your numbers um let's talk about this too last week was actually the first week that ethereum actually had negative issuance david we've seen some milestones on this ultrasound money thing in the past in fact like the first day i remember a uh an individual block it was the first day of the first two days after eip1559 an individual block that had negative issuance i remember being really excited to see that like it's happening but now we're hitting all of these milestones uh talk about this for a minute yeah yeah i think it was like just a couple hours after eip159 everyone was scraping the block ether scan trying to find the first ultrasound block yeah that's right that's right it took people a couple hours and then i think just a couple weeks later we had our first ultrasound day where the full or no we had uh just a couple yeah a couple weeks later we had our first ultrasound hour where every uh all the blocks over the hour had were ultrasound they're burning collectively more ether than was being issued a couple weeks after that we had our first ultrasound day 24 hours of more ether being burned than was being issued we have now hit our first week of total issuance going down rather than up due to ether burn and so at some point we're going to be repeating this but it's going to be a month and then at some point it'll just be every month moving forward into the future uh ryan are we seeing the current limit of the ether supply right now like that could that could be happening as of this week that's what ether capped out that is a possibility that's true i mean uh justin drake when he put some numbers on this predicted this in april he's he thought that ether supply would never get above 120 million and i don't know what the total supply looks like but but you're right we're at it right now the total supply is a hundred and eighteen point two million so over under audit do we ever hit 120 million what do you think oh under yeah i definitely uh under for sure because this isn't even getting started yet okay once the merge happens so like we're maybe six months away for that it's over it's done it's gone right so a reduction of four percent this is an immediate reduction of four percent annualized issuance so we're going to be ultrasound month every single month every year i wouldn't be surprised if we start to get ultrasound decades david under our belts with this i mean we'll see what this is as soon as we hit the merge it's just ultrasound now and for forever yeah so it's just it's just a race to get to the merge unless you think block space ethereum block space is going to drastically decrease in demand is there any world where that happens i i don't think so and there's a there's a take that we have later to talk about what happens when you increase the block space available people just use more of it yeah uh and so like even with charting we're going to increase the amount of blocks available people are just going to use more they're going to transact more and that's the thing it's not even going to be humans it's going to be other chains that are actually using this block space and being secured by it absolutely there's uh there's no coincidence that we are breaking all-time highs this week and that this is all-time high week and then also ethburn uh ultrasound week as well like that is not as a coincidence like bull markets bring in fees yeah and so like really this is a game of are like are we in all-time high season right like are we in bull market season are we out of the crab season and we're just going to keep on eating into new all-time highs if that's true then we might actually be in ultrasound territory now for forever if that bull market can carry us into the merge like that's that's a possibility heating into all-time highs eating into the bulb markets what we're doing right now i love it yeah top assets by market cap this is all top assets by market capability doesn't have things like gold but it has things that you can like you just generally trade on exchanges so number one of course actually not of course i'm surprised to see this the top asset in the world worth 2.5 trillion dollars with the t is microsoft now no longer apple it's microsoft actually then after that it's apple and google and uh then some like oil and gas companies amazon etc all the way down to number seven is bitcoin bitcoin is the seventh largest asset in the world that you can buy on exchange of this type right behind tesla yeah right behind tesla well that's interesting and then right ahead of facebook and then if you keep scrolling past berkshire past nevita uh nvidia uh you get to ethereum at number 13 almost breaching into the top 10 assets in the world that's pretty cool to see yeah ether is within striking distance i think it's just like something like 12 or 15 more percent which is just like hey that's just like one good week away from becoming a top 10 global asset so you gotta love this you think jamie dimon's looking at this and being like oh i'm number 14 and ethereum just passed me now it's it's over for uh for jp morgan it's like i was wrong about i was wrong about crypto i don't think he's saying that probably not but maybe he should be and along with the rest of the banks even visas behind ethereum at this point which all makes sense because ethereum is a network of networks it is a global settlement layer it is a monetary system it is a money it is not like all of these other things aside maybe a little bit like bitcoin uh i think they'll continue rising in the charts david um that's it for the markets and we've got some hot releases coming up for folks but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless all right guys we are back with the hot releases of the week the first is this ens which is the ethereum name service you might have seen those dot eths all over twitter you might have a dot eth yourself that is registered to the ens ethereum name service well now ens is issuing a token they are doing an airdrop to all holders of dot ether counts what's going on here david yeah yeah so we need to um when i was talking to brantley even forever ago he was always saying like they would receive money from selling the ens names lots of money right lots of money tons of money and like they consider themselves like public goods right not a private company they don't want to be a private company that is just like operating what is a core function of the ethereum system which is names and so they've been sitting on all of this ether not knowing what to do with it not knowing how to structure like this company and then the whole dow revolution starts and i think it's very very obvious that the dot eth side of ethereum becomes community operating community governed and so what's so fantastic about dot eth names is that it's so easy to identify who has them and so they just airdropped us or they will be airdropping some ens governance tokens to eat holders and so there are some different parameters as to how much you are getting uh you are getting you are getting one if you own a dot eth you are getting double that if you actually linked that eth name to and actually ethereum address then you are also getting a multiplier based on how long you've actually had that linked and so if you have linked your ens ethereum address and you've done it for a long time you might get some nice air drops coming your way soon hell yeah man that means if you've been listening to bank lists when we started talking about ens addresses back in 2019 and we created tactics on how to actually register them uh and set them up correctly then you will definitely get this airdrop which is super exciting um 137 000 accounts holders which is great one important note though is they're not rewarding like squatters in this mechanism right so if you bought like i don't know 100 names and you're just sitting on them you're not getting any amplifier for owning more youth names is that correct that is correct yeah so if you bought a hundred ens names and you're just sitting on them you're not you didn't link them to your you know your ethereum address you are just getting one shares worth of an airdrop uh and so it's it's unique addresses that linked their ens name to their to their ethereum wallet for amount of time i think it's a great great mechanism there's a link in the show notes if you want to check out more details on that overall 25 of the total airdrop will be given out to in um two dot ethers 25 will go to the ens contributors and then 50 to the dow community treasury which i i really like that model this is kevin owaki shared this model and i i put this idea in my head where it's 50 for the past and then 50 for the future right so everyone who's worked on the project so far so 25 to the air drop 25 to the team uh and then 50 to the community treasury which goes and funds the future dell right after people that wants to start the deal this is super cool i think this is one of the ones i'm most excited about since probably uniswap and the reason is because of such a large distribution and there's so many dot youth holders so many ens users and so this is getting out there but like in general um they kind of had to go down this path right because they had a multi-sig they had a treasury and they had a small set of individuals who are really responsible for that multisig i don't know it's like seven to ten members of the ethereum community who had access to that multisig and of course you know it requires you know some majority of owners to sign off on transactions but this turns that multisig over to the dao over to governance over to the users over to the community it's a very web 3 concept and it's super cool to see so we are actually having uh nick and brantley from ens on our state of the nation on tuesday i think more details will come early next week on how you can pick up this airdrop of course if you were a bankless premium member we dropped the ultimate guide to airdrops last week and if you did number let's see um number 20 number 16. number 16. these are 16. 25 hypothetical potential we're not sure if they're going to airdrop but you might want to check them out in case they do sort of opportunities number 16 was ethereum name service had some folks ping uh us earlier in the week and be like oh my god i'm glad i saw that registered dot eth domain got started on it now i'm eligible for that airdrop so bankless premium members get that we will include a link in the show notes so you can check that resource out it's evergreen 24 more on this list potentials so you can be damn sure that every time an air drop happens we will be reminding you that this hairdryer why not go do your homework do your homework why not get free free airdrops folks like why not just put in some effort crypto pays you to learn about crypto so take the extra step here anyway uh before before we move on there are a couple more dynamics about the ens uh dow now that i think are are worth pulling apart dao's uh inherently have like a funding problem at genesis because like they they just meant to token they don't really have any money yet that's not true with ens they have that very large stack of ether from all of the ens sales and so the ens dao is going to have a very large treasury of ether behind it and so they are going to be able to fund themselves right off the bat they the the ens team is giving all of that ether to the dow so that's pretty cool i don't know how much that is i forgot about that to you but it's like it's got to be a lot because um when we said the dao is a lot of money all of that money is in eth as you said so when you register a ethe domain you're paying for it in eth and if you paid for it in eth back in like 2018 2019 that eth is worth a heck of a lot more in dollar values than it's like your your five dollars or ten dollars to register is now a 10x from that right so i'm sure it's a substantial treasury yeah and then the other the other side of this is that the ens team they never raised anything from any funds at all zero funds own ens right like this token was it just born uh no there was no vcs no no one backing it and so it's going to be one of the coolest i think it's gonna be one of the coolest launches yeah top top 10 launches top 10 launches top 10 launches sounds like another bankless blog post but this is like yeah the distribution is great i'm excited about this one the way i was with uniswap so anyway next week more details on that uh let's talk about this maker governance just onboarded lido's staked eath that's st as a collateral type it's really cool because staked eath is kind of like um treasuries and t-bells are to dollars right it's sort of like you know you take your dollars you put it in a risk-free asset which is a treasury and the reason it's risk-free is because the us government can always pay you back why because they are the mint of course they can print more money and always pay you back so it's called risk free rate of return that's what staked eath is or it can be it does have some risk the risk with the staking provider like lido has some risk on it so there are various forms of steak teeth but anyway it's really cool to see staked eath tokenized and available as collateral so you can get a loan against it you can start to use it as a composable money lego inside of the defy economy and he takes here david yeah this is uh this is a it's just a great integration it's a great collateral but this is a first step of a very very large story which is eventually all east it's all east inside of uh defy is going to turn into state eath inside of d5 because why wouldn't you well you could have two collateral types eath and steak teeth one stays the same and one goes up like five four five six percent a year and they're both formally liquid and they're both equally liquidy that's the difference right so like with the t-bill it's like it's locked up but you can't do anything with it like your money is kind of parked inside of that instrument you can't you know do very much with it at least an individual can't do very much with it but with this you could do anything in the d5 economy that you could do with any erc20 and that's exactly right and then this is the really the important story here is there's going to be a network effects competition for this state eth derivative token right uh uh coinbase as a centralized staking as a service operator probably going to release coinbase staked eath as a secondary currency any any staking as a service operator in order to compete with all the other ones they need to generate liquidity on their state e token so they will all generate the stake d derivative token who can get their staked e derivative token integrated into d5 the best is going to win uh and so like because monies have network effects and so this is a competition that all staking as a service providers are are uh playing in this game rocket pool also has r eth as well uh and so it's really nice to see these decentralized committed to decentralized uh versus the centralized ones uh start start to make those moves before the centralized companies do yeah that's the one i'm gonna the the collateral types i'm gonna support most are the ones that are um the most decentralized so yeah right the most trustless forms because those are the true truly the most risk-free forms and um in the best interest of that and that's specifically the bold case for rocket pool and and re this rocket pool is trying to be the most decentralized co-like technically uh risk-free uh that there is uh lydo has done a few compromises to to get there but they are still committed to decentralization and they just want to go to market first and that's how they have done that uh both of those are far superior than anything a centralized seeking as a service company could offer when launched rocket pool come on come on guys yeah we'll see you soon let's go this is really great look at this uh release from crypto.com so we think of the cryptography.coms of the world as like uh crypto banks so right so there's sort of infrastructure that sit on top of chains they are now supporting direct deposits and withdrawals to and from arbitrarium a rollup nice we said this was going to happen it's starting to happen crypto.com i believe they were in the top like five or something apps um in the in the like the the apple itunes you know this is google android i saw this is the android app store top five apps so like crypto.com has a ton of customers and consumers and now they are enabling layer 2 fiat withdrawals this is fantastic to see a much needed bridge into these ecosystems any thoughts here david yeah there's going to be another race between all of these centralized companies to figure out how can they drop their users off onto much more user-friendly environments we asked brian armstrong the same question on the podcast that comes out on monday uh brian armstrong on the podcast monday by the way uh and so such a good episode oh my god it's really good yeah uh and so like all every single exchange needs to be playing this game right now and figuring out how to and it's not that hard just do it just do it put it on the side yeah allow users to withdraw it like what i don't get why this is so hard yeah shia labeouf me man just do it just do it just do it right now okay exchanges and look we're going to support you if you do right the exchanges that i care about it's like this is a conversation we had with brian armstrong just to tease that episode a little bit more by the way premium members get that tomorrow or today if you're listening to it yeah um but uh we asked him the question of like a couple questions i guess related one was do you regret not building coinbase chain was the question we asked him in the podcast his answer to that was phenomenal um the other question we we asked is binance is building a binance chain right uh ftx is really partnering with with solana it feels very much like most exchanges are playing this this web 2 game like they onboard you to crypto and then they try to lock you into an ecosystem that they control right it's like like the facebook we've seen this before uh and then we kind of asked brian armstrong are you going to be the crypto bank that's going to build on open credibly neutral protocols that was the question we posed to him for the answer to that question you have to stay tuned to the podcast coming on monday but it's such a good answer and it's so worthwhile um anyway uh i think very much the crypto banks and exchanges will be competing and hopefully they are competing for consumers in a very web three way that is positive building on top of credibly neutral open infrastructure layer two is one essential layer in that stack and so maybe we see coinbase support for layer two next ryan i uh actually saw brian armstrong last night you did yeah he was he was there yeah uh and so uh again so we were i saw him yesterday the day before we were recording with him and zoom and so i go up to him like oh hey hey brian and he looks at my name tag and the name tags okay this didn't be an nfc nyc story when you were when you were in line and somebody was filling out your name tag for you they were asking you like what is your eight what was your aim screen name not your name what was your ai screen name which and mine was blackjack davey yeah like i go up to brian and i i say oh hey hey brian like hey it's great it's great to meet you and he just he looks at me and then looks at my nametag like oh hey blackjack david like no brian it's david from from bank oh my god we were just recording and he it took him a while like it's a loud party it took him a while to to hear you thoughts but yeah you know he did not recognize me at all well the other thing it was funny though because we were joking with brian on the podcast we were like he's like look we've hired so many people i've done bars number is like 150 people i don't even know the employees that we hired on coinbase so um yeah uh it's hard it's hard when you meet so many people like for that facial recognition software to keep up and like remember and put names with faces and uh it's difficult but uh crypto crypto conferences there's the writing joke that is just so impossible and like i i will never knock him for not recognizing me because i do the same thing for so many people why don't you just met like three times like i recognize people in the digital world by their twitter avatars honestly yeah it's like that is more recognizable to me and i i know some people change their twitter avatars a lot so that throws me off but anyway um digital games let's talk about this next one running a phone on what is this uh this is a product by grid plus what does it allow you to do david yeah phonon is uh um i guess this new kind of primitive that is being built by grid plus grid plus again has the lattice hardware wallet and what they have done is they have made a what they are calling a phone-on transfer now the details for this as to how this works i do not know but i know the gist and so the gist is that they sent bitcoin 100 satoshi's of bitcoin from one grid plus hardware wallet to another grid plus hardware wallet not using bitcoin using the hardware and so basically it mimics the properties of cash it's like if i were to actually be able to give you go and hand you physical bitcoin it's like that and so it bitcoin was sent over the internet from one hardware wallet to another hardware wallet but not using the bitcoin blockchain and this is also works for ethereum too and so we are now able to mimic the properties of physical cash and then also send it over the internet but not actually using the networks it's it's pretty crazy yeah so like trust like trustless bearer assets uh and private too privacy is a really important uh because like i can just like dm you some like bytes of data in this zoom chat and that those bytes of data will be like a big bitcoin 100 satoshi's a bitcoin right and you can go redeeming all this sounds magic and i don't know how it works but it sounds super interesting and i know grid plus is very much in the cutting edge of um hardware while it's like the most secure enclaves possible which is super cool i feel like i want to learn more after this david and if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to check out some of the technical details of this also dao infrastructure tools man how where do you go is there one place you can go where you can see all of the infrastructure tools available for you now there is it's called dao masters dot x y z and you could look at all of the tools that are required to spin up a dow discord of course uh mint gate gardens open law um investing recruiting marketing fundraising payroll all community management all of these various tools in one place uh kind of cool to see this is this is all the infrastructure i wish i had in 2017 2018 oh i wish i'd like to make a token and then i would like how to mince an erc oh it's gotten so much better like i've always wanted just like drag and drop push button ethereum smart contract infrastructure and this is that and not only that but a bunch of infrastructure around that infrastructure too so this is that old age of infrastructure right now it's gotten better but it's still going to get so much more like better like better it's like it's going to be another 10x a year from now in terms of the tooling we'll have so um stay tuned for that guys also stay tuned axe infinity continue to crank it out they just released on their ronin sidechain something called katana which is a dex for axs tokens and uh slp tokens tradable with eth uh david what's what's going on here yeah actually infinity famously the axi nation has their in total entire gdp on the ronin side chain but it didn't have a dex and so if you wanted to swap stuff you would have to take it back to ethereum so they just built their own decks on their own side chain so it's like axe infinity nations got its own new york stock exchange natively on their side chain uh and so that's probably a huge upgrade for all the axi infinity players out there that don't have to go back to ethereum to start using the d5 there god look at this video man this is these axes they're so cute the cutest creatures i've ever seen uh digital creatures that is optimism what are they doing vienna equivalents we talked about that a little bit next week but they're releasing that as a release in probably just like seven days or so that's exactly right optimistic ethereum coming to uh optimism itself they're upgrading their own system going to into evm equivalents they release a fantastic blog post if you want to understand evm equivalents and alpha leak you do you do want to understand the evm equivalent so go check out that blog post it puts it into really simple language there is a fundamental difference between evm compatibility and evm equivalence evm equivalence allows optimism to ride the network effects of ethereum uh all the all the infrastructure tooling the dev tooling the node tooling everything that's already been built out just gets to be immediately repurposed for optimism uh and that is that is their big competitive advantage so congrats to the optimism team we're going evm equivalent in just about seven days yeah it's really interesting because i i think the the real chain wars are actually going to be the the chain wars between layer twos that will uh need to carve out their place and carve out their niche and i feel like our optimism's take is we are going to be the most ethereum aligned roll-up of them all basically so other roll-ups uh might adopt you know other technical implementations they they might even go to other chains but optimism is really aiming to be an extension of ethereum which is a really neat niche and um it's something that i expect they'll be able to carve out quite successfully uh david let's move to the raises of the week every week in crypto there's always a massive amount of raises we can't cover them all anymore but we do try to cover some of the big ones this one's different though yeah so what is this dcg this is digital currency group so barry uh silbert's firm of course you might know many of his products coin coindesk is one of his products another one of his products is uh gbdc and all of the grayscale funds that that you might buy so what are they doing here what's uh this raise just raising a casual 700 million dollars okay yeah yeah 700 million dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation all right well this is the 10 largest yeah this is the second largest crypto raise ever i actually don't know what the first is um but i mean this is just absolutely massive naturally softbank is behind this because they have all the currency um in the world uh and so yeah congratulations to barry silbert uh this is uh absolutely massive raise weird headline though i think i don't know who gave them this moniker uh dcg wants to be crypto's standard oil standard oil uh we don't want standard oil we don't want robber barons in the crypto industry that's a little weird yeah i don't know where that's coming from but uh whatever metaphors aside quick facts about barry silbert like he he was originally super supportive of ethereum classic for some reason uh he put a ton of ethereum classic on on his treasury i don't know why uh also he's also previously this is no longer the case from what i've gathered but there was a conflict of interest between coinbase and digital currency or coindesk and digital currency group because they didn't put up a firewall between the news uh arm and the fund arm of the same company so that's raising some eyebrows over overall like a what is it called um a conglomerate i guess is what this is it's an empire the dcg is an absolute massive standard oil fire it yeah it doesn't not fit right yeah and they're definitely raking cash i think they've done a lot for crypto adoption i'll totally give them that uh and uh yeah i think overall they're they're healthy they're a good actor i think they definitely um skew a bit more banker old world um bitcoin maximalist type uh but still i mean this is all part of the the adoption story and i mean wow 10 billion dollar evaluation that's got to raise some eyebrows softbank jumping in as well this is another one that's uh that's pretty big the firm backed by alan howard which remember he's the massive hedge fund manager that is also backing eric peters firm we talked to eric peters uh from one river capital management a couple weeks ago on the podcast anyway they just uh closed 100 million investment in a major metaverse fund with our friend andrew steinwalt who a year ago about a year ago at this time came on the bankless podcast andrew has his own podcast had his own firm was very small firm at the time and i'm going to butcher the name david can you say the name for me sir fermion fermion okay thank you so fermion and at the time he was on a podcast with um uh he and who was a jake um it was jake jake burkman jake berkman and he basically gave the pitch for nfts in the metaverse and he was like guys you're not to believe us when we say this but nfts are going to be bigger than defy and we've just come off of d5 summer and it felt like very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very well and i were like okay like yeah eventually you know in 10 years or something sure like i i did believe him but you know i thought it would take a longer time for him to play and to be fair he probably did too well definitely he definitely thought it was it did not happen as it happened way faster than he thought it would okay so now his firm just got a hundred million dollars in funding his fun so congrats to andrew congrats to the people preaching nfc and like um i think a lot of the people who were right about nfts and the metaverse uh a year ago are now reaping the rewards on this side it's like market validation now you get 100 million dollars in your fund go invest for us so congrats andrew steinwald the um and his entire team and congrats for being right on the thesis it's really cool to see yeah and again like believing in nfts before there was any real market validation about them right crypto punks were still like below to ether right like there was no excitement about nfts they were just a concept yeah and he believed that he believed in it before anyone was actually bullish on anything about it you know what something really gets me excited gets me going is like investors with conviction okay there are so many people on youtube and i feel like in in in twitter some of these are traders self-proclaimed traders but some of these are like crypto influencers and like investors in the space and they don't really invest with any conviction they don't really have a long-term thesis they just play on whatever is popular in the narrative right three months in six months in okay i hate that like it's just not it's not something that i gravitate towards like i like the andrew steinwelds of the world i like the olaf carlson wheeze in 2013. i like the brian armstrong's in 2012 who are like oh i see what this can become i have conviction when everyone else is going in a different direction no one else believes i'm going to put my flag in the ground i'm going to build something cool and i'm going to like invest in this space and build in this space with conviction those are my favorite people in crypto because all of them are playing long-term games and you should go and follow what they do at every single step and i think andrea's one of those people have we said enough good things about andrea wonder if he's listening andrew all right what's uh what's next david what's this one sandbox yeah this is the company that snoop dogg uh is associated with uh so that's how snoop dogg came into the world of crypto with uh like uh partnering with the sandbox uh metaverse type avatar ish second life type game haven't played it hasn't been opened yet but you can build stuff on it so far uh just raised 93 million dollars again by softbank so softbank really putting out injecting a ton of cash into this space yeah they just uh raised a couple months ago 140 million dollars um i don't know what the valuation is this particular article doesn't say it's got to be unicorn status already building on ethereum which is interesting i know you've taken a look at the the tech you think it looks cool but i think a lot of this um comes off of the the facebook meta pivot right facebook the biggest social media the fifth largest company we're just looking at that in the world is now pivoting to the metaverse and sandbox has a sand token um how's that how what has that done on this news uh it's done some things yeah some big things yeah it's been hanging around like 75 cents and then as soon as uh the facebook meta pivot and sam just went from 75 cents to like three plus dollars uh and then at the same time it also raised you know you know 93 million dollars so good things good tailwinds for this for this uh sandbox company geez market cap close to three billion dollars and this is just a leg up we've seen that ever since the facebook announcement and a lot of like anything that is classified as the metaverse as a token that's a narrative that is happening in d5 tokens right now another narrative that doesn't get old is the narrative of get a job getting a job in crypto of course time for the this is the time when we remind you that there are all sorts of fantastic job opportunities in crypto all of these fantastic protocols and companies are hiring we have a bankless job board where we try to consolidate as much as possible some of the coolest opportunities this week head of growth at dex guru a technical lead at daftly incorporated an accountant accountant at smartd5 product manager smart defy as well head of ethereum research at immutable david you had immutable on the podcast earlier this week also head of tokens community manager at dexable a lead engineer at hats dot finance community manager e agronom did i get it right this week yeah nice job nice job that's like four so i don't know if that's correct but that's how i do it okay that's how david has always said it also they're looking for a cto e agronom uh senior back-end engineer smart defy blockchain technical cto interim role at merritt community manager argonne founding blockchain engineer at highlight oh my god i'm almost out of breath senior software engineer popcorn and a community lead at popcorn as well i rattled off just the top ones that i could list but there are dozens more on the job board sign up for that and make sure you check this weekly for opportunities in crypto that could fit your skill set yeah as these raises have come in in the last few weeks that we keep on talking about raise after raise after raise no wonder there's so many jobs available on the job board we just raised 700 million dollars we're digital currency group i think we need to hire some people to spend that they've got to be doing some of that right where else is the money going with all of these phrases um yeah that's that's where it's going folks all right david let's get to the news the big one of the week is the facebook metaverse pivot they're changing they're rebranding no longer facebook they are now called meta that is the company name that is the ticker symbol that is the meta.com website uh a social technology company is what they're saying in their press release david what's happening here i like this little graphic where they have like whatsapp facebook instagram all of their products and then it forms into the m of the meta basically i think this we talk about this a few times where like sometimes people start building stuff and they don't know what explicitly what they're building towards until they actually get there so i think the idea here is that facebook has been building out parts of the metaverse in different little pieces like you know the fit the facebook was like the first virtual online social media thing that really took the world by storm it was the first iteration of you know v1 metaverse uh add an instagram out in whatsapp i'll add in all these social elements now with oculus vr i think this pivot makes a ton of sense right they are already making like virtual online experiences in different silos and now they're just branding this under the single umbrella also doing a fantastic job of aligning their branding with the metaverse which is getting a just absolutely ton of attention as a word even though no one still knows what it actually is oh i feel like we know what it is yeah we do know we haven't yeah yeah we have some direction there yeah but uh i mean obviously like there's basically nothing that facebook and zuck can do that has positive light on it like sure you can call it the metaverse i'm gonna call it the zuck verse well deservedly so i mean they have um it feels very much like use their command and control to abuse users in the past maybe abuse even ecosystem uh participants so countries entire countries yeah it does feel like zuck deserves maybe facebook deserves a lot of the flack that they get um but chris dixon pointed out in our podcast like he is one of the only original big web 2 founders that are still actively involved in making bets and managing their companies right it's just kind of zuckerberg i guess jack dorsey and zuckerberg but like the google founders you know uh they're gone microsoft of course like they're gone all of the original big tech companies um are mostly gone i guess bezos is still there i don't know why dixon did include them but it enables somebody like zak to make a big bet and that's what this is this is a big bet on the future it's going to cost a lot of money for them to get here into the metaverse and there was so many different takes on this right so like one take i felt like was um the political take right uh maybe political twitter was very much like oh yeah this is just zuck trying to deflect from this bad pr right everyone hates the name facebook so now you're becoming meta okay you know whatever um i think crypto twitter much of crypto twitter saw this as a co-opting of crypto a co-opting of the metaverse yeah okay you're trying to duplicate our thing but just make it decentralized or centralized centralized um brian armstrong's take was interesting which he was very much like um you know zuck knows what he's doing he's smart he's founder-led uh he actually believes that someone like like i think i do maybe you do too david that this is going to force mark zuckerberg and facebook to build on top of crypto right because like in the metaverse where do you get your property rights layer we can't have meta facebook be the property rights layer of this entire economy this universe that we're building so where does that come from well it has to come from nfts tokens settlement on systems like ethereum and so maybe this is actually just zuckerberg kind of capitulating and being like okay i'll build my universe right i'll own the front end but i'm going to build it on this open standard which is krypton maybe that's a super bullish thing for crypto what's uh what's your take on all of these things yeah i i i'm going to go with occam's razor here i don't think there's much of a crypto story here at all um i i think this is just about because there was a video i saw of um the whole like presentation of the pivot and what they were going to do with it and everything was cut out for it except for the words experiences and so it's just zuckerberg saying experiences experiences experiences over and over the word experiences was built into this thing i truly think it's more more of web 2 stuff less about crypto property rights nfts stuff like that and more just literally about like it's a big pivot into oculus into vr into the online social experiences uh and so may like maybe the crypto part does come but i don't think that's the specific strategy that's being communicated here it could be wrong yeah no i i think there's some truth to what you said i just think the reason it's bullish crypto is because i think um many people are in silicon valley no it's like it's more than that so many people in silicon valley if you ask them what they're we have a different definition of the metaverse than them okay if you ask them what their definition of the metaverse is it's experience it's augmented reality it's virtual reality it's this new realm that you can go to okay the crypto definition of the metaverse is strong property rights it's self-sovereignty it's like the difference between new york city a neighborhood where you can own private property and set up commercial shops and business and disneyland which is an experience and where are you actually going to set up yeah it's manicured were you actually going to create a real organic digital universe it's not in disneyland you don't build a house and raise your kids in disneyland okay and that if the metaverse is going to be a human experience if it's going to be a real organic thing then it has to have property rights it has to feel real it has to like live so that's why i'm kind of of the mind that yeah zuck thinks it's about experience maybe because that's the only hammer in their tool belts but what this really is about is like they can build the front end on top of this thing i don't care they'll be forced to settle on top of crypto money systems and crypto property right systems so that's why i am i guess bullish and i do think that there is a crypto story here underlying even though they don't see it yet sure yeah i do like that take uh you said that they think it's all about experiences and we think it's all about property rights and i will say when you have property rights you also have the culture come out of the property right like crypto punks board apes like property rights about those things and that is also experiences and those experiences are vibes that i've been feeling all week here at nfc nyc and you're not going to be able to that's a bottom-up vibe not a top-down experience and so that is the difference it's it's it yeah it's it's totally right and it's like back to what we were talking about it's like let's make the internet weird again the internet is like boring and sterile and not weird let's make it weird again i think that's what crypto's doing um nike's no risk in disneyland but there's a bunch of risk in nfts and there's no risk in disneyland you can't get kidnapped in disneyland it is locked down very secure very safe um nike is heading to the metaverse as well they are filing trademarks uh in the metaverse and they are hiring metaverse designers so here's an interesting thought for you okay it's like all of the growth for the mega brands particularly the premium luxury brands is going to be growth in the digital product space rather than the physical product space over the next 10 years remember when we had kathy wood on we were like well like for the banks um you know they could start doing more in crypto but it would just be such a marginal small part of their business because they're so large and she was like oh that's where you're wrong chris berninski said this too because it's not about the proportion of total um revenue it's about the proportion of future growth all right so all of the other business lines could be stagnant and if and if you have 90 of the growth on the digital side on the crypto side then the banks are going to start taking notice and capitulating i feel like that's going to happen with brands too it's like nike you've got all this ip you got all this fan base this brand equity all these athletes how are you actually going to grow your revenue over the next decade and the massive amount of growth is going to come from digital products rather than physical products so they're going to start piling in david that's what i see here yeah and the whole facebook pivoting to meta i think there's a lot a lot of companies behind the scenes doing virtual goods metaverse type things and this is just again going to turn this into an absolute rat race of who can be the most metaverse the fastest these are awesome shoes by the way what are these like virtual nikes they look awesome i would i don't get it i want these i want these have you ever seen my shoes i have never seen i have never have you usually seen the bottom half of me i uh it's weird when i do i'll show you my shoes sometime i do have a pair of nikes uh not that cool though um yeah i i said this take but that's the take the the ver the virtual goods are gonna dwarf the physical goods before long microsoft getting in on the action too microsoft ceo is the biggest company in the world apparently uh the metaverse will bring real world the real world into any digital space so they are going all in they plan to introduce 90 new services and updates in three major areas including the metaverse you can absolutely expect us to do things in gaming of course they said no no surprise there they own the xbox so are they just going to fast follow facebook into this thing david uh yeah yeah everyone everyone everyone's going to the metaverse we're all going see you there see in the metaverse what's reddit doing david this is super exciting this is an engineer who just joined their team going to the metaverse um three words he says decentralize period social period media what does this mean this is huge okay reddit is i think reddit is on the cusp of perhaps one of the biggest pivots of all time uh from a web 2 company to a web 3 company not just a little bit but going heads first so we know that reddit has always been curious with ethereum they had the reddit scaling bake off competition forever ago arbitrarium won it uh and so reddit is now using arbitrarum to scale out nfts and tokens inside of the reddit platform and so this uh this thread and this the the uh runner uh the writer of this thread has the ultrasound money uh icons in his handle um just want to throw that out there oh my god and so he makes he makes a fantastic thread so let's go through it your karma points will soon be tokens think community-based decisions forking subreddits in disagreements which is oh my god that's so cool that's so amazingly cool first off like incentivizing good content via valid contributions that's amazing but also a very dark part about bitcoin's history and crypto's history at large is that the bitcoin had a civil war inside of the our bitcoin subreddit and for they forked it off into our btc and our bitcoin because there was this uh i can't remember his name uh but as a mod a mod subwriter that was like uh silencing anyone that wanted big blocks and only four small blocks uh and there was a massive massive civil war that ultimately created the the block uh the block um they formed block size wars the the four wars right uh and it was just a conspiracy and espionage it was crazy back then some of the stories griff green told told me some of these stories in the layer zero and like if we can just figure out how to like in like how we fork our blockchain we can just fork our subreddits like with more like instantiated assets inside of them that go and have governance votes and allow the communities to have voice that is amazing and that's exactly what dows do when tokens do and so i think i think the what this could become is one of the coolest things of all time the threat continues reddit has 500 million monthly active users when we all pull this off we will on board 500 million web 2 users into web3 and then there is no going back we are all gonna make it uh and then he just can't continue saying cryptoculture things it's time to take back control make the true internet truly open and break free give us each ownership of everything uh and so i i think this could be one of the most groundbreaking pivots of all time yeah i do too david i'm super bullish on this like we said in the last episode reddit actually has uh they don't monetize their user base very well right and right maybe that's because they don't really prey on their user base the way other social media platforms kind of do through advertising through like mining them for all of this information it's a bit more open bit more free but as a result it's not as profitable well this gives them incentive to jump into web3 first because they don't have to cannibalize a large existing business model there's just opportunity they don't have much to lose there's just opportunity on the other side and uh the thing is the technology is here too so this thread goes on to say uh reddit is partnered with arbitrum which you mentioned created our own separate instance of arbitrum community points for two subreddits eighty thousand users are already on rink b test net in our arbitrary network so remember arbitram when we had them on they have arbitrary one which they're rolling out which is live right now but um arbitrary doesn't have to be just one roll up okay you can use the arbitrary code and create your own rollup and that's what reddit is doing here they're just forking they're creating a separate instance of a rollup that all settles on top of ethereum so super exciting to see an engineer talk about the technology being ready for this too uh overall this is just uh ultra ultra bullish web 2 companies becoming web 3 companies they have everything to gain as chris dixon said web 3 is ownership he actually quotes him in this thread and i mean man web webtoons that's great webtoons peaked man i like i really feel like that um absolutely this is uh is this the wall street new york times new york times says they are hiring a crypto and fintech reporter must be able to explain what web 3 is apply here new york times look at that getting in on the action too also going web 3. everyone's going with 3. everyone's going to the metaverse they want to talk about it anyway so uh super cool stuff to see david let's talk about some nft action you saw something like that actually this week yeah what's this quentin tarantino thing yeah quentin tarantino seven uncut scenes from pulp fiction released as nfts so he was at nfc nyc on a panel with some of our fellow like community members uh a coin artist uh g money quentin tarantino all sitting in chairs together talking about nfts uh that's a that's a big name getting into nft so nfts like got another one yeah got got another one what's your favorite quentin tarantino movie by the way do you watch anything oh i was not prepared for that question um i i can i can first next week yeah yeah you go watch a feud we'll talk about it next week go watch glorious bastards and choices yeah oh no it's jane going change it's jango and chad that's mine that's fine yeah totally it's easy for me i love that movie um all right let's talk about mcrip david mcrib is issuing an nft okay uh top signal um global adoption new paradigm it's it's top signals all the way down um yeah it's just like a rotating like trading card but it's a mcrib uh mcrib has this like cult following mcdonald it's a pretty big deal that mcdonald's is releasing an nft of a mcrib uh again legitimizing the technology like hey someone's gonna buy it have you ever eaten a mcrib i have never and i've never eaten makeup i've never eaten a mcrib do you know what it's made out of because i don't i've heard it's made out of a bunch of bs that i don't want to know so it's not an actual rip like fake filler and like the ripples in it are not actual like it's not an actual rip right like it's just uh right synthesized grip fake rib fake fake grip okay well i'll probably enjoy it more in nfc real nft though real nft that's great all right well i don't know if we peaked or not but mcrib is on the blockchain so uh that's great um how about the matrix dude that um actually yeah let's let's skip to that we'll get back to this so the matrix the new movie coming out they are actually issuing nfts as well right pfp and a profile picture nfts a hundred thousand of them which is crazy you on a side chain yeah on a ethereum linked side chain not not a roll up just a side chain it's called palm uh but yeah a hundred thousand profile pictures for the matrix avatar is this the new style of marketing like oh yeah yeah it's like oh our movie's coming out let's try and get everyone to wear our avatars as the movie gets released if people get hyped about it yeah that's pretty cool and the numbers here you pointed out david 100 000 that's big for crypto right because usually these pfps are like 10 000 or something is pretty common but like that's pretty small for all of the moviegoers who see the matrix right what what are their box options and millions of people that go and we'll see it box opening weekend it's pretty small and it's it's very easy for them to re release this digital nft merchandise i wouldn't be surprised in the future david this is successful every single release we're certainly seeing last week we talked about disney getting on every single movie release you're going to see nft digital merch merchandise that you can purchase on top of this too here's like a possibility that i could see happening you know how twitter is integrating verify verifiable nfts yeah well what if you get an airdrop for verifying your matrix nft and having it on your profile picture for like two weeks because they want you to do that to market the movie and if you do that and like market the movie then you get an airdrop after the fact like imagine those games that could be played i mean marketers are gonna come up with basically every every sort of iteration of what you're talking about david yeah i could totally see that playing out um what's interesting to you is uh in china the tech giants are saying yes on nfts but no on cryptocurrencies right we sort of seen this in the u.s where web 2 companies are like we're not going to do crypto payments that's a little scary but nfts oh yeah easy let's add some features you know tick tock twitter all of these things we're seeing that in china yeah from think about this from a regulatory perspective like it's the same thing like no get the currencies out of here nfc is like sure whatever yeah sure we're not threatened by that we're not here about jpegs by your taxi it's a trojan horse oh my god that's what i said it's the biggest trojan horse it's the biggest because without cryptocurrencies nfts actually don't work like did you know nfcs are actually secured by the cryptocurrencies on the chain right like that is the security mechanism the value of cryptocurrency that is a security mechanism for nfts and if they're not secured by cryptocurrency then they're not nfts they're just entries in a centralized database so tricked you we tricked you guys you are by adopting nfts you are adopting cryptocurrencies maybe without knowing it so thank you very much the nft rugpole i love it uh let's talk about this was this a rug pull or what there was some uh cryptopunk that sold for 500 million dollars as a bloomberg 500 million dollars for fyi i think the biggest crypto punk sale ever was something like seven or eight million dollars something you know very very high but not 500 million dollars so so what the hell happened turns out this guy wrote a smart contract guy or girl unknown person uh wrote a smart contract that when the smart contract would receive the ether it would immediately send it back uh and so what would what happens is this guy put his crypto punk into a smart contract and borrowed a flash loan from ave just borrowed all the all money possible and a flash flow a flashlight unless you borrow all the money that's in the vault so long as you also return it in the same transaction which is why you actually don't have to put up any collateral to do a flash loan so this person just borrowed 532 million dollars to buy a crypto once in that same block the crypto punk was bought the contract returned all the money but so this person basically bought their own crypto punk for themselves for it it wasn't a sale they just they like a wash trade kind of thing it's a wash trade right and they do but they did set like the all-time high sale of the crypto punk ever and so what happened was that the crypto punk bot that goes out the the notifications that the crypto punk was sold uh one bot goes out and say somebody bought a crypto punk for 532 million dollars everyone started freaking out it's not even that cool of a crypto punk what the hell is going on and then they realized that this guy just made like a circular loop and it caused a bunch of storm but yeah it's good meme good joke good good riff now we're all talking about it it's yeah that's the thing we're all talking about it and uh we're all getting educated on flash loans because this one person i don't know who this is ryan uh patrick uh curlin he says who the hell gives out 532 million dollar loan to an individual even for an instant who does that and then scott lewis is like uh the ethereum virtual machine does that it's magic that's how we do it and so yeah what just happened do it with code yeah this guy was traded it wasn't real sale right but like these numbers the the amount of money that we're talking about gets headlines and then those headlines further propel this conversation and mainstream to start learning what flash loans are what ethereum is what nfts actually are and what this transaction was really about so kind of cool kind of genius i guess uh from from a pr perspective ryan since you're the tax optimizer between the two of us is it is this a taxable event oh my god i don't even ha that's you no i mean if you're moving from uh one wallet that you own to another wallet you own it's not a taxable event there you go fax optimizer answer for the week thank you sir no taxable event david you can do that it's fine check with your cpa i know this is financial advice tax advice bitcoin stuff uh man quarterback backs sure do love getting their payment in bitcoin so this is nfl star aaron rodgers he is uh of the green bay packers he is getting some of his salary in bitcoin what's going on yep it's not not the first time that that's happened uh some nba players have also done this some people just want to be paid in bitcoin uh and i i've they're players like they have a lot of money right and so they like to they like to play in the money games too they play in this in the markets but and they like crypto market just saves you a step i guess rather than buying bitcoin you get paid in bitcoin you don't have to do that stuff good marketing you still have to pay your taxes in fiat unfortunately but yeah that's true yeah they won't be changing that anytime soon coinbase is why they want to be paid in bitcoin so they can just like get it immediately yeah yeah i i guess so yeah um i i see that you know i guess i'd rather be paid in um in crypto in a lot of cases uh coinbase is doing bitcoin loans now so the sec shut down coinbase lend right well threatened them and coinbase decided to withdraw i said okay but coinbase borrow yeah that's what this is that's okay so what is this product dave and what's it doing yeah well famously you can't do defy on bitcoin uh that's not what bitcoins for you can take your bitcoin onto ethereum and then do the d5 stuff there or now you can also take your bitcoin to coinbase and get your loans your bitcoin collateralized loans from coinbase and this is kind of how we've always said bitcoin is going to like scale out as a currency it's going to use crypto banks and that's what's going on here so one million dollar loans from coinbase on your bitcoin collateral yeah that's cool it's interesting that they can borrow but they can't lend according to the sec regulations completely nonsensical one half of uh block five but we talked about that with brian armstrong too you can listen that on monday um what is the biden administration doing next they might be putting stable coins under federal supervision uh if you don't do that to congress biden administration says we will we will do that um what uh what's your take on this message to me this was relatively sensical sensical regulation yeah what i got from this is that the stable coin issuers need to be regulated as banks that makes sense the other thing that's also really nice about this is that bryden is saying hey congress hey legislators the people that were elected please do legislation which i like way more than the sec which i did not elect to impose regulation what about this or we will part though david yeah or i think it's by or executive order which like yeah okay yeah they might do it anyway yeah um but also it's congress so like don't hold your breath like congress doesn't go very fast yeah it doesn't go fast at all especially these days um jake travinsky i think had uh had it had his take here he's a great you know crypto lawyer somebody's been on bankless many times um there's lots to pick apart in the new stablecoin report this is a report that was put out i believe by treasury i think that's kind of related to that headline that we just read um but the tl dr of this is basically congress has to has to act in order to act enact the new legislation right and so i think what the treasury is saying is basically like hey we'd like to do some things but we really can't unless uh congress acts and jake's point is like prompt action from this congress on anything is unlikely let alone on something like stable coins like this is not that big of a deal on the congressional agenda they can't get any of the the main um initiatives passed that they that the congress wants to get past are they going to do anything with staple coins no so this is kind of a i guess a sigh of relief for people in the industry who are worried about some harsh action being taken against staple coins that might be a bit you know we talked to brian uh quintes quintens he talked about like you know congress is either doing like not enough or like way too much and so you got to watch that pendulum swing and that was the worry that suddenly they would get draconian on stable coins and do way too much it doesn't look like that is likely at least at this point according to jake yep i agreed yeah very cool uh david let's talk about what china is doing china is continuing to roll out its central bank digital currency did you know 10 of china's population now has a digital wand wallet yeah that's crazy big moves that's way more like there's not 10 how many 10 of people inside the united states play with crypto how much how much do you think people play with crypto inside the united states um well coinbase has 30 65 million um customers i guess some of that's worldwide so yeah 10 to 15 let's call it that okay okay well anyways no one's touching the united states central bank digital currency so if uh you know the united states would like to latch on to the success of defy they could actually be china in this but you know not holding my breath there either yeah they really should i put out this tweet uh meanwhile in the us back to our favorite screenshot here the congressional hearing cryptocurrencies what are they good for that's what the us is still debating while china is like rolling out a central bank digital currency all right guys we are going to be right back with the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the leido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath terra or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave dot com all right guys welcome back we are here with the takes of the week we go we search the twitter sphere we search for all of the great takes that are happening in crypto this week we try to dish them out to you this is the first one david you want to read this out from zenika once again it made it last week making it this week too what's this take yeah zenikar says on the calendar year of nfts we are still having breakfast on january 1st what he means that like if you take all of nft lifetime like the whole entire progress and development in the stories of nfts we are just eating breakfast on the very first day basically he's saying nfcs have a long long road runway ahead of them have you ever seen like you know what that reminds me of it's like the the lifespan of of humanity and if you like project like the entire history of the universe uh and make that a calendar year then how long would humans be alive it's something like some sort of uh pico second like it's like nothing right so it's nothing yeah we're very early not quite there but maybe we're just still on day one of nfts um david what's this take from eric wall yeah eric wahl says making a high throughput l1 to reduce gas costs is a bit like mating a making a road wider to reduce traffic in reality the wider road makes people think oh i can take my car to work now instead of commuting and then boom traffic reclogs it takes exactly as long as you took to get to work as it did before and he is quote retweeting kyle simani when somebody was asking hey can like solana do roll ups too and yeah sure of course solana can do roll ups but the point is like if you can do roll ups why do you scale the l1 right and so it's just what eric's saying he made a great threat about this is that it doesn't make any sense to both scale the l1 and the l2 because you're putting an l2 which is really really really scarable scalable on top of l1 which is also scalable but also not decentralized and so what he's saying is like kyle simani is saying like oh yeah solano will eventually have to go to rollups because it'll eventually congest except kyle said that which goes against the whole entire point of why solana exists in the first place and is just being like hey we can just like use penetrative pricing cheap gas fees to to undermine ethereum uh and then we'll we're going to be the thing that goes to roll ups because we are all we totally know that we're going to be that's a total pivot by the way that's a total pivot because the the entire purpose of chains like solana monolithic chain design was high throughput on layer one so that you wouldn't need roll-ups why right because the advocates of solana would argue in roll-ups you lose composability right you lose this kind of atomic defy to defy sort of transaction ability and so you need massive amounts of throughput on the monolithic chain on the layer one and this is a pivot from that a departure a change a 360 a i don't know sorry 180. uh like what what what else is this i mean it it it it doesn't make any sense to me either and eric wall is uh i think rightly calling it out i think there is a path as we said before for the solana's of the world to um get you know to to move into the roll-up design and it's like two-fold either you become a roll-up on top of some other high highly economic consensus layer like an ethereum or something else right so you become the execution layer or you move to become more decentralized over time right and like you become a bit more ethereum like and you prioritize rather than scalability on layer one you prioritize decentralization a bit more and security right and then in which case you're just kind of following ethereum toward the path that it's taking so this is what we've been saying right with the ultrasound ethereum ultrasound network modular blockchain kind of thesis that we've been putting out there and others like paulie and i have been putting out there too that's that's exactly right yep well uh let's talk about this i've i read a letter earlier this week um because metaverse was all the rage right you know zuck and facebook moving to the metaverse what does this mean and this is like an investor letter that said oh hey if you're an investor and you want to play the metaverse the thing you should do is go by facebook and go buy roblox all right it's so crazy to me that people still think that the metaverse will emerge from this old world that it will emerge from like one old capital formation tools like stocks and like two um old web two companies that don't really get it it's like folks the best way to play the metaverse is to buy eth okay it's to buy the property rights layer of the metaverse okay so if you believe the thesis that we believe which is this entire metaverse thing has to be backed by strong settlement guarantees strong property rights like actual digital scarcity that's open incredibly neutral you're buying things like if you're buying things like you know bitcoin you're buying the banking layer of this new economy which is d5 like you're buying web three type things you're buying crypto money things you're not buying facebook and roadblocks my god i mean you could buy those things they're not terrible it's just like why would you allocate capital to those old things when you have this new thing that's how i see it anyway and so i i just it was just like a connections people think oh the metaverse is hot and they really don't know what to buy or what to invest in in the space and i i think once again the answer is is really it's crypto yeah 100 and we don't talk about it we haven't talked about this angle a lot lately but ether is one of the most fantastic indexes of what ethereum is and if you read our um metaverse emerges article or our metaverse podcast everything when the metaverse is built as a property rights layer everything ultimately converges on ether and i think yeah and you finish this up with this with exactly what i was about to say eath is metaverse money that's the whole thing yep absolutely that is the whole thing and uh i don't think traditional investors and traditional media get it yet so that is uh an opportunity to front run yeah of course we're still the ability to front run the metaverse now uh david do this take uh it's really good from twitter yeah this was funny the first company to call it a profile instead of a wallet will win if you still think it's a wallet you don't understand its capabilities this is just lending itself to like you know your ethereum address is more than just like you know the place that you store your money it's your metaverse identity it is your web3 identity layer for the world uh my davidhoffman.eth connects to my specific ethereum address and that is uh you've called this before my passport into the into the digital nation into the metaverse uh so it's not these aren't wallets these are profiles i love i love these small little paradigm shifts like that right like wallet is a really good mental model but also profile self-sovereign identity is a really good mental model and i think uh that is starting to emerge in crypto as well hey these things aren't just places where you can store assets these can actually be like the ability to log in with an etherdress is uh is a real thing uh really cool to see the decentralized identity narrative um you know taking form somewhere david this is your take why don't you say it yeah facebook's metaverse is encyclopedia britannica ethereum's metaverse is wikipedia and this is just basically saying hey facebook is going to build their own metaverse their own disneyland and they're going to invite you into it ethereum's metaverse is everyone's going to contribute and put their pieces of the metaverse into this larger and growing and open and free larger metaverse right uh and so this is this is a just a fundamental analogy that we always use in the free and open source software world like why why did wikipedia win well it allowed anyone to write for it yeah i think it's the difference between like like the united states versus um disneyland right it's like you couldn't fit the united states inside of disneyland could you yeah but like disneyland has to rest on something like the united states right so it's like facebook's metaverse really is going to be an app on top of this larger metaverse uh that we think it'll be the disneyland version of the metaverse yeah exactly exactly right um and it'll it'll still be there and people can go there people can visit they're just it'll be in the metaverse yeah it'll just be in our metaverse and it'll be the metaverse inside of the metaverse the disneyland verse yeah i don't think it's it's just not that complicated it's just like facebook is an app on the internet it is not the internet right it's just that um here's a scary thought i was thinking about this earlier this week as bullish as i am steven you know i'm bullish right and you know i don't think the the bear market is coming anytime soon i think we've still got a run in us but it is a scary thought to me sometimes when i see all of these token thoughts probably close to 50 percent of people right now have never seen a bear market okay they don't even know what that looks like they're their only experience with crypto is oh i buy the thing and the number goes up oh and it doesn't really matter what i buy because anything i buy the number goes up right and like oh jpegs go up okay everything goes up all right and some things just go up faster than other things and so what do i want to do i want to get in the the um assets and tokens that go up the fastest right these are like little babies in crypto like and i don't mean that in a condescending way i'm just they're so new they're like newborn babies and they've never seen the real okay they haven't really like until you've been through a bear market and like everything gets tested your conviction gets tested all of your theses get tested and you've seen kind of the recovery of that other side you don't really know what you own so many people like your friends and family people you like go to thanksgiving with they pro many of them will probably own some crypto but very few of them probably know what they own or why they own it right so this is actually a little scary to me a little concerning because um you know bear markets can come and then what happens when people don't have conviction in the things that they bought and they start to see a 20 30 decline they're gonna head for the exits so and then it's gonna make it worse right it's gonna make it worse it's a feedback loop yeah i mean that that just struck me i guess like at some point in time you get a certain amount of people who buy in and they don't really know why they bought in and then it kind of like there's a tipping point reached where like something bad could happen right i guess that's what speculative bubbles are at the end of the day absolutely any yeah one of the guts that i that i try and listen to is like the um euphoria pain spectrum like sometimes i'm like oh it's been a while since i felt any pain i've been feeling a lot of euphoria lately like that usually means that pain's like around the corner yeah like you don't get to be in markets and don't feel like both like you you get equal amounts of pain in equal amounts of euphoria uh and there's been a lot of euphoria lately and as you can definitely tell that in like how many strangers there are at this nfc nyc event like a lot of these people are just here for the first time and like they've come they've been coming in when the times are good not they're very few people that have felt pain and so so does this worry sir are you worried right now are we getting a little long in the tooth in this run the thing is like i'm i always leave room for a new paradigm and so like i i think like all of the pain that the collective crypto uh community felt during 2018 2019 like it's it's that the meme of the army man protecting the sleeping child from the from the knives and the swords and the grenades and stuff like i think we maybe there's a world where we took that pain and like you know shielded the 2020 the 2021 ears from having to worry about that because we built all the infrastructure in the bear market i think the other thing is once you go through a bear market right like you're not worried about that you don't you don't worry about the next one anymore it's like what's the worst that could happen right oh i was making so many jokes this week as well like oh yeah all the crypto people that i met in 2019 2018 like a lot of us are like gosh the bear market was nice like it was quiet back then like it was quiet good time to make friends good time to start things good time to build right and like if you didn't leave in 2018 2019 are you gonna leave in the great bear market of 2024 no it'll still be a bull market to us exactly anyway i just you know it's something i'm thinking about and um again i don't think this is imminent personally but uh but you never know and uh markets can certainly turn in a hurry um at least in the short run david this is a means take and it's actually a riff on the the reddit thread that we're tugging on for that engineer who just recently joined reddit what does he mean say here mean says the end users of ethereum are no longer individual humans it's roll up dev teams building ecosystems let 1000 roll-ups bloom ethereum as a civilizational trust anchor and ethereum is specifically talked about the ethereum l1 he's saying the end users of the ethereum l1 are no longer individual humans and amin soleimani is one of those guys that memed moloch into existence and this angle of ethereum as a civil civilizational trust anchor is so great and so reddit when it uses arbitram to scale all of its stuff it it all of the world the entire universe of reddit comes and settles on ethereum and that is why ethereum is a civilizational trust anchor because it's not just reddit it's going to be everything it's on a roll-up settled by ethereum secured by ethereum allowing coordination to happen so great take yeah i really like that take and also let a thousand roll-ups bloom right any like a roll-up can be whatever you want it to be and this is reddit you know creating its own roll-up um super cool i have actually a question for you dave this is something i've been thinking about recently so let's assume as we are that the main chain is completely occupied by rollups in the future right so like large pools of capital that are settling on ethereum that means gas fees are not going down on ethereum main net anytime soon transaction fees on rollups will go down in the future but gas fees on mainnet will not does this mean there could be a lot of nfts like stranded on ethereum in the future right like and i say like tokens too but nft specifically because some of these are pretty some of them can be very low value and they cost more to to trade has there been any talk uh at uh nft nyc that sort of thing no no i haven't i haven't thought about that but that is a good point i do believe that l1 gas fees are up only uh and so like damn like nfts might a lot of cool stuff might get stranded on the l1 simply because it's just not viable to get it off there i mean it's something i'm going to think about some more but uh yeah uh anyway also when uh amin sulmani says let a thousand roll-ups bloom that should be in stark contrast to um uh what kyle stomani was talking about and with when eric walt retweeted him and talking about like oh yeah if you add more lanes to a road the road just gets congested the way you add more lanes is you add more roll-ups because they're separate roads more roads anyways more roads rather than one super big road make more roads on the l-2 that's what the l-2s do that's where the extra roads go roads and bridges and all sorts of things uh this is scott lewis stake ethereum isn't going to be a consumer facing blockchain for all that much longer that's what he means on the main chain right specifically so i was asking that question about nfts on main channels it's always been it's always been ethereum's plan to be in the background it's not supposed to be in your face it's supposed to be invisible just like tcp uh and if ethereum hides behind these rollups that's perfect that's where it's supposed to be yeah you don't even know like it's dydx i mean this exists in practice you don't even know you're using your name uh david you you do this take this is uh from nftnyc again yeah somebody uh somebody tweets out the pro of being a woman at an nft event is that there are no bathroom lines ever and so mike dudes who i actually met this week great to meet you mike he goes crypto bringing equality to bathroom line weights i experienced this for myself i had to wait behind like seven other dudes to go to the bathroom while like the ladies room had no one in there that's funny maybe another push for just like unisex gender neutral bathrooms and it's like just even things out anyway um okay david before we get to uh what what you're excited about actually we're about to get to what you're excited about so let me just ask you what are you excited about this week uh yeah tell me well i've teased it throughout all of this roll up but nft nyc was great i met kami russo there met her in person so i thought that was funny it's nice in crypto where like you know you know defiant bank list like we're not we're not the same we're not different but yeah friend some friendly competition there like she's got a great newsletter we've got a great newsletter she's got a great podcast we've got a great podcast but in crypto like it's all love it's all love so got to meet uh cammie russo that was fantastic like i said met brian armstrong got to uh shout out to the pleaser dow family which we call ourselves a dao but we're really a family uh even though i'm like the least active member of the town and but like you know hanging out listening to the wu-tang album it's like i keep on chilling in real life events maybe ryan will come to one maybe one day definitely next year okay the the culture and vibes are are really really great uh and again if you you gotta find your your clan you got to find your community find your people um there there's a there's a somebody the first ever crypto event i ever went to uh was east denver 2018. i met two people there from the brave team uh luke and jenny i saw saw jenny for the first time in four years uh the this this year here in new york so that was pretty cool um yeah like again uh the the crypto world the longer you're here the more it feels like family and so it's it's really cool too a bunch of people shared values as well and i'm glad tammy probably recognized you unlike brian armstrong right but i see i see your uh aim username uh aol username there blackjack uh davey's uh yeah it's a totally different shot shout out to jack white in the blackjack davey song that i named myself that's awesome man ryan i think i just got to tease about what you're excited about too quickly but you know this okay uh bankless dow the dow punk kind of um project that spun out of bankless doubt had an nft drop and that happened last friday it was awesome dude it was just really fun i uh you know i mean you know me look i'm into turtles okay like but i haven't jumped two feet into the whole nft game so this was the first time i got to experience a whole nft minting from the ground up and what was cool about this was like um this really started with the community first so there was a culture and community uh for dow punks and what is that culture in the community it's like a bunch of people who want to say f the nine to five right like we want to self-organize in these new um capital structures and social structures and and work for dallas full-time right is about going bankless which of course we are fully into bankless culture and saying like no to the establishment this is about going west and so a lot of this culture and these values were really imbued in these uh in these dow punks uh and uh so i minted some nfts and then i purchased a few nfts um like on the on the secondary market and again i don't do this a lot so it's just really fun man and i love the nfts all of these are going to be uh actual uh physical merchandise too so this is a bridge of the real world and what i saw in the community was you know not a lot of shilling not a lot of like what's the floor price checking not a lot of like it was just a very um long-term kind of thinking new vibe new culture right very sustainable culture sustainable culture and you talked a lot about like what's a dow it's all about like flow it's all about like the vibes with the dao um and i think i felt that in a in a in a cool way and you know tying that to nfts is cool so what do you think of my collection here not too bad right oh i love it ryan yeah yeah i'm trying to pull up mine right now but i don't think i'll be able to do it in time i was trying to wow you you've got some good ones wait some good ones okay so i missed these two look i minted this one and that one right which are great they're great but like i really wanted a um i wanted one of these either crypto natives or a shadowy supercoder and i wanted one specifically with like a bankless bankless box and um so anyway i i found somebody in the dow channel who's willing to like just you know sell me one that wasn't posted in the market so i did that and then i also bought this which is a great one yeah it's like you know it's rare it's got this interesting skin uh it's a creative number 35. anyway it's really fun i know you had a lot of fun too so do you have yours can i pull yours up yeah i just sent you my my nft address in the chat so if you want to put paste that in into openc it'll take you there because i i also like mine one of the cool things and cool things like like you said in the discord tasteless it felt really great oh there it is yeah uh and like uh the thing is like i made a joke in the discord like these dow punks are going to simultaneously be with zero and also infinity yeah because no one wants to stop oh someone sold me one oh i got a new one oh the which one the the oh these ones yeah that's a good one man that was another one on top of my list but yeah tell me about which ones did you mint uh i minted the left to the top left too the ones with the orange backgrounds yeah and then the the other three that i bought um i i offered a guy 3.5 eth and a trade on one of the crypto point or dow punks that i already had and he was like no man like i i it would be really nice to have to have that eath but uh it just it meant it was too too sentimental value like and i i had this conversation like three times like another person's like no like i i that that's a nice offer but like i want to give it to my wife uh and so like no one's telling me the the dow punks that i want right i have a list of a few others that i'd love to get but i'm just not seeing them on the on the secondary market and offers aren't going through this is uh this is probably my favorite in your collection here that's my that's my bankless ninja i call that my v for vendetta dow punk because he looks like he's about to hack a bank that's awesome this one looks good too that looks like that one's super cool yeah anyway i guess i'm down the nft rabbit hole now like you know i guess turtles was kind of my my first experience with the dow punks you know i got some like a few other things but um yeah i'm glad the turtles are in the rearview mirror hey i haven't sold a turtle i will look it's turtles we'll come back okay david but you know gotta give it a rest after dressing like a turtle last weekend all right i hope listeners are ready for the meme of the week let's finish this thing out meme of the week what is this from nifty not david yeah he says can't see it any can't unsee it anymore and we have netflix google meta instagram and if you are looking at this
