it was crazy and i would just say rest up because it's not slowing down next year like a crypto just accelerates it only only moves forward in velocity it only goes in one direction that is the direction of acceleration welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is our five things we got right episode it's really more of like lessons from 2021 it's been a crazy year it's kind of our wrap up of the year uh what we're taking with us into 2022 so we're gonna go through a few things for you guys the first is which of our predictions last year came true and which ones were a flop which ones we failed on we're going to talk about five things we got right we're talking about five things that surprised us five mental models we unlocked and five bets going into 2022 and then we end this podcast with some reflections on the market whether we think there's a blow off the top coming whether we think next year is going to be a good year bullish or bearish so stay tuned to catch all of those details david uh been a fun year man maybe we should just get to the episode do you have any thoughts before we do that yeah 2021 has been a crazy year and i feel like almost every single quarter deserves its own reflection um but crypto moved so fast that we didn't have the time to do that at the end of every single quarter so we were trying to summarize and reflect upon an entire year in crypto which is has also been crypto's craziest year so it deserves a ton of reflection and a ton of attention so we are going to unpack something that we have all experienced already and try and discover where it what it means where it's pointing where it's going and why the things unfolded in the way that they did so we'll go ahead and get right into those conversations but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbetrom you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many default applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted alcomix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stable coin into the alchemics vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f-i follow alchemics on twitter at alcomix-fi and join the discord to keep up to date with alcamix v2 and to get involved in governance david how you doing man just fine ryan back in seattle it's extremely cold and that's i've been at the top of my mind this morning how goddamn cold it is yeah how much you want to be back in san diego southern california right very much so yeah my flight back to san diego is the day after christmas as soon as possible let's make this flight as soon as possible well david i think this is going to be a really fun episode because um it's our chance to really reflect back on 2021 everything we learned and bankless listeners we're gonna split this episode into two parts so part one is everything we learned this year the year of 2021 and also how that informs the bets that we're making going into 2022 our thesis the bets the framework the mental models all of that it's gonna be in part one in part two we're gonna talk about this thing that we kind of helped start which is the bankless movement thing that we're building now that we've kind of dedicated our working lives to maybe not just our working lives like i think about bank lists a lot david yeah and that's what we're going to be talking about in part two so this is a special holiday episode for you it's gonna be our last episode of the year hope you're enjoying the holidays hope you've had some time to uh get away from screens spend with your loved ones spend with your friends and family also some time to reflect on the craziness that was 2021 and crypto why don't we start with kind of part one our reflections on the year that was 2021 these last 12 months really felt like i don't know i mean january feels like five years ago like six or seven years ago at this point in time all that's gone on all that's happened what what did you think high level about the year david man i've said it before but 2021 is the year that the whole entire crypto industry starting from probably when when bitcoin first got any sort of like meaningful attention on it from its first few adopters 2021 was the year that like crypto predicted uh and obviously it's gonna throw us a bunch of curveballs left and right and we totally got those curveballs in 2021 but some of the underlying themes definitely were predicted by crypto well before even you and i got into crypto like the inflation in uh you know the the the dollar mainly and all other fiat currencies starting to see some fiat currencies pop off one by one with hyper inflation events uh that you can definitely see the writings on the wall some of them have already happened uh and like the turkish lira happened this year and then you know inflation in the dollar picking up so that's been a crypto prediction from the from the beginning uh and that definitely happened this year we finally started to see uh just uh you know public companies putting bitcoin on the on the balance sheet celebrities and big companies moving into crypto in meaningful and sustainable ways it really just in so many different ways uh was what crypto people always thought would happen and hoped for for a really long time and so uh when it's time to reflect on the end of the year like that's kind of where my head's at no this wasn't just another year this was the year for crypto this is when so many things happened that are good for crypto uh and like i said in one of my recent articles like this was the 2021 was a big w for everything new and ever and everything crypto and a big fat l for everything incumbent and i kind of think that's that's kind of the theme of the year like uh w for the new things and l for the old things yeah it's it's kind of surprising how much crypto got right this year right how many like how much was um kind of proven this year uh i mean it had been a had been a dark bear market and i wouldn't say 2020 was a bear market right we definitely got some um some some uh tailwinds that year at d5 summer lots of great things happened the the previous year but 2021 it felt like the first year it felt undeniable it felt like we had mainstream's attention i think ryan selkis used the word uh inevitable we've said this all along about crypto hey crypto's inevitable like but that's been kind of more hopium now i think mainstream sees the inevitability of this asset class uh and that's been cool to see so maybe just surprising the amount of things that that crypto got right in a very concentrated year but that's not to say there weren't some curveballs like some things that were total surprises some things that we didn't expect um david let's see this man because at the end of every year we put together a list of uh predictions and so we did that at the end of 2020 and we created a piece called bankless banklesspredictions2021 and i want to review some of these because it's interesting the mindset that we were in at the time and i feel like um the end of 2020 the beginning of 2021 if i'm thinking about it correctly i think eth was around 700 or so do you recall the bitcoin price at that time yeah bitcoin had uh just crossed its all-time high and december 14th i don't know what day we released this but december 14th bitcoin had crossed uh 20 000 again for the first time and it was crushing it right like relative to ether as well it was just having a really good year and there was this sentiment in the year everyone was very bullish defy at the time if you recall because we had just seen we just come out of an incredible defy summer all of these token launches and discovered yield farming uh and that was a big focus and it was in that backdrop where we're trying to figure out okay what's gonna happen in uh 2021 and so uh here are some of the predictions we made we call these our layup predictions so one we said eath will cross all-time highs remember to that point like eth had never been above what 1300 or so 1400 was the previous high and at the time of writing it was something like 700 to 900 dollars yeah and that was like uh you know we were feeling pretty good at 700. so uh we said eve would cross all-time highs and hit 2500. call that a layup prediction we said crypto would become a multi-trillion dollar asset class okay it had just barely touched 1 trillion in market cap we said that was like obviously going to double triple something like this we made predictions about ethereum's settlement value we also talked about d5 protocols reaching the top 10 in market cap so i recall one of the things i think we we really expected at that point in time was coin market cap would be full of uh ethereum bitcoin maybe a couple of others but then the defy tokens would launch into the population like 10 through five yeah yeah they'd kick out the ripples and the you know trons of the world and the stupid coins that were in the you know in the top ten we got that one wrong by the way that was wrong okay the other so far all of them have been right but that one was wrong that one was wrong very wrong and i think we want to talk about that today um we also said d5 total market cap would cross 100 billion we were at 28 billion in total locked valley at the time and we also we said so we got that right although we did say 100 billion is our bearish estimate and now here we are in 2021 we had we just barely crossed 100 billion i think the highest 120 yeah and this is measured by you know d5 pulse so if you look at other alt layer ones and such that you know those aren't included those numbers but we just barely did it we beat our bearish estimate but uh i'll i'll check mark that as uh we got that right we're also pretty bullish on um bitcoin on ethereum like tokenized bitcoin on ethereum and i didn't even know we said um 2.5 of the total bitcoin supply would be on ethereum sometime in 2021 i don't even know the status of that david like how do we do on that prediction i'm pretty sure we are above 2.5 and i am pulling that up right now well you pull that up another prediction we we call the layup was um coinbase's ipo they would ipo which that in itself is a checkmark uh prediction but we said it will have a valuation greater than 100 billion and last time i checked i mean it probably depends on the day but like coinbase about 60 billion or so i'm not sure what the highs were if it ever got above 100 billion but um close-ish but maybe no cigar in that prediction i think we got the main thing right it was just a coinbase ipo and we were just off by uh a couple dozen billion in terms of the valuation of coinbase yeah currently clocking in at 62 billion in market cap i think it got up to like 80 billion 85 billion at the very very peak at the very start but it did not sustain that at all and fell quite a lot actually how are we on that bitcoin to uh how much bitcoin is on yeah according to uh according to d5 pulse 228 000 bitcoin uh are on ethereum so that is about a little bit more than one percent a little bit more than one percent so it didn't get quite like it started to slow down right it was uh it was really crushing it last year in 2020 and we kind of extrapolated that and said it would you know get 2.5 percent didn't quite hit that uh we also said uh banks would start adopting ethereum as infrastructure to settle dollar payments i think we saw a lot of that with um not not quite formal banks but like the visas of the world and the pay pals with the world getting to stable coins so overall like predictions are hard but i feel really good about some of these predictions we made at the end of last year i feel like where it was wrong we were probably overly bullish on defy relative to other things but everything else was pretty darn close any thoughts yeah you can definitely tell when in the year some of these predictions were made uh there this was also the moment of under collateralized uh stable coins so there's a lot of predictions about stable coins in here yeah i make the pretty i make the prediction that no significant new layer one will launch uh in 2021 and granted technically that's true because both avalanche and solana launched in 2020 not 2021 but the i meaningfully i did not get that one right directionally wrong uh and there's a few other ones as here like we talked about libra we'll launch and no one will care i don't think that definitely happened uh that was your prediction yeah yeah uh lucas the editor it's kind of like libra didn't launch and also no one cared so yeah that was kind of half right yeah either way uh lucas made some fantastic predictions uniswap will reach 1 trillion in annualized volume i think that's i think that did happen uh and value of crypto art will cross one billion dollars in art sales uh definitely predicted like you know nft is leading the way um yeah these are always just fun to look back on they are uh he also said dpi crosses one billion in market cap which it didn't get there nope this is interesting again overly bullish on defy going into the year um let me see a few others you said that um tron would go the way of xrp one way or another and i feel like that kind of happened david right like there's been almost no conversation about tron the end of end of last year remember that was the the eve killer du jour and now like recently was it last week justin sun just um uh i'm done with the project done with tron yeah yeah i'm moving on i'm gonna do something else with my life and um yeah it feels like that project is kind of stalled not doing very much um we also obviously predicted eip 1559 gets shipped starts burning some eath um that was actually a harder prediction to make at the time right now it's deployed and everyone forgets everyone forgets that that was um not a layup prediction at the time right because there had been a ton of delays for eip 1559 it was like two three years in in the making and uh we got that one right the internet bond gets memed into existence i feel like that kind of definitely happened that definitely happened that yeah ether and eat staking was talk discussed as like you know uh head and like shoulder to shoulder with the risk-free rate in a number of financial reports from from banks and funds and stuff like this uh and so that absolutely happened look at this one i'm actually proud of this one a central bank will acquire bitcoin all right it's kind of happening in el salvador 100 yeah 100 yeah definitely that that was also uh something that um you know seems obvious now that's happened but was definitely not obvious at the time i don't know if this happened to you but i predicted uh that we'd start getting text messages like bull market text messages i have so many of those yeah so many i said we'll enter a 2017 like retail fomo and the friends and families that you know that know you're in crypto will be asking you for advice what happened now they were asking about nfts though yeah this is true but hey cryptos nfts are crypto uh i also said the digital one will launch uh it kind of has launched as well and uh i said if it was successful the us will be forced to consider a digital currency strategy that second part did not happen yeah i mean i feel like they're in this constant state of kind of considering it but like not being serious about it right yeah and so that's just um never never be bullish on government timelines especially us government timelines i think there's a lesson there so overall man uh pretty good predictions actually uh going into the year so let's talk about this now david um some of the big things that i feel like we got right in the bankless thesis so more than predictions there were at least five things i think we uh we hammered on for for quarters for almost a whole entire year that we yeah definitely big themes that we've had a very strong conviction on that did end up playing out in 2021 so let's talk about these we got five of them um the first is one of the that prediction so the crypto became a multi-trillion dollar asset class we said that would happen again bullish crypto right bankless has always been bullish generally crypto now we're in the multi-trillions of dollars uh we said that was a layup and i feel like crypto has really reached escape velocity with with this like when you're in the multiple trillions i mean yeah you can you can dip you can you know uh enter bear markets that sort of thing but it ain't going anywhere now like it's no longer just a fad uh what are your thoughts on that i think this is the zone of like total market cap where there's a decoupling between the naysayers of crypto and the capitulators of crypto uh uh people just looking at crypto now and choosing to not ignore it and say oh it's in the multi-trillions now i guess i'll take this seriously paul tudor jones comes to mind uh raul paul comes to mind um you know banks issuing reports comes to mind this is when uh crypto like triples in size and the number of crypto antagonists or crypto naysayers did not state did not track the growth of crypto crypto outgrew its naysayers with this in in this metric and i think that's a great summary a summary for it so like there's with crypto becoming a multi-trillion dollar asset class it has more tailwinds of support than it does uh antagonism which is actually i think one of the new things about the world of crypto uh in 2021 and 2022 moving forward i totally agree i i think it makes the naysayers look foolish yes look kind of silly when they were saying things like hey it'll never recover crypto's dead it'll never come back it makes it looks like a bitter people that missed out it does and it becomes increasingly so as the market cap goes up i wonder about that point whether you agree with that point about escape velocity do you think that this is now like cat's out of the bag genie's out of the bottle you know it's it's it's over crypto is now here to stay it can't be shut down can't be regulated out of existence can't be squashed as maybe uh early bitcoiners felt in the in the earliest days of bitcoin when it was just an infant in the crib yeah even if we had like the worst possible uh 2022 when it comes to prices of crypto assets even even if we had like the doomsday scenario where like we get hit with a 2018-2019 bear market scenario uh god forbid that that happens but the amount of funding into teams projects startups uh you know client teams that we have that are is in dollar terms not crypto terms is orders of magnitude than we've ever larger than we've ever had ever before uh and so if you ask me like is crypto in escape velocity i would say yes because now the prices of these assets mean a lot less because so many like startups and everything all the infrastructure has so much funding behind it that we can all the whole entire industry can withstand a bear market way better than it ever could ever before so it's almost like the prices of these things almost don't matter because we are now in escape velocity we are now building our way out of bear markets with ease um so yes we are absolutely in escape velocity territory i feel like this was the first year that the conversation you know we didn't even have the conversation in crypto around will the government shut this whole thing down right in all my previous years in crypto that was in the background that was looming like and that was actually coming from the antagonist well if if bitcoin gets strong enough then the government's just going to like deactivate it shut it down we're no longer having that conversation the conversation around interacting with the government is well how much regulation is going to be applied to various sub-sectors of the space say stable coins or or d-phi or aml kyc and crypto in these sorts of areas no one is talking about the governments of the world banding together and actually trying to shut the whole thing off because i think there's the recognition that it's impossible escape velocity has been reached i remember my biggest thing that i'm not the biggest but one of the things that i'm really really appreciative of that did not make its way into this this recent bull market from the 2017-2018 era is this common line that you would hear all the time throughout 2017 and 2018 that it could all go to zero no one says that anymore no like if it could have gone to zero it would have done it in 2018 and so no one no one ever says like hey people say don't invest more than you can lose but no one says it can go to zero when that used to be like a common line throughout the previous bear market so i'm so happy that that trope has has now like completely moved away from people's like headspace it is now dead that is great that's great and that's definitely new this year let's talk about number two so the first was uh crypto became a multi-trillion dollar asset class it's something we got right the second thing we got right is eth eats showed remarkable strength relative to bitcoin anyone who's been familiar with uh who's familiar with bankless knows we're bullish on bitcoin knows we love bitcoin we think it's fantastic but also knows that we are disproportionately overweight eath relative to bitcoin like we do believe that flipping is inevitable yeah uh and eth was super strong relative to bitcoin this year so eth hit a high of 4 600 and then more importantly the metric we're tracking if you're tracking this is the ratio strength so each bitcoin ratio strength highs highs since i think uh 2018 was the last time we saw them this high so something else we got right uh eth was up 490 percent on the year versus bitcoin which was up 101 what are your thoughts on this david yeah and i'm pulling up the uh east btc ratio chart so i can look at the exact start of the year because ether started 2021 at let's see point zero four three uh so you would for one ether you would get 0.043 bitcoins and we are currently clocking in at almost double that at point zero eight two uh and so since the start of 2021 ether has doubled in bitcoin terms uh and back at the start of 2021 there was still a lot left a lot of ground left to cover to like reclaim some of the high set in the previous bear market or bull market in 2017 and ether just did exactly that uh and not only that it again currently looks like it's primed to recover even more ground so the amount of time that ether has spent above um above previous all-time high or yeah excuse me the amount of time that ether has been higher than it is now is like it's like 95 to five as in like five percent of the time it's been higher in bitcoin terms than it is right now 95 percent of the time has been lower than than what it is now uh and so yeah this is one of the big stories of 2021 is that bitcoin got beat out by basically everything down below in market cap uh and for the second largest thing to double versus it is a significant deal because you can actually only either can actually only double versus bitcoin one more time before it flips it actually less less than that right so one more doubling and then and it's a flip so uh that that's a huge story out of 2021. that's it's a question of uh and that's a question of are we primed for the flipping uh going to the next year but here here's one of the mistakes i don't want to make the mistakes that that maybe um bitcoin maximalists mis you made at the end of 2020 which is just assuming the next year would be an extrapolation of the previous year and if you look at this this is the eth bitcoin ratio david look at us all in 2020. even as defy was like crushing it defy was breaking out proving the use case proving product market fit for ethereum uh block space eth was pretty flat relative to bitcoin anyway it was going up but not relative to bitcoin and so there was this idea of um defy not ethereum do you remember that it was a there was a common trip at the end of 2020 and so i think um people didn't see this going to the next year they just thought bitcoin would continue to dominate and uh that that's not what we saw we saw a uh a recovery on the ratio and a ton of strength uh which uh makes me wonder what's gonna happen next year which is also the reason though david i i feel like you have to track fundamentals because i mean eip1559 look when did that happen right um august yeah august right you know that that accounts for some of the anticipation working up to eip1559 it's another fundamental next year we're going to see fundamentals like the merge coming on board and so how does the ratio fare in the face of that that's something we're going to be uh going to be tracking but let's get to number three uh another i think contrarian idea that we've held for a very long time since the very beginnings of the bankless newsletter in the podcast is this idea that eth is money and that had a breakout year as well this narrative hit the mainstream eip 1559 was just an idea when we first wrote about it in fact you first wrote about it in 2019 do you remember this article the final puzzle piece to each monetary policy august 10th 2019 talking about eip1559 it took two years for that that thing to come to fruition but from so much that i've read this year not not just on the bankless side but industry reports investors talking about eth as an asset class even like bankers talking about youth they refer to it as a monetary asset some even refer to it as an internet bond which uh we've talked about for a long time and all of them refer to eath as a store of value so that is now the commonly accepted narrative for ether as an asset that is not just gas it's a store of value asset so this year i feel like the narrative flipped and eth actually became money what are your thoughts on that i i think dare i say that the narrative flipped and eth became money and displaced bitcoin as money because bitcoin is now just digital gold like that's what it is when you reach read the the big reports uh and so you know bitcoin is sound money is like a common trope from from bitcoiners but like you don't really hear that in mainstream that's not a meme that broke out um yeah you don't really hear that is money uh chanted by like mainstream either but what you do here is ethereum as the current ether as a currency of the ethereum network which has what it's always been uh but people are also wrapping their heads around the ethereum network being able to do basically anything and if ether is the currency for that network then you know therefore ethan's money uh and so just a growing acceptance and this definitely is coming on the backs of the point we were just talking about which is ether appreciating versus bitcoin uh that's definitely a tailwinds into this into this narrative that you know ether is just the currency that you need to use to do the things in the crypto world um so that's just becoming more and more just embedded into many many people's heads and also i would also credit having so many metrics to look at when it comes to ether the currency especially when blockchains are open permissionless transparent ledgers we have so many numbers we have ether issuance ether burn rate in total fees network security volume liquidity so many things that we can directly look at in terms of what ether is as an asset and these metrics that we are able to view just backstop put up foundations on the narrative on the meme that eat his money yeah even the even the burn rate is a constant reminder that hey like this is a scarce digital asset that is becoming more disinflationary yeah as a function of the economy that it resides within exactly which is exactly what you need to have a money and monies are tied to economies so that that brings me to a question because i think this is an interesting lesson uh in general um we've seen this kind of play out but like what's more important or which comes first the meme or the fundamentals is sort of a question right and in some in some ways the meme came first for this you know in other words like this money we started saying it before it was fully true but yet there were hints of it being true in the very early stages we just you know saw the vision uh you know a little bit earlier but what do you think which comes first the the meme or the fundamentals uh in this particular scenario fundamentals absolutely came first other currencies memes come first like doge for example the the fundamentals are the meme but with ethereum their memes came out of a fundamental truth about what ether is in relationship to ethereum well it's it's kind of a i feel like what happens is the meme always gets tested by the fundamentals and like memes and fundamentals are are related but the only way fundamental the only way meme the narrative can last through a cycle is if it's like reinforced and bats backstopped and proven out gone through the forgery of uh fundamentals and that's what's happened with this meme so um number four it rained air drops all right we said this would happen there would be a ton of air drops for 2021 and indeed there were what were some of your favorite air drops of the year david oh gosh uh well uh the tornado cache airdrop was lovely uh the one-inch airdrop was also fantastic did that happen in 2021 i can't remember um but of course the big winner of the year has got to be ens the ens airdrop uh it was fair it was distributed uh it was a different kind of airdrop in that it wasn't ens the token isn't really like the other tokens that are out there because of just how close to public goods the ethereum name service system is um and it's it's a different breed in my mind similar to unisop similar to get coin but also meaningfully separated in the fact that it wasn't supposed to reward early users it was supposed to decentralize power over the ens naming system uh and so i feel like the ens airdrop is just definitely takes the cake as the the airdrop of 2021 uh unit swap being the airdrop of 2020. getting airdropped responsibilities nothing like it we've got a uh a ton of other potential airdrops as well we published the ultimate guide to airdrops one of our biggest most popular content pieces of the year so make sure you check that out as well as for bankless premium members david let's talk about the fifth one and last one in this section of things that we got right and we got right that defy usage would continue to go up but like with an asterisk yeah this is like barely we just like barely made it above the bar we squeaked by on this one uh total locked value got above 100 billion um why didn't it go further as kind of a question what like why why didn't d5 have another explosive year i i guess we'll get into that in a little bit but uh what are your thoughts yeah i think the answer to the question is like so much about cryptos based on attention uh and if your thing doesn't have attention on it then like you are suffering um attention and market cap go hand in hand in the crypto world especially in the short term uh and so nfts are the most an attention grabbing thing that exists out there yeah people forgot about defense it's just kind of like it's now like the boomer side of crypto it's like oh boring old defy like there aren't any jpegs related to that uh i think that's what happened i think uh the nft stole all of d5's attention that's so funny yield farms are out nfts are in that's what happened so those are the five things we got right let's talk about the five things that surprised us there's always a lot of curveballs um i feel like for as many things as we got right there were there were some surprises and a lot of the surprises were surprises of timing um so let's talk about these five things the first one is nfts they just blew up this year faster than i think any of us thought maybe even faster than the biggest nft bulls we know thought they would like it all happens at once uh we've been bullish nfts for a while right but it was always like oh yeah someday these would be cool like someday these will be meaningful and we'll be able to bring our sword out of world of warcraft into something else and then like it just happened all at once in 2021 uh nfts went mainstream we did people we got crypto punks we got board apes we got open street open c they went mainstream in a way that d phi never has right as we we said before nfts got us on jimmy fallon and snl and snoop not d5 not talking about bitcoin monetary policy it was nfts um i i want to hear about like your learning lessons from that what what you uh but why why do you think we missed that why do you think we were that that surprised us you know always in the back of my head i was like man this defy thing is so fantastic i can trade assets on uniswap like i can do it all myself i can self custody this stuff like this is great but in the back of my head i was like do people really like dude does everyone else think well well they think that this is great uh yeah and like in the back of my mind it's like you guys got to try out this defy thing it's so revolutionary it's going to change the world which it has and will continue to do but when again when it comes to popular culture people just don't care about finance yeah no one's going on like late shows and talk about their savings account no like it's never happened and so like i think i think the thing that we didn't realize or we yeah we didn't put the dots together is how simple and just how simple it is to ask someone to trade jpegs it's like hey do you want if i slap on this financial asset onto this jpeg would you trade it and like society gave a resounding oh yeah oh we'll totally trade those things didn't that surprise you though yes a hundred percent but yeah and in hindsight it's so easy to just look at it as like oh put and put a token behind pictures like i i again it's one of those things where like i too my middle bell curved it so hard and i should have been on the far left being like oh yeah picture tokens like it's it's hilarious it's hilarious to you because i i feel like um we heard the bull case super early do you remember when andrew steinwald and jake came on we did a bowl case for nfts i think this was in september of last year right after defy summer and they were like oh yeah guys like nfts are going to be way bigger than d5 right just you wait you'll see and we're like okay cool but like explain what an nft is and why is that more value but i remember you talking about a picture of uh art that you had on the wall and you were like hey this is a one-of-one but like how does that translate into the digital world what about the kind of the right-click save aspect and like not one year later but not just you and i are fully bought into nfts in the valley proposition but like the whole rest of society is i never anticipated it would happen so quickly yeah no and again it just boils down to the simplicity of nfts like you get to own a picture like don't think about it too hard and society didn't and that's why they got accepted do you know the other thing i was thinking is um really uh defy money these types of conversations not only is it easier to understand but um nfts are far less threatening than those things to incumbents right right so mainstream brands they didn't have to worry about like regulatory issues with nfts they could just use their digital brand uh equity and ip and issue them as nfts social media like the twitters of the world for example just add nfts as features no disruption read it fully embrace it it's great it's another competitive advantage christie's in sotheby's made hundreds of millions in sales but by selling nfts so like oh yeah yeah uh-huh all right what a gift nfcs were a gift from the crypto world to the rest of the world and everyone else was like oh yeah i love it uh everything else is like okay we're going to come and eat your lunch about crypto well and and even even like the regulators right crypto is scary bitcoin is for drug dealers and terrorists or whatever but nfts man they're just like yeah these are for everyone like you can't be angry about them so i totally underestimated the surface area of nfts um but let's get to the second one and this is axi infinity and it deserves its own category in and of itself because crypto gaming took off in a way but only because axi infinity just like plowed the door wide open for all of these other crypto games it melted faces a few things biggest discord server in the world bigger than fortnight okay revenue in the billions this year millions of players from all over the world it went axs that's their native token went from 30 million to 8 billion last year okay 30 million to 8 billion dollars what's going on here and how did uh why were we so surprised by this yeah uh it's just like it's this very rudimentary like game that there's it looks like a flash game looks like a browser game uh it's it has crypto elements into it like so like looking at it's like how is this ever going to catch on like who's actually going to play this like gamers want more than just this very simple like you know flash game uh turns out that gamers are not the right target audience uh and turns out there's a number of other people a larger much larger population in the world that has you know doesn't have super suped up gpus in their gaming computers and they just casually game on their laptops or whatever you know hardware that they have in their country and because of the economic game behind it that is the real story it's not the visual gameplay game side of things it's the economic game the underlying accident it's the open economy it's the gdp of the economy it's providing employment opportunities for people that's the discovery right and yeah that's exactly right and kind of yeah it's it's it wasn't had anything to do with the actual game itself it has to do with the economics of the system that's what got adoption in my mind uh and again when you when you talk about crypto gaming you still kind of think about their your old mental models of games which are like call of duty super high graphics uh you know in intuitive gameplay like no like gaming crypto gaming studios don't optimize for that sort of thing at least right now they are optimizing for the economics and that is a brand new paradigm shift that i i think surprised everyone the the other thing that made this take off i think was a catalyst because we were talking about actually infinity at the beginning of 2020 right we thought it was it's cool we just had no idea what taken yeah proof of concept like there'll be other crypto games this is one of them we were really bullish on it at the time but like not like this we didn't expect all of this but when we had jiho on earlier who's uh one of the co-founders of axi he um you know he talked about layer two basically not quite layer two but they're the rowan side chain as being a massive growth catalyst for this right so at some level what we discovered in 2021 is that high blocks based fees were the thing holding axi back and holding crypto gaming back and that like once you untether that once you unleash all of this and and provide cheap block space then it absolutely explodes i think that's something that happened too let's talk about the third one web 3 became a narrative all right i was i was not a fan of web 3 back in you know 2017 2018 because it felt like it was associated with like all of these um unrealistic ideas these naive ideas like oh we're gonna you know create a white paper for decentralized uber or like decentralize twitter and we're gonna raise an ico but today i see something completely different in web 3. like it feels much more real we've got the creator economy we've got the ownership economy we've got this self-sovereign identity concept we have nfts and crypto as like a digital property layer for the metaverse what happened with web3 becoming a narrative in uh 2021 and why wasn't that uh on our radar i i think web 3 is really riding on the back of the fundamentals of the crypto industry uh and so we had web 3 in 2017 as you said and momentum many many different things like decentralized uber decentralized ticketmaster um and then there's also components of like the uh broader ethereum ecosystem where it's literally trying to be at the decentralized internet like decentralized file sharing decentralized file storage and it the web3 meme wasn't solidified and i think slowly over the years and especially as the industry uh built itself in the bear market and actually established meaningful fundamentals like the fundamentals of defy that are meaningfully strong and real and in stark contrast to the fundamentals of the ico movement which are non-existent uh so the web 3 meme the web 3 narrative was able to stand on the shoulders of actual true fundamentals of the crypto industry and i actually kind of think that web 3 and crypto are almost completely synonymous um but web 3 is just like crypto throws a lot of uh people for a tizzy like it's the crypto word word it's got some negative connotations kind of like you know the dark shadowy super coder connotation web 3 is illustrates a lot more things like hey we already have the web we already know what the web is web 3 implies some continuation of that uh and we've been running i've been talking with a bunch of uh funds like a16z and and uh uh just regulators people on capitol hill who are actually doing real research into the term web 3 and how it lands with just people all over the world demographics and politicians and it's overwhelmingly positive everyone loves the term web 3. it is the correct and great branding for the crypto world moving forward that doesn't have the negative connotation of the word crypto and is considered i think it's kind of a populist term web3 is a populist term it's a pushback against facebook it's a pushback against any top-down monolithic silicon valley company and i think uh you know more and more and more web three is going to become a household name uh that is going to hopefully resemble a brighter future of the internet that uh people wish that we had in the last like decade or so yeah yeah i agree with you and i i do think web 3 and crypto are synonymous but not everyone agrees with that right it's particularly strong bitcoiners bitcoin maximus i would say jack dorsey a number of tweets earlier this week saying hey web 3 is something different there's bitcoin and web 3 is this thing owned by a bunch of venture capitalists and he's like distancing himself from that which is interesting that the the bitcoin community at least the strong maximalist community is not adopting this term web 3. yeah uh but you know we'll see how that plays out let's talk let's come back to this concept because we got to emphasize it was something that we were super bullish on going into 2021 and didn't quite pan out in the way that uh we we hoped or thought it would and that that is defy defy wasn't the golden child this year that's number four we talked about the first reason for that which is like everyone was distracted by by nfts of course but you know just to give you some sense the dpi which is an index of you know the aves and wi-fi's makers of the world the blue chip defy assets was only up 115 on the year okay that's barely above bitcoin's rise and uh you know you'd think an asset class would be much far higher beta than uh than something like bitcoin like defy over-performed in 2021 i i jotted down a couple of other reasons for this besides everyone was distracted by nfts um another reason i think david is because this industry is just a bunch of fractals on fractals and fractals right there's a familiar pattern in crypto that goes like this builders they'll start they'll build for years no one will pay attention to them there's like no market reaction then suddenly in this violent upward burst the market's like oh this is a big deal we got to reprice this asset class and they they fomo in they pile in price shoots up and then price overshoots fundamentals and it tends to either drop or flatten out stop growing at the exponential pace attention moves to other sectors and then we go back to step one where builders keep building with years with no market reaction i feel like that's what was happening in 2021 like d5 builders were building they were hustling and that's when i start to get bullish in the asset class when the builders stay and they keep building but the attention has drifted elsewhere because that's where i think the biggest um opportunities are are for purchasing and i feel like d5 is uh is in that zone right now the the other thing i feel like this holding d5 back is we still don't have cheap block space right and we have alternative layer ones and side chains and things like this but we haven't reached the golden age of uh layer twos yet and i think that is coming but that's been holding d5 back and hindering it for a while what are your thoughts on that yeah i i think just you know to elaborate on that last point uh number four defy wasn't the golden child i think we also have to add in the label that ethereum defy wasn't the golden child because did take off elsewhere um it uh a lot of things uh uh quickly moved on to binance smart chain uh and and then solana activity on solana picked up and then also avalanche uh we thought there was going to be this world of d5 layer 2 summer where tokens and yield farming on layer 2s would happen turns out that you know if you go look at the avalanche when avalanche started doing token incentives as in come do yield farming stuff on the avalanche l1 as soon as they started doing token incentives which is what kicked off defy summer by the way uh that's when avalanche started to really uh you know get into its heyday and so i think ethereum d5 wasn't the golden child d5 did take off but it took off more horizontally across l1s again exactly what you said looking for cheaper block space than it did vertically on already existing d5 ecosystems on uh the ethereum l1 so i think you're totally right like it is uh d5 wasn't the golden child because ethereum didn't have the cheap block space needed to really allow for experimentation and innovation the other bright spot for d5 was this like defy 2.0 projects like uh projects that were you know playing around with through token economics and you know doing some tweaks on on standard d5 like making the the protocols more permissionless like olympus tokamak rari come to mind for that that was another bright spot but yeah overall um d5 was not the golden child but that gets us number five which is kind of the point that you were making and something that um i don't think we anticipated going to 2020 at least the degree to which this happened we didn't anticipate and that is this all layer one tokens pumped okay they went absolutely crazy i'm talking things like uh solana luna from the terra network uh ava from avalanche we saw some adoption in terms of nft and financial projects some of them kind of copies from ethereum some of them sort of net new and um yeah these tokens just absolutely destroyed all other everything else in their path right it's like uh far outperformed bitcoin of course and also outperformed ethereum and ethereum had ether had a fantastic year and so we started hearing narratives like this it's now a multi-chain world uh remember the suzu thing ethereum abandoned its users right ethereum is getting leapfrogged by better technology these are some of the narratives that partially follow the token pumps but also maybe partially cause them depends um for me this is like a point of reflection right for for us right so like what is happening here because the bankless thesis is very much we have these three asset categories we've got you know monies and capital asset and commodities and i'm looking at these token valuations and i'm asking myself like why are they pumping so hard what is the value based on are these assets actually becoming money okay that's one thing is there a monetary premium are we pricing in some future transaction fee growth because when you look at the fees block space fees generated it's like nothing on these all the other alternative layer ones relative to ether so is that why are these chains just like assuming that they're going to uh flip in uh ethereum and be long-term competitors to ethereum or like or do you take the suzu three hours capital approach it's like ah none of that matters okay it's just memes all the way down and like don't be don't have such hubris bankless guys we don't really know what fundamentals are in this crypto industry at all and the market's just showing you why it's foolish to assume you actually think there's a thing that exists called fundamentals all right that's what they would say um these are some of the biggest questions i think facing investors going to 2021 and facing sort of the bankless thesis and us on the journey i have a few thoughts on this but what are some of your thoughts david again taking a hindsight perspective at 2021 uh if we all thought 2021 was going to be the year that we thought that it would be at the start of 2021 then block space would have been the thing to invest in uh if crypto is ever going to go mainstream and everyone's going to come onto the blockchain and do their crypto things what is going to be the most scarce thing and that is block space and so i think it was kind of naive to think that like the block space on bitcoin and ethereum would have been like sufficient to supply all of the adopters of crypto in 2021 with sufficient block space to do so um and what really happened was that there were some uh there were some people that i and like i think people like you and me is like oh well if we were presented with that critique it's like hey the theorem doesn't have enough block space to support until the whole entire bull market like what's going to happen we would be like oh there's going to be layer twos where there's like almost infinite block space we can just go there right and uh we just i think we just mistimed it um lsu's are certainly here their block space is certainly adding more to ethereum but if you go to etps.info we can actually see how much uh etps info we can actually see how much actual block space uh was added to the ethereum uh blockchain with just rollups and it's actually not that much it's a decent percentage but it's still in its infancy and the alt layer ones were able to go to market with more block space faster than ethereum layer twos were and so that race against time uh i think was won by the alternative layer ones before ethereum layer twos could really add their supply of block space to you know the global total supply of block space that you know a bull market totally uh demands uh and so i think that's what happened i do think had that the pendulum has shifted far too in the favor of alternative layer ones and with the advent of you know optimism removing its white list arbitrary nitro coming out optimism also releasing the brakes uh starkware and starknet happening the pendulum is going to shift in the opposite direction uh because it's super overweight l1s right now like you said the the token pumping is just pricing a ton of growth in into these alt layer ones when they've definitely supplied the world with enough block space but they have not at all addressed the monetary economics of their of their l1 asset which is a battle that ethereum definitely won in 2021 uh and the outlayer ones still have to fight that fight yeah that that's why i feel like calling uh the market may be um a little wrong okay and i know that's dangerous to zoo to do and suzu would be like who the hell are you to like call the market wrong but i feel like your point is very well made that like being bullish on block space is definitely something you should have been in 2021 right totally get that point but there's a difference between block space and actually purchasing the underlying asset of that blockchain okay because like those two things are different all right and if the if the blockchain is not generating sufficient fees to make to turn the asset of that chain into a capital asset productive asset that is harvesting those fees or turning it into a money somehow then why should the asset be worth tens of billions of dollars i feel like maybe what's also happened is uh people in the market are just saying oh okay ethereum's worth 500 billion dollars and what is the tlv of solana or avalanche okay it's you know five ten percent of that okay then we should yeah we're about five ten percent of the value of the theorem they're calling it a day that's like the depth of the analysis right and i feel like that is a flawed assumption now maybe i'm wrong maybe uh maybe this is the wrong fundamental to be thinking about but um that's something i'm thinking a lot about going to 2020 too and we'll talk a bit about that later but david before we do we got to get to some of the mental models we unlocked in 2021 and there were so many on bank lists i don't think we got to all of them but let's talk about just uh five of them anyway so five new mental models for 2021. you know let's start with this one do you remember that episode we did all the way back earlier in the year i think it was like february with justin drake the first justin drake episode which already blew people's mind which wasn't even the episode that is known to blow people's mind by justin drake it was it was a great it was a great episode and it was a key episode for me and my learnings for 2020 and this is um the bookcase for cryptography it was the episode not about price not about economics just about raw cryptography and the magic that cryptography brings and here's the thing i learned from that episode um basically these are all trust machines these blockchains that we're building they're all trust machines and the things that actually scale them the trust machines are like it's cryptography that's the magic that's the solution uh cryptographic always has been cryptographic cryptography breakthroughs are the only things that actually scale blockchains everything else is kind of a hack so that's what that episode taught me and there's a lot to it we just refer you to the episode go back and listen that one but what what that really that mental model um made me is uh you know more bearish on high transaction throughput chains that just don't use cryptography to scale they use high node requirements to scale right because that's that's kind of a hack it's kind of a shortcut and it makes me very bullish cryptographic breakthroughs so things like zk roll up chains seem to be the future and are much more exciting to me any reflections on uh that mental model cryptography being the only real breakthrough for performance yeah the line that justin drake left that left with me that stuck stuck in my head is that um if you can't solve it with cryptography then you can do it with crypto economics but that's prioritizing cryptography as in like you gotta really really try to solve your thing using cryptography alone and only when you know that you can't can you then rely on crypto economics crypt adding in crypto economics in order to solve a problem is again a compromise on a complete solution to that problem with which is solving through cryptography and remember cryptography is compression technology using cryptography you can compress gigabytes of data down to a very small hash uh it's just a matter of how you do that in this inside of the context of the system that you're trying to create if you can't do it then you use crypto economics but the idea is that it's always cryptography first and uh and that and that's why it's ethereum has always been a cryptography first a cryptographer first ecosystem uh because it's always going to the world of cryptocurrency is always going to be uh won out by the system that has the best cryptography uh that powers it and so that's why cryptography is really important yeah i feel like i developed a holy reverence for cryptography this year and partially through that episode so so go back and listen to this um the second mental model i feel like we unlocked is this mental model of legitimacy in particular legitimacy as the only scarce resource that is the thing these social systems we call blockchains are actually producing and actually optimizing for and um legitimacy is like a a social technology okay it's like governments use it you know religion confuses it it's the social consensus technology and it's one of the most it's layer zero we'll get to that soon but like it's one of the most overlooked and most powerful um you know coordination mechanisms and systems that that we have as a species it's it's the reason why bitcoin is a store of value and bitcoin uh diamond isn't right it's the reason why ethereum has a larger market cap than ethereum classic it's the reason why doge pumps binance chain uh you know rises based on performance it's the reason why crypto punks are more valuable than pudgy penguins this is a an iron cat okay this is a a famous internet meme it's like 10 years old but if i just right click save this and issued this as an nft it'd be practically worthless okay but the creator of nine cat the person who actually has the legitimacy to issue this as an nft you can issue it it's worth 300 eth and it sold for three underneath this year and it's not it's not like a little poep that you get like oh you have the legitimacy it's not an actual asset there is no like known tangible form of legitimacy exactly it's just what's in people's brains yep absolutely and so i found myself this was an episode by the way that we did with vitalik who wrote a blog post that we kind of parsed apart and you know understood what legitimacy actually means and he talked about brute force as one path to legitimacy continuity fairness there's lots of other things that you need to get your mind wrapped around but i found myself once i unlocked that mental model david i'm no longer asking the question of okay what's the path to the most secure blockchain right like the technical side of things like how does the blockchain get there i've now started asking what's the path to building the most legitimate blockchain and that is a that is a mind shift that i didn't have it's a different question and i think a more fundamental and important question and i'm bringing that with me into 2022. it's a really hard like i don't think this theory of legitimacy could have come from any other sector in the world other than crypto crypto is like the proving grounds in like the test bed for finding legitimate things versus illegitimate things um uh and like we've seen illegitimate things like left and right like for example in my mind funks which are crypto punks but mirror images of each other and now they're trying to like gain some sort of adoption by just being the mirror image of a crypto punk not legitimate in my mind um there's a bunch of things like that uh tron for example has its white paper just copied and pasted from the ethereum ipfs white paper like not legitimate and that's why among other reasons why tron didn't really work out over the long term uh and so i i think one of the greatest things that crypto has to export is our values and our culture and that is comes with that a concrete definition and appreciation for the concept of legitimacy it's also a concept that you can export to the real world right you think about the the institutions the existing legacy institutions their legitimacy is eroding relative to some of these new crypto systems and that's interesting to watch as well as they try to grapple to reestablish their legitimacy what will they do will they will they use brute force uh for example in some cases and maybe it depends on the jurisdiction in the government um let's talk about the third mental model we unlocked this is a big one man but we haven't talked about it in a while ethan's ultrasound money okay so a series of three podcasts actually two podcasts we did with justin drake on this the the the largest most famous being that you could start with the uh podcast just simply called ultrasound money with justin drake and and the simple case that was made on that podcast and articles that that you wrote about that podcast was eth is on track to become the best monetary asset the world has ever seen okay bitcoin started with this fixed 21 million supply cap was not the optimal system to maximize value and network security ethereum's approach is better that's kind of the contrarian thesis that we put forward with ultrasound money and i think if you own eth if you're looking at eth as an asset you this is a required listing a vitally important podcast and mental model to to download and see if you agree with and i feel like this one's held up pretty well david yeah i'm going to try and give a very short summary and then a prediction for in 2022 about this is um uh ether is a groundbreaking new relationship between an economy and its own money where currently we have the dollar and the united states economy where the united states gdp it trends up over time meanwhile the value of the dollar in real terms goes down over time so we have a discrepancy there like economy goes up but dollar value dollar foot dollar value of the dollar goes down then we have bitcoin and if the bitcoin economy goes up the bitcoin supply stays completely the same therefore the value of bitcoin goes up uh and so bitcoin economy goes up bitcoin value goes up bitcoin supply stays the same ethereum if the ethereum gdp the ethereum economy goes up in value the rate at which ether is burned also increases uh and so and also the value of ether goes up even more so uh so value of the ethereum gdp gdp goes up the scarcity of ether the asset also goes up and that is something that's brand new as a function of ethereum's monetary policy amongst these monetary system that we've never seen before ryan i think in 2022 we will not see too much of this talk happening because that is going to be coming around after what i think will be coming in 2022 which is you know general institutional and market adoption of layer twos and having the economy of ethereum spread outwards more horizontally across these layer twos and then having these layer twos have their own internally native interesting economies and then once we have this very vibrant multi-layer two multi-chain like economy flowing around ethereum with yeah stable coin flows and ether payment flows and layer twos buying l1 block space with ether then we will get to see deeper and more interesting analysis into ether's role in the ethereum economy and then i think in 2023-ish people start to like really re-focus in on the relationship between ethereum the economy and ether the assets because there's going to be so much data to look at and people like data yeah i totally agree and this is i can't underscore your point enough this is brand new we've never seen an economy act like this right so you know that this is as if a a government is taxing you and it takes all the tax revenue based on usage based on gdp of the economy and then burns all of that money it collects effectively circulation yeah we give giving it back to basically any of the holders of you know it's underlying bonds right uh so super exciting and i totally agree with you we're gonna have so much more data on this it's gonna become self-evident we don't have to keep saying it anymore okay that'll be that'll be the day um let's talk about this uh this this fourth mental model that i feel like was i i don't want to say it's our biggest mental model of the year but it was for me personally i will say that and that's the idea of modular chains modular block chains and the idea uh contrasting modular block chains with monolithic chains uh we did a the writings of polynya were key for me to to sort of understand this i think for for both of us and to come to the conclusion that modular blockchains are the best scaling solution for crypto we put out a podcast about this called um ultra scalable ethereum uh and an episode called modular versus monolithic blockchains there's an article and there's also a podcast about this um but the the idea that that polynya put forward was refreshingly i guess pragmatic and utilitarian to me because so often when crypto people talk about the value of decentralization and you and i are guilty of this too right because like they'll talk about it almost in like religious terms or in social value terms right and it's like why should you care about decentralization well think about the greater good okay don't sacrifice these temporal things for the long term don't be seduced by the dark like black power of centralization wealth creation opportunities think about future generations it almost sounds like religious but pauline's argument for decentralization is very different it's just very technical yeah it's a technical and economic argument it's like uh decentralization is just the best strategy for survival and it's going to out-compete all the more centralized chains and why does he say this because of this modular blockchain thesis because modular chains will easily out scalable monolithic chains and modular chains invert the scalability trilemma so it effectively rewards decentralized chains with more scale more detail equals more scale it's just a super pragmatic non-religious it's like oh you want to be the most scalable chain you have to be the most decentralized chain then and like mic drop yeah and so that was such a cool unlock for me and we're not gonna have time to talk about what we mean by modular chains versus monolithic chains if you haven't heard that episode and read that article it's homework for you to do i think this is an important mental model that you need to bring with you in 2022 because if it's right it will shape reshape everything in crypto what are your thoughts on this david yeah the one quick thought is that uh going into ethereum after sharding and proof of stake the the final fully fledged version of ethereum that we see on the horizon that's actually not one thing um the proof of stake validators are different from the data shards are different from the layer twos uh and they're all different modular components that only when you stitch them all together is that ethereum so unlike a monolithic blockchain where you can point to like one computer saying like well that computer is doing the execution it's also doing the the data storage is also doing the validation it's also you know doing all the consensus what all that stuff that's a monolithic chain you know with a modular blockchain there's so many different modules that there isn't actually one thing about ethereum uh and so it's it's very like itself is even decentralized uh the actual construction of the blockchain uh in in the construction of the blockchain is decentralized of a decentralized blockchain network it's very emergent very important yeah um and and so overall this is going to be i think a theme of 2022 is that you know is it is it going to be the module the monolithic l1s that brute force themselves into relevancy or is it going to be the modular systems that um you know pragmatically and practically scale themselves out and you know for for us what this makes us i think from a thesis perspective is bullish roll-ups bullish ethereum roadmap bullish modular chains whether it's ethereum or some other chain bullish decentralization and bearish monolithic chains at least until they embrace their role as maybe an execution layer or or something to that effect so go listen to that episode if you had no idea what we're just talking about go with that modular versus monolithic blockchains episode it is incredibly important to bring with you into the next year um the fifth and final mental model of our top five mental models is this one we're living in a crypto renaissance the episode with josh rosenthal david could you like give a synopsis of that episode it was probably my favorite episode that we've ever recorded of any year and um yeah i know you feel similarly about it why do you like it what's in that episode yeah i i think the reason why everyone loved that episode is because it's a story uh and humans love stories and kind of in in the same vein as you were talking about with uh decentralization and pauline and modular blockchains like it's a story but it's also a very technical and and well uh backed up story with actual evidence with actual real fundamentals behind it so like like all things it's a great meme but there's actual fundamentals behind it so yeah we're living in a crypto renaissance it's a great meme to tell your family it's like oh yeah crypto's gonna bring in usher in a new renaissance something of of equally of equal magnitude to the old renaissance yeah like the one you studied in high school that will also make your family think you're crazy which is again another fun talking point right but at least you can tell them to show them this story and also one thing i learned in 2021 ryan is that stories do way better for onboarding than like technical arguments uh like what is crypto what is a blockchain how's the blockchain work that all those pieces of information and content have their place but it's really stories that embed uh meaning and significance into people's brains uh and so the tldr of the crypto renaissance podcast even though you absolutely need to listen to the whole thing is that there are two technologies that triggered the creation of the renaissance one was double entry bookkeeping which is basically democratizing and decentralizing the concept of finance into the average you know everyday individual's brains and also the printing press democratizing the freedom of information uh and the the availability of information and also the low cost of reproducing information uh so that's what triggered this great wealth creation and wealth uh distribution event in the renaissance allowing everyone to any any and everyone to be their own bank double entry bookkeeping allows you to be your own bank that's what it does slowly over the year over 500 600 years that became centralized into the current baking system that we have today and now we have another set of decentralized technologies that allows a renaissance 2.0 or the crypto renaissance and that is the internet the modern aid ma the new age printing press and also blockchain technology which is the new age double entry bookkeeping and these same two technologies which are ones about information ones about finance allows individual rights into individual sovereignty individual power to create and spread wealth as the individual sees fit uh and so without any hyperbole we are living in the crypto renaissance i absolutely agree and you know the renaissance is an exciting time it's a time of turmoil as well people look at the renaissance's rose-colored glasses but there were some institutions that had a hard time but on the on the other side hand we had new governance systems that arose like fledgling democracies and nation states culture really bloomed during the renaissance a new class of medici creating a world of economic opportunity and i think that's the takeaway from that episode with josh rosenthal in this mental model of the crypto renaissance like we're here now so like what what are you doing to be part of the new crypto medici right like that that's a great place to be if you're an individual on the journey and so bullish crypto bullish crypto medici this is an episode that's bullish humanity and bullish optimism which is something we've talked a lot about on bankless lately the only thing that's bearish david is pessimism if you are short humanity like gtfo man it's like you like get out of here because that's not what we're doing in in the crypto renaissance so it's a it's a very optimistic um lens through which to view all of crypto you know what also came out of the the renaissance the actual og renaissance in the 1600s the dutch east india company that's true and you know what is i think the the new dutch east india company today yes the new capital formation structures right these dowels absolutely there are two other uh mental models like we did this um this fantastic episode with chris dixon on web3 check that out that's kind of a you know bonus mental model for you also uh david you and i did this episode on the metaverse i feel like it's still one of the best episodes i've heard on the metaverse just because it actually defines it okay so many people concretely so many people still think like uh zuckerberg's version of the metaverse or it's just like virtual worlds that's the metaverse it's not or whatever yeah vr it's not about virtual worlds it's about property rights that's what the metaverse is about zoom is not the metaverse zoom is not the metaverse all right it's just like an overlay of the metaverse property rights are the metaverse and crypto is a key aspect of that in fact the foundational aspect of it so listen that podcast where we uh define the metaverse and talk about that in depth okay matcha everyone's favorite decks aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eath and

ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space we gotta get to five bets going into 2022 all right so if you've been hanging with us so far what does all this mean all right it's like how does number go up as a result of these theses david what are you how are you positioning your time and resources and capital going into 2022 here are five of our bets going into 2022 not all of them but i think some of the more interesting concentrated bets um i'll start with the first the first is this okay bullish block space but that comes in the form at least for myself of eth layer twos and also some of the bridges from layer two to layer two so chris dixon in our episode earlier this year called block space like the most valuable commodity asset of you know 2021 and i agree but as we talked about earlier i feel like some of the block space out there is overvalued and some of it's undervalued um and i don't think space is the same it's not all the same some has a stronger settlement guarantees which is a mental model from 2021 bankless mental models settlement guarantees go look that one up too that might be that might have been 20 actually yeah 2020 excuse me i said 2021 but 2020. the modular blockchain thesis that we're talking about earlier uh makes me really bullish on ethereum of course but also layer twos you know polygon immutable starkware arbitrim uh aztec optimism a slew of others that are about to enter and i think ethereum's roll up scalability strategy which is essentially the modular blockchain thesis is massively undervalued i expect layer twos to absolutely explode next year i expect all layer twos to issue tokens at some point in the future they're not gonna tell you they're doing that but that's what i expect i also expect bridges like hop connects and across to be a big deal and for me personally that's kind of the block space for my portfolio that i want i'm more neutral on all layer ones like i don't hate them i just i don't understand what the valuations are based on and i don't like to invest in things i don't understand so i'm not i'm not a great meme investor personally and i think some of these monolithic chains they'll have some success in areas um you know in the maybe the medium term even some of them will pivot and become successful execution layers some of them will become more centralized become a bit more like central banks and binance chain is an example of that i think others will fast follow ethereum and go in the modular blockchain strategy direction and i'm more bullish on those but for me personally i don't feel like i have a need to be exposed to those relative to ether and uh layer twos what are your thoughts on that david i i think this prediction for 2022 hinges on whether or not these uh projects teams layer twos bridges issue tokens we need them to issue tokens it's going if if they issue tokens it's layer two summer uh bridges getting farmed with tokens player two is getting pharma tokens liquidity all that stuff it's really it's a matter of just and like think of the the layer twos that have issued tokens immutable incredible adoption incredible usage uh incredible bd dyjx incredible volumes they have a token um the other ones that haven't had tokens uh a polygon again token adoption like this is how this goes like arbitrarily uh optimism uh stark net i mean it's still very very early on stark net um like no token not not so much adoption like people need the incentives uh and i think as soon as these tokens come out people are going to start to view these layer twos as the things that you that you and i ryan think that they are which are like you know multi-decade long time horizons uh uh investment thesis as for block space uh and so owning these tokens now are going to be very very valuable and that's going to be how a lot of momentum moves into the layer 2 world don't think david tokens are inevitable though yes because of that economic fact yes it's just it's just like they've been very some of them have been very very patient to issue tokens and i know i know like long-term thinking long-term thinking do i want the l2 token summer to happen uh i i think it's coming and i think we're building towards that and i think we'll start to see some of that in 2022 uh and i think people are way underexposed on layer two uh relative to alternative layer ones but we'll see uh let's talk about the second bet category which is next generation d5 all right so d5 has been sleepy from from a price perspective but the builders haven't been the builders have been continuing to build and now we have layer twos that that are coming out i think that will bring a whole new cohort of breakout d5 applications applications that are born on layer twos rather than main net weren't even possible on maynet i'm watching for these i also think a lot of the blue chip defy assets like the stuff that's inside of dpi they're an absolute steal when you look at it from a price to sales or price to earnings ratio okay like some of these from a price to earnings ratio are like lower pes than uh than apple or general electric right it's like silly how much cash these things are are creating now maybe you could argue the the the token valuations aren't tuned to capture them but they will be governance will adjust that and make it so and so i feel like if if you think about the growth story of blue chip defy assets on on layer 2 and you think about them as also value assets from a price earnings price to sales perspective they're both value assets and growth assets so i'm actually bullish on on the category i um i think the blue chips are pretty cool too i'm also too keeping an eye on alternative layer one projects so there are new projects spinning up on d5 projects spinning up on alternative layer ones and side chains like polygon for instance and i think some of these could start to give some of the traditional ethereum only uh d5 projects to run from their money if they start to expand into layer two and ethereum right it's ultimately this is a this is a battle for liquidity it's the great battle for liquidity and the best money robots will win and i think that's a great thing for consumers so i'm keeping an eye at least one eye open on what's happening in the alternative layer 1 and d5 space as well so those are some thoughts on d5 assets what do you think yeah i think the only thought i'll add is that there seems to be uh hopefully an aligning of the stars behind a lot of great under the radar d5 projects that are coming into onto may net be that layer one or layer twos just production ready simultaneously as layer 2 start to um you know remove white lists and also remove the breaks uh and allow for uh more unconstrained or lesser less lesser constrained supply of block space that has really kind of been the thing holding optimism and arbitrary back going from like having like unit swap fees going from five dollars where they currently are down to like 50 cents or even even uh less than that so brand new defy use cases simultaneously aligned with a lot more supply of block space to experiment and innovate and allow these new use cases that are coming online to also be surface area for additional use cases on top of them and in order to incentivize and create that sort of you know innovation uh cambrian explosion you need cheap block space so hopefully those stars are actually lining in the way that i see them yeah yeah yeah totally agree um the third bet going into 2022 that i'm making is dao's as a category of all types and it it's kind of weird to bet on dallas david because like what are daos kind of like uh it's kind of weird to think of them as a category it's kind of like i'm betting on llc's as my investment strategy right it's like okay right but it kind of makes sense going into 2022 because uh dalles are so early stage right there are thousands of these experiments there's the creator economy dalles fan token dows media dolls social dowels dows that are doing weird things that we can't even predict like trying to outbid a billionaire for a copy of the constitution all right like weird stuff and i'm monitoring as many of these experiments as possible because some of them i think will be breakout successes i think we're looking at you know potentially the future fortune 500 and these assets will dwarf their traditional competitors so what is getting exposure to a dow look like i think at this early stage it just means tapping into as many experiments as possible getting into these dials actually becoming a member of them participating in them investing in infrastructure that they need too that's a whole nother category under daos when it makes sense potentially looking and evaluating their their token and i think daos as a category is not so much like you're not betting on um you know specific areas of crypto as much as you're like betting on the blockchain's ability to coordinate it's like dials are a bet on blockchain coordination and that's why it makes sense to me and i think coming out of 2022 i hope we have some like categories sub-sectors of dows that make more sense but right now i'm just like i'm bullish dallas are you bullish dallas what do you think about that oh yeah um just the amount of flexibility that ed dao has because like you said it's betting on saying i'm going to bet on llc is kind of weird um but that's because like an llc can be anything right and a dao can also be anything and so not only will i see more do i expect to see more dows in in 2022 but i also expect to see dows uh be formed in attempt to do weird new things that like i don't think we can predict right now um for like buying the constitution would have been a great example yeah that's weird man it's weird so it's gonna get weirder bullish on weird douse let me say yeah exactly that's it weird doubts is a category um let's talk about this crypto gaming so that's the fourth category of bet i know you're super interested in this we had two podcasts recently one with ariana simpson on the crypto gaming revolution another with amy wu crypto gaming 101 if you want to get up to speed a primer on crypto gaming i recommend you listen to those two podcasts uh david what are your thoughts on on crypto gaming and maybe maybe as the key to the metaverse because i think both you and i see crypto gaming as basically a a portal of first instance a manifestation early manifestation of the metaverse what do you think about this category of bet yeah i think in 2022 the story is going to be a lot of gaming studios wanting to do crypto gaming and then getting a lot of pushback from their fans who don't want nfts in their games at all and then let that like friction leaving a lot of energy a lot of uh room for newer more indie upstart gaming studios to innovate and tinker with uh crypto asset powered games uh and so that i think there's going to be a big story of like gamers and game studios having a lot of friction because game studios knowing that it's the right direction to go uh just but also trying to answer to their very committed and loyal fan base and not trying to undermine them because you know in gaming communities everything uh but ultimately crypto gaming will definitely become a thing meaningfully different and distinct from non-crypto gaming uh it's just going to be a matter of who's actually going to build them uh crypto gaming is one of those things where there's a lot a lot of development under the radar um that those games are not yet released but they are being built by startups and crypto native people building games for for crypto native people crypto native gamers uh and they they're not gonna come from theme people like ea or activision or anything like that it's going to be uh smaller studios that can make more basic indie level games um but they are specifically built for crypto people uh i think that's going to be 2022. yeah i agree bullish crypto native games right not games coming necessarily from the big studios but what does this mean for an investor it's like you know play games play as many games as you can if you like a game look at the tokens evaluate the items of that game you can also get involved in gamer guilds there's another opportunity for you so lots of opportunities to plug in get exposure to that decentralized identity that's the fifth one this is a a bet that i think is interesting in 2022 and not a lot of people are talking about it right now because i guess there's not a lot of projects tackling this space but i feel like uh we're kind of here right at the um the tech tree that is crypto we have some of the core primitives in place to bring about decentralized identity and that's we have sign in with ethereum right you have your private key you can sign in better than facebook you just like plug in via metamask or via your ethereum address we have self-sovereign e s names it's kind of a form of identity we have an ecosystem of nfts right these are like blue check marks potentially on on twitter what i feel like we need to complete the decentralized identity story is like attestations some sort of proof of reputation there are a few projects that uh i'm tracking that are related to this but nothing has really broken out but i i think it's not far-fetched to to start to see this emerging the space of like on-chain resumes right like the work the things that i'm doing on chain i can associate with my reputation and i can get kind of a real life level up with that i also think um we might start to see interesting experiments with crypto-native social networks in this space too so decentralized identity is as a category i guess i don't have a lot of specific projects in mind but like my eyes are peeled wide open i think something cool could happen in 2022 but that's just a hunch what's your take on this yeah i think the whole sign in with ethereum thing like imagine imagine like you know sign in with facebook signing sign in with google sign in with ethereum that button existing at the same time the web 3 narrative is taking off and becoming mainstream uh that i think we're like hang on i can sign in with google like prenormal or i can sign in with this ethereum thing that like from what i'm told it gives me self-sovereignty and power and i get to stick my middle finger up to google and not give them any of my data like maybe that sounds like kind of compelling i like to stick it to the man and uh maybe maybe that's how this goes maybe uh signing with ethereum like arises at the same time that what the web 3 meme starts to become you know a household name absolutely guys uh there are a few other spillover categories we can't get into we touched five but let me just list them off really quick still kind of bullish on crypto banks okay because these are going to out maneuver the incumbents and by that i mean like the coin base is gemini's block 5's ftx of the world there's space for that probably in a good investor portfolio not financial advice also infrastructure like block explorers analytics tools decentralized storage all these indexing protocols like the graph these are really the the picks and shovels of crypto and i think that's an interesting category to uh to keep inside of a portfolio i'm also bullish on super wallets right we saw metamaster adding defy features um i'm really excited about things like xerion and zapper and what they do in the future these are really the front ends to the decentralized financial system i think these are the the banks of the future in a way it's uh bankless banks of the future really excited about what arjun's doing with its smart contract wallets now that has layer two i think um we'll see that experiment play out bullish on that um nfts and d5 i know that was a major theme in the recent um nft conference you went to right so kind of this hybrid investment category where we're fractionalizing nfts we're getting indexes of nft exposure there's hedging projects on nfts like d5 meets nfts is a really interesting space and of course uh nft apps okay open c was not the last answer to like nft apps all right guys like open space open c is awesome but it's ebay okay and it's 1998 and we still have like google and facebook and instagram and all of these other application uh categories to unlock so i think there's going to be several generations of opportunity of apps that are built on top of this nft primitive and they'll look a lot different than openc and do different things versus openc so that's it from a bet's perspective man we went through a lot we just went through the the five things that we got right the five things that surprised us five mental models and five bets going into 2022. um how do you want to end this for for the holidays what's uh what are we thinking about going into you know 2022 that you want to leave folks with yeah the discussion i want to have just to wrap this this whole 2021 year up in 2022 predictions your uh uh conversation up is uh ryan 2022 bigger equal to or not as big as a deal uh as 2021 is with regards to crypto we're gonna get crazier it's gonna be about the same amount of crazy oh yeah definitely bigger why do you think definitely bigger well uh first of all it could be wrong right it's like probabilistic i could be wrong but like i've learned that um when you're wrong it's best to be wrong bullish in crypto and we have a ton of momentum going to the next year i think there's a ton of growth catalysts ahead for crypto and um you know i think layer two is gonna be huge i think uh yeah if you're gonna emerge i think in general crypto as a category is gonna absolutely fly next year and it's gonna be a very bullish year um could be wrong other things can happen but like i'd rather be wrong bullish than wrong bearish because on average you'll be right and you'll be more right over the long run uh what's your take on that what do you think yeah so if say that that in order for that take to be right as in like it's going to continue to continue to be bullish and maybe even be a little crazier than 2021 even though that's really hard uh being being bullish and being crazier than 2021 are different things i'm also bullish i'm not not necessarily ready to commit that 2022 will actually be crazier than 2021 because 2021 was pretty damn crazy but i could definitely get on board with it being another bullish year and so granted say let's say let's say 2022 is a bullish year and what that means is that three out of the four quarters of the year are green uh and q4 is is higher in market cap values than the end of q2 for example um does that mean that it was a super cycle in in that mind in your mind uh i'm still so i'm still i'm still kind of longer fourth cycle you know so i i'm still not fully bought into the idea that um this is a super cycle and the bull run never never ends um basically and that we've you know reached this place of mainstream adoption i i do think that we'll have a very bullish uh next year i think this is just a longer cycle than previous cycles i do think this cycle kind of breaks the mold of previous cycles except that it's just a repeating pattern and every cycle gets a little bit longer i mean we did this episode with ben cowan and talked a little bit about that um but i do think we'll get exuberant and there will need to be a a pullback and that pullback will feel very drastic to a lot of newer entrants in the space i think some of the people have seen cycles before we'll just sort of shrug it off and stay zen but you know people will call it a bear market rather than this idea of a super cycle what do you think uh i'm just trying to wrap my head around if we have a blow off top or not because like say if we can get some sort of just like vision of the future and the future tells us that like crypto prices are going to go up 20 quarter after quarter for the next four to six quarters well you know what happens next a blow off top because everyone buys it because then and then just gets too exuberant right yeah exactly and so like in my mind i'm kind of worried like it doesn't matter how long and slow and steady and sustainable crypto price rises are because the more that that's true the more likelihood you accidentally accidentally manifest a blow off top oh i think there's going to be a blow off top to be clear would it blow off top in 2022 maybe not in 2022 maybe not but like if not 2022 then you know into 2023 you know like it's going to happen like we're not done with blows blows off the top and it like and it's not binary either right like you could have two blow off tops that are smaller blow off tops and maybe that's just part of the larger bull market maybe it's a mini blow off top like who knows uh the 2017 blow off top was one single gargantuan blow-off top eruption uh and then we suffered our hangover for the next two years i don't know maybe maybe we're more mature as an industry maybe we just have a bunch of mini blow-off tops you know i'm feeling zen though david is cause like i don't feel a pressure to trade those things oh yeah like i'm just like way too difficult way too deep yeah i mean i don't i don't i don't um i don't feel like i have to time it right like i'm you know holding space next decade settler not a trader and um that restores some some zen so just let it play out slowly and let the traders worry about these things uh at some level but yeah it is always nice to be bullish i think i think the case for a crazier 2022 uh resides in inflation uh if inflation stays hot 2022 will get crazy i wonder if there's some diminishing i'd be interested in having jim bianco on or somebody like talk about in flinholden or somebody it's like um how is there a point of diminishing returns where it's like inflation gets so hot and you know maybe double digits or something that like crypto gets crushed as a result we get this like people just get scared yeah people get scared like crypto's still a risk-on asset is it not and so in high inflationary circumstances how many people are going to want to hold risk on assets versus other it's a it's a risk on asset but also it is strong property rights in a world where inflation tends to bring on governments that's right to take a lot of property it's weird right it's in this weird place where that's why it's this industry is notoriously hard to predict uh from that perspective but um you'll be fine if you're bullish long run i think i think that's guys always worked before look we haven't said it thanks for hanging with us throughout the year uh we we definitely appreciate the community we appreciate you listening to this podcast giving us your time um you know we hope you enjoy some
