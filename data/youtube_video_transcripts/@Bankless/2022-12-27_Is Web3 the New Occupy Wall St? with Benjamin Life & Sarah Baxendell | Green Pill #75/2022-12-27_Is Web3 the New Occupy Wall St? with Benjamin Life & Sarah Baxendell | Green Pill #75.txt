foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we're discussing whether web3 is the new Occupy Wall Street how web3 relates to Occupy Wall Street why it matters and what we have to learn in the web 3 space from the Occupy Wall Street movement so um on the Pod we have Sarah baxtendel from the regen Network been in web3 for several years has done a bunch of stuff with permaculture also was involved in Occupy Wall Street back in the day we have Benjamin life who works in the independent political sector and was a social impact filmmaker also involved in Occupy Wall Street back in the day so we talked about where web3 Occupy Wall Street a line and share DNA as social movements and also where they detract from each other and how they take different approaches to the various movements that they're in and we also talk about the limits of being able to make those types of comparisons because uh both are decentralized distributed movements and it's hard to talk in generalizations about any of them so I think that uh when we're talking about regen web 3 and web 3 for social change taking a look at a movement that happened to generation before us with Occupy Wall Street is really fruitful exercise and so I think that you're really going to enjoy this podcast with Sarah and Ben enjoy working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work while opolis manages the back end there's a lot

um I'm here today holding two lenses one is I was a organizer for the Occupy Wall Street New York City sustainability working group and the other is in the world of web3 I currently were constructive ecosystem for regen Network so I'm going to try to hold a little bit of past and present perspective in today's conversation great then you're gonna you want to go next yeah my name is Benjamin life um I was at the Boston occupy and as of late I've been working in the U.S independent political sector for an organization called The Independent National Union working to organize political Independence for good governance and then I also work on a project called open Civics which is trying to bring together systems Architects and Community organizers and elected officials to help redesign systems at the local level beautiful um well I I'm really excited to have this conversation with you all today the topic is this really obnoxious tweet that I sent that said web3 is the new Occupy Wall Street uh which you know uh created some debate on Twitter but you know the things that I see are that there's a lot of X Occupy Wall Street people building in web 3 um and because of that we have a lot of being able to think differently and swim against the mainstream current uh there's a focus in the space on group collective intelligence over hierarchy and to focus on Wall Street and its Financial rails but building an open source Financial system it's an alternative to Wall Street for a new generation and those are the parallels that I saw between Occupy Wall Street and web3 that caused me to send that really obnoxious tweet but uh I think that the three of us were kind of debating in the replies the merits of uh of the parallel and and I felt like it was an important conversation and worth having living in a more High context environment than on Twitter replies so um Sarah maybe I'll go to you first just to tee things off what is your uh what is your reaction to the statement web3 is the new Occupy Wall Street my reaction was a lot of resistance personally um and I and I was thinking about this morning I think a lot of this really roots in what we're using as our description of web3 if we're talking about the social impact quarter of web 3 the environmental impact quarter of web 3 I think that there are more parallels to the underlying ethos of Occupy Wall Street than if you look at crypto or web3 at Large but I think at a pattern level of humans and organizing and decision making and decentralization no matter what use case we're taking a look at there are a lot of parallels to what really happened in a natural organic and unexpected way in Ducati Park in regards to how people gather how they make decisions um and I think that there's really a big difference between what it's like to be in a crowd of 5 000 people making a decision on what it's like to be you know on the internet on Twitter on a commonwealth Forum having an opinion the discourse and the environment of that and the energy of that to me are really fundamentally different lived experiences so I'm excited to dig in because I think there's some similarities and some differences that I do think are really important to tease out yeah where I I completely agree with you at the experiential level and maybe even at the cultural level there's some really important parallels or distinctions um the reason I feel like web3 is is in some ways an evolution of occupy is around what occupy was trying to achieve and there was this rise in awareness of the inherent systemic Corruption of our financial system and yet the kind of means of redress of that grievance was an encampment that struggled to actually create an alternative or to get a new Financial system um that could solve a lot of those Grievances and so I think it was an important cultural moment of bringing awareness to the Brokenness of our financial system but where I see web3 continuing that Arc is actually being able to provide the infrastructure that would create the foundation for a new economic system that could have different design principles than our current one and I think we're seeing with things like FTX that a lot of the principles of decentralization have been kind of lost in the early commodification of web3 but I think at The Primitives level um we have a lot more tools that we can work with to actually achieve the goals of occupy now than we did in 2011. yeah I definitely agree with that I mean I think for me the part that I get stuck on really comes down to what is the point of web3 and if you take a look at the vast majority of web3 it really is about something distinctly to do with the financial system it's it's a D5 exchange it's some sort of dap it's really focused frankly on people making money whereas occupy was focused on having a radical disruption experience that was very direct action oriented both in the park and in the marches in the actual Street activism that was really associated with that experience and what it was trying to do there in the financial district would say the underlying structure of capitalism as a concept is sick it is a sickness that is cultural that is really evolved across the entire globe and so to me I struggle to get over that hurdle in comparison because I do think that the vast majority of web 3 activity is about individuals making money and there's all these components that really do reflect an evolution from occupy the holding of your own Keys the decentralization of validators on proof of stake chains the decentralized decision-making mechanism the fact that you can jump into a protocol and write your own smart contract there's a lot of decentralization and autonomy inside of the web 3 systems that we work with on a technical level but to me the vast majority of that is still about people making money first and foremost and any occupation that was not the goal the goal was not for the people that showed up to make money and because of that there were millions and millions of dollars of donations that came in and then there were consensus mechanisms that were enormously public that anybody could join about how that money should be distributed so for me I think that's the real struggle and I I think about it on the level of art I think about it on the level of intention I think about it and the level of water rebuilding and why and being from a protocol that is environmental rails Financial Solutions for environmental impact you know the financialization component is there as well so I do think Finance is this Universal threat of web 3 but I do wonder if the overall whole web through space is more just decentralized capitalism than a true evolution I think that's a really interesting take I mean the way I'm viewing this in my mind is that there's like the web 3 movement which is just decentralized immutable ledgers that you can program your values into and there's like one Circle there and then there's like it's almost like a Venn diagram the other circle is a bunch of Occupy Wall Street alumni who are now seeing this as an opportunity to meet the ends that they had with Occupy Wall Street but just on on on new rails and it's only within the intersection of those Venn diagrams that Occupy Wall Street or with it web 3 is the new Occupy Wall Street and the and the outside of that Venn diagram on the web 3 side is like just more capitalism and you know unfortunately there's like FTX collapses and and scams that are out there too and so maybe within the within that Venn diagram that's where web3 is the new Occupy Wall Street but I do think that within that that intersection there is some really interesting opportunity space um for doing things that maybe would have felt naive 12 years ago for creating real systemic change and and and and that's that's why I'm excited about this conversation the the one thing about the the hyper financialization that I think is interesting to to track is we we're we've never been in this part of the cycle before I mean there I haven't been in crypto long enough to have seen as many of the bearable cycles that I think maybe both of you have um but I'm curious if this the the way that this cycle is changing the Dynamics of crypto itself might I don't know if the staking protocols that were so wildly all over the place in the last cycle if those will make it through this uh Market I I'm curious if the way that the the regulatory space is Shifting um if if it'll be possible for that hyper financialization to continue and I admit I myself got lost in it I thought it was going to be the best social impact um funding strategy that would ever exist is like free money and but then you look at the underlying principles and it's actually it's all um not really real like there's no real value that's being created there and so in the same way that I think capitalism is destroying itself I think the hyper financialization kind of already destroyed itself in web3 and I'm curious to see if that aspect of web3 makes it through this next phase and you know the the meme of the Degen to regen pipeline like I'm curious how many degen's through this cycle will actually move into more of the refi space yeah and re-fired the use case aside I think the most for me this is just my personal opinion having been here for a couple years I think the most interesting thing about blockchain is application specific use case potential and the fundamental transparency of the data set the democratization of participation the autonomy of holding your own keys to me I think that we're gonna have to as a culture and as a blockchain community really make a choice to Showcase these real world use cases if we can't make a strong enough industry-wide argument that blockchain has real world use cases and can be a real value proposition on the global level we are going to get out regulated there's there's just no way around that and for me I was thinking about this earlier about you know I was saying in terms of police because when when I got down to Occupy Wall Street to be completely honest it was an absolute accident I thought Radiohead was playing someone sent me like a one-time email straight up and now I got there they were like great I was playing this part you should go I was like and then that's a great occupy origin story uh the total Universe accident I had no idea it's crazy but I ended up in this March to the police headquarters in New York City and the energy of the experience at the time I didn't even know what police brutality was in my you know upper middle class New England white privilege it wasn't you know a world view that that I had come from and I was thinking this morning about the the system aggression I saw it occupy the people who the police curb stopped the fingers and hands I saw broken the ripping apart of direct action activists linked together arm to arm on Bridges and comparing that um as like a social subjugation to the lack of federal action around collapses like FTX really makes me question intention um around our industry from our regulatory level because I think there's so much Wall Street Capital in all of the investment and all of the exchanges and in all of the organizations that to some extent I actually think that they're afraid to regulate and they've been afraid to regulate for a long time so I really think that the whole point of blockchain is the social organizing mechanism a social decision-making that's mechanism a social graph a trust graph a truth graph and we have a real responsibility more than anything else to tell the stories of our use cases in our communities and build honest and authentic technology that will outlive us um because to me you know a lot of the Occupy Wall Street notes are lost somewhere in a Google group that if I work hard enough I could probably find a password to but none of that as a historical record is public none of that decision making is something that everyone can't get access to so I do think we're in a different social Evolution point in this juncture and I really look forward to how we communicate our use cases and how we build public conferences about them the one thing I walked away with more than anything from occupy is a love of public decision making and like a real willingness to be like radically vulnerable and a pile of people making decisions and helping people make decisions and I think we have a real opportunity to build a shared governance culture and a shared decision-making culture that I don't think we put enough time and energy into we put energy into defy exchanges and getting our little Rewards and we've all participated let's not pretend like we're not up in there reaping all the aprs that were so crazy but I think it demands something more of us on a soul level and so I'm kind of excited about the bear Market because I just think that we can evolve why we're here and our intentions more authentic way when we're not stuck in a hype cycle and I think the social dimension of governance is something that the Dow space is still learning and yet there's this whole other body of work and people who've been doing that kind of stuff and they haven't been in the web 3 space and that intersection is really interesting to me because Dao's create a kind of back end for distributed decision making but like what the social process is to scaffold the the integration of perspectives and and listening to each other and finding decisions that are actually more consensus based than like first passive post voting or reputation based um but when I imagine occupy happening again now powered by Dows and to actually have be able to collectively raise and hold funds to pay for the Medics to pay for food it feels like it it would accelerate occupy if it were to happen again to have those tools um and it might actually improve web3 because a lot of people who are in the social process space could actually integrate that wisdom into the web 3 Tech stack one of the things that I've been studying as a technologist for the last couple decades is technology Trends and and there's this thing called the Gartner hype cycle in which you have some sort of trigger that creates a peak of inflated expectations and then that collapses and you go into this thing called the trough of disillusionment and um and then you get into What's called the slope of Enlightenment and then there's this thing called the plateau of productivity and you know this is sort of a um sort of something that assumes that the technology gets through the trough of disillusionment in reality there's a bunch of different technologies that just stay in the disillusionment draw forever because there's never a slope of Enlightenment and I'm wondering if you know I I've I'm kind of just thinking about that as a cyclical way that movements happen um and just thinking about the peak of inflated expectations that happened um with Occupy Wall Street in in which there was a lot of really amazing momentum and social change and probably inflated expectations for what was possible and then when the camps were all broken up by the police and we all moved on then that that was a trough of uh disillusionment and if the integration of Occupy Wall Street and Dao era tools can kind of be the maturing of the movement and a plateau of productivity I guess Benjamin I'm just saying back to you what you said where if occupy was on Dow based rails then it could do way more in and probably be more productive than than otherwise otherwise noted like I don't know I guess maybe the question that I'll take back to you is are there any theories of systems or social movement maturation that that fit your modeling and how does that my comments about the Gartner hype cycle resonate with you all yeah that you bring up a really important paradigm shift that I think I want to unpack some more which is that even in my example of what a new occupy could do with Dows the only use cases I gave were things relative to protest like how do you run an effective protest and where I'm really interested to go is in part of the paradigm shift is instead of organizing people to use our voices to delegitimize a system like the Federal Reserve or capitalism itself or the banking industry I think we have the potential of galvanizing that energy of needing change into actually building parallel systems and structures instead of protesting things and there's this really incredible organization called the bloom Network and they're building on web3 but they're mostly focused on like actually improving quality of life in place and so they you know build Community Gardens and they do after school programming and they're this very post-capitalist anti-capitalist organization but they're not protesting anything and I think that's a really interesting paradigm shift with web3 where the the kind of solar Punk ethos of like well this whole thing is screwed and and failing um what would we build if we actually wanted to build a society that was Equitable and we end with web3 we can actually just start to do that instead of protesting you know the Brokenness of our current institutions I want to add some Parallels for my own experience because I actually think it's a back and forth that happens to to everybody on an individual level so you know when I when I was in Ducati Park sustainability working group only gave like it only gave you crap about the Earth like I literally found it because someone had painted the Earth on a piece of just like you know whatever and I was like this has got to be where my people are and I just kept harassing people at this little Earth picture until I figured out where the meeting was like there was no you had to be aggressive to find your way into what you were after there um and I through that process um that's how I became a permaculture designer there were folks that were Building green water systems um or gray water systems for the kitchen that I started to help with that are these amazing organizers in New England I got to go to all of these classes we replanted all them Ducati Park um we started to take all the compost out to Community Gardens on bicycle we developed bicycle uh generator systems that ran all of the Power for press and media and then eventually when we got rated and I do think we got rated because of us this is my theory in the end I think we got rated because we had developed a decentralized power system that the people could bike on themselves after they turned the power off in the park as a way to try to Scamper us out of there because it was the night that we distributed the Final 14 bikes that they got rated um so I afterwards really I became a designer I became a Solutions architect and spent a Whole Decade building Farms building Gardens helping communities decide how to redesign their Park re-envisioning public space through group design and public decision making process I mean there were 25 000 people who participated in decisions for the parks that I was a planner for in the city of Pittsburgh for almost seven years and now I work at Regent and I find that this I have this new desire to protest and it's not that I would go in the street but I think being comfortable enough being vulnerable um and speaking up is a really critical aspect of intervening in our complacency and you know now that I have more technical experience under my belt I can I can explain to you how the different blockchains work and how the assets move and the architecture and decision making and the code in a way that you know that's not my background um I find this this new arrival at a point of saying in these cycles that we're in we have to speak up and not be complacent and so our voice and our creation is in fact protest as well as it is building the rails that are fundamentally necessary to build a new economic system and my question is really like what is our shared value set can we build one can we have a collective cross protocol cross whatever consensus process around what we think that our value set is because I fear that you know the occupation had its principles it had its little pamphlet you knew you knew when everybody thought they were there for and in that park there was the beating drum like literally the guys that literally they took it on themselves to literally have a drum circle for like six months straight like nobody stopped drumming no matter what time of day it was to the point where you were begging them to stop but what is our heartbeat as a community what are we here to build and how do we build cross-organizational consensus around what that mechanism should look like in a way where we can be decentralized but we can come together with a shared ethos I'm looking for that charity ethos being this far along in this journey and I'm looking for how we build charity ethos across whose Tech is best and who's protocols flies or who thinks they're you know fanciest on the deck here I want to know what we all want to create in the world together and find ways for us all to work together and build that consensus to me that's really the Golden Nugget for us as a community moving forward I've been using this phrase kind of largely inspired by Kevin about Civic hyperstructures the phrase hyperstructure and you put Civic in front of it there's something about like how do we facilitate the process of alignment between different social groups and actors one thing I noticed in your share was just how intensified the political polarization and the identity politics has become in the last 10 years since occupy and it's actually even hard for me to imagine that kind of pluralistic or diverse of a group of people in one movement today it feels like you have to be part of more of a niche movement context in order to speak the same language and be seen as on the in-group of of that and so I'm I don't have an answer for this but I feel like you know is there a sort of social architecture with that could be that could utilize web3 to help build the nodes of of the movement and the connections between those nodes um because it feels like we actually are all rooted in at some levels there's certain Universal principles I keep I come back to life and quality of life um as a kind of universal principle like we're all going to have different experiences of what quality of life means to us but if we can collectively say we actually want to create an economic system that that improves the well-being of people and communities then that creates at least some kind of a shared value system um and but then there's going to be a lot to metabolize to actually come into alignment as a larger movement together and so I don't have the answers for this but I'm I'm curious how technology might be able to scaffold the the process of depolarization and helping people find those shared value systems one of the things we talk about a lot when I was at git coin is this idea of cooperation across social distance so basically you know cooperation across distance is is is basically like if we're not in the same social network but we can still cooperate on on something and that's like the opposite of tribalism and being in our own little Echo Chambers and so you know I I think that that's that's definitely one really component of Coalition building and in doing it across dowels across layer ones across tribes I think is a really important thing and and I think that maybe what we're building towards here is Nathan Schneider who's also an Xbox occupier who's uh web3 adjacent Now talks a lot about how in the web the web has gotten really good at disrupting power uh by creating protest but it hasn't really Gotten Good at holding power and and I think that that's maybe one maturation point that we really need to see is is creating systems that are stable and can hold power and still be legitimate in if if occupy was to move on to web3 rails and and it seems like occupy was really good at disrupting power um or at least creating a social movement that felt like it could disrupt power what would it look like to hold power as the generation that went through occupy uh matures is kind of the question at the tip of my tongue yeah I think that's a really interesting question I mean I think it rests on social coordination and a just a really a good example of where I felt like this happened just really beautifully and magically this fall this is just a very distinct thing that happened um the blockchain infrastructure carbonoff setting working group has been trying to like gather all the refund homies for you know a year and it never felt so alive as when we all met in coconut Colombia in person and actually got to see each other face to face and actually got to develop real relationships and actually got to talk about what does technological interoperability with like to us and how can we really work together what's our shared value is how can we share resources how can we have shared decision making definitely map a bigger system that we want to create together so I think part of power is being connected in community um and being willing to sort of take your boundaries down about being bigger better or best um but I also think power is money because money reflects contention and focus and finding a way to further and deepen the capitalization of these blockchain for good whether it's social good or environmental good or other good use cases I think they're really expanding the capital investment into those spaces and finding ways to really fund those economic models is largely going to be critical to us having power we don't have power unless you have place unless you have position and a lot of that still rests on this investment Capital cycle that again comes back to that 99 thing and are we going to be Bankers or are we going to be the bank lists and and how do we how do we negotiate and navigate between outside forces and forces of ourselves because I think we create so much value that in my mind is worth so much more to our social and planetary Evolution than like the big D5 verticals that have a lot of you know total value left I want to see like total value captured into social organization and into resilience systems and that requires a real Evolution but it also requires a big capital investment as you value proposition in our ecosystems yeah it feels like the the maturation of both how we approach the strategy of them of the movement realizing that at a structural level we we are in some ways forced to play into some amount of financialization of even social impact um and yet there's ways that we can do that in a more ethical way that's aligned with our principles and values but it's it's we're not just doing it for free in our spare time we're actually building models where people can be remunerated for taking pro-social actions um and as far as like making it real and and actually holding power um I was reminded of the experiment of redemption Dao which if you were in tracking it was very similar to Constitution doubt people trying to raise money to buy uh land in the Congo and there's a lot of complex intersectional conversation we could have around colonization and the kind of naivete of some of the organizers who weren't aware of just how challenging it is to work with it with the government in the Congo but it came from this like deep I felt it myself of like reading in the New York Times this giant area of rainforest is going to be extracted and the amount of carbon that's released from the peat lands alone in that area let alone the the fossil fuels that will be burned that will be extracted from that place it was so viscerally disturbing that I got the impulse of why people wanted to raise as many millions as possible in a very short period of time to buy that land and put it into a trust um and so I think where things get really real is like can we hold things of value together and direct those flows of value into different value systems that are non-extractive and I for all of the amount of times that like Frontline ecological protesters go and like cut the lines uh and do kind of um direct action to disrupt fossil fuel extraction what if on the other side of that they're a group of refi investors who are going to buy the contracts to those natural resources to keep them in the ground is that a strategic necessity at this point if we found that the wheels of capitalism keep turning no matter how many people put their bodies in front of it to try to get it to stop do we actually have to use capitalism to end capitalism and that's that's the inquiry I'm in I think I've settled long ago and yes like I I am not afraid to admit that I am a catalyst trained in financial capitalism at a corporate level who is unafraid to use those mechanisms for good I mean I mean just give you a stat I mean I spent 10 years helping people develop their projects developing projects my own developing projects for cities I've raised over 30 million dollars as somebody who just helps people raise money in that time period so I like to the phrase I use with like Gregory from regen is I like to call it composting capital I'm not afraid to use the structural mechanism to say okay cool how do we you know how do we take those funds and put them into something really extraordinary that it's going to change many different people's lives and you know I would love for us to have a hundred billion dollar fund that there's a consensus mechanism where leadership across all these organizations in the blockchain space work to have decision making processes and bring communities of practice into those decision-making practices and actually move Capital into building the solutions that we want to see I think that's possible but it requires a willingness for all of our leaders in this ecosystem to work together to largely take time out of their days to work together to raise funding at a scale that allows us to have control over the solutions architecture and the decision-making architecture and you know I would love to see that be possible and you know hearing this in in myself out loud you know I wonder if maybe that's part of my next wave of service in web 3 is pushing that dial Beyond you know the stratified lines of who we work for and whose Tech we build into how do we movement build and capitalize Solutions oriented movement building in a way that is authentic and transparent and Collective I think that could really change a lot of things around the world if we were focused and coordinated collectively the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the

go to goldfinch.finance to get started what you all said about uh was using capitalism to end capitalism kind of reminds me of um you know there's this this Winston Churchill quote about how democracy is the worst form of government except for all all the others that have been tried and I kind of feel like the same way about capitalism is that it's it's the worst form of economic systems except for all the other ones um and so you know that leads me to okay we can now program our we can now program money why don't we try some more some more economic systems so that you know we can create an evolution of capitalism that's more regenerative and um you know the the stuff that we put in the green pill book is going from just like creating rewards for for for now me but like in more of like a bentoist type of of system which uh creates rewards for for now us and for future us um a type of capitalism that rewards value creation instead of just value extraction um removes the incentive to externalize harm I think the decentralized markets are a really powerful tool for allocating Capital but we just need to it's like they need to be oriented in the right direction and I feel like that's the opportunity uh of the space and and also maybe creating little local bubbles isn't the right word but local economies that are oriented around public goods or permaculture or Civic spaces and and allowing them to uh have their own value systems and capital that Finance them feels like a huge opportunity for this space so I don't know if that's if that's occupy being the new web 3 but it feels like it's an opportunity for occupy organizers to use web3 to to realize some very occupy uh like like ends so I don't know curious your reaction to that if any the one addition I would make is I the change to our relationship to climate change and ecological collapse that the kind of trophic Cascades of the six mass extinction uh for me I look at ecological claps as a kind of heuristic of systems design so what are the core human needs that need to be designed for in these parallel systems to minimize human suffering as the Glo as globalized Supply chains begin to fracture and fail and I think that can actually help Orient our building towards the things that actually are needed at the Grassroots level to create Healthy Communities instead of this sort of abstraction of like let's try a bunch of different things like let's definitely experiment but I think having a kind of design space that's like how do we work on local food how do we ensure that we have clean water how do we put more of our community land into trust and have funding to um rehabilitate areas that have been really profoundly extracted from and those kind of heuristics I feel like are the kind of where it grounds in and it's it's not just sort of the abstraction of making any type of system it's like how do we design using web3 to account for the core human needs so I mean as someone who's in this movement and you know maybe I know more about it than most from doing 70 episodes of this podcast and like um is it it feels like those experiments are happening I mean I'm looking at the regen Network I'm looking at proof of humanity I'm looking at all the hundreds of impact owls that we've found to me the problem is that the design space we have the tools the problem is that the talent and the capital are not focused on those tools they're focused on Vegetable Farms they're focused on with chasing the highest yield and so the big opportunity for me feels like how can we plant in the uh in the minds of of a hundred thousand digens this idea that the best yields come from going into regen web3 projects into the regen Network into proof of humanity into impact else because what that does is it up regulates those projects allows them to scale their Capital it gives sustainable yields I mean assuming these things these impact hours are more sustainable and anti-fragile than things like FTX and you know like the yam Finance ponze it gives them stronger yields um it gives us all legitimate use of crypto um you know the financials should be a means to an end not an end in themselves in my opinion and um it just feels like it solves problems for all the different actors in the ecosystem but I don't know how to make a case that case to the djends because it like I think as soon as they hear a social impact it sounds like woo-woo to them or it sounds like something where they're going to lose their money and so connecting creating that connective tissue I think is is what feels like the work ahead of us so I don't know any reaction to that but that's at least how I'm thinking about it it's interesting we're facing this right now with this campaign we have called cosmosero and the goal is just to get protocols and validators to take responsibility and offset their footprint they have a footprint let's just be honest here but what is getting people to participate is in climate altruism as I would describe it it's that there's going to be a liquid pool of carbon it's that there's gonna be rewards it's that they could do a native token Swap all of these financialization mechanisms and so I think we have to be as people inside the impact space unafraid to utilize capitalistic language in order to draw them in and I think we just have to come up with a better strategy of like cool degender regen is a meme but like how many people really care about that it's only us making fun of them and like isolating ourselves with that Meme I'm more interested in like how do we really tell a financialization story for ecological systems and those social impact of those ecological systems because to me you know that single drum beat and this is what I look up to at occupied it's the gift that it gave me that keeps on giving is that the climate collapse is the only thing we're putting my time my energy and my money into and if I was so independently wealthy that I could fund everything I freaking would even if I only got one percent um but it's really a social Evolution it's really like a mental architecture Evolution that we have to be proactive about um that's why I always tell people I used to work for JP Morgan they take the conversation more seriously when they know I had all those licenses so I always lead with that because it disarms them and makes them realize that I was them but I chose to apply those skills to a different problem solutions that than necessarily the one that they have with their balance sheets and I'm game so like we should do this not just talk about it but like find a way to do these things I I do have like one group of really close d-gen friends of mine and it's kind of rare for me uh to have that experience of like trying to instill or advocate for principles that really matter to me um but to feel like there's this kind of nihilism in the Degen space that's just like yeah cool like have you seen this like stick man it's the latest one that I'm Shilling and it's been really hard for me because I'm so Earnest it like actually required me to actually become to let go and be like okay if you guys want to do that I'll be over here building this stuff if you ever want to come hang out you're welcome to um and there's this real question of like what is value what is valuable um and then this sort of nihilistic d-gen space like well whatever anything can be valuable instead of like Community is valuable A Healthy Living Earth is viable and so I don't know how you make that bridge I think the bridge is being built this is just I'm going to add some financialization information here one the SEC now requires um everything listed on the exchanges to report through EST and to truecarbon data information and really from a corporate sustainability and corporate finance perspective carbon is now an asset on the balance sheet the more pardon that goes on to the balance sheet which I actually think is the more important Financial intervention than companies offsetting the more and this is where I'm totally on the same team as Gregory wholeheartedly admitting that out loud I do believe that as corporations and nation states put the value of ecology on balance sheets the system re-architects itself so to me that's like the Lynch pin in the situation that if you pull out the whole damn blows but that takes a long time for people to make brave choices at corporate levels and I think that looking at what is it that we value and how and why it's a conversation we need to have in a more mathematical and forthright fashion than we currently do we can't lead with hey climate Doom or hey impact good we need to lead with dollars and cents and be okay doing that because it transforms and compost Capital into the system that we think it ought to be but that drives from first principles as I go back to do we all have the same drum beat can we Define our principles and have multiple strategies to that aim depending on who you are and what you bring to the team yeah I don't think a web 3 is having the same drum beat maybe abusing your analogy but it feels like an orchestra uh in in you know as long as we're all playing different instruments and that there's a Sim there's a symphony that's developed uh between all of them then it feels good um yeah well so we only have four more minutes until the the bottom of the hour so I'm wondering um if y'all have anything that else else to say in closing and if there's anything that I didn't ask you that that you all want to say I I think the the I love the kind of the Paradox here because I think that there's something about the financialization of carbon and of social impact that um I think occupy did a better job than web3 has so far of questioning the underlying values systems of capitalism itself and um I don't want to go off on a whole tangent now but there's this notion of energy blindness uh Nate Haggins does an incredible work on this um that basically a large amount of the value that we're able to extract from the natural world is the product of millions of years of stored carbon in the ground and so we're actually taking from an energy store without replenishing it and so we've basically created an inflated value system where we think we can make things for cheaper than we actually can because we're not factoring in the amount the millions of years that it took for that carbon to become in that form and so it feels like we're actually running up against like a very material structural wall around value and and I think that could be a really rude awakening for a lot of people um when we start when it starts to become harder to extract that energy and energy costs go up and then costs of everything go up and so I think we're in this very narrow window right now where um we're not being forced to radically change those value systems but I think we will be um and so I don't know that we're going to need to make as much of the financialization argument um once it becomes really clear that we've so vastly extended beyond the carrying capacity of the earth that we're no longer able to produce things at the cost that we currently have been and that's just going to send so many different things into a totally chaotic systems chaos before they recalibrate to a new a new Basin and um and so yeah I would love to see more like deeper conversations about the nature of value in the web 3 space and I appreciate this conversation like bringing that ethos like back into my awareness it's a really good point I think I want to leave everyone with a little bit of hope that this is going to be better suited for those that are able to watch on YouTube so for anyone who's listening you should go see this on YouTube I have some real art from occupy I would like to show you um because I am a hoarder of you know important historical artifacts from the journey oh yeah and I want to make some points so this is a print of the uh march across the Brooklyn Bridge uh by a wonderful artist named lopi larrow very good friend of mine I've seen a long time but if you look at the spread that front line is women and I think here in web 3 we need to have more women more non-verinary people more people of color using these tools with us because occupations and Evolutions are often driven by women and those who are marginalized so on their behalf I want to show beautiful art that represents that and occupy if you looked under the hood it was there were a lot more women in occupies than there is in web 3 or in Tech and so I want to show you a couple more things because I totally am a true occupier that Hoards the original journals this is my favorite picture of the whole occupation in one of the newspapers it's like this young radical activist cup letting me know who they are kissing and I just want to remind folks that love the love of ourselves love our communities love possibility is a true driving force and a first principle that I think is really important I should think this is like the sweetest photo I ever saw if I didn't keep the rest of the newspaper I literally just like kept this page as an example but I'll also say that there's something visceral that hits to see the Wall Street Journal but it's called the occupied Wall Street Journal yeah I love that medically great I know totally they they had this epic Journal club and this might make some terrible audios I open this but I have the general strike Edition filled with arts and different posters so I want to show you a couple of them here because I think that we don't do enough climate Joy we didn't do enough art as activism in web 3 we view art as commodification but do we just make art to raise money do we just make art to like emancipate people from the drudgery of their daily lives I don't know that we use art as an essence in the same way that Occupy Wall Street did we use art as capitalism and they're just I want to find just this one last one because I know this is sort of me and a piece of paper pile this one is so beautiful and in a language I can't even read and so peaceful so I want to see us create climate Joy climate art climate activism and be totally unafraid to be weird and wonderful and let more of that vulnerability out in web 3 and to me when art is just seeping out of our pores then I will probably personally feel like occupy in web 3 are more of the same shared lived experience than I currently do so thanks for letting me show you my relics that I've kept for a decade folded peacefully in a drawer to keep them safe so if you're listening uh we'll have a link to the YouTube in the show notes where you can check out the last five minutes in which uh Sarah shows us her beautiful art but I also think that your audio voice over as you're talking to them is uh is worthwhile for audio listeners as well so thank you for sharing that pleasure thanks for letting me share this has been a really amazing conversation appreciate the thoughtfulness um in the care that went into preparing for it and and also just the fact that we took a low nuanced conversation on Twitter and brought it into a high nuanced place here so um thanks to the listeners for listening and and Sarah and Benjamin thank you for joining [Music] yeah thank you for holding space [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
