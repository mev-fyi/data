if your dow isn't moving items in the real world it's not doing anything welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with metadreamer out of the meta factory dao uh but meta dreamer has he's he's uh he's a dower so he's a bar of many different parts of the ethereum ecosystem uh and every time i talk to metadreamer either through through zoom or on discord or in real life the conversations just get really really cerebral really really cosmic and he's one of those he's one of the guys out there that i think really embodies the the core values of what makes this crypto space tick the the leaning into collaboration over competition and like this yes and mentality and this uh how do we create an abundance mentality rather than a scarcity mentality and really focuses on what i really try and get out of these layer zero podcasts is ultimately the code that we write will ultimately come to impact society for the better if we design these systems correctly and so he's very tapped into the whole point about crypto is to change culture the whole point about this whole revolution in digital money and digital finance is to have a better society and i think a lot of people when they come into the crypto space they feel that but they're in my mind is not enough conversations explicitly talking in that direction and so that is what bankless nation you are about to listen to right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with

going pretty good man are you david pretty good pretty good i think for the rest of this uh podcast i'll just call you meta how about that yeah or maybe dreamer dreamer probably dreamer i don't want to be referred to as meta yeah yeah right okay as soon as i said that i was like uh wait a second it's probably gonna be the other one yep uh so dreamer um who are you tell me about yourself uh yeah i'm uh i go by mega dreamer i'm a software engineer and designer i've been working in the dow space for uh just over two years now um founder of meta factory and uh work on a bunch of projects like metagame and source cred and coordinate and uh part of medic cartel ventures and uh yeah just someone helping to figure out where we're all going where are where are we going wow if we could only answer that question uh dreamer i think uh one of the reasons why i wanted to pull you on layer zero is because every time you and i have had conversations either through zoom or or in real life in person they always seem very cosmic uh and these are my my types of conversations uh and so that's where i hope this conversation goes i i hope to just make it i hope it ends up very being very very cosmic i'm gonna have to figure out how to get there uh and i think the first question that i want to ask to figure out how to get there is what do you really care about um both inside of crypto and outside of crypto what's what really just stands out as important to you what's what do you fixate on yeah so i think like from it's kind of like from my name itself i guess it's like you know not trying to fixate on like the surface level things but really trying to understand the underlying uh causes or sort of you know what's this like what's the root cause of this you know so that meta level um you know whether it's like you know within crypto and like figuring out like what what type of things to build um or even just like philosophically or on a like socio-political level like kind of breaking down what's really going on um and going deeper than just like um you know narratives that people hear or things that we you know like i think a lot of people it's just like more so about taking the things they hear from other people and sort of like recycling it or regurgitating it um but for me it's like trying to like break sort of what's like the underground mycelial network you know not necessarily the forest you know it's like the whole thing of like you missed a forest for a tree it's like people missed the mycelial network underground for the forest um so yeah so there's always one more stage of meta that we can get and you're trying you're always trying to chase the meta yeah and i guess like the the purpose of it is sort of you know uh i do think that you know things uh if you solve things at like the primitive level then you can like solve those problems downstream uh and you know that's how you also solve the most problems possible is like you know find the the uh i said this once yeah find the lowest common shelling point of something and like if you make like a one percent improvement there it could end up being like thousands of percent improvements in many areas just because you know it's downstream of a lot of these other things so i think uh like yeah that's like sort of important to me is like you know what's the like it's an engineering mindset you know which you know i went into school for computer engineering but it's like you're always min maxing right like what's the you know how do we get like what's the lowest budget we need for this project so it gets built to spec et cetera et cetera but you know really in a more like philosophical way of like uh what's like you know the lowest hanging fruit low hanging shelling points that we can address to make the most impact because i don't think there's any end destination um or some sort of happy state that we're working towards it's like all about the journey um so yeah i definitely resonate with that i think a lot of people in the crypto industry resonate with that journey of like trying to find the most bang for your buck when it comes to changing the world um uh the post post college i was always focused on like how do i uh help people feel better the most and so that led to a degree in psychology but then i got that i realized like oh well nutrition also is really important to helping people feel good so i layered on nutrition and all of a sudden i was like super fascinated with the way that the food that you eat impacts your psyche but then i realized you have to layer on physical movement on top of that it's like all right so then now i'm interested in a career path that was one part psychology one part nutrition one part physical movement and i was trying to figure out like how do i make a holistic career out of all these things and i saw just a bunch of bureaucracy but then i found crypto and i was like as learning about money and finance i was like oh well i mean if i'm really focused on trying to make the most amount of people feel the best i would probably try and rework the money in the finance system uh and so that's that's as soon as i kind of realized that about crypto that crypto is going to exactly what you said be like the the lowest common shelling point it's like oh well i was immediately just captivated by crypto because yeah i can just you can just have so much influence on the rest of everything about the way humanity works would you say that that was kind of a similar um path that you found when going into crypto yeah i i would definitely say so um it's interesting too because my wife's a dietitian so we get that uh crypto diet combo um but yeah i think like the you know even if you're like the bureaucracy thing is like you know that's everywhere it's omnipresent right like the whole you know people get convinced into thinking like we're in like a war of like left verse right or blue versus red or like you know this team versus that team um but the real sort of the split is like the elites versus the masses and that's apparent in every industry across every domain um and you know i think going back to the thing of like you know solving things at the root level money at the end of the day for better or worse powers like everything in the world right so if you can make improvements on how money is distributed and you know the access people have to it um and you know the not even going beyond money but even the concept of value itself and how we like engage with that as a society um you make improvements there then it applies you know across the board um and i think you know for any like smart person who like wants to make a change in the world i really think crypto is the place to do it and whether it's like you know i think it also crypto space needs to also like evolve a bit too where we need to get past like some of the technical stuff to actually like application like it's no longer about who has like the best l2s but who can use l2s to like make the best most real world impact right i think you said it once before of like if your dow isn't moving atoms in the real world it's not doing anything so i think we're in that phase now where you know the tech is pretty much like a solved problem it's a matter of time i think until like certain things get implemented but it's really time to like start walking that walk and i think you can apply crypto principles to pretty much like every industry you know with matter of fact you're doing it to fashion but it it goes beyond that too so um i think you know people getting involved in crypto now is just like getting involved with internet stuff back in the 90s you know whatever you're doing the internet's gonna like boost your ability to do it would you say that value is a lower common denominator a lower what was it was a phrase you use lower lowest common shelling point would you say value is a lower common shelling point than money and then like value is below money yeah i would say so if you think about so money itself if you think about how money was created it was created as a means to convert one form of value to another right like if i had a tomato and i wanted to get a haircut i would have to either like barter that which is harder to do but if i can sell the tomato and then use that money to buy a haircut then i can sort of achieve what i want so money is a means not the end itself right but the problem happened is like money became the only thing that's like quantify like objectively quantifiable and measurable and it's the whole saying of like you optimize what you measure so when money became quantifiable and measurable it became the measuring stick in how we like organized everything the whole game turned to like let's maximize gdp you know and we we all sort of convinced ourselves that that's really what we're trying to go for or that's the measure of like success or value is like money itself but money value is actually everything outside of money money is just a way to convert from one from value to another so if you can create things that are not money but serve the purpose of like converting one form of value to another then you get to move into this like post-money society where people can actually communicate and coordinate or you know around value itself and it's more pure form instead of only having to go through money because money becomes a bottleneck in a way where you look at you know the great depression like all the factories were there all the people were there to still work on those factories the whole thing came crashing down because the money broke you know so i think you know money is still going to serve the system it's still going to exist it's not going to go away but it becomes a means to an end and instead of optimizing for money we actually make value itself more objectively quantifiable and we can use cryptography for that as well so you know we've used it for money because money is what we've known all our lives but in the same way you can record like a number in a contract that represents some token balance you can also record like verifiable statements or attestations or all these things which you know i can then quantify my values or what i think is valuable and if you have a bunch of people quantifying what they think is valuable you can run algorithms on that and then figure out as a group what do these people think are valuable by summing it all together and then what that gives you is like a real-time map of like what's valuable or not you know in a bottom-up way and we're not sort of agreeing or trying to come to consensus on like what's valuable because that's impossible it's all subjective but we can get some sort of common ground by summing together our individual perspectives to get like the inter-subjective sum and then that is a map of what's valuable and once we have a map of what's valuable we just like sprinkle money on it because then you just like money is the sort of water and that water gets distributed to what people have attested to being valuable and then that acts as like again a part of the system but instead of like optimizing for the water itself we're optimizing for the fruit that we're growing with the water okay i didn't expect this to get so cosmic already 10 minutes into it this is beautiful let me let me try and like uh uh reiterate what you said just to make sure i'm i'm following along uh so we have all of these like pockets of value on around the world right got the shoemaker the tomato grower the pencil maker but all of these are valuable pencils and tomatoes and shoes are valuable for their own particular reasons but we use money as like this inter-subjective layer to instantiate the value that we have everywhere in the world and there's like a communication between all of these very non-fungible forms of value you know while many many many tomatoes can all be alike to each other they're still very different from many many apples and pencils and houses and cars and so we the money money is currency is like this fungible value uh tool to connect all these other distinct pockets of values separately and allow us to communicate value but then you said like oh then it kind of leads us to optimize for the wrong things right like we optimize for gdp and andrew yang talks about this a lot where like if we keep on optimizing for gdp we're just gonna drive ourselves off of a cliff like we're gonna optimize for gdp out of a cliff and it was what you said when like all the factories broke down like uh if the money breaks well there's still tomatoes to grow and there's still pencils to make and there's still like shoes shoes to to wear in fashion and stuff but we don't we've lost our ability to communicate the value between all of these things uh and so i think that gets really really interesting when we put all of these um expressions of value on chain where like daos have their own native tokens which are imbued with some sort of sets of value uh and they can be right next to another dao with another token with another set of values and sure we have like the stable coins and the ether but we also have the native dow tokens and since it's all on the same substrate we're all able to communicate value a little bit more efficiently a little bit more directly without perhaps having to go through an inter-money layer and uh where does it go from here is it first off is that a pretty a good summary or would you change anything to that and like what kind of where does it go from here because there's always the idea like oh we'll go back to a barter society because we'll have 10 bajillion tokens but i think a lot of a lot of economists would say like well no because you still need the money yeah for sure no i think that's a great summary um i think the where it's going from here is like most more than anything it's like a real mentality shift you know we have to do i think it's more about unlearning these things than it is about learning new things and the the mentality shift is like um you know the way we like value something so right now there's this disconnect between value that's created in society and where money goes right so a teacher for example arguably generates an incredible amount of value for society because they literally educate the people that then go on to like do all these things right so they're upstream of a lot of value that's created but they don't really get any sort of upside on that value or they don't sort of realize the you know teachers are underpaid overall in society because you know the value they create is disjointed from the value they receive the value they're receiving is in the school board here it's like not along the same like pipelines as the value they created um and then if you look at an investment banker for example like you know arguably they generate much less value for society they're mostly just like you know acting as like analogs between like other people's value creation but because they sit at the intersection where money flows like they uh essentially get much more of that upside not because they're generating more value but because they're closer to proximity to where like financial transactions are happening so in society right now the closer you are to where financial transactions are happening that's what indicates like you know how like successful you'll be if we change that where money can you know actually track value more directly then like it changes the game where instead of like the narcissists or like the psychopaths who can like you know become these like ceos and like do these crazy things like instead of them making the most money the people that make the most money in society would be the ones that are generating the most value as attested to by the sum of everyone's like individual opinion on what's valuable so if you think about like democracy it's a very like lossy form of governance because we're essentially trying to take all these like nuanced opinions of like 300 million people um in the states at least and then like condense it down to like a binary decision of like this party or that party so like and it's really never about like left or right or any of that or it's what it you know it is and andrew yang says this too is like certain problems need left thinking and certain problems need right thinking in different amounts and different places at different times so to like condense that all it's just like all that does is actually make sure these problems never get solved so that the elite can stay elite and then the people can just sort of continue to play that game and think that they're solving something or sort of making an impact so uh once you can like what this does is if everyone's making attestations on what they find is valuable at all times then like we get a real time like uh inter-subjective emergent democracy where it's like i don't have to like you're not like elect a representative to represent your views on a certain area like it decentralizes it where you can just express your views yourself and everyone's views are on some common substrate which can then be like composed and interpreted and you know uh be used to like drive decisions or make you know governance and you know that what that gives you is like that nuance where you can like height down to like the individual like hyper target exactly the needs and you know values of like each individual member society so instead of trying to like fix problems from like the top down where it's like you know you can try to like implement this one law and then like it fixes five things but breaks six other things and then you do that again and like fixes some things and breaks and we've been doing that for a very long time and like it's not really i'm not really optimistic that it's going to actually progress us fast enough to where we need to be to actually like get out of the sort of you know timeline we're in uh but i think going the other way around is like a potential we we could address it in that way but again it takes like you know it's it's the same thing like with the internet right when internet first came out people were just like how do we put radio on the internet how do we like put books on the internet how do we take what we know and just like apply this new thing to it instead of like you know the internet native companies like you know snapchat or instagram or facebook like they took that medium and you know utilized its strengths and unique advantages in a way that wasn't ever possible before in a way that like you couldn't even like really think of before if you just held on to like existing notions of what you had so in the same way i think you know it'll the new system will look like very different and sort of that's going to be the future like social media as well instead of like just communicating information online and trying to like influence others to do things we don't have to influence anyone we can just be constantly making attestations and what we find is valuable around us right so like social media i think it starts to become more decentralized as well where it's like really more about you and your relationships and the people you work with and these sort of like networks rather than you know oh here's a big influencer with a million followers it's like that's very like you know one to many but i think it's going to become more many to many and instead of just information also communicating in value through these like direct attestations yeah what does an attestation look like or is it more of an idea because like the i think the most like basic reductive version of an attestation is like i'm a student at school and my teacher taught me something really useful that day so i pull out my phone and i give her five stars like is that is that the agitation we're looking for i think like yeah there's attestations that are made all the time they're just not recorded or captured or you know made verifiable and sort of you know the whole crypto methodology so if uh you know like however like if you get paid from your dow that's an attestation if you like vote on a proposal that's an attestation you could we could actually create systems for like direct attestations too like you know uh like imagine like personal tokens and you can like whoever you give your personal token to that's essentially an attestation of some sort so i think attestations will take many forms and it's not really about creating this new system that we have to now learn how to use and adopt but more so like mapping our existing behavior and like building the technology around that and that's like another thing like i'm really sort of i really prioritize is you know creating technology and organizations and everything around the people instead of like molding the people around the technology or organization so you know in traditional startup or company it's like all the employees are sort of forming around the corporation and it's like you know they're sort of changing their identities or the way they're working or the things that they're doing to like conform to what this organization needs i think that will change in the future where at the center will actually be individuals and then like communities and groups of people and then organizations and products and tools will essentially be built around them to like conform to what they're doing what their needs are um and so in that sense it's like kind of flipping the table um a bit like finding out that like earth is not the sound of the universe and you know something like that so the idea would be in like instead of having the corporations that control us and our nine to five jobs being the center of the universe it flips it on its head and the corporations actually respond to the humans and answer to the humans rather than the humans answer answer to the to the corporations and it's all through the primitive of ada stations like attestations or how this is unlocked yeah and you know if you make a tweet that's also an attestation if you say something like oh you know we should do this or this project is dope you know those are all attestations it's just that they're not quantified or verifiable or you know but if that exists in a web 3 medium where you can actually when you say that oh you support this that this is actually like a cryptographic record of something you know like there's an nft that represents that whether it's an organization or a event or whatever it is you can like point to that thing and then you can once you've like mapped that out then that same it essentially builds up this irrigation system for the infinite garden right right now if we're talking about the infinite garden of like everything humans are doing uh the way the irrigation system works is like there's a big bucket of water like certain buckets of water and then people are a certain sort of you delegate allocation of money to someone else right it's like i'll take a bucket of water and then my job is to go try to find out where the soil is dry and then pour some water there but like on the way i'll probably drink half the bucket because i got thirsty and then you know all these other things like someone creates like a cabal to like you know take all the water from everyone else and like all these things happen instead what this is is like we have like sensors that can read the moisture levels of all the soil everywhere and this like automated complex irrigation system that can like sense exactly where water is needed and what amount at what time and instantly like get the water there so i think in the world that's how money will serve us is like based on what the humans want and what the humans sort of um like instead of like getting rid of our humanity and sort of like suppressing who we are to like be the sort of like robot for the corporation and i think that's a symptom of the industrial age i think but yeah instead of doing that it'll become like we express who we are what our needs are and then the irrigation system is like something we collectively like govern and influence and we can control how it's set up in our certain communities but um it it provides like it moves the resources from where they are to where they're needed and if you think about in the world like there's no shortage of money right the issue is it's just like stuck in these pockets so like imagine this like scenario where you had a society where everyone got paid like 200 an hour but you couldn't keep more than five grand in your bank account um or in your wallet uh and then what that incentivizes is if you want to actually make the most of it you actually have to spend it so it incentivizes people to like actually get capital moving to the system as much as possible in that system you actually don't need a lot of gdp like the amount of money you need in that system is not a lot but you can get way more economic throughput so money that's sitting idle is essentially like a drain on society it's all this value that was like captured and sort of created and sort of stored in this form that's now sitting there doing nothing that if if there was a way to communicate exactly where it could be effectively used even the people who are rich and powerful like the money itself doesn't make them happy it's still in human nature that you derive happiness from like you know making others happy or you know seeing some sort of purpose or influence that you know what you're doing and people like rich people are like powerful people they might want to influence that through like direct command and control but if you can know that if elon musk could know that like he could flow like a million dollars through this like irrigation system and it will actually get like really effectively allocated to all these places where it's needed based on attestations of people then i think people will be much more willing to do philanthropy because it goes even beyond philanthropy it actually becomes like a way to invest in these things that you believe in and you know ensure that your money like it's like lossless value transfer right now it's way too lossy because you'd be like oh give it to this charity and then they'll give it to this non-profit and then you know everyone's going to take a cut along the way and at the end it's like sends to the dollar to like towards the actual cause you wanted to do and that's what happens when you have all the money you know all the water being carried by people in buckets instead of being distributed with a advanced irrigation system so with this like current financial ecosystem that we have and also uh nation state paradigm uh i think a lot of your argument is that the the lossiness is uh creates a strong incentive for having a scarcity mindset because like if if this paradigm of financial loss ever if you do anything you you have lossy outcomes with your finances and like you know the like kind of how you're saying got a bucket of water walking through the desert you're gonna go from a to b but you're gonna lose water along the way for reasons if we can build out this paradigm where we don't need to we have much less loss you also create a paradigm of people that have a lot less of a scarcity mentality because like they're less fearful of paying taxes to the government they're less fearful of donating to charity because they have stronger assurances that the outcome of the resources that they are giving up they have assurances that it's actually going to actually there will be something produced as a result of that and they'll be able to like see that man manifest rather than kind of just like pray and cross their fingers yeah yeah i think like the idea like we talked made this blog post about like retroactive public funding and stuff like that and i think that's really sort of on point and you look at you know open source software and all these things like there's that key problem of like you know that generates all this value but there's no way to like distribute value back to them um i think you know in that same way of like guaranteeing it's going towards something that was you know not only that will create value but that was proven to have created value like the value was already created it's just now being retroactively recognized right and then that that changes the game too because then people instead of like thinking primarily how much am i getting paid and thinking how much effort to put into that based on how much you're getting paid like you know i'm getting paid 100 grand so i'm going to put in the amount of effort that would like meet my boss's expectations for this like pay grade and then like not anything more than that but it changes that where like the first thing you'll think of is like how can i create the most value for the most amount of people like what you were saying after university you know you wanted to like make the most amount of people happier than average and then like uh once you do that then the value the money you get out of that would actually map directly to that value you created whereas now now it's like someone could do something that's ultra impactful like you know the people the core devs of ethereum for example like i know they're doing it they get paid way more anywhere else but they're doing it because of that fulfillment they get and that's another sign of like it's not about the money it's about you know they're getting value in all these other ways but we should map that to actual value they get for money monetarily as well too and we can do that if we you know have the way to like recognize that value and then you know ensure that it gets distributed to the right people and i'm working on a project actually directly for this that was like inspired by the whole guest team not getting enough funding um where like we can actually instead of having to like give money to like the boss their bosses and then like delegate it to them on how to allocate it to the people um you could run something like source credit on the guest github repo and then have a map of like who like did the most work and committed the most code and you know whatever effort they did even if it's not perfect it's some representation then you can create a contract that's like you know and anyone could deploy it like it's permissionless that would then directly send the funds like to those people's wallets you know those devs that directly contributed and then if you actually make that system like strong enough where like it you have these like cryptographic guarantees that could eventually become a thing at a protocol level where like protocol fees could actually become like the uh the master sort of like source of water that then you know gets redistributed out based on direct value created and maybe not like on the crypto level itself there could be protocols above you know the base layer chain um to do something like that this is certainly what optimism is trying to do with uh their the revenue from maximum extractable value out of their sequencer right so the idea for the optimus optimistic the optimism's optimistic roll-up is that there's a lot of value to be extracted from fees from protocol fees not at the base ethereum layer one but the optimism layer two and that value that comes from sequencing the the mev gets fed into retroactive public goods funding yeah so this this like illustration that you are describing is actually being experimented and iterated on in real time with the optimism team for sure and i see like you know when i talk about this being the future like i i get a conviction and say this because i see everyone else moving towards this as well you know like you can start to see the patterns and the structures and you know for me it's like i'm not really trying to like say i know what's going on i'm just pattern matching on like what's actually happening and yeah i think what they're doing is like really awesome and it illustrates a great point where there's certain things that will like generate a lot of money but like the they might not be something that you want to like you know fund itself right like these protocol fees like that's why people are like oh like you know projects shouldn't take fees because like what are they needed for is that's a protocol that's permissionless anyone can use it like you know why the fee is going there but and then on on the flip side there's all these things that generate incredible value but don't have a way to be monetized or if they were monetized it would like sort of ruin the point of it you know so teams that like build this amazing tech that's not really like productizable and they're forced to almost productize it or you know add some way of value capture there that like doesn't fit to try to like you know get that value but i think when we can create that connectivity between these pools where a lot of that value can accumulate but you know it isn't necessarily allocated yet and then places where it's like really needed but we don't want to like monetize that thing instead of having to like you know value these things directly we can disassociate like where the value comes from and the thing that creates the value so you know protocol fees like that defy treasuries like you know yearn for example the fees it generates like and they they do this themselves right now of like you know they really like give back to the community and sort of do a lot of grants and funding and but it's still sort of people you know like manually pouring buckets in places i think eventually we can evolve that to be even more like decentralized and you know people can still have that influence right they would just have like a lot of voting weight for example to influence that like irrigation system of like where it goes right so they can say i think it should be here and then the pipes will like shift here a bit and then the other guy said i think it should be there and then like shift there a bit and then once you average it all together you get like the the outcome one of the uh problems that i'm i'm i'm seeing with this is when you talked about like attestations and then you kind of list some list some activities like a dow paying someone as an attestation or like a tweet can be announced station aren't if you extrapolate that aren't you just really talking about data and like how do you standardize data because there's so much data out there and how do you ensure that like the data is the right data and how do you actually like consume that data in ways that is like scalable yeah um so i think like the difference between attestations and data is like an attestation is cryptographically verifiable so like if you sign a message that says you know i support optimism or i like optimism then there's inherent value in that attestation in that like your ethereum address is attached to all this activity on chain you know all these like various forms of identity and reputation that you can associate with that address that you can then weight the value of that statement you know um in a certain way so i think in terms of like how we so the nice part about this is like normally in a blockchain you need like there's a scalability issue because you need like global consensus of like you know this token moved there this value moved there the nice thing about these attestations is it becomes much much more scalable because the only instead of like you know a bunch of validators in the network needing to verify that information before that block can be processed the only people that need to validate that information is the people that are carrying or using that information so um you can you still use cryptography you know because like crypto is like way more than just blockchain right you can still use cryptography to like record these attestations and as long as you have it in a like if vitalik talked about this too in ecc's like we need like a shared state you know a credibly neutral shared state in which we can just like dump all the raw data of like what happened and you know these are like this is not like high-level data it's just like you know just as much information we have on like things that happen that it's like cryptographically verifiable and then you can have multiple like entities essentially like curating that information or like filtering that information to represent a certain community's views or certain products views or you know so um the way this like scales and sort of builds up is this composable thing is like it's not an end-to-end system you just want to get like the bottom layer right of just like let's just get all the data in one place and have it be verifiable and then we can work from there to figure out how best to use it and associate value to it and then so you'll have like layers and layers and layers of like higher level sort of interactions being built in terms like actually i think ceramic network is like a great great project and they're really trying to solve this problem of you know acting as like the data layer it's like l1 for data and attestations and sort of verifiable identities so you know things like social graphs or even like like all sorts of data that you just want instead of being stored in a server or just in like ipfs where it's like a static blob it's not like you can't do anything you're storing it in a much more composable way where you know you can define a data model for example in ceramic you can so there's a group right now uh if you know what it's called exactly dow stars i think it's like a bunch of the top like dao people like gnosis guild and dao house and like some argon people like a bunch of people kind of working group coming together to define the data model of a dao so like you know there's all these different implementations of a dao but if we can at least agree on what are the components of a dao and like you know the oh here's the proposal here's remember like what are these like common denominator fields if you can agree on that data model then that like greatly increases the interoperability so we can separate like the data model from like a specific application built on top of it so you know this is what ceramic really enables is we have like instead of like you know there's like if you log into a website you have your user account for that website instead of that we just have like a user account that's like sort of universal this is somewhat your wallet but the wallet alone isn't enough you need like all this other auxiliary data and you know links and this like graph system on top of it uh and then any app can be built in the same underlying data so you it actually changes data ownership too where you can actually own your data it's not like you know this data is owned by the platform like you would give the platform access like read and write to your data but the data would be like sovereignly like owned by you and you could like control the access to it and um everything like that so that's how it really kind of comes becomes composable from the bottom up is like getting those primitives right it's like the if you look at d5 right we it's not like there's like even 2017 maybe there's like a lot of these like monolithic projects that are trying to be like all-in-one d5 platforms and stuff but that's not none of those really ended up working out the things that worked out is like you know we had erc 20s and then we had like ether delta and then we had uni swap and then we had compound and then we had urine and these all sort of progressively built off of you know a really solid underlying primitive so i think right now we're really just figuring out these underlying data primitives and then over time we'll all sort of build new layers on top of it to get like more sort of complex systems um that emerge you know again it's really about like emergence rather than like you know trying to pre like uh premeditate like what is going to happen and trying to build that you just want to create the the right infrastructure to allow the right things to emerge naturally the other person that i know is working on this is uh the the other team is uh the team at disco are you familiar with disco yeah so the way that i've had this explained to me is uh with um verify verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers and like they're the evan mcmullen always describes this as like your your loot bag for data where your your ethereum address can be your loot bag for on-chain tokens like erc20 tokens and nfts like it's your inventory but then you she says that you need an off-chain loop bag for your data and your your verifiable credentials and your decentralized identifiers and the the way the the way that she's explained this to me is that like your ethereum address your private keys can unlock your loop bag but your loot bag can actually rotate out private keys yeah so like you don't is you're not ever tied down to one specific ethereum address exactly which makes sense if we're talking about digital identity right like i use many many many ethereum addresses how can how can any one of them be my identity right how can any one of them reflect my soul my soul is really an aggregate of all of my ethereum addresses and and much much much more that has nothing to do with any transaction that's on a blockchain it has to do with the data of the world that i have both consumed and projected and and interacted with and so it's like uh she calls it um the space between the chains as in there's all the block chains in the world kind of like the root system but then there's the space between the chains which is kind of like the mycelial networks of the infinite um the the my mental model for this was uh like data is a bunch of like micronutrients and tokens and nfts and dows are a bunch of like macro nutrients and those are the value right the macronutrients are the value the proteins the fats but then you have the micronutrients of the organism like the little like the magnesiums and the iron and the the molecules but for an organism to exist you need all the micronutrients to process to to correctly and efficiently process the macronutrients and so to put this into crypto language you need the taos the tokens the nfts of the world the value of the world it needs the direction of the micronutrients into in order to know where to go yeah and so if we're talking about your irrigation metaphor like the the micronutrients of the world are redirecting the flow of water in my in microwaves in order to most adequately produce the outcomes that the organism wants which is to route the value into the places that the people want it to go yeah exactly and i think it's it's pretty awesome because like we actually already have the answers in front of us like nature is already a highly evolved value internet you know it's its own like distributed like chain like my serial networks you know they so they do like three things one they like communicate information so like stress signals and like you know organisms or plants and stuff and just like uh information sort of electrical signals that get communicated over them they uh so then we had that with the internet and then after that there's uh value so you know nutrients or carbon or things that sort of travel along these networks um then we got that with ethereum right and then the third thing that my serial networks do that we don't have yet is they decompose things so when something dies or something you know they rot it and it decomposes and it takes those nutrients then redistributes it out to the system um and we don't have anything for that and i don't think people have really thought about that too much it's like how do we like allow for decomposition because the legacy way is like you know you create an organization or you do something you like start a company you essentially like want it to succeed forever and grow forever right like that's sort of the game you're trying to play is like how can we make this thing succeed and grow forever if you look at nature the only thing that like grows forever like that is cancer so it doesn't even grow forever though because then cancer ultimately kills the host exactly exactly so the only way so if we try to grow these things forever the only outcome of that is it'll kill the host aka all of us right so to actually avoid that we need to introduce the ability to decompose things allow things to die and i think like this is another sort of trick of like you know western not just western i think human nature too but like this like fear of death and like people not being you know sort of come to terms with their the fact that they're gonna die or their own mortality is like you know i think a big thing because it's like then you're just gonna be like you know trying to make the most of like what's here and and whatnot so i think death is a feature not a bug right because like imagine if putin was like gonna live to be like 200 years old or 300 years old right like then his like he's doing all this like crazy now but like if he's gonna if he's not he's gonna live that much longer then he's gonna go to like even crazier lengths to do this right so it's actually good that you know at a certain point he's gonna be like you know i'm too old for this i'm gonna die soon like i'm not gonna like all the i did is just gonna be left behind so you know that that is like a feature and then the new can sort of like take that place um but we don't we don't have a a way to deal with that and i think the way it'll actually take place in crypto um like i'll use the example of consensus right so consensus like served a really important purpose in like you know bootstrapping a lot of the ecosystem like you know getting the talent like acting as that bridge from like you know pre-web 3 to web 3. um but because they were that bridge there's like inherently like you know they have that like legacy sort of baggage that came along with it and all these like issues and you know all this stuff happening with consensus and it's actually like really hard to try to like fix consensus at its core and you know uh like turn it into something that's like you know actually better or sort of like you know next generation the way to do that is actually decompose consensus from the outside in aka take the talent that's there and like deploy them in the web 3 ecosystem because there's like it's crazy because like there's an incredible amount of like really like top level crypto talent at consensus who's like been in the space for like you know since og days that are completely siloed from like the rest of the ecosystem because they're like oh you can't work for a dao you work for consensus so like now all these people are now like not interacting with dow people at all and not really understanding that side and like but what would be actually better is if you like instead of trying to fix consensus you took these people at the edges and like you know downpilled them and then deployed them to like you know do some like awesome work somewhere else where it's way more impactful so like this is what decomposition is it's like nature decomposes this old thing and it's rotting and dying takes those nutrients and puts it towards something new that's growing that's like it's much better off there so then you know these people these like this human resources would essentially be like the the fertilizer for the infinite garden that you can then like oh this died like just decompose it and distribute it out there instead of trying to like put on life support forever and wasting resources and misallocating and i think you know we're trying to do the same thing with how we structure our thousand organizations where we should like start every dow with the assumption that it's gonna die and like prepare for that outcome and you know have like and treat it as like a feature not a bug you know like you then you evolve it into something else you take those people and you give them a pathway like people want to be afraid of that because you know they would be afraid of uncertainty but if you can give them a certain pathway of like you know here's the other channels or avenues which you can like be deployed or have your influence then that you know it starts to make more sense and you you start being you stop being worried about this organization dying because you're not sort of building your life or personality or whoever you are around the organization the organization is built around you so then you know if you were to fall off the mother ship that's like scary but if some like you know some aspect if you were to shed some skin that's no problem right so it it's it's all connected in that way of you know really shifting the mindset on how we think about how we coordinate and think about value and all that the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer 1. assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across these bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum across is critical ecosystem infrastructure and ownership is being handed over to the community you can be a part of this story of a cross by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to

apps nfts and do all my defy things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out web3 wouldn't be the same without it download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamask.io and load up your trezor ledger lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web3 i think the the meta goal here is to how do we um retain and transform value rather than rather than losing it right we're going back to like lossiness yeah uh the the death of organizations is the destruction of capital but i think what you're talking about is how do we not let capital be destroyed but all but instead like let it also be transformed and i think um i'm in the middle of a ray dalio's book which is uh titled something about like the changing like lessons or lessons for managing how to survive like a changing world order and uh using like kind of the frame of reference that we've been talking about right now the and also the fourth turning thesis or the fourth turning theory is also related to this where it tends to be every 80 years humans go through like a destruction cycle because like our institutions get too calcified uh the people and and their and their institutions are too misaligned uh the whoever holds the the reserve currency of the world has spent it on military for to too much and now no one uses it as a coordination tool anymore uh and so like the world order dies uh and then there's a period of chaos and then and then like a new world order is being born its place like you know like you know the so it's a little bit like a the we we lose the structure but then like new new plants grow out of the decaying body of the of the old structure but like the the thing is like we want the world to be iterative games not not games that uh not single games right and so like 180 year-long cycle of conflict before we go on to the next 80 year long cycle of conflict is one game followed by another game not iterative games we want one game to fold elegantly and gracefully into the next game because every time it's like uh the current paradigm of the world is always like two steps forward one step back and in order and that's just because we need to take that one step back in order to take two more steps forward but i think what we're talking about here is like all right how do we build systems where we can take three steps forward or four steps forward before we take a step back and it's all about like there's this concept of uh jubilees that has been just ingrained into human dna since since before like written history right like um the concept of like sin in the bible is a very similar concept to like a debt jubilee where sometimes society just gets like pen like too much pent-up sin in the world and so we need to have like we need to just blanket forgive all sin and that's what jesus did like jesus blanket forgave all sins and then and then later on we got recorded history things got a little bit more concrete things got a little bit more like uh reason able to be reasoned about and we went from like sin to like debt jubilees and jet jet debt jubilees are something we all saw all throughout like uh uh judaism and and many many other like religions in early early human organizations where like oh there's just way too much debt in the system we just need to wipe it clean so we can take two steps forward which is very very destructive because when you wipe debt clean you're taking value from somebody that was owed that and just like deleting it just for the sake of everyone right so there are there are big losses in the system but on net it's the right choice just because so much debt was built up in the system and now we're coming to that part of like our history more or less again right now this is what ray dalio's book is is all about is like there's too much debt in the american economy like everyone owes debt the american economy owes debt the federal reserve owes debt all the other central governments of the of the world owe debt there's just too much debt in the system so now we're gonna have to like wipe the slates clean as we have always done throughout human history in order to take two or three more steps forward and and i think what like one of the meta goals of crypto as human organizational structures is finding ways to not have jubilees because jubilees are always about taking step back the goal is to not take steps back and so when you're telling me like there's a this system where we can build our social structures with like a difficulty bomb baked into them like a like a dead end in them was like hey this is going to die we can actually have like contingency plans it's like all right like well the goal is to create value and then die and then pass that value along elegantly so that one step forward turns into two steps forward turns into three steps forward and perhaps we can have like a brand new human renaissance that we've never ever had before yeah for sure and i think like it's just that instead of like trying to delay the death for as long as possible we're like you know because that's the thing is like we talk about human systems and then like natural systems as if they're like you know outside of each other but we are actually just also a you know fractal of nature or a product of nature so you know nature will have its way whether we like the easy way or the hard way you know like if we like the longer we work against it then it'll eventually still have its way you know on a long term like even if we like destroy the world with like global warming or whatever like eventually it'll come back into balance and you know like come to the stability again but i think like the what you're saying about you know every 80 year cycle like i think what we can do is like instead of having 80 years we can do it like maybe every eight years or like maybe eight hours you know like take it to that level because then what that's how we actually it's not about we can't ever like eliminate mistakes from happening aka like steps back but if if the steps back are happening at a micro level you know instead of just at a macro level then they're much less painful and when you zoom out it'll just look like sort of consistent forward progression even though in between we're like taking all these like steps forward and back it's just that you know we got to iterate much more frequently um i think that's where we'll go and i'm get i'm getting sounds of like an old cranking engine slowly turning over like one revolution yeah two revolutions but then if we can get it faster and faster then you saw the engine actually start to turn and tumble and tumble and tumble and then boom we all of a sudden we all have an engine that is doing 80 000 rounds revolutions per second and we can actually make some goddamn progress finally yeah for sure um and i think the the thing he said about this like um rebirth thing uh uh who was it um terence mckenna he had this like really good talk that he was giving once um about how and this was in the 90s and this is crazy because it sounds like he's talking about now but he's saying like the trajectory of the world is just like you know we're at a road's end you know like things are gonna like wait it's too late to sort of fix them and things are gonna keep accelerating and we're gonna go through this process and that process is actually not a bad process because it's like a rebirth it's like a birth in a way so you know think about a baby in the womb right it's like it it doesn't know anything about crypto or the internet or anything you know it's being fed it's getting its nutrients it's like comfortable warm like it has everything it's needs you know in a way that's like heaven for for that and then it goes through this like you know the process of birth is like the most violent part of a pregnancy right it's like the the transition and like the detachment from like the thing that was created from the crater so that's the thing is too we actually have to let go like the the child has to be detached from its mother um and then you know then you get to like you're in this like world now and then you like experience that and you know there's this like new paradigm and i think in the same way society itself will go through this like violent rebirth and it's gonna be like you know painful and it's gonna be like you know we'll be screaming and that's all you can do is scream but like once we go past that we'll be in this like entirely new unrecognizable space that's like you know fundamentally different from where we were before um and it's it's crazy too because like the the you know universe if you think about like primitives of the universe a lot of people like who are coming more from like a materialistic standpoint are like oh we have atoms and we have molecules now we have like quarks and subatomic particles and like trying to find the answers to the universe there but there's nothing really there right like there's just like less and less stuff there there's no like answers there so it's like okay if that's not the parameters and what are and you know if you think about like the golden ratio and fractals and like you know these patterns the patterns are the perimeters of the universe right if you look at like the structure of a tree and the branches there and how that looks the same as the structure of a river and how that looks the same as the structure of the neurons in our brain and how our eyes look the same as like you know flower paddles or like these things and trees like those are the parameters of the universe so if you start looking at those instead you start to see these these fractals in which like the things that are happening at a micro scale are just like you know smaller versions of the larger thing that's happening and if you think about the process of like you know pregnancy and like the embryo like the baby itself is like actually re replaying the whole history of evolution you know we went from like this like tadpole to speed running evolution yeah we went from this like tadpole looking thing to this like little like fish looking thing to then you know growing arms and like this but like so that's a fractal of like all of human history in a way and in if you think about it that we can use that as inspiration to know what what to do next is like this comes back to like the mysterious networks right so if that network pattern we can recognize in nature you you know you damn well bet that that pattern is going to repeat itself in different forms in the future so it's almost like an onus to look at that and then you know recreate the things that we're building to follow those patterns because when you follow those patterns that's you know you're sort of like doing it in the in nature's way and like the this discussion like you know so if you really want to take it to like a meta meta level um you know when you think about nature itself like nature is like the essentially like the the substrate or like the the the creation itself right but like underlying there's like even if you think about humans like we actually suck at coordinating you know like none of us really like asked to be here or coordinated us to be here right like you know it all it all sort of just happens right and in fact actually when we try to exert our own control it actually like breaks things from coordinating the more you like let go like even this conversation you said like you didn't want to like set the agenda because that would like constrict you from like the actual good things that would come out of it so you exerting human control actually for the listeners that's what i say to the guests on the start of layer zero that's yeah that's the alpha yeah so you know that that breaks down then and then like so you realize like letting go of control is the way for like it's actually more intelligence and better coordination there it's like if you think about like okay where is this like root like coordination coming from that's god like that's what people refer to as god is that like root coordination right that's like you know and then god's way is like letting go of that like human egotistical like exertion of control and more so realizing that you're on remote control you're not under control you're like on remote control and you're like a part of this thing that's like you know the nature has been coordinating and you know like where like kanye west says this but like he says human beings are god's iphone right it's not like we're not doing the coordinating we are but like where the where the iphone we're not the like the person running the iphone you know so it's like where the vehicle in which this coordination happens just like human beings use our phones to coordinate but the the the phone itself isn't doing it but we only see the phone right so in that way i think like the it really you know root coordination you know and this is it's crazy because like people i think you know for reasons like discard religion or like you know certain forms organize religion because of things that's done but it's actually a misattribution it's actually a failure of humans like them like messing up and not doing it properly not like the religion itself or you know the concept of religion or god itself you know so people like oh like why why did god do this god didn't do it we did it right so it's like the like religion or like god's ways essentially humans like letting go of that control and allowing these things to emerge um and that's you know how i see everything we're doing is like for me when i like i could not if you ask me like two years ago if i'd be like doing any of this today it'd be like no way but like as soon as i like let go of control and allow things to emerge like then i'm in places that i never would have imagined and you know i'm like holy  i can actually like like i see a light at the end of the tunnel for like how i can actually make a difference in the world and none of this would have happened if i tried to do it my way you know i was like put here the the framing of crypto using a biological lens i think is the most underappreciated and also the most useful uh and when you're talking about like the patterns of the universe right the lightning in the sky the arteries in our vein in our veins and our neurons and like the and you can find these same like the roots of trees these are the fundamental patterns of the universe and how god is the is the overarching rule set that produces those outcomes whatever whatever god is is the thing that just produces the rules it is the rules yeah the the the if this then that version of of the things that make the outcome that's the the archetype for what this thing is and like i think as we move into the future and move into you know a metaverse and have an even more digitally enabled future than we have today i think one of the best things that's going to be an outcome of that are people are going to start to view some of these digitally native uh organization schemes as nature itself like right right now we we look at like our our square homes with our square windows and our square like skyscrapers and our grids and our the grids of our roads it's like god it's so inorganic it's so fake like the like the everything is so so like manufactured and so wrong cookie cutter houses at amcon in the mountains um but i think as we as we move into the future people are going to start to uh extend what is nature into things like cryptography things like math things like um uh what today feels like sci-fi science but is actually just once again the only way that this crypto industry is going to work is if it follows the rules of nature yeah because like you said if you if you don't follow the rules of nature it'll get you yeah and so like the the crypto system the crypto blockchain the crypto l1 that wins is going to be the one that resonates most with the rules of nature uh and because that's the thing that is going to be able to take many many many steps forward without having to take a step back yeah for sure and i think like overall ethereum community has done a great job of that um you know like really decentralizing allowing things to be emergent um you know iteratively like evolving things like you know a lot of the like core innovation here so i think and vitalik like he made a that new york times thing i think he made a lot of good points is like you know we've done a pretty decent job thus far that's like let's not like mess it up now you know it's like it's like a you know we have to it's like a fire that we're kindling right it's like as soon as that gets a little like grow we should not just like you know run with it and like do whatever and you know we'll just like end up extinguishing it so it's i think or lighting the forest on fire yeah yeah and it's like it's really about nurturing it in the right way and continuing to nurture it and you know we go through these cycles i think of like you know bull and bear and i think that like helps keep it in balance so um yeah i think you know again you know we're not in control and i think overall as long as we're all you know operating in that uh in god's way or in nature's way that that will have the right outcome you know it's like that's it's it's really liberating too because then you're not stressed about you know having to figure it out it's like i don't have to figure it out it'll figure itself out as long as i'm you know adhering to these like principles right uh the the bowl and bearer case i think is a great example there's there's always been like frustration from the crypto people about like all the gamers of the world that hate nfts and all the artists of the world that hate nfts and like we as crypto people got super frustrated like you guys shouldn't hate nfts you guys should love nfcs they're going to make your games better but like if we really thought about it and we just injected gay like nfts into all these games like first off we don't have the technology to do that like ethereum would be at capacity even the layer twos would be at capacity solana and avalanche would be at capacity uh and so like the pushback from society about like hey i hate your nfts is probably healthy and probably what the crypto community needs because we are not ready to onboard another like mill like 10 more million people like we do not have the structure to do that and so like they probably would hate nfts a lot less if we had more scalable blockchains if we had more better nfts if we had better organizational smart contracts around these nfts they'd probably hate them a lot less and they'd probably adopt them and then we would probably go through another bull market yeah but it's one of those things where like and definitely i definitely resonate with like in the in the bear market of 2018 to 2020 like me and a few other people like ryan anthony cesano were just shouting from the rooftops about like you know ethereum's gonna this defy thing is gonna be a thing guys like this is gonna work ethereum is money like ether's money like this is gonna happen but then as soon as the bull market started like at least me personally i was like well if you don't believe me like i guess i'll just stop shouting it because i know it's just going to unfold the way that it will unfold and i'm going to stop trying to like make sure ethereum doesn't die from a lack of funding because this doesn't have that problem anymore and now i'm just gonna let let the the leaf float on the wind because however it's gonna work is gonna be how it unfolds and i just have to take that on faith yeah yeah exactly and you know if anything our purpose is just to like observe what's happening and if things somewhere are you know uh like diverting from nature's path then it's like step up there and try to correct it and balance it but again it's like it's not about it's not about us or like what we want it's like it's really about you know understanding that like what's that core um thing underneath and the the quakers like they had a very like interesting and i think effective governance mechanism um their governance mechanism as like a decentralized collective of people to figure out like what to do and things like that was to like come together and discuss and try to like collectively determine like what is god's way or like what would like god do what's like god's path in this decision so it's not about what you think you should do or what you think you should do it's about like you know collectively trying to like understand what's like according to like their principles or whatever you know values they have like what's like god's path in that thing and then that's how they would make decisions so it's not basically it was like not making decisions but discovering decisions it's like you know like uh dusting for fingerprints right like the fingerprint's already there you know dusting it just you know like drawing the fingerprint when you like put the ink on it it's just like discovering what's already there and i think you know what what we do and when we iterate in in our organizations and the things that we do it's just like we we have we shouldn't like make assumptions we should like look at what's happening and pattern match and then you know build like roads on that pattern um and it brings me back to like this example of my university where they had like the middle like park area between all the buildings um they were trying to decide how to like you know where they should build the pathways between the buildings so instead of like trying to decide that what they did is the first year they just like planted some grass and then just like let the people walk all over it and then they looked where the grass was like beating down the most and then they built the sidewalks there because essentially people the students themselves walking around needing to get to class on time they like the the patterns of all their activities summed together to show like this is the most efficient like way to do it right so that's the thing is like the answers are sort of inside us but we have to like let them come out and not try to like let our egos suppress it and then you know when you look at the way they built the sidewalks it's like who designed this it looks like crazy there's like all the there's like a bunch concentrated here and then like these weird going in different directions but it like when you actually walk on it you're like oh this makes a lot of sense how do they fit it i would imagine walking on the like again taking a look at it like well that looks weird and then realizing that it's actually super functional would actually be a very trippy moment yeah i think trippy is the right word to describe how like the really the realization process because like again there's no grid like clearly an engineer didn't do this or or somebody with like a fixed like fixed engineering type mind i think i think like trippy would be the best word to say the discovery of like because it's nature right this is an expression of nature yeah this thing is like we think we have the answers but like we you know we we do but it's just like in the in a different place and i think like this is like where you know psychedelics are really fascinating too is because if you're like you know i could understand someone being like skeptical about this whole theory and like all the stuff i'm saying like you know it's like it's just like wumbo jumbo but like psychedelics is a way to like directly prove that to you through direct experience right like there's like no doubt in your mind that that's like you know it's not just like uncovering some fundamental truths about the universe and how it operates you know um so i think the uh and but i think again that's not like an end either that's just a means just like sort of show you the patterns if you don't already see them right like even like with psychedelics like the they're not addictive in that way they almost like tell you that you don't need to take them you know it's just like showing you things that were there the whole time that you just failed to realize or notice so in that sense you know it's like i think training wheels but not necessarily you know there's no like you talk to people too who have like done this like you know who go really deep into psychedelics and just like take insane doses of like dmt or all these things to try to like discover some sort of truth about anything but like there's nothing out there really it's like you know there isn't a fundamental truth out there it's just a vehicle to sort of show you the underlying sort of uh you know the the the cosmic circus you know behind it all but the the answers are really in in what you do in actions you take and you know those um sort of things and again it's like just fractals of what you know many like world religions throughout history have like expressed and you know tuned into and it's just like we're evolving our understanding of that um dreamer what advice or just knowledge uh would you have for somebody who's newer in the crypto space well is there like a a life rule of thumb or just you know rule the rule that you live by that you have thought is really really useful for you that you would like to share with some of the newer people in space yeah i'd say like stop trying to learn crypto and start trying to unlearn like web 2 stuff you know i think it's almost frustrating i think to try to like really understand like the whole crypto space before you get this like you know uh like put in that effort to like or it's not even effort but just be consciously aware of like you know assumptions that you hold about things and why you hold those assumptions and allow yourself to like let go of those assumptions and sort of discover things that way so i think you know once you do that you'll start to see like new patterns that you didn't see before and i think you know the throughout history it's just really been about you know suppressing people's like individual thought because like you know that creates problems it's hard to coordinate that when people are all thinking different things it's as advantageous as possible if you can sort of make people think in uniform ways and sort of control like how they think and how they coordinate and that's you know what's been done throughout history but you know recognizing that and then starting to realize that it's like james young makes a perfect example of this it's like this transition to web 3 is kind of like you know the transition from like surfs plowing the land to then the enlightenment age when the search were like oh hey we don't have to just keep playing this land or for our whole lives we can just like go here and do some stuff ourselves right and then we had the whole enlightenment phase so i think in the same way that's happening from this like web 2 to web 3 transition or sort of legacy to like new world transition is not necessarily we're not tearing the old world down we're just like throwing a better party and then people are coming over right so it's like the surfs is like oh do i wanna like slave myself away on this land or am i gonna go like you know make some fun stuff there and they're of course gonna come over there so i think you know we're not the legacy governments and legacy system it's going to exist it's just going to decompose from the bottom up or the outside in until eventually it might not need to exist or it'll take a whole different form but you know we're not trying to destroy it from the top down like that's the wrong way to go about it and that's like you know gonna put us in more danger too so um you know for example with like money like right now government sort of plays the role of like allocating money through taxes and i think that will change where like tax distribution will sort of become decentralized but the government will still play the role of being the referee and sort of like you know because you did there's sort of governance stewards then instead of actually players in the game you know so i think that's how like we'll sort of meet in the middle is like we're not trying to tear them down or create a new system because if you if you actually like try to work for any dao you'll like realize how broken it is and that there actually is a lot of value in sort of the legacy legal system and the judicial system and you know the ways and practices we've been doing like you don't want to destroy that you want to like encompass that and do something more you know it's like yes and not like you know not that way in my way so i think yeah um back to like the original question i guess uh i think that's one thing yeah like unlearn the old mindsets that's a general rule of thumb second one would be like really like you know break things down into its primitives and like compose those primitives and like realize that in you know collaboration is now a better more effective strategy than competition and web 2 competition was the most effective strategy the people that can out compete others one and crypto is the opposite the people that can collaborate with the most other people win so start to like you know disassociate yourself with like what you think of an organization or working for an organization like think of it like what you need what you're interested in where you can collaborate with others to like move that forward in a meaningful way and you know just like build up from there rather than you know a lot i see a lot of people they're like oh i need to find some like company to like you know work for who can like you know pay me so then i can like make the transition and you know it doesn't have to be a binary thing like that and you don't have to apply those mentalities like think of it more so just like you know an online game right like in and if you're playing like world of warcraft or something you'll like create your clan you'll go like do some battles with friends and then you know like if you stop you know collaborating with them it's fine or like stop playing with them it's fine you go find some other friends to play with like it's it's like you know you almost have to bring back that child-like mindset how the child's like exploring the world just through play and you know experimentation and you know uh treat it like that um more than anything and um you'll start to like figure it out and find your place naturally uh talk about the importance of a yes and mentality can you define yes and and just kind of explain the yes and mentality yeah so i think like you know whenever it comes down to any disagreements between any two people it's like very infrequently is it about one person is right and the other person's wrong it's just that they're both talking about different things from different perspectives you know out of different sort of like you know needs so it's like you know disassociate the fact that they're disagreeing with you from like your idea being bad it's like they're both good ideas you know figure out what's the common denominator between them or the pattern between them that allows them to like you know uh and again think about the metal level don't think about what you're disagreeing on think about why you're disagreeing right and like uh disassociate yourself and don't make it personal in that way obviously hard to do but um then once you like do that you start to pattern match all these behaviors among all these people then you see like oh this this thing is actually common among all these so if you can make an improvement here it'll help all these people right it's like people like well we express our like problems but like those problems aren't solutions right it's like i think that's a lot i think some of the issue with like some like you know the like modern like left thinking is like you know recognizing a problem and then trying to like address it at that level of like you know for example the whole issue of uh um like uh people like getting admissions into schools and like whether there should be like quota for certain like races or genders to like oh you know we have to like meet this quota to like um you know so we get more people in because there's not enough like you know uh colored people here right i think that's the wrong way to do it because like that's actually probably more racist because like you're assuming that those people can't actually like get there through competency that you need to give them this handicap to get there and you know realizing that the problem is not there the problem's like upstream of that you know so like where can you go upstream and fix a problem there and then you know that will actually result in this outcome that you want you know downstream so we see the symptoms and try to address the symptoms but we don't like think back far enough to like talk about the real problems metadreamer last question before we we wrap this up uh what about the future makes you optimistic the thing i'm most optimistic about is like people um you know again moving into this like post scarcity mindset and like instead of everyone even like people who are rich or poor it's like um zach from coordinates said this once he's like uh you know money like uh i forget how i ordered it but he's like um money is great until you have it and then it becomes a problem so it's like this is almost like you know if you have more money than you need then it actually makes you more depressed and if you have like less money than you need then it's actually like you're just as sad so it's like you can't even the ultra rich like they're not really happy or content with their lives either so you know the it's actually like about getting that balance and if you have these mechanisms to better distribute value you can give people guarantees that they'll have their like baseline needs met you know um and then once you have that and you can go into post-scarcity mindset then i think that'll be like this new sort of like renaissance where you know we're like really understanding what it is to be human and like the way we're you know interacting with each other and you know uh a lot of the like you know i think that will alleviate a lot of like the built up sort of internal like stressors or you know if you think about it like so many of um like all the problems in the world could be like broken down into you know like if you had a bad childhood experience because like you weren't you know your family wasn't well off and they couldn't afford to like do this stuff then that leads you to like all these like emotional issues and like you know all these things like so much of it can be you know uh be broken down into like people not having their needs met and having that like worry of like you know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow and that safety so true happiness i think is not really about like what you can get or like the good things that can happen to you it's about eliminating how many bad things can happen to you because like if you've eliminated all the bad things that could happen to you but like nothing else on top of that then i think you'd be like perfectly content and happy and sort of you know like uh at peace with everything and that's like you know a lot of people do have that it's like they're just like monks or like they're living like very minimal lives and they realize that the the the key to happiness is like eliminating like negative like externalities or negative the potential for negative outcomes to happen and not necessarily positive outcomes but you know from the western capitalist view there's like an advantage in sort of convincing people they need all this and this will make you happy and you take this pill for that then you take this pill to like deal with the symptoms of that pill and then you know it's like you sham you like shampoo your hair to get rid of all the oils and you use all these other hair products you put all the oils back in and then you know the whole cycle so it just creates this like artificial sort of game that literally leaves us on and leaves us like unhappy at the end of it um we can we can actually change that and i see us actually like you know getting there and you know so for me that's like i think it's a race of race against time more than anything we're on the right trajectory it's just we need to like accelerate it in the right direction before we like you know fly too close to the sun and the dreamer thank you for coming and sharing your thoughts on layer zero thanks for having me it's great talking cheers hey we hope you
