how close are you to being a decentralization maximalist does that describe i mean i would not call myself in anything maximalist but i definitely think that decentralization is extremely important ultimately decentralization is what this space is about like once you start compromising on that then there does come a point where you just have to ask well like what is even difference between what's being built here and uh centralized systems the more that we can actually get to like genuine decentralization and an ecosystem where you know in order to make changes to the protocol like he actually needs to have buy-in not just from a couple of protocol elites but from the entire user community like i think that's a really important and beautiful thing it's also an important and beautiful thing for each the asset to maintain its credibility it's an important thing for a lot of the applications on ethereum to maintain their credibility and it's something that we need to fight for and support
