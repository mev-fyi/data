welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david great episode today with i i guess maybe the unicorn of the year that's devin fisner he's not the unit finster he's not the unicorn of course his company is that's open c uh what do we cover here a little bit of everything going from the complete history of the genesis of open sea to where we are today also talking about devin's perception as to why nfts blew up at all in 2020 and and 2021 why is society ready for them in today's age what's the appropriate context we also talk about the insider trading which devin uh corrected that term to be something else we talked about that whole debacle and but you really use that as a jumping off point to talk about the nature of openc as a company rather than something like uniswap or ave or compound which is a decentralized app on ethereum we talked about that spectrum and also asked is openc going to go the whole like committed centralized company route or going to go down the defy application route i asked him the question uh what's more likely an ipo or a retroactive airdrop and so stay tuned for his non-answer there and uh all in all just had a fantastic time had a pretty punchy short conversation with devin fincher ceo of openc yeah absolutely we asked him a question can nfts really get any bigger are we at the peak so stay tuned for the answer on on that question too and i guess my takeaway from from the conversation with devin is like he he's a really cool guy like he's uh a humble builder right so even when we asked about like how come open c is blowing away everybody else and it really is from a marketplace perspectives absolutely dominating um he pivoted to like here's some things that we're not doing that great you know like here's some improvement areas and uh i i guess that's kind of what it takes to build a company like open c in this environment we also asked him near the end about his nft collection what what does the ceo of a multi-billion dollar nft company actually own in uh in their portfolio so uh stay tuned for the answer to that as well guys we're excited to get into the conversation with devin but before we do we need to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest he's had a tremendous year fantastic year it's been a huge year for nfts but he caught the original nft bug back in 2017 when the world didn't know what an nft even was he applied to y combinator at that time where he began working at openc devin finzer is now the co-founder and ceo of course at openc devon it's been i think last time we talked to you it was march before all of this craziness how you doing now man doing well thanks for having me back on i've been i'm a huge fan of the show as you know i've been listening to all the episodes so it's been a great way to keep track of all the goings ons uh as someone who tends to be somewhat heads down and company building mode so going well though well welcome to the mutual admiration club because i buy all of my nfts on openc it's a fantastic platform and um it's absolutely blown up this year we're going to talk a bit more about in what way openc is blown up but first we got to talk about nfts writ large last time in march it was just like the very beginning of kind of an nft craze if you will or maybe sort of it was ebbing down but nfts over the course of this year have absolutely exploded onto the scene and i know you've got a great vantage point on this because you live and breathe this stuff but like why did nfts blow up this year why now well as i always like to say i think it was just like the accumulation of a lot of things over a long period of time but uh i know that's not the you know exciting answer that people want to hear but i i do think you know if you zoom out that what's really interesting is just like it's this whole kind of cultural movement around crypto that has really driven this wave which is actually not what we expected like early on in our like journey at opencv we thought maybe like sort of mainstream gamers would sort of like come on and like you know people would build these like crypto games that would bring people from outside of crypto and you know there's definitely been some of that but it seems to be more driven by this like cultural movement from really like crypto native people who are now realizing that like there's all sorts of like interesting social and cultural interactions that they can have through nfts like cryptic monks and board api club and whatnot um so that seems to be it just seems to be kind of the accumulation of a giant movement and nfts playing this critical like you know cultural role inside of that movement um and you know certainly like just all of the building and all the smoothening out of the user experience which is still obviously very rough has just helped grease that flywheel bring more people into crypto and i think it's just the accumulation of a lot of things at the end well that's a super interesting observation that you just made i want to dig into that for a second so like i like you i thought the interest in nfts would come sort of externally right so like gaming was a huge thing but but you're saying a lot of this has been driven by sort of crypto if you will exporting its culture to mainstream and mainstream being like oh that's cool i'm getting one i want in on crypto culture you're saying it was sort of the reverse of what we all thought yeah and i think like i mean in fact we probably should have known that right because that's sort of how the internet worked not that i was like part of their like a little bit like i can't i'm just sort of going off of like you know my personal experience and what other people tell me but like you know my senses is kind of a similar phenomenon where like there are these people who are just like super early and internet adopters and there was all this like cool stuff you could do on the internet and it sort of like spread from that as opposed to like you know existing incumbent industries like moving people over right it was more this internet culture that emerged and then like you know people dipped their toe and once they dipped their toe they were kind of addicted to it so i think it's a similar pattern where it actually turns out like most of the stuff tends to be grassroots at the end of the day even though it's kind of hard to maybe imagine that uh early on so way back when devin when you were building open c at a y combinator and i thought it was an interesting fact to learn that when you actually applied to y combinator it was not to build open c it was to build something else and then you pivoted during your time at y combinator to build out open c it kind of feels like a change of major uh for a y combinator um so when you were uh choosing to uh build out open c what were you envisioning the future of the nft market would look like and then how closely did we actually get there or what what surprised you along the way yeah well i think i mean my my style and like i think a healthy attitude sometimes can be to not have sort of too many like preconceived notions of what the future is going to look like and focus a little more on just like what are you curious and excited about in the here and now that was our mentality was just like there's a lot of people building cool nft stuff like there's definitely momentum it's not clear exactly what's going to happen we can sort of like prognosticate different ideas and like you know kind of make some forecasts but generally speaking it was more driven by like there's an exciting product we wanted to build and let's just go and kind of experiment um but i do think um we're still very excited about the future of like gaming nfts uh as as a big use case i mean axi has really proven that out and i think the interesting thing is that if you look at the development cycle of games they tend to be a bit longer than you know your typical like collectible or art project so i think i'm still really bullish on like you know game companies seeing what axi and other companies have done like taking a few more iterations and you know really pushing things forward but just taking a little bit longer but being really big at the other day i think gaming could just be huge because there's that utility and sort of native digital uh analog to kind of the existing gaming world so you know i could still see that metaverse vision being driven by these these gaming projects in addition to kind of the collectibles but really you know overall i think it's just like more diversity of nfts all sorts of experiments is such a broad technology that at the end of the day i think it's gonna be a lot of things so devin some people um aren't sure about all of that right so some people maybe we'll call them the haters out there they think that uh nfts have peaked right maybe we're witnessing the peak i mean openc is doing like billions a month in volume how much bigger could the nft market get they get they ask and uh they say well it's it's maybe it's a bubble i'm gonna ask you the same question like do you think the nft market can actually get bigger than it is right now oh yeah certainly yeah i think like at some point you kind of achieve you know the level of escape velocity and i obviously think we have a i mean it's early days we have a long way to go and so this isn't sort of a statement that should be taken as like pompousness or like feeling like we've already made it or something but i i do think we've made it sort of past the point where matt where we have to sort of like try to you know correct the naysayers it's like why i spend mental energy like telling people why it's going to be big when you can just sort of like point to you know what has happened and say like it's pretty clear and if you don't see that then that's fine like we don't have to justify ourselves anymore yeah yeah you don't really need to justify your team do you guys think like the right click save uh tribe is like it's sorry guys case closed exactly yeah i mean i think it was it was it was like sort of an interesting jumping-off point for maybe like an intellectual discussion but like at this point you know it's been discussed and like you know we can kind of move on to like more interesting things right well let's talk about something that's super interesting and that's uh open seeing the numbers you guys are putting up there so i i mentioned um you know billions in in uh volume per month we could get exact on that 3.4 billion in gross merchandise volume uh in in august i think you're on track september just finished out so over 3 billion again in september so it's not it's not really decreasing very much at all and just to give folks some context right well you mentioned the the internet the original internet right so like you go back and you look at the web to marketplace companies uh this is more volume than most all of almost all of maybe the very popular web 2 companies it's more than etsy for example i think you guys are creeping up towards ebay type numbers um tell us about that like how is it possible that openc has found itself at the center of this nft mania and this nft boom yeah well i think it's i mean i i think it's just very interesting to see that you know there's this sort of mechanic where like you know you can have a very interesting business and sort of level of uh you know sort of traditional marketplace uh traction on still a very early community with a very kind of early product and i think it's just a testament to sort of how much room there is to grow right we are really still serving the crypto community and the people who use open c for the most part are not like necessarily crossing over directly in den of teas they're usually like having to go through a lot of the traditional like crypto hurdles um so i think it's it's pretty you know exciting that we're able to have you know volume numbers that look similar to more mainstream marketplaces in a brand new space and it's just a testament to kind of how exciting crypto as a whole is going to be and i i do think that we're witnessing i mean we've we've been witnessing this over and over again but each cycle or each sort of movement within crypto kind of becomes it becomes clearer and clearer that this is like a giant trend not sort of like a mini trend within um within tech credits this i think crypto is the big paradigm shift that you know a lot of people have been looking for uh for a long time of course openc isn't the only nft marketplace that exists out there there are there are plenty other marketplaces where you can browse nfts and purchase nfts but openc is really the platform that seems to have captured the bulk of the energy when it comes to this nft mania nft phenomenon nft hype what what about openc made it be the standout clear winner in the last few months of nft market volume well what's the what features and designs about the open c platform really made it the the winner that we all know yeah well the first thing i'd say is like we're really trying to improve our platform like we you know um we were sort of in the right place at the right time we had a great feature set we have you know people on our team we're always really listening to what customers want and trying to build the right features for users so i think that's been really important but i do think at the same time you know we've gotten some push from the community that we can do a lot better on a lot of different angles and so i want to start by just saying that we're trying to improve and so i don't think you know i'm always hesitant to talk about what we're doing well because we have so much room to grow um but i do think you know the things that we did well you know we just sort of like continued to uh figure out like what was important to people when they were browsing and filtering and discovering nfts right like you know traits are really important for nfts to be able to have a sidebar where you can like dig in and like easily filter search performance of the site which is something we're still working on is really important so something we take really seriously different mechanics so auction mechanics bidding bundles private listings all these things just like sort of the full suite of um buying and selling and then you know gradually making the user experience easier for people so supporting all the different wallets just being very kind of friendly with the ecosystem as opposed to trying to build all of the things ourselves has been important for any web 3 company i think it's really important to like figure out what your focus is and not kind of necessarily try to like take everyone else's territory but be really you know friendly and um and play into the ecosystem and we all know that communities are the lifeblood of almost everything in crypto companies applications tokens doesn't matter your community is everything and so having a company that listens to the community is really really important and so devon i'm going to ask you kind of an unfair question uh is it intimidating to seemingly have like an entire nft bull market on your shoulders well yeah or well i think um you know i i definitely don't want to give the impression that like openc is like the one company you know moving this thing forward it is interesting that like we have been um such a dominant force in terms of like market share and all these things um and certainly it's a big responsibility to the like to make sure that the product is as good as possible like fix these burning issues and we really are trying as hard as we can to kind of like scale the team and you know we're like a very small team when we start happening six or seven people now we're about 45 people um but like wait you guys were six or seven people when like this year about a year ago or about six or seven people yeah six or seven people a year ago now 45 and uh yeah so a very small team that had to sustain this growth yeah yeah so we're really yeah and i think for anyone who's like frustrated with their platform yeah we are trying to improve it uh and it's been really just like a challenge of how quickly can you scale you know not breaking all the kind of cultural things that make the company work well so yeah we're um really trying our best uh and uh it is a big it is a big burden or not but a big responsibility for sure i want to peel back some of the layers there because you guys have gotten absolutely just flushed with users over the last few months or so only in such a short amount of time right so what are these users telling you both the new users the old users like what are the most commonly requested features what are the most commonly like surface complaints like what what do the pro what do what do the users demand in 2021 when it comes to openc and nfts yeah i think um you know trust and safety is a big one we're investing in so ensuring that like when you find something on openc it is like the sort of verified version of what you're looking for and it's not you know anyone can create an nft now so that means that you can create a fee that resembles a legitimate one so just figuring out how we deal with that problem in like more creative ways you're curating for quality and filtering out like yeah and stuff like that exactly so just doing a better job of like manual curation algorithmic curation ensuring that the best content gets filtered to the top right it seems like a almost like a google type job that like the thing that google did for the web was like just curate links for us right help us search things um yeah that's kind of what you're talking about right yeah no exactly i think i think there's a lot of like interesting analogs there here we're dealing with like sort of more structured data whereas like web pages are just this giant like html thing so it's a little bit of a different problem um but yeah and certainly similar um and then you know there's also the external challenges right where like people are getting you know scammed or fished on discord or whatnot so dealing with those sorts of challenges um you know now they're actually a really interesting one that's popping up that we're working on is like you know now nft's almost become this like free messaging platform like you have your openc account with like your stuff in it and anyone can send an nft to you without you needing to accept the nft and so now people are sending especially on polygon they send people this maybe you guys have experienced it these spam nfts and so giving users greater control over their profile and like what kind of bids they see what kind of stuff they see there like those sorts of um challenges are another one that is a big pinpoint and then i think the one that's maybe not spoken about as much by the like more vociferous members of the cryptic community but is a big pain is just people who are trying to get in and like have to go through you know get crypto somehow and then get it into the mess you know the traditional like crypto onboarding challenges hit us pretty hard as well uh definitely do you find um users uh complaining about gas fees like to gas fees does that become your problem like so i've been personally shocked at myself because like uh you guys know me on bagless i do not like to spend eth that's a thing i do not like to do yeah and i found myself on open speed see and i'm like i'm like spending 100 or more right like like to mince something david's like those are rookie numbers i'm surprised that um i it's been surprising for me to see the amount of demand for nfts and how uh nft like purchasers and users are willing to spend massive amounts of money to uh to do things in this field yeah i'm curious your thoughts on all of that i guess yeah kind of a growing concern do you think it's a show of maybe of strength of nfts that that people are it's got product market fit people are willing to just to go to these lengths to mint them what's your take yeah well no i mean i think it's a very strong indicator of like product market fit the fact that like people are paying hundreds of dollars like i don't even list their first you know there's a setup process on opencv to pay gasty and like that often costs a lot of money and just like people going through that demonstrates that there's so much strong demand here um i do think like you know to your question of like you know having to use eth right you can have like a process where you like restock up on each every type but often times like you know you don't think you don't necessarily think to do that um but yeah i think like the barriers to entry are so high and the fact that people are like you know doing it is just such an indicator that there's so much potential um i mean on polygon for example like that sort of a testing ground and there's you know some of these other layer ones and all these other things are like kind of testing grounds for what it looks like when you're when users don't have to worry about that for example on polygon we pay gas fees which is kind of nice the challenge is that you you do run into like the gas fee is almost this kind of like interesting and inefficient spam production system right i guess that's kind of what it's for right but it has like these sort of like it does it in a really weird way i guess um and you don't have that on some of the polygons so then you sort of have these different problems that come up when when the application is paying the gas um so i think application developers and users are going to try to figure out like what's the best way to provide a good onboarding but then also like have these checks and balances in place um but yeah i want to get your take on this because i think this is a big secular trend that we've just um entered into and this is like social social media platforms and web 2 now starting to come to web through uh we've seen glimmers of this with reddit right they're doing technical stuff but now we're seeing it with nfts and we're seeing it a big way so uh you know the the newsletter platform that we use on bank list is called sub stack right and we have been bet i've literally been begging them for the last two years to add eth as a payment option right and pay by credit card would do something manual if they want to pay by crypto they still haven't done it yet okay but you know what we get as a release a couple weeks ago is like the ability to embed nfts from open seas in sub stack which is super cool and like they're a smaller platform they're not the only ones twitter now the ability to authenticate nfts as part of a twitter profile that's huge tick-tock now starting to experiment in in the space and what i've sort of seen devin is like there seem to be almost three steps to this of web two entering web threes like step one they start experimenting they're minting something they got some content yeah that's what twitter's doing that's what uh sorry that's what tick tock's doing now but that's what twitter did a couple months ago and then they get into the we want to authenticate nfts on our platform that's where twitter is i expect that's where like the tick tocks of the world are going next i i expect they'll want to start like minting content maybe directly from uh their platforms but like tell us about this trend is this a big deal for nfts and what does this mean for uh c yeah i think it's a huge deal i mean i think what's so cool about web3 and maybe what um is sometimes overlooked is it's in the same way you know the internet was sort of built on the fact that everyone had personal computers right that was like a sort of critical building block like web 3 is and then web 3 is built on all the kind of like information distribution infrastructure that was like built through web too right like it's now nearly trivial to like contact anyone else in the world right through twitter or whatever social media thing and and just and spread information across the world and so um these when when you add the like this sort of new primitive on top of that those rails i think what we might see is just like way faster growth than maybe is expected and it's interesting because you know we had slow growth for a really long time and then if you look at our trajectory it was like boom like unprecedented and i could see that same sort of like unprecedented or define the laws of physics level of like trajectory for crypto as a whole and not just speaking of nfts because we're not really dealing with hardware here we do have some like technical constraints on like underlying blockchain systems but the rails have already been built to like get this distributed globally that um i could see things sort of like moving really quickly right and it's scary i think actually in some ways um but i think the to the question around like you know this web 2 web 3 thing i i think that's going to be one of the sort of i mean it might fizzle at first like you know maybe some of these early experiments won't you know like get crazy traction and people will kind of just be like okay but i think eventually that will be sort of what takes it to an even bigger level yeah this could accelerate quickly i'm like i'm like um starting to realize that over the last you know a couple months but like how many uh how many people own nfts right now i've seen estimates where it's like i don't know two hundred thousand addresses maybe three hundred thousand that's higher than that because um i mean i think like let's say let's say you know it's it's in that range i don't know if it's over a million do you think devon yeah i don't want to give any exact numbers but like you know i would guess more in the millions so we're in that ballpark right high hundreds of thousands maybe maybe a million maybe a bit more right but like how many daily active users or monthly active users does reddit have right you know 450 uh million right and like what's the i don't even know how many accounts does twitter have right hundreds of millions yet again and so web web 2 kind of adding this nft overlay is going to bring a tremendous amount of exposure to nfts and this thing could blow blow up really quickly like it could accelerate we could be at the beginning of the nft acceleration even though it feels like to some like it's the top so yeah i double down on that like seeing web two platforms they're okay web 2 is adopting nfts in a way they've never adopted like cryptocurrencies and tokens right never not even close because i feel like they think they've already got the payment thing like figured out it's like it's okay yeah we accept credit cards and that's good enough for a lot of people but like this nft thing it's new it doesn't exist you can't do this outside of web yeah i think it's a great point yeah it's like incremental technology is not gonna cause people to like change their road maps and like you know shift trajectory or shift prioritization but like brand new experiences that like are attracting you know millions of new users into these things even though it's early when you see that like growth curve you know you can't really ignore it so i think it's interesting the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn

you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless devin i think people would actually including myself would actually appreciate a little bit of a history lesson with openc and also you yourself so before openc before crypto where did you come from and then how did you can you tell us the story of the genesis of open sea sure yeah i have a very boring background i was a software engineer at pinterest and was on the growth teams i like uh you know worked on consumer products uh i left to start a company in the personal finance space that was acquired by credit karma where i was an engineering manager for a while that's around the time i got interested in crypto i was like yeah just you know very again very boring like traditional fell down the crypto rabbit hole um was interested in like the you know more consumer like you know at that time there was sort of this like debate which i think has in many ways been sort of put to rest but like around you know blockchain being a financial technology or it being like there's a tech crypto or finance crypto right like is is it all just about like digital gold and like um these necessary policy yeah monetary policy or is it about like the new web 3 internet right i think the jury is out it's a web 3. um but that was it that was still a debate and there were actually maybe fewer i'm sure you guys were in the web three camp but like there were maybe 50 50 or something right um and cryptokitties i think was like the first semblance of something that was like oh this is their first like kind of consumer web 3 app um we were the other yeah the other thing was we had applied to yc with a different crypto idea um and got it in with that and sort of realized that that was more of like a like a crypto idea that was like your traditional like ico type thing what was that idea uh we were gonna do like it's sort of like helium um uh it was gonna be like wi-fi or bandwidth sharing using crypto so like um you can basically share your wi-fi with other people and earn cryptocurrency and stuff like that um so now a lot of companies are doing that but it's more it's just like a different type of project than like a you know thing where you can just like take it to market and see how customers interact with it um so pivoted to something related doing something related to cryptokitties um i think at the time what was really interesting was people were permissionlessly developing on top of cryptokitties so some people were creating like kitty hats or kitty racing or you like did other things with your cryptokitties which was just a cool concept um and then you know the idea of a marketplace for cryptokitties and things like cryptokitties was like something that was a cool concept and sort of a bigger idea that you know you could sort of squint and think about how it could become a big uh a big thing um so we just kept on kind of working on that and iterating on it what kept you going during the bear market because it was deader than dead right like d5 was dead ethereum was dead and nfts were never oh my god they were barely alive in the first place they were like somewhere near the center of the earth that's how buried they were they were dead dead dead like yeah barely existed well i think it's honestly just like you know not really having done a successful consumer startup our metrics were really bad for sure like we didn't have that much users but we had some and they kept on coming back so like you know it was like enough and you know they were very vocal so like to us it seemed like we had adoption like a bit and like and and then also within the developer community that was where you saw the real momentum like just people really excited about it still building so it seemed dead from like out the outside but internally like within the small niche it was actually pretty vibrant so i wouldn't say like that it took like i mean yeah certainly you know in hindsight now if you look at our like graphs like those user numbers are just like minuscule but um it wasn't like we were like really like being there were a few people that kind of like you know beat us down to some extents of like you know you guys should pivot out of this and do something else but there's also a lot of like really positive signal and so i wouldn't give us too much credit for like you know weathering the like bear market because i do think that um there was a lot of kind of just sort of um hidden excitement and energy in the nft space like we had conferences and stuff still people were like meeting up and you know talking about their games and stuff it was just i guess it was just underground right you're excited about those days with you know a few hundred users per day and that kind of growth and that you know some developers thought it was cool and uh that was enough i guess what the other thing people don't realize is like it felt really terrible in 2018 and 2019 but like it didn't last that long like we're just talking about a couple of years can you please wait a couple of years until you reach unicorn status definitely i mean we're not talking about like grueling decades of uh trying to weather this thing great granted 2.5 years into the bear market you still actually didn't know that the bear market was about to end so like putting ourselves back into those shoes like we could have like in that frame of reference like we could have gone on another year or another two years we actually didn't know at the time yeah i mean i think what's impressive like i haven't followed these like trajectories like super closely but like like i don't know roadblocks something started in like 2004 or something something ridiculous right where like you know and they were just building this game where it was like there really wasn't i mean there was a big a bit of a macro trend that they were capitalizing on but like they had no idea whether this game was going to actually like take off and they just kept on like that type of like passion and like ability like just devotion to building like this amazing product is very i just think i mean you know i'm not saying that what we didn't do we did wasn't admirable but like i i think there's like people who have weathered so much more and then eventually like kind of seen that inflection point when there was really no there's never a guarantee that you're gonna hit that um inflection point but as long as you love what you're building then that kind of like keeps going right so what was it like to be a fly on the wall of open c slack or open c headquarters in 2020 when all of a sudden the nfc markets actually do heat up and like i'm reminded of that gift from the office where there's a michael saying everyone stay calm it's happening it's happening everyone stay calm when there actually was like a like a actual moment where like in the winter of 2020 when nfcs really had their first big mania like what was that like like was there just like an internal office meetings like guys this is it or like what was like the real estate realization point well i think one really weird thing about that was like so that was february like well i guess like august 2020 was when things started heating up and you know it was still like coven right and so like there wasn't you know people were still very asynchronous right and so getting that like and we're also just a small team we're like six people so it wasn't there wasn't much like everyone kind of knew what was happening and like uh you know it wasn't like we didn't like we're just like oh this is very interesting there was one day where like it was like you know 10 or 20 x the volume that we usually see because of this hash mask project and it was just like and we didn't really think it was like the beginning of of some crazy run but um yeah i don't remember it was just like very kind of interesting and confusing and we're all just like whoa is this is this going to continue there's always a question like is this going to continue or not right and then you know things would die down a little bit but then they get to just get bigger and bigger and then the recent one i mean this recent last month was just very that was just like a overwhelming feeling because we you know we're doing these really crazy days of volume and there was like let's just like hold on for your life and just make sure that like everything's running correctly nice and so you guys have had like guys had your first taste of success in 2020 and then continuation on that success very strongly in 2021 but also recently we've had that story of a first like bump in the road when it comes to just what it's like to being a company with this whole insider trading debacle uh can you take us kind of just through the story of what happened from from your perception and um can you also answer the question uh how much ether the employee actually was able to collect from this informational arbitrage can you tell us that story and tell us the fallout sure yeah and i think one important note is like that this was not insider trading right because you know we don't trade financial items on uh these are nfts or digital arts so there's no notion of insider training the term does not apply to us but um so i think that's an important note but um yeah and just you know to um talk about that particular incident we we did have an instance of an employee um who made purchases prior to items being listed in promotional slots on the openc homepage and we did end up letting go of this employee we've had internal policies around what the use of confidential information at openc and the knowledge that certain things will be promoted but we really use this as an opportunity to strengthen those policies um and ensure that they were like crystal clear both for employees and also like crystal clear to people externally that you know employees are not um allowed to use confidential information on the platform to make decisions around buying and selling nfts and so we view this as an opportunity you know this is completely uncharted territory because these you know this is not an exchange it's a marketplace for consumer items and so we have taken this as an opportunity to really like pioneer some of those policies and ensure that we're like really being forward thinking about it and luckily you know in the grand scheme of things this was a very small instance of a problem um and so really like um you know we saw this as a you know a responsibility to the community to push the space to a place where um you know people on openc have a level playing field um and ensuring that those policies are super clear um in terms of the monetary amount i think was like 50 grand or something like that so again right this is like really small you know not gonna make a huge difference um in someone's like crypto you know uh financial state um and so you know it was a it was an unfortunate event but again like something that was um quite small but but was a useful opportunity for us to really solidify those policies yeah just throwing out some thoughts there devin as as you think about that so like i when i first heard about that incident and kind of investigated it i guess i felt a kind of a mixed reaction maybe i'm speaking for others in crypto there right the first reaction is like oh interesting this is all on a public emphasis on public permissionless blockchain so it's really cool that the community can see exactly what's going on right so we have a layer of transparency in open finance that like people would have never seen this or caught this in the existing system so that's a plus the other side of me was like okay crypto industry we got to do better because if we don't figure this out right um regulators are going to come to us and start asking questions yeah and um you know deservedly so right like are there centralization vectors are you using those centralization vectors to uh screw over customers i think that's a fair question that um regulators can pose to any cert centralized service or any d d so called d5 service in the space too so i'm curious to hear your thoughts on this like just what can crypto do more broadly or d5 or the nft space more broadly to uh self-police to self-regulate right like is there a way maybe an open c can sort of say hey here's our employees here's all of the addresses they'll use in the platform we're using the openness and transparency of a public permissionless chain to actually you know provide more information to the public give me your bigger picture thoughts here yeah no i totally agree yeah i think you know in an uncharted space that's like completely green field i think that's the opportunity right is to really put in place those policies i don't know if it comes in the form of like everyone needs to know every address of every open c employee because you know there is privacy considerations there but like for sure you know ensuring that like you know we have clear internal policies that those policies are clear to our users also i think there's really opportunities to bring in um more sort of decentralized uh organizations to get involved in the curation process in some of these areas of the product so you know working with dows on you know promoting content that are that's you know maybe voted through a dao or something like that and like you know just having more surface area of the product be given over to um the centralized organizations in our community i think is really important so we're really looking to see how we can better like engage our community in the curation of the content uh on openc and not make it as central and have as much of a central point of failure in just the in the open seat organization that said we of course i think perhaps contrary to some crypto companies we do believe that um having you know an organization that can scale quickly that can make decisions quickly and is not reliant on kind of like a decentralized group of people to make every single product decision is really important if we're going to like serve our customers well listen to customer feedback and move quickly to companies so there's a balance there but i totally agree that like you know this is an opportunity and this is what we're working on um to put in place those policies that hopefully other companies since there's going there are a lot of marketplaces and more and more companies that you know participate in the nft space can look to and model um and adapt policies as well so the the where this conversation goes and kind of why i wanted to bring up this conversation in the first place is that uh it's illustrative of openc that open sees a company not an app right it's not it's not a decentralized exchange it's not a dap on ethereum it's a set of smart contracts on ethereum that helps a company operate but it's a centralized company which while it's a sign of maturity and growth i think of the ethereum and d5 ecosystems that we are starting to have these centralized companies that are operating by smart contracts open c is not the only one dydx also comes to mind as well but at the same time like there's a reason why we all like d phi uh and so like where where's your head at with open c and its future as it relates to like the centralization decentralization spectrum yeah it's a good question and it's interesting the terminology there is interesting because i would i do think maybe some people would like label us as adapt and we do think of ourselves as a decentralized marketplace in the sense that you know we're not custodying assets we're allowed to connect their walls directly and the transfers it's a peer-to-peer exchange where you know it never is in the in the hands of open seas as like a custodian so i didn't want to make that clear um yeah i think it's a balance right like i do think you know one of the reasons unisop was successful was um not just because it was just like a completely decentralized protocol but also because it was very practical right like it made like the mechanisms made sense um it was very easy to swap they made a nice portal for like you know the first version of unit swap and then of course they integrated into all these other platforms but like there's a lot of pragmatism actually to their approach that i think people sometimes gets lost in the conversation where people are like oh it's all because these companies are extremely decentralized that they're successful i think also a big piece of it is that they the self-custodian approach of connecting your wallet and immediately being able to swap is a better user experience and so for us like it's really comes down to like what do we think is best for the user base you know and we want to take into account the philosophical leanings of the user base and like you know the ethos of the community but at the same time we also know that um uh you know people don't always know exactly what they want and and sometimes people want like a fully decentralized thing but then when that happens and like there's all this fraud and like you can't actually take down like listings that are just fake and like all these things happen they want the decentralization without the without the sharp edges right the decentralization and then they're like oh wait maybe i actually kind of wanted someone to help right and so you know there's all these problems that were really and you know i think some of them we have to take a step back and say like is it good to be a centralized point of failure for certain things what can we that's why i think incrementalism is really important like giving some pieces away to the community but not being so dogmatic about it that you like destroy yourself right um uh and and so i think just striking that that balance is really important and so that's kind of how we do it what do you think is more likely in the future an open c ipo or an open c token airdrop uh we should start a prediction market for that on poly market or something i can't answer who knows we'll see uh you know going back to i guess the the topic of decentralization versus centralization i find myself agreeing like so uh personally i'm a big believer in decentralization the lower in the stack that you get right like it's it becomes far more important it's far more important for ethereum to be decentralized than every single component of an app on top of it like that opens me up um but i think others others maybe disagree with that too which is uh and we've seen recently there's been um event a talk of a vampire attack this was a a headline from uh coindesk uh andre uh cronier has created a an open c like project yeah is um open sourcing it i believe putting it out on a side chain and he's kind of like throwing down i guess right saying hey we're entering the ring uh open c what you got and i'm curious what you think about that dev and not about that specifically maybe but what are the the moats that open c has and what's going to be important moving forward do you think how do you feel about vampire attacks you think they'll be effective yeah well yeah first i think you made a really good point which is like ethereum is like the perfect example of like where decentralization is so vital and i think if you move up the stack like you have you do have these proof points you know you know swap compound etc but it's really you know the causality isn't as clear always like it's not clear you know to what extent did unit swap adding a token lead to its success versus just being a really great protocol right and um and so you know i think that's important to keep in mind is like um as you like analyze these things um but i do think yeah i mean to the question of these like vampire attacks and you know different approaches i mean in some ways we kind of welcome the innovation i think there's a lot of things that we do that maybe you know folks who are just starting new projects don't realize and only become problems when you hit like a certain level of scale um i think fraud and kind of like curation and discovery being one of them um and so i think anything that sort of pushes the space forward and creates a better user experience and forces us to innovate um is actually pretty healthy we you know we take sort of the approach of like fearing you know our customers right because we want our customers to like love our platform and use us because we're the best user experience but we you know in terms of our competitors if we feared kind of our competitors all the time that we'd usually be lagging far behind on a customer experience standpoint but um yeah i think the last thing i'd say is just like i i don't know exactly all the mechanics behind that particular vampire attack but i do think what we've seen in the past with tokens is they can be like a very interesting short-term like way to kind of incentivize liquidity and like move people over but um oftentimes what ends up happening over time is like people gravitate towards the product that works the best and um and the experience that has like you know the optimal thing that users want to accomplish so um i think there are a lot of interesting tactics and for sure it's you know we don't take these attacks like lightly by any means but we don't um necessarily think that there's um you know that we you know for example have to like immediately introduce a token because someone on some other project has one right like i think that's more sort of like thoughtful way we can approach it devin everyone thinks that we are on the cusp of the metaverse yet no one has really kind of figured out what the metaverse actually is yet we have our ideas but i want to pick your brain on what the coming metaverse looks like how do nfts fit into into that story and also what's open c's role in the metaverse that's coming whatever that is yeah um man um well sorry the first part of the question was what does the metaverse look like yeah exactly well i feel like i think you guys have i mean you wrote a um one of you wrote like a blog post on it right which i think is more like thoughtful than you know anything i i would say but like um in terms of yeah i think it's like going to be sort of i mean in some ways like already kind of here right it's like um you know we have like if you if you think the metaverse is like these really awesome like um immersive experiences we have some of that in virtual reality today right where like there's so many cool things you can do if you are on social and all these things and then you have crypto where you're like you know able to interact with people across the world and it's interesting exchange value an interesting way so you kind of have the ingredients and maybe i guess maybe the interesting thing about is like will there be these like worlds where it's like sort of combining all of the kind of frontier technologies of today like virtual reality artificial intelligence crypto they're all kind of like innovating a little bit separately right like vr isn't touching crypto a ton ai is starting to touch crypto a little bit but like they're all kind of separate and so you know maybe those three frontier technologies maybe there's another one biotech or something like start to converge and you kind of get like really interesting stuff not to like call out a particular project but one bulithia is this really interesting weird project that's like it's like you they put like gpt-3 on nfts and like they come alive and like start talking to you it's just like so many different foreign technologies all in one product um so i think like that kind of thing is some is like an interesting way to think about the metaverse is just like the combination of frontier technologies um in terms of open seas role yeah i mean i think we yeah we're really trying to be sort of you know the best marketplace for the metaverse and then also like help push forward the open standards that allow the metaverse to work really well right so like the metadata standards for nft is interoperability between nfcs and that's something that we're just getting started at because most most of it has been like playing defense and like just making the marketplace work well but that's like one of our the exciting pieces of our vision is helping with the with the standards that like make this all possible um so that's something that i think we'll be investing a lot over the next like year or so that's awesome devin i i know we had to kind of accelerate our our time together so i i want to wrap up with a few like rapid fire questions if if that sounds okay with you um okay so the first i have is this like tremendous amount of growth in the last year what now uh open c is a unicorn company right so you know you're riding the unicorn sir over a billion at least in in value what would the the seven person team devin tell advice what advice would sorry what advice would the unicorn devon the devon of younow tell the old devin a year ago this the devon with a you know seven person team what uh what insights would you have for that person well i told it two years ago devon to like hire more people and like scale up a little faster because i think we're just getting too lean and maybe tell the seven in person but we were you know at that point we were trying to do that it just took a little bit of time um yeah i think like you know and again you know these are maybe the like much older or much younger devon but like yeah following your conviction i think is really important like sort of not like not over indexing on like advice from really smart people if it's not properly contextualized i think it's important tell us about your favorite uh nfts devin what are your favorite nft projects i'm a big fan of like virtual world um sort of early metaversy type things like descent for land encrypted voxels cryptic voxels is really one of my favorite projects where like you know it started out with one guy and just sort of started selling virtual land on sea um and now there's like this whole community of people who are creating interesting art projects inside of cryptic fossils it's just like you know it's just you can really like dig your teeth into it and go and like do stuff in your bivoxels whereas and you don't necessarily get as much of that from some of the more like collectible projects and i think it's just it's one of those products that's been building for so long essentially and sandbox similar but like um i like that grassroots style of just like you know ben the founder is just so passionate about it and it's just been working so hard that i really find that admirable what do you think the cutest nft project is out there and why is it the penguins whoa you read my mind you're talking about pudgy penguins right yes oh yeah oh yeah cute little guys yeah are there other penguins guys i mean i'm sure there's something but yeah there's always other other things and there's always the off-brand i i gotta ask devon crypto kitties are pretty cute actually just like you mean you mean cool cats or crypto kitties okay crypto kitties yeah i mean like yeah do you you own any like like flashy big nfts like do you own a crypto no i don't i don't have anything too crazy no yeah why have you just like just focused on building or yeah i just was like every time i thought about like going and buying another tea i was like maybe we should just go back to work [Laughter] see david that's my pain man you're busy you keep up with all this stuff that's why i always say punk and done punk you always say you always say that huh oh i do now okay it's punk and done devin this has been an absolute blast i appreciate it so much any anything you can tease for us in the product red map anything really cool coming like all the well i think if you guys you know our launch of our mobile app wasn't like you know supe super flashy since it's sort of um a first iteration of it where uh as people like to say on twitter you can open and see your nfts but not necessarily do anything else but yeah um but but um the mobile app is really we're iterating on it it's getting you know we have some cool releases um just like incremental improvements to it that's really fun um just a cool way to like you know open up and and check like what's going on in the in the nft marketplace um so i highly recommend people trying that um and yeah we'll probably we'll have you know new projects uh coming so that's live now on mobile android and apple yeah apple and android yep sweet yeah guys devin thanks so much for joining us and you know talking more about nfts i can't imagine where you will be a year from now but we'll have to have you on soon we shall see you thanks so much for having me action items for you bankless listeners uh number one
