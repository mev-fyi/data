what does this mean to be the Nintendo of web3 and how do Game cartridges fit into this whole thing coming at this from how kind of treasure started it was a derivative of loot it was a fair launch Freeman so we distributed magic we distributed the initial nfts that led to free mints that led to small brains that led to bridge world and Legions and so that was our approach of this interoperability thesis like a Nintendo there are first party bets and IPS but at the same time what magic should have unlocked for a lot of people was the ability for other games to come into treasure my aspiration is that we no longer have to refer to this moniker of the decentralized Nintendo in a few years and we just call it treasure
