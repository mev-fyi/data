think that it's a really exciting moment in our ecosystem because we are looking at our own role in web3 in a different way than we have before and so we as a community have the opportunity to go meet people where they are in their own journeys not at you know the first step of our user journey which means that we can reach out to so many communities who haven't yet engaged with web3 if we can tackle the end points that they're already using i definitely think that the more we consider the tools we have both on and off chain the more fun superpowers we're going to be able to create in web3
