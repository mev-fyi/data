so hypothetically if there was a token to be associated with arbitron what would its ticker name be just out of curiosity i thought it was like arb because arabs like arb for arbitrage rb also just sounds fun no no no no would it be a r b i or rb rbi e probably just like r b i know it's not like a r b y like arby's and if i was this hypothetical token when would we learn the name of this hypothetical token like when would we learn about this so so let me tell you this actually our team is tech first so getting the tech right first you know even before we think about any of these questions having mature tech is is critically important to us and and the most important to us i have nothing specific to share today on that unfortunately only to say that some of these questions of how do we decentralize how do we involve the community more in the protocol become very very important to us and we will definitely consider various options there
