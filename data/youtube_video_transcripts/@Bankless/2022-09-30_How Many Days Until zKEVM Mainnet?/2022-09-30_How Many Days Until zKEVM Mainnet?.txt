you guys are getting close to mainnet and by mainnet I'm talking about a ZK evm on mainnet can you give us the countdown how many days out are we and are you going to hit that date yeah we said 100 days a while ago and as soon as we said it was 100 days to mainnet I think everybody in the company threw up because we're like so worried about hitting it but um we're 31 days away right now and I I think we're gonna hit it one month things are looking you know I would say more than a non-zero chance that we'll hit it more than a non-zero chance but there's also a chance that you won't then I assume I think we're looking pretty good I think we're looking pretty good all right
