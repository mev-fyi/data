in terms of the four pool it's it's a huge move right uh the the three pool is the biggest and like most most liquid pool on on curve so it ends up being the bridge pool for a lot of uh stable coin swaps and then the bridge pool for a lot of swaps generally especially as curve v2 and the volatile assets becomes bigger um with this so and and frax had it had its own pool which it was uh participating in the curve wars and then terra had its own pool that again it was doing it was doing the same thing and they basically like teamed up right they've kind of cartelified um and and they're along with redacted and there's also i think a few others joining this coalition in order to put in this four pool which will be you know fracks um ust uh tether and usdc and and send all incentives towards this pool which should make it the most liquid pool in a stable coin pool and defy and become the bridge pool so that so that uh fracks and and ust become the reference decentralized stable coins across chain
