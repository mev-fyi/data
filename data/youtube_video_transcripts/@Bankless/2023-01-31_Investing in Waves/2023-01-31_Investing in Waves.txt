one thing that 2021 taught me is if I have a really allergic reaction to something I need to look closer at that thing an allergic reaction is not an excuse to look away but it's actually a reason to look closer that intensity that I feel in a negative Direction probably to a very different person incurs intensity in a positive direction I think part of the practice as investor of stripping your emotions out of the process I mean you can use your emotions you can observe your emotions but you shouldn't let them shape the intellectual process so they can be indicators to you but the intellectual process should remain objective and rooted in study and reasoning
