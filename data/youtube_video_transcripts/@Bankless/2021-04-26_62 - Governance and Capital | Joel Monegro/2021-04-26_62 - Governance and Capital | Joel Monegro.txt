welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david fantastic episode who did we have on and what did we discuss we had on joel monegro of placeholder vc joel is uh very close with chris burniske who we've also had on the podcast and i personally really enjoy this duo of of really big thinkers and these guys really take the very nuanced details of you know token governance uh you know crypto network management and really extrapolate it from the micro all the way to the macro and this is a bankless podcast that i think is really pushing the frontier of crypto knowledge because again we are not designing these systems we are exploring these systems and joel i think is doing a really good job exploring the frontier of crypto network governance and what that means and he has i think done a very fantastic job really defining and articulating what is actually going on when we talk about governance and linking it to capital and his association of governance and capital is actually two sides of the same coin i thought was extremely profound and perhaps actually the entire through line of this entire episode yeah what's crazy here is i feel like a lot of people who whether they're bankless listeners or just you know the population in general have this like feeling that something big is happening like something has changed like we are entering into almost a new era where our previous institutions no longer work and we've got to discover these new institutions like change very much maybe it's the 2020s thing but it feels like change is in the air david and people are uncertain how this is all gonna shake out and what i love about this episode with joel is he thinks big picture about how these technologies specifically these coordination technologies capital coordination technologies governance technologies will shape humanity's trajectory will shape us into the future it's just a a very big brain a very big picture high-level long-term type of podcast that blends like what we love to talk about so often on bank list this kind of philosophy side um you know this anthropology side of things the societal impact side of things with the technology this is dude this is right in our sweet spot this is a podcast that we we love to do because out of joel we get definitions for things that um we hadn't previously really defined or thought about like what is the definition of capital david hmm let's ponder that for a bit what is the definition of governance we talk about these terms so often on bank list but joel actually brought some definition to these terms and that's what i loved about this episode and i don't think there's any other realm of knowledge outside of the crypto space that is really tackling questions like this tackling questions that that joel is really going after and the the inspiration for this podcast came out of a desire to really articulate why governance has value in the first place because we've been here ever since defy summer we've been hearing that like oh these defy tokens they control the the passing of money you know uni uni governance tokens control the lp fees they control how money is uh sent around in the system and there and therefore the governance tokens will just vote in fees to the the tokens and then that's how there's money that's how there's value collected in these governance tokens that's why governor tokens have value and it's been this very hand-wavy explanation as like oh the the governors of a system will just vote in fees for the governors and so i really wanted to get joel on the podcast to ask him is it really that simple is it really that you know if this then that and that's why governor tokens has value and to some degree joel said yes but also he said no and we dove into like how actually capital is a form of power over the world and as a capital owner you can direct power and route power as you see fit and whether or not fees actually do make it from the hands of the protocol into the hands of the token owners the value of these governance tokens have value no matter what because of their ability to dictate power around the world and just like you said we can talk about that in the might very micro aspect of you know crypto network governance but we can go all the way back into the history of human governance at large and talk about governance is power power is capital capital is governance and all of these same things are becoming distilled inside the same asset on ethereum and tokens when crypto networks at large if you love previous uh bankless episodes like slay slaying moloch or our episode on the crypto nation state with bellagi or where we talked to chris dixon about how the nation state would be unbundled how there's this new capital coordination technology this is the episode for you and of course if you are a paid subscriber to bankless stay tuned for the debrief that comes out on the bankless premium feed where david and i do an after the podcast digest of our thoughts definitely one to catch up this time david one more thing we'll get to sponsors then we'll get to the interview is dharma is hot these days folks that are listening to the bankless podcast over the last few episodes know we've been talking about dharma which is a smart contract while it enables you to go directly from your bank account into a crypto protocol start earning yields in something like wires particularly if you're in the us david tell me something good about dharma because we're really excited about them these days yeah the the my current thesis and i'm pretty sure ryan you agree with me is that retail season is right around the corner how could it not be when doge is at 40 cents uh retail is coming and retails is expecting a centralized platform level of performance but we are trying to get people onboarded to the values and merits of decentralization and dharma i think it's how we do this right dharma is how we make sure that people get into actual real capital assets like the ones we're about to discuss with joel and they do it in a very easy and quick way and without having to worry about things like doge or litecoin because the capital assets on uniswap are legitimate assets and you can access those legitimate capital assets directly from your bank account with dharma if your friends are asking for a way to get into defy send them to dharma at dharma dot io speaking of fantastic defy tools we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping tools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bath t-shirts to much success bouncer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity

is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange alright everyone we are super excited to have joel monegro on the podcast joel is a partner at placeholder ventures placeholder is a venture capital firm which invests in decentralized networks and companies uh we call these crypto native organizations he started the firm in 2017 with his friend chris berninski who is a bankless podcast an alum go check out chris's episode as well and one of his mentors brad burnham after three years at union square ventures which is a relatively famous vc fund he developed the firm's early blockchain thesis and portfolio there including such memes and articles as the fat protocol thesis he is now a big believer and has been for quite some time that crypto will change the structure of all markets maybe even how humans organize societies into the future guys prepare yourselves this is big brain stuff today we are going deep we are super excited about this episode welcome to bankless joel thanks ryan um and david i'm super excited to be here and looking forward to the conversation you know we got to start at the that the highest level macro place we can to get introduced to this and this is like the structure of societies the structure of humanity one of my favorite books i know is david's as well is a book from yuval harari called sapiens and there's a lot of great insights in that book but one of the insights is the thing that separates humans from all the other animals and all of their species is our ability to coordinate socially that is humanity's superpower and you can even think about our trajectory our technology trajectory through the ages we've come from kind of a cave society to agrarian society to this digital society as just increasing progress on coordination technologies um i want to start with this this question around with that grounding around coordination technologies in a term that we use so often in crypto which is the term governance now i think of governance as uh the the ability to really determine how decisions are made but governance is is almost a coordination technology in and of itself how do you think about governance at the highest levels joel what is governance yeah um so governance is is a tricky term because it's so broad right um and i think that's what makes it sometimes difficult to think about and analyze but um i'm with you that governance is ultimately about how decisions get made and the structures that drive decision making between groups of people or among groups of people it can also be within an individual though there i guess you would call that autocratic governance or use a similar term um but yes at a high level governance is how decisions are made and they're usually tied to some kind of system uh whether it's a social system or economic system and um you could say that those are the same but governance exists um between a group of friends for example if you're going out to eat there is a governance process by which humans find consensus about which restaurant to visit all the way to d5 protocols there is a governance process and a system that gets created for deciding where a network goes and also like ryan said sapiens mentions how the reason why humans are different from other species is that we can actually scale governance and uh we he talks about how humans use stories initially to scale governance uh shared stories and shared myths um but uh as and also as ryan said governance is also a technology and it's really a humans are trying to find governance mechanisms governance technologies that allow us to scale into larger and larger groups and that allows us to scale beyond just like tribes of 50 to 150 things below dunbar's number into uh you know nations of millions and hundreds of millions and so joel when we talk about governance what is it that we are actually governing over that allows us to scale from just you know hunter-gatherer societies of you know 50 to 152 nations of hundreds of millions yeah um i think ultimately government what we're governing is uh pools of economic economic resources um and so that can be anything from a household um you know if you live in a house with people uh there is a kind of understood or maybe not so well understood but there is a governance process internal to the household that is about how to make decisions for that little system um and in economic history there have been periods where we have set for example the family as the as the core economic unit um other other uh schools of thought think of the individual as the core economic unit but this idea that it's a it's a little economic system we're deciding how resources are distributed and how responsibilities are distributed within that system you can have governance over another kind of economic system like a company and there you're making decisions about how voting power is distributed same kind of exercise how do you distribute the economic resources within that system who's responsible for certain aspects of that system you can have governance over countries as you men as you mentioned and it's the same dynamic it's who makes the decisions about how resources within that country are distributed um and now the principles are the same whether it's you know a family or a company or a country or the world um if you think of the united nations as a way to create a governance system that can coordinate across countries um and the technologies change right um in a at a household you know you may not need a rule book though i know that some households have household household rules that are written down um and um other systems have um you know for example a company have shareholder agreements um and all kinds of of contracts that that define the governance system for that kind of organization and different companies or different countries will have different systems and by and large the technology the dominant governance technology is writing writing is what you use to define um a lot of the processes and a lot of the responsibilities and it's ultimately about what mechanism do we use to find consensus among a group of people and it's how it starts um kind of giving us a window into um why blockchains are so intertwined with this idea of governance um because we primarily know them as consensus protocols um and it's very different from say the protocols of the internet which are communications protocols um and so this idea that we now have this new technology that allows us to create consensus protocols of various different kinds from the bitcoin blockchain to adao um really helps us understand um that we are dealing with not only a financial technology but also a governance technology it's a new tool um and a parallel to writing which has been used for thousands of years so joel you said um the thing that we we govern over most often is economic resources various economic resources i've often heard crypto and systems like ethereum being described as sort of a capital coordination tool or a capital governance tool if you will you just use the word consensus maybe where we're kind of swirling around some synonyms here and maybe these these terms have different meanings how would you relate the concept of capital to governance are it are we essentially in these uh crypto economic systems are we governing over capital is that the thing or are capital and governments more closely related in your mind i think they're more closely related than than we might think and um to to zoom out a little bit um a lot of my time uh over the past couple of years um i've spent it trying to understand capital a little bit more um and it's it was this funny thing because i found myself kind of thinking about the traditional definitions of capital which are taught in economic schools and and so on and i think the the most common definition goes back to adam smith who describes it as the part of your your stock um that that affords you revenue and capital is this interesting thing because i i found out that um everyone is aware of capital kind of the same way that everyone is aware of energy it exists in every social system um people usually understand what you mean when you say capital though most people don't seem to be able to describe it precisely and so it's something that we experience that we know what it is through experience but don't necessarily know how to how to precisely define it and i found that the the classic definitions um in the textbooks don't cover the full spectrum of capital that that we have observed um in society over the past couple hundred years that that 300 year old definition of you know those those um possessions that you have that afford your revenue um were created at a time when there were um there was a limited number of observed forms of capital um and so we're used to thinking about capital as money for example um we're used to thinking about capital as um you know the the equity of a company um but capital takes so many different forms uh we now know to speak of political capital we now know to look out for social capital as well and i find that those new forms of capital don't adequately fit within that framework of this thing that affords you revenue per se and so um as i started thinking more about it i came to the conclusion that at the end of the day what all the different forms of capital have in common is that they all represent some kind of power or control over economic resources and which is a form of governance and so for example if you think of political capital if you have a lot of it uh you're a congress person for example and you have through your career accumulated a lot of political capital there's no object right that that embodies your political capital it's kind of a power that you have and the more you have of it the more influence you have over how laws are created and which laws get or which proposals become law and so your political capital in that scenario is governance as control over the rules of an entire country and that's an incredibly valuable thing even if it's not a revenue producing asset like a share of stock in a company if you have 10 million followers in social media you have a lot of social capital you don't have again this object or this instrument that necessarily gives you direct value like the dividend on a stock but you have the power to influence the public opinion of your followers or the opinion of your followers and that's an incredibly valuable thing and so what's interesting about that exploration is that if once we understand capital as control and once we understand governance as control then we start to see this very intimate relationship between capital and governance and we might even say that governance is capital in this idea that governance equals capital is i think a a foundational principle for understanding um how to think about governance and decentralized systems because once we understand that the governance of a protocol is really the capital of that protocol um it helps us understand then uh what to expect from from a governance system or what to expect from say a governance token joel there's so much to unpack there like just the idea of governance equals capital like i mean i think that that could be quite honestly the rest of this podcast it's so deep um yeah like i i want to get in back into just uh some of the the concept you were talking about so what you're saying is basically there are all of these other forms of capital that aren't very visible to modern society that adam smith didn't see and we might not see might not be quite obvious now we might not recognize them as forms of capital and it's probably partially because there aren't assets around these forms of capital and there aren't um markets around these forms of capital so if i wanted to measure the level of political influence of a senator say like senator bernie sanders for instance over time there's no asset i can purchase like i can't purchase burn token you know right and uh and chart that over time not yet that's interesting social capital right um you know david is a really popular crypto social media figure as we all know i uh i can't chart the the value of that over time because the asset is not visible so what one thing i think you're saying among the many things is that um there are all of these forms of capital in human societies uh that are like forms of influence as well forms of governance as as well that are basically invisible to us because we don't have financial markets set up for them at least that's part of the reason why is that is that what you're saying um for the most part yeah um i think you're right i the way i like to think about it is um or the terms that i use are there's there's capital which is uh a natural social phenomenon um and it's if we think of capitals control or influence or power um all those things are related um capital kind of emerges naturally out of any social system if you have a group of friends there are some friends who are more influential than others in terms of how a group decisions are made um and same with a company there's a more established hierarchy same same with the government and so as we scale the systems they tend to have more structure around them but there's there's capital and then there's capital instruments um and the instruments are what define the behavior of that capital and the instrument layer if we want to think about it that way is where technology comes in and so for the most part because we have used writing as the governance technology for thousands of years um instruments have been defined with language um and so for example um reusing that friend circle example there's no friendship agreement that you might use with your friends and so the capital exists but there's no instrument around it and the instrument is the object the abstraction of capital that makes it observable measurable and tradable and once you can do those three things then you can create markets around it and that's where the financial market aspect of it comes in but there's a really important concept here to impact this idea that capital exists whether or not it has an instrument and then the instrument is the mechanism that we use to build consensus among a group of people about how that capital is distributed and so for instance um in a company you use the the full stack of contracts from the incorporation documents to the membership agreements or the shareholder agreements to the employment contracts to the lease agreements when you're renting an office all of those things are instruments attached to different forms of capital that define the behavior of the assets within that system for instance um if you are the ceo of a company you have a different set of rules and responsibilities than if you're an employee um and your capital within that company is represented by shares of stock that you own and those give you certain governance powers over the organization and certain control over the organization if you have if you're a an employee you have some capital in the organization and that is defined by your employment agreement and it tells you what things you have power and control over and what things you don't if you're an investor in the same company you also have shares of stock usually with different rights and different uh terms than say the shares owned by the ceo and that's another instance where we use writing to define how this form of capital behaves differently from this other form of capital but the instrument there is the share of stock and so the stock that is distributed to employees versus the stock that is distributed to the founders or or leadership versus the stock that's distributed to investors may have different terms and different rules and so it defines how the different kinds of capital within that system behave and it ultimately defines what they are worth so for example investor shares tend to have certain economic properties and protections and we usually call them preferred shares and those have a different economic arrangement than say common shares um now the instrument remains the share of stock um for other forms of capital like intellectual capital for instance we may have other kinds of instruments so um a patent is an instrument for um an idea that you had uh and it's it's the instrument that we use and it's in writing it's a legal contract as well um that gives you certain rights um and certain control over that idea that you had and that ends up in this instrument called a patent or a copyright um we may have also um for example uh property titles are yet another paper contract written in language that gives you ownership and control over a piece of physical land and that's an instrument for a different kind of capital um some people call it real capital um or land is a is a form of capital and so the instrument there is a property title and so we have these different kinds of capital and then we have associated instruments that allow us to do those things observe it measure it and trade it and you know i can i can sell you my patent right and it's how i am able to trade uh something that's not tangible like an idea uh using this instrument that's been created around it but what's interesting about that is that we have all of these other forms of capital that don't have any instruments yet so going back to political capital or social capital um you know political capital as you described it's hard to measure we don't really have anything to measure it and if we can't measure it we can't value it or price it and we also can't trade it formally and so it kind of stays in this gray market governed by lobbying and other forms of capturing value from that political capital and so that i would argue is inefficient and i'm sure we'll we'll go into that in a second um but then using the example of social capital we have we have a way to measure it right like followers on social media so we have that but we don't have an instrument that allows us to trade it because we don't have those instruments then we can't create markets around it and so we can't accurately price and value what that capital is worth and so i think one of the big opportunities we have here with blockchain says um at the end of the day we have a technology that collapses the cost of instrumentation and it makes it so much cheaper and easier for you to create instruments for all kinds of capital and i would argue that most kinds of capital that exist in the world don't have instruments attached to them and therefore don't have markets attached to them and so there's a lot of wealth out there in the global system that is yet to be captured because we haven't created instruments for those forms joel this is insanely cool and i want to i want to back up and just kind of recap the the conversation so far and and so when people typically talk about capital they typically talk about perhaps their their net worth and their net worth is always something that is a collection of all their defined assets right but but what you're saying is that capital we can actually look at capital more expansively and perhaps a way to define capital is a trying to measure the some individuals or some individuals capital their ability to influence the world and perhaps we don't know how much capital that person has until after they try to expend it and then we can look at how much of the world that they have changed and they and then we can measure it's like well you have this much capital and we can judge that by expending it but before they expend it before we understand all the forms of capital that they have in their potentially infinite different forms we actually don't know how much capital there is out there in the world because humans through their unique ability of communication and language can instrumentize capital and that is something that we try to do and seemingly has we've always tried to to do more and more and more of as we progress through history and now we have these uh crypto networks which as you said collapses the cost of instrumentation which allows humans to express capital in uh in in and define it in a precise specific asset so now that now they have this cool new technology where more and more capital can be defined and instantiated in one single asset my question to you is what does that unlock and why is that good why why is the instrumentation of capital uh why can we say that that is advancing of human society what does that unlock for us what ability does that give us the first thing it does is it unlocks wealth um at the broadest sense um in part because you are abe once you instrumentize capital once you create an instrument around the form of capital the most important thing that instrument does is allow you to exchange it and that once you understand capitalist control um you know something like a share of stock is a share of control over a system um and once we can trade it then we can create markets and once we have markets then we can put a dollar amount um or a dollar value to to that um unit of power if you want to think of it that way and so i think there are lots of forms of capital out there that um so far we have unable to create instruments around for various reasons and to understand that a little bit further it's worth um noticing that every instrument of capital that exists today is a legal contract um everything from a property title to um a patent to a share of stock none of those are objects that exist all of those are abstractions of of of that power of over the underlying system if you own a house you can do whatever you want to it right it's or if you own a piece of land you can do almost anything you want um and so you have total control right and so this idea that you have complete governance over that plot of land uh if you own all the stock in a company or even the majority of the stock in a company you have the control over that system and you have complete uh governance control and power over that system um we used to have uh kingdoms right and so all of the capital in a kingdom was invested in the monarchy and there was no instrument for trading it other than violence and death you had to go kill kill the king or queen in order to transfer that capital and capital was transferred through war and control and it wasn't until we started creating legal agreements which are consensus mechanisms and consensus technologies that we were able to transfer power um and so going back to the question about what this enables um it unlocks more wealth because we can create more markets around new forms of capital um i think there are so many interesting things that can happen once you make influence tradable for example um and i also think that capital is valuable in and of itself uh whether or not it produces say profits in the traditional sense that that we're used to thinking about capital assets and so this idea that we can use this technology to create new kinds of capital assets that have never existed before um it shouldn't be controversial to agree that capital is inherently valuable and whether or not you can measure it and so being able to measure it means that we can distribute that power more efficiently so if you think about the wealth concentration that happens in a monarchy when all the power and all the value is concentrated in a family versus how much more distributed wealth is in the modern world with democracy and open markets and we can take that a step further um and it's almost like you know hyper capitalism but in a good way um capitalism is actually responsible for distributing or discovering and distributing a lot of dormant value in the world and so being able to take that idea further is i think what's enabled by blockchains so we are unlocking more capital we are instrumentalizing it if that's even a word as well and this is going to unlock wealth i i want to camp on a particular subtlety i think that i don't want listeners to miss here because this is super interesting when you were describing it joel you kept using the terms and the way we create an instrument out of capital is we use words we use language essentially and i think what you meant were things like it could be a verbal agreement a verbal contract um but more commonly it could be a legal contract that we create these are the words this is the the code essentially uh of course in the crypto world in the blockchain world that can literally become digital code those words can be code we can embed um some of these these ideas and if then statements into actual code but another change that i think is is worth talking about is the settlement layer is is somewhat different right so the words that we write the settlement layer is ultimately the legal system of our nation-state so if we have a dispute on some contract then joel you you might take me to court and ultimately that's going to be settled by the nation-state and of course at the root of the nation-state um the the nation-state uses uh force you know violence the ability to throw someone in jail uh potentially the ability to to find them um you know against their will that's how these word-based contracts are enforced but crypto and blockchain offers an alternative settlement layer as well and i i wonder if you could reflect on this because it seems to me if we have digital contracts that are settled on a crypto consensus layer and outside of meet space court systems and nation state court systems we actually are able to remove that need for force and violence as the base settlement layer is that is that the right framing of things and the right thinking of things or or how would you respond to that yes it is and it it starts opening you know or pulling yet another threat which is um how does this play into the future how does this evolve over time and it it starts a trend towards the unbundling of governments because if the more commercial activity that we move over to blockchains that are able to enforce contracts between people and enforce agreements without the very expensive use of force um then there's everything we've talked about so far in terms of it expands the you you reduce the cost you do a couple things once you expand um the the amount of that activity and so for example and i think this is what we're seeing with with crypto the activation energy to launch a token is much lower than the activation energy to launch a company for example and that's in part because you don't have to do all these time-consuming processes to make sure that those agreements settle in in physical court um but then as we need courts less and less and less and we need the state less and less and less to enforce contracts um it's it's cheaper um for for everyone involved it's more efficient it's faster it's all the things that you would expect um but it also reduces the roll and the importance of the state which opens all kinds of weird side effects um but the most important one is i think it helps scale capitalism globally in a way that was impossible before this consensus technology before blockchains because one one interesting thing about what i call industrial capitalism is that and then um the instruments of capital that we have today is that um most of the instruments we have today were created under this industrial paradigm of capitalism um shares of stock are just a couple hundred years old but capital has existed forever right um uh patents are relatively new um properly titles are also relatively new in the context of humanity um but shares of stock in a company that is a concept created under this idea that or under the paradigm of the economy where it's based heavily on production um or heavily on kind of land-based capital kind of physical forms of capital um and they're also designed to operate within the framework or the paradigm of a nation state because they have to be enforced by some court right and so when you remove the need for a court you could think about all the things that that does to the state which is one rabbit hole but also you could also think about some of the things that it opens and one of the things that it does is it makes it much easier to conduct commerce on a global scale because one of the ways in which we have found the limits of industrial capitalism is with globalization and globalization has created um a lot of um weird side effects that we're still struggling to with today going from wealth inequality that has been created uh all the way to uh just the cost of creating and distributing capital around the world and what i mean by that is um you know if you want to start a company you have to choose what jurisdiction you want it to exist in and so let's say it's the united states and so you have to make a big investment into making sure that all of the rules around that company are kind of compliant with the underlying framework of the united states and that works fine as long as you're in the united states things get orders of magnitude more complicated the moment you're trying to do business globally and that's how you end up with very weird structures with companies and parent companies and children companies and all of the weird effects around you know how taxes are handled across jurisdictions all these things that are very expensive and what ends up happening is that because most of the instruments that we have today are designed to work within a jurisdiction as opposed to work globally it makes it very difficult and expensive to distribute capital around the world and what does that mean so you have um let's say walmart was started in the united states operating in the united states as long as you you're in the united states it's easy you can go public and the idea of a public company within a country makes sense within the confines of that country um and so for business like walmart that's all good there's no weird issues there um it's a bit of a crude example but to to illustrate the point you have something unlike uh facebook right which is a very different company than walmart it's very different because facebook is global facebook has customers all over the world or users all over the world um whereas walmart has most of its activity concentrated in the u.s now facebook facebook's capital is concentrated in the us as well because facebook is a us company and when facebook went public facebook went public on american stock exchanges and later you can find those shares maybe in london maybe in tokyo but by and large the capital facebook is concentrated in the united states and if you are anywhere else in the world your life is affected by facebook whether you are you know using facebook or not um but you are unable to access the capital created by facebook um unless facebook shares which is the instrument of capital for facebook is available in your country and it's unavailable in the vast majority of countries in the world so in the times of walmart that was okay because if you are in you know pick a place in latin america you're not really directly affected or influenced by walmart in the united states because walmart is kind of just putting up stores in the united states but now you have companies that exist stay in the u.s or in china or in europe that can do business globally but their instruments of capital are still tied to individual jurisdictions because you need a court to enforce all those things when you replace that with these global settlement layers then you can now create more um inclusive instruments of capital that are properly available and so the the theme that i'm trying to or the line that i'm trying to draw here is um with with this new technology you do two things you collapse the cost of instrumentation um which we can think of as the cost of creating capital and then you also collapse the cost of distributing that capital over the world so joel it seems to me also that what we're doing is we're collapsing the cost of um essentially maintaining consensus on that capital because instead of you know tanks and armies and a court of law uh we have the expense of a global settlement network something like ethereum or something like like bitcoin is is that the case too that we're collapsing costs on the consensus layer that is the case too and and it goes even further than that which is um a result of basically everything that happens before you go to court right um there's a lot of humans in between uh making sure that those agreements are followed um to the letter and that's where we get that phrase um to the letter um but a lot of that gets automated with smart contracts and so it's not only that it's much cheaper to settle um but as you mentioned it's much cheaper to operate because it requires less humans and less oversight because really when you and i create a contract between each other um we're both trying to avoid going to court um and so i have to hire if it's a business context i have to hire accountants i have to hire operations people and lawyers to make sure that the contracts are being followed but a lot of that goes away with automated smart contracts and with crypto networks we really get a two for one punch with both the efficient settlement and efficient more scalable distribution and so uh just just returning to that that violence conversation where you know ethereum and bitcoin they've replaced tanks and fighter jets and armies with proof of work and proof of stake and what bitcoin is frequently cited as this super inefficient network right where like one transaction consumes as much electricity as like 50 households for a year and even though that's perhaps an inappropriate calculation the the connection still stands the same but people forget to make the similar uh comparison where like joel if you and i make a contract together well that contract is actually settled by you know f-35 fighters right regardless of whether we actually need them or not the dispute will go all the way to the courts and if it makes it past the courts then it makes it to violence and so one takeaway i've already had from this conversation is that crypto networks proof of work proof of stake perhaps just make this world a less violent place because it makes the returns on investments into military and physical power less lucrative because we just don't need them anymore if we don't need armies to settle our consensus agreements then perhaps there will simply be less violence in the world as a result of that in the very very um distant future and that's that's only one side of the equation the other side of the equation is what you were talking about where we uh have made it more efficient to distribute capital uh and just with with what we call you know tokens both l1 tokens bitcoin and ether but also tokens on ethereum and i think we can definitely draw the comparison the difference between uh facebook with its capital locked up inside of the usa nation state versus uniswap which distributed 400 tokens to a hundred thousand individuals all over the globe without asking where in the in the world do they live because it doesn't matter where they live because it doesn't settle to the nation state so we really get this massive two-for-one punch with crypto network and specifically crypto network governance uh do you have any thoughts on that yep um and i think you're you're exactly right and it's a perfect example and it goes for all crypto networks right um and this idea that like you know that's impossible to do with the instruments of industrial capital it's it's practically impossible for you to distribute capital that broccoli because those instruments were created for the industrial age and now in the information age with online communications networks we are reaching the limits of how much we can scale the instruments of of the past and what makes this and that's what makes blockchain so foundational it's it's it's a technology for creating new capital instruments um that are orders of magnitude cheaper to create orders of magnitude cheaper to distribute and orders of magnitude cheaper to defend um and you're right that um i think this is part of a longer trend towards less violence it doesn't feel that way necessarily to us but if we take a very high level view to the history of humanity we live in the least violent times um in in in human history and i with every um socio-economic revolution um that creates new capital that distributes that capital more effectively among society we require less and less violence um because we have more and more consensus in a way um and so i think um crypto is yet another one of those socio-economic revolutions driven by a new technology and just like the industrial revolution was driven by you know steam power and all that um that allows us to make a significant leap forward in terms of being able to agree with each other without the need of violence and with with governance throughout history we've seen two different ways that human humanity kind of progresses which is both the improvements of making governance align with what humans want but there's also this other side which we haven't yet talked about which is uh what what ryan and i have called ungovernance where uh bitcoin and bitcoin proof of work is actually trying to be an ungovernance mechanism and so we have we have new ways of distributing uh power distributing tokens distributing the the control over the system and that is a perhaps an order of magnitude improvement upon our previous systems yet it is still the same pattern but we've also unlocked uh these these a new a frontier to expand upon which is ungovernance which is well what what can we do when we make systems that actually there's no governance about um and and so joel like when you wait when you measure the future or project into the future the future of crypto networks do you look at new governance mechanisms as the main innovation that has been unlocked or is it on governance or the or the removal of governance that is really the cool new innovation so the the only thing i struggle with in with that idea is um i think that the what you're describing as ungovernance is itself a form of governance um and so bitcoin requires less um and i'll use slightly different terms less active participation but it does not require less governance there's a governance process every 10 minutes with every block um it just so happens that the rules for how to process that information have been pre-established and we found concern the miners find consensus around those rules and then what you have is hyper efficient automated governance with every block um but we've already agreed on the rules and that is and that is governance and so this is actually something that i've debated a lot with my partner brad where um he believes and and i i largely agree that um crypto should allow us to have the least amount of governance possible and the least amount of governance possible is achieved through more and more automation now there i think is where it's worth thinking about okay governance as a concept is one thing the amount of required participation to maintain that governance system is another thing and so for example um if you have a crypto network and you compare it to a country a country requires a lot of active participation in order to keep the system running because it does not have a lot of built-in automation and so yes we can agree to the laws and we've agreed to them but we have to maintain an entire apparatus employing hundreds of thousands or millions of people to maintain that system whereas with a crypto network you define the laws and then the machines maintain the system so joel is this um is this a new form of governance then that humanity has unlocked david just called it ungovernance i think you you added that it is actually governance but it's governance embedded in in code i i often think of the comparison of like sort of you know we had um economies and uh states ruled by kings uh and then the u.s went out on this endeavor and created something called the the constitution which is essentially a governance protocol right and allowed them to to scale a different uh form of society um that was like a technology unlock um have we unlocked something new here with these uh systems let's talk about these base layer systems like ethereum and bitcoin and kind of the the un-governance uh that uh that they have which is like there's this ability to fork if you don't like a decision it's it's very much opt-in the rules are all defined in code is this a entirely new governance unlock for humanity or does it mere something that we've we've always had in the old world and just translate it into code that's a good question and i think the answer is both um [Music] and i would say on on the first half that um we are in the process of unlocking new governance systems and this is where we have to differentiate between the tools and the systems um we have a new governance tool just as um previous advances and gave us new governance tools like when we created courts and and contracts and private contracts right that was a big unlock or that was a big new tool that we were able to use um to create agreements and and have them enforced versus say just verbal contracts right which are not very reliable and so once we went from verbal agreements to written agreements that kickstarted a a whole new era of productivity um and with uh crypto i think we are making a similar similar leap um going from the uh inefficiency or the relative inefficiency of paper contracts over to digital contracts we have a new tool um but as for whether we have a new governance system depends largely on what we do with that tool because i can create a dao um or a crypto network governance system that works exactly like a traditional company with a ceo and different roles and departments and a hierarchy and there i'm using the new tool to implement an existing governance system but at the same time we can use the new tool to create vastly new or vastly different governance systems and i think we are in that process of formulating those new kinds of governance systems it does feel like we're in this awkward process uh right now for example i have a personal gripe jewel i don't know if you showed us at all with um everyone calling everything that has a token uh decentralized governance you know or a decentralized autonomous organization when a lot of the governance structures that are proposed to me look just similar to like shareholder governance like how do you make decisions on the network um well or in the critical well it's a coin vote right well this looks a lot like um stock voting and like proxy voting in in uh corporations so to me a lot of what crypto calls in this this awkward phase that we're in decentralized governance actually turns out to be very much a close mirror of governance that we have in uh in in the traditional world in a c corp um can you maybe reflect on that like do do you share that opinion that sometimes token vote is is just an analogous to like c corp vote or do you think that there is actually something new here that i'm missing or some other governance forms that are going to be completely different and much more unique in the crypto realm yeah um i think it's a it's a mix of both um on the one hand um i share some of that gripe and and it's i'd like to think of dao's for example not as decentralized autonomous organizations but just digital organizations to not necessarily say that they're inherently decentralized because they don't always are much more precise in my opinion so do do's not daos guys just digital organizations just do it well you still have the autonomous in some sense right depends on how much how much uh functionality you make into the contracts because you have a broad spectrum you have um protocols where the token votes just provide a signal and then someone else has to go and execute it and so there i like the analogy of of nation states better where um you have the executive branch which are the core developers um and you know they are there in the day-to-day understand the system really well and they make decisions all the time that are not put up to um token holder votes right you don't want token holders to do your code reviews for example um and you don't want always to allow everyone to make every proposal or you don't want to create a whole governance proposal in a protocol to decide whether the button should be red or blue and that's not something that is is a productive use of a doubt but then you also have situations where keeping some of the similar structures like say some a company hierarchy but opening some functions out to to the public creates this kind of hybrid sometimes awkward situation which whether it's good or bad i think depends a lot on the specific circumstance of the underlying network um but for example um one one line that we could take is yes in some cases it may be frustratingly similar to the concentrated levels of control that we see in traditional organizations but we have much more open processes for example and that is arguably a positive thing you may not want to vote in every decision but you may like to know that you have the right to vote in every decision whether or not you actually participated in or not but ultimately i think that birth generations of any new idea or any new concept tend to be very similar to the things that we know and understand um so for example um early web in the 90s a lot of it was mimicking um the traditional media business models of of you know pre-internet like for example craigslist was classified as which is a straight copy of what you would see at the local newspaper very different from say ebay and or amazon or the e-commerce room and so um i think we're at that stage where the the best we can do with the new tool is try to mimic what we know and it may be up to the next generations of innovators who don't have as many preconceptions about how governance should work to come in and create vastly new systems like for example uh we've talked about the molok dao in another conversation about how this idea of a rage quit um is really quite innovative that you know um there isn't that's not common for example in any organization that i know of of the kind of industrial paradigm where you can just take your share of the assets and go whenever you want um and so that's an an innovative use of the new tool that we really couldn't implement before yeah i i by the way just on the on the mo locked out i i showed um one of my accountants look like an illegal guy the um basically the prospectus of metacartel which which uses a concept from the moloch dow and um he loved absolutely loved the term rage quit because he was like i've seen the need for ragequit so often inside of the traditional deals i've done that i wish it was embedded in every single company contract that i wrote so there are some cool things being unlocked here for sure indeed and in that very example like try to implement a rage quit um in an actual company contract right you could write it but then think about the expense of executing um if if we build in a rage quit into an organization and let's say that the three of us are the shareholders of that organization and you can give me the exact same rights as the rage quit and say look whenever you want um you just submit this notice to the group and saying i'm rage quitting i'm taking a third of all of the assets of the organization um and so what needs to happen after i've made that assertion um the two of you have to recognize it number one we have to get to consensus that this thing actually happened that this race could actually happen and then there's the entire process of you know it might be bank accounts it might there might be lots of things that are indivisible like you know piece of property right um and someone has to sign off on those distributions of assets right and so now we're talking about all the time that it costs to actually go through that procedure someone has to go to the bank accounts and calculate what a third is and send me the right amount um and let's say that the person responsible for that is you ryan um what happens if you don't do it and then i have to take you to court and then we might spend several months fighting this in court where they have to read the paper contracts and say well you know this is what happened and you know gotta defend this whole thing and if you still don't do it going back to the to where violence comes in then the court can find you in in at fault and then um threaten you with say prison time that is a completely different process from just pressing a button on your wallet calling the rage quit function on a contract and all of the underlying tokens just being sent to you uh within it you know even if gas is expensive it's nothing compared to how much it would cost to actually execute a rage quit in a traditional company such a good point amin soleimani who coined the term rage quit i think that the the name itself is actually really really awesome because it what it's the metaphor the illustration is that like you're playing a video game on the computer and all of a sudden you're really unhappy with what just happened and at the just the at the click of a button you're out you're done and it was so easy for you to just be get done and exit and in the game you always announce it you make a big deal out of it i'm about to rage quit right but like the ease of exiting is so incredibly important and we we see the similar uh pattern or or lack of pattern in uh the traditional nation state where there is an exit tax of 50 percent or more for most nation states which isn't literally an anti-rage quit mechanism where if you leave the united states you get half of all of your capital revoked from you and returned back to the nation state and on ethereum all of your money is one transaction away from going from one defy app to another defy app and so if that defy app has governance you the ability to rage quit and immediately exit is always one block away just 12 seconds away right and so migrating your capital from a system that perhaps you don't agree with the governance into a system that you do agree with the governance is so trivially easy and this is to me a very powerful mechanism that puts power into the hands of the individual rather than the governing body and i'll and it and it really is a check on the power of to over to a heavy-handed inappropriate governance that is not aligned with the people uh joel how do you how do you feel about that i agree with you and um it's it's yet another example of um the efficiencies that you have and and and when you play that out uh further you mentioned for king uh ryan which we haven't really pulled on that threat yet um but forking is embedded in it at the at the lowest level of everything in crypto because you could always fork ethereum and you get a complete copy of everything that's built on top the entire body of activity and that is insane um you know that and that's probably one of the most important governance innovations um that come with crypto and by being baked into basically the constitution or the constitutions of the entire space this idea that you can make a copy and leave one it's something that um only exists in the digital world you can't have that in the physical world it's just impossible um and two what's interesting about it being baked at the core is that it extends to to the applications built on top and we've seen lots of forks of say uh dex protocols right um there was a time back in the day where uniswap was presented as a fork of bancor without the token which i think is kind of funny um and now we have you know forks of uniswap and a lot of the forks that we see either at the blockchain level or at the protocol level um they tend to be because of um differing values um you believe that a system like this should be governed in that way versus you believe that it should be governed in another way that's i think at the core there's there's forks that are opportunistic and you're trying to capture um you know value kind of you know parasitically but most governance disagreements that result in forks um are due to deep differences in values among the participants and that is that is subtly powerful because it means that um we might end up or we were likely to end up with several parallel systems and markets for the same activity say decentralized exchange that provides you the same function but where you are able to choose which one you want to use based on which one aligns with your values the most um and so in your example of the us um if you feel like the us is not aligned with your values and you're an american citizen it's very expensive for you to leave um but if you feel that uniswap is no longer aligned with your values there's 10 different other protocols that do the exact same thing that you can choose from if you want to depart do you know the more you're talking about this stuff like even just the concept of a forking jewel forking is not possible in the industrial revolution era in the analog world you can't just like let me take your factory and like i will fork that automatically i mean i think so much of what we're talking about here is actually upgrading our capital system and if capital equals governance then that means upgrading our governance systems for humanity's um trajectory into into the metaverse into the digital world right we were an analog world and that's where our capital system has been created but now we need new tools because we're in this digital world where it's completely different there's the concept of forking there's the ability to to rage quit with the click of a button um i want to get to something specific here as we talk about governance joel and this is maybe a concrete question that embodies some of what we've we've talked about that bankless listeners and people on the journey often ask and they ask this question so a a governance token and there are many of these in d5 why do these tokens have value many are like pre-revenue for instance they're just the ability to vote in the protocols governance scheme they're not attached to any sort of value accrual from fees within the protocols we often just kind of hand wave and say oh well you know governance is going to eventually vote fees in and value accrual into the protocol is that your answer is it as simple as that or how would you answer the question joel why are some of these d5 tokens that are just governance tokens why are they valuable so to answer the high level question first and this is where understanding that governance is the capital or the governance of the system is the capital of that system is incredibly important because at least to me it creates a baseline assumption that um that governance is inherently valuable um in proportion to the value of the underlying system um and so if the underlying system is not worth very much then control controller power that system's not worth very much and if the underlying system's worth very much then control or power of that system should be worth more um and so when it comes to to kind of going down to the micro level and trying to think about the value of governance tokens in a particular network or a particular system um there it's it's it's there's a lot more variation that makes it kind of um difficult to say for example this is exactly how governance tokens will capture value um because it will change from system to system now a lot of the um pricing that we see with governance tokens is speculative and that's not very different from what a venture capitalist does in the industrial model of organizations we buy the governance tokens which are shares of stock um in young startups and we value those governance tokens or those shares at millions of dollars sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars often before it's even clear what the business model might be or how that value might be created um and so i think to a large degree we're at that stage where you're not making a bet necessarily on the specific way in which um that value may be realized but you're making a bet that the underlying system is valuable that the value of that underlying system is going to grow and therefore control over that system or the value of control over that system is going to grow now this is where going back to the idea of capital versus capital instruments is is kind of interesting um in in a company the the capital of a company is the equity and the equity is um a a different but related object to the uh to the shares of stock right um the shares of stock are the instrument of the equity and the shares of stock are contracts that distribute the equity among the different people involved in this in this organization um scherzo stock as an instrument have evolved to be primarily focused on um how to distribute the profits of the system and so a share of stock is fundamentally a voting token and it just so happens that the most important thing and has power over it is has to distribute the profits and so we have built markets and we have built valuation models based on how much profit is being redirected to the holders of that instrument which is the share of stock and it's what the holders vote on and anytime that a company decides to reinvest its profits as opposed to distribute them that is a governance vote um it was either established in the in the organization or it's an actual vote in the case of mature companies when there is a vote at the end of the year to decide what to do with the profits with crypto networks it's possible that we might create new instruments whose value is not necessarily tied to the profitability to the holder of the instrument and this is a bit of an unexplored area but we got a little bit of a heads up to this future with um with amazon's progression through um being a public company where for much of the early 2000s and even 2010 a lot of the criticism towards amazon from traditional financial investors was that um you had to stock who was um or the value of the equity was increasing more and more but there were no profits and no dividends being issued to shareholders and so that broke a lot of the valuation models for a lot of people because if you just use them straight up it would say this stock is worthless because they're just spending money and they're not distributing any to shareholders the price earnings ratios would be in like the thousands or like infinite it breaks exactly it just doesn't work and so uh if you're just following the traditional models um it'll it'll break every model i think 20 years later we can agree that amazon as an organization is an incredibly valuable thing whether or not it distributes profits because at the end of the day a share of stock in amazon is a proportional right to the entirety of amazon and whether or not amazon distributes profits tuition to its shareholders is independent of the value of amazon as an economic system and this is where it's interesting to think about the value of control when we talk about the value of capital because control over amazon is an incredibly powerful thing and it's an incredibly valuable thing um if you owned 51 percent of amazon stock whether or not you're able to capture that value for yourself and extract dollars from it i think it's easy to agree that that power is is very valuable and now i think that we're closer to markets financial markets pricing in the value of the asset not necessarily the value of its cash flows and we might end up in a similar place with crypto protocols where um over time we might discover valuation models that tell us what the value of governance power is in a system without that system necessarily having to distribute profits to its token holders you know i'll give you an example joel of a time i was wrong about this in in define defy tokens 2017 it was the era of futility tokens right every ico had a new token that was going to serve as maybe a money do something inside of its economy uh xerox the xerox network had one of those too and i remember they released their token and and what was the utility of the token what was the token going to be used for governance voting in the system and to me at the time that felt very like hand wavy especially given the the valuation that xerox zrx token had at the time it was just like well like how do you value something like governance flash forward now um z zrx is actually receiving a portion of the the system value uh in in terms of cash flows in terms of revenue and now i very very much clearly i clearly see the value of zrx as a financial instrument and it was really the governance vote that has given it this value so that's a time maybe i was like i was wrong about the value of governance i think i've like kind of learned my lesson but is that uh is that an example of that sort of thing what you're talking about here 100 then in the same time frame um we were raising our first fund and xerox was an example that i used of the kinds of things that um we would invest in and we did end up investing in zrx and it was um an interesting um argument to defend with our investors where um you know why is governance over 0x valuable well well um if there is a chance that a decentralized exchange protocol like 0x grows to say um be responsible for the exchange of i don't know 10 of the world's value trillions of dollars right if trillions of dollars are flowing through this network um i i can't tell you how that's going to translate into value for zrx in terms of cash flows and as you described over time then indeed the governance voted in fees and those fees are now being distributed to the token holders but it was easy to get people to understand that if for example crx is responsible for trillions of dollars in transaction volume it's clearly a valuable system how much is control over that system worth i don't know but should be a few billion dollars if you're responsible for trillions and trillions of transaction volume and so that was kind of the picture that i that i painted in terms of you know why and this is before thinking about making that relationship between governance as capital but this kind of basic intuition that control over a valuable system is itself valuable well it turned out to be the right call but like i i'm curious as to because i remember the debate in that era was basically oh should we buy the token or should we buy equity in the entity uh how did you wrestle with that debate and how has it turned out um well the equity in the entity is in large part the value of that equity is in large part valued by the value in the token and that is actually because the equity holds a lot of the tokens and that turned out to be um to become how we think about investing in in um in crypto network companies um because we can then map out okay if this company is going to launch a network and they're going to keep say 20 of the token supplier or 30 of the token supply then we can basically value the equity in the company uh in proportion to the value of the equity of the network um but in in general i think you have to basically hold those two ideas at the same time there's the equity of the company and the equity of the network um and then you have to make the decision about whether you want to participate in the equity of a traditional organization or you want to participate in the equity of of a decentralized network and we started placeholder to participate in the equity of decentralized networks and that was one of the main ideas that that we wanted to pursue xerox is an example of when fees was actually turned on as a value capture mechanism but we actually don't need fees to be turned on to have similar valuations and and joel when we were planning out this podcast we talked about uniswap as it as and this is the unit is the classic example i was like oh we'll just turn on the fees and then the uni token holders will get the fees and then it'll be valuable but perhaps not um and it's it's i think this the reason why perhaps not is because the users of the system not only the traders but also the liquidity providers could have different incentives or different motivations or different desires over how the uniswap economic system operates that bakes in the values of the cash flows regardless of whether they are paid out or not so perhaps you could you could illustrate an example of where an economic system is generating cash flows and it specifically does not distribute fees yet the value of those fees still gets captured by the governance token yeah and we could use um that same example of uniswap um because it's it's it's easy to think through if you're an lp in unit swap and you're staking in different pools and providing liquidity um you are [Music] have bring fees that get distributed to you as an lp in unison pools and so let's say that you you run an lp operation in uniswap you're making x amount of fees every month from this operation it's very profitable for you um you're very happy um and along comes a proposal to say we're going to essentially tax that fee income that your that every liquidity provider is is receiving and let's say that i make that proposal and i say hey you know let's take 50 of all the fees generated by lps in uniswap and put them in this pool that gets distributed to uni token holders right if i am a uni token holder that's not an lp i'd quite like that idea because it means i'm i'm just getting this this distribution of the income in the system just by holding uni or just by staking it but if i'm an lp and i'm running a a a very profitable operation being an lp i may very well not want um that tax to be introduced because it will cut my lp profits in 50 and i may do some math and realize well wait a minute if this proposal passes my income gets cut 50 and i don't you know the uni that i hold and i might stake to get a share of that may not um complete and kind of make me whole and so i may actually have an incentive to vote against the inclusion of fees to protect my own profitability and the value of preventing that that tax still gets captured in the token because then my incentive is to acquire as much uni as i can afford over time to prevent fees from being introduced into the system and specifically the measure or magnitude of that incentive to purchase and hold that uni token to sway that vote is proportional to the fees no matter what regardless of whether the fees are paid or not paid the incentive if there's a lot of fees being paid or a little fees being paid the magnitude of the incentive to sway that vote is still proportional to the fees and so at the end of the day it collapses back down to how much control does uniswap have over economic resources inside of its system which goes back to how we're talking about capitalist governance and governance equals control correct because the main thing that you want to control is how those resources are distributed to whom and why and it's the same as in a company as it is in a in a crypto network um in most companies the governance of the equity votes on how profits are distributed and it's usually fairly straightforward it's distributed based on token ownership or sorry on share ownership and that's pretty easy it's not always distributed based on share ownership right um so if you have for example problem and shares versus preferred shares the reason investor shares tend to be worth more is because they have things like liquidation preferences which means that in a liquidation if the company is being dissolved or required that the holders of preferred shares get paid upfront or get paid first before the holders of common shares and so that's why you often see very wide discrepancies in the value of investor shares versus the value of common shares in a company and that means that you have two different stakeholders with different incentives when it comes to voting on things um and we ascribe or we invest different voting rights and different classes of shares in in a crypto network you may have the same instrument but you may have different stakeholders with different incentives and indeed um the power to um to prevent fees um is just as valuable as the power to introduce fees ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full

flatter than in previous systems as in there is seem the the different parties whether you are a uniswap lp you are a uh uniswap transactor or you're just a uni token holder uh you still you still are different parties but in comparison to previous systems where with uh what you were just talking about with privileged shares or privileged stocks over over other shares with different governing powers and uh the in crypto networks everything seems to be a little bit closer together as the users we all have more aligned interests yet we are still not one homogenous global organization of people different people have different incentives and so my question to you is have have we really just made a marginal improvement on how these economic systems can treat everyone or are we still going to be presented with the same problem that humans have been presented with since the dawn of time which is that some people have different incentives than others and over time those differences will turn into frictions and will cause disorder and chaos and so really i'm trying to get at a very long term multi-generational perspective here where how can we make sure that these systems that we are governing over like maybe uniswap is actually an economic system that spans centuries how can we make sure uniswap answers to the needs of everyone that uses it not just perhaps people that are using it today but people are that are using it tomorrow and in 50 years from now how do we make sure that like and and we've talked about um how facebook is really governing over people that don't get to determine how that governance works and that is one of the reasons why facebook is always is an example that we keep on using as a bad example in this podcast as to how perhaps we don't want governance to look like into the future how do we make sure that the governance over these defy apps or crypto networks stay aligned with the users that use them now and into the future so i don't think we we can guarantee that and there's kind of a lindy effect of of human issues here where we've had this issue since the dawn of time we're probably going to have it till the end of time um and um you know i i'm optimistic that um with every new kind of innovation in governance technology it is easier to coordinate there is less conflict and there is less violence so i do think we make a significant leap forward in uh reducing the space for this agreement because the more the more we rely on code and automation then there's just uh fewer uh avenues for discord among people and and that is a good thing um but it's it's generally difficult to make everyone happy um at the same time about anything and in in part the role of a consensus protocol is to get people to re-agree to disagree on certain issues um like if you we look at nation states you know you may vote for the candidate that lost and you know that's okay we've pre-agreed that if you lost um the election or you know any any kind of office that you you can vote again in four years to pick a random example right and so we've bought into the idea that um the you may not always get the people in power that you want but uh there are systems and pre-agreements that you know make sure that we can you get the opportunity to vote again and so on um when it comes to crypto um there's there's all kinds of of interesting things that i don't know how they will play out but i know that they are different uh one is especially when you compare crypto to say um governance over a company is you tend to get well you have no guarantee that the people who voted today are going to be the same people that vote tomorrow not in the same way that you have it in traditional organizations at least where if i put a vote on uniswap i don't know who's going to vote and i don't know you know who the people are behind that vote whereas if you think of the decisions that get made at the board of a company usually the people on the board have been there for some time and have known each other for some time and you can kind of predict how one person is going to vote versus another and that brings certain efficiencies and certain inefficiencies and similarly having a much open much more open process will bring some efficiencies and some inefficiencies there's there's one kind of subtle difference that i think is very powerful and one of the main ones when comparing governance in crypto to governance in in the industrial world um at a societal scale which is that if we think of the governance systems of a country for example say the united states um and you're voting uh on you know the president for example or the uh as a as a representative vote for the broader governance machine that is you know say the government um you have to make you make a vote or a single vote on um the full spectrum of decisions of the united states all markets all spaces all economic activities and so you have to choose a the precedent of a governing body of an executive branch that governs over all markets and that's an incredible incredibly difficult thing to do um because most of us only understand a few markets i can't say anything about farming i have no idea so if i see a proposal for like you know how farming policy is supposed to work i just have no i it it just flies over my head um but if they're proposing finance regulations then i have a much stronger opinion um about what's right and wrong um something that makes me optimistic about crypto is that every protocol or protocols tend to be much more um specific in in the activities that they that they preside over and they govern and i think that makes it easier to govern because it means that if i'm voting on uniswap then the the scope of things that i'm voting on is fairly limited to what uniswap does um and then you know i can go to maker to vote on another thing but it's still equally narrow and so rather than having a single body preside over all markets now we can have each market and each sub-sector of that market have its own internal but open governance system and ultimately i think that leads to specialization of governance which is not necessarily something that that we have today in traditional governance systems joel for somebody who's listened to this podcast i made it all the way through here today but it's still doubtful on whether this is a good thing for the world right so i'm picturing somebody who's listening to this and has heard you mention this our trajectory into the into the digital this new form of uh governance this new form of capitalism we've even used terms like hyper capitalism and they get this picture of the current state of the world which is extreme wealth concentration extreme power conversation concentration and we talked about the bankless movement in crypto and defies as we're part of the revolution now we're you know against that we're for open access to the best uh self-sovereign money system that humanity can create that's what that's what crypto is now um how do we how do we kind of preserve that ethos uh do you have any concerns that we sort of become you know that when we're old men we we sort of become sort of the stuck in our ways and uh a new generation has to revolt against us what's the boomers yeah what's the case that this um hyper capitalism and everything we've talked about so far is actually good for people good for humanity and good for the world so that's that's almost an impossible question to answer um but mostly because i believe that the future is uncertain and um i i heard something the other day that i loved which is that um optimism the the definition of optimism is believing that the future is uncertain because if you're a pessimist you're just sure that it's it's you're sure about the future um and so to be pessimistic about the future of government governance is to be sure that this is gonna fail right and i think the world is a little bit more complicated than that um i do think that um opinions here will be drawn by generational device um and so um and part of the reason why this is a difficult question to answer is because for us who are part of this movement and and helping shape it in you know different shapes or forms or ways or forms um it's going to work for us because we are building it right um but it's not necessarily going to work for tomorrow's generations and because we have invested so much in this infrastructure we're really going to resist challenges to this paradigm just as our generation resists the paradigms that were set um by people um two or three generations before us um there's actually a book that helped me understand this a lot um it's a fantastic book it's called generations a history of america's future it's brilliant it was written in the 80s it's um it's by two researchers um strauss and howie who actually coined the term millennial back in the 80s before millennials existed and they go back through the entire history of the united states to find every generation and then try to find patterns between the way that different generations emerge and what they found is that there is this kind of hundred year pattern in the way that generations behave that is heavily driven by each subsequent generation's reactions to the previous generation we've called this uh the fourth turning thesis and so bankless listeners will remember that that term if they uh have uh been following along yeah yeah very very um similar paradigm or set of ideas um and so what what generation theory kind of suggests to us that there is a there is a general repeatable pattern to how how different groups of people think about the world um and i think that the we will find the limits of this technology generations into the future just as our generation is finding the limits of industrial capitalism and the problems that it created and so while i think that this technology helps us solve a lot of the problems that we observe today i don't think it necessarily helps solve the problems that will emerge tomorrow as a result of the introduction of this paradigm in this technology and so we'll need the next generations to figure out what the issues are and solve them and it's on us to get out of the way when they come and you know we're just gonna say these damn kids they you know we fought so hard to get blockchains distributed all over the world and now the world is run by daos and they're probably gonna complain about how difficult it is to change the blockchain and how expensive it is to fork and and all kinds of things um and and we'll have to listen and you know we'll have to be better than the current generation in allowing um the kids of the future to take power joel here i've thought about this concept as well and i want to run this by you because here's why i'm optimistic that this time it's different uh and because and i recently wrote an article called the digital culture revolution which touched on this a little bit where i said um the reason why there is so much strife felt among young people these days is that the age-old institutions that were created out of world war ii in the late 40s early 50s and 60s those institutions the keys to the kingdom have not been passed down uh the the wealth has not been actually being passed down from generation to generation and therefore the young generations are rejecting the older institutions because the older institutions are not working for them and then like we said the boomers just don't understand this like why don't you guys accept these new these institutions that we've created for you and my critique of of the boomers and it's not totally fair to call them the boomers it's really just the boomer elite but to say that that the reason why young people have rejected them is because the boomers forgot to hand off the value of the system the control of the system to the younger people therefore these institutions are not updating and this is perhaps less of a technological problem and more of a psychological or sociological problem right this is not something that can be completely solved by technology but i think that technology can really really help and the difference between legacy technology of c-corps and nation states and blockchain technology and crypto networks is that crypto the the technology money and technology are the things that intermediate all of our relationships and when our relationships can become disintermediated us as a people can become closer together and that can actually change our culture and change our psychological disposition and this is something that i'm i'm hopeful is something that i'm not just blowing out of proportion but i am seeing what it could be a change in psychological disposition on the economic actors of these networks and i wrote about this about the the uniswap v3 nft that was uh minted and then sold for half a million dollars and 100 was donated to charity in a in my mind a wealth distribution event and we saw the edward snowden nft be minted for 5.5 million dollars and all of that money donated to a freedom of the press wealth distribution event and so what i am hopeful for is that the type these this more distributed technologies changes the culture of the people that use them and allow them to have a more uh inclusive disposition of being able to pass wealth down and maybe this doesn't solve the problem but it postpones the problem and allows blockchain technology to really be more inclusive for more generations for longer and really is capable of kicking that uh that calcification problem down the road further that much longer than like the nation state lasted or the c-corp organization lasted how does that how does that land with you um i i would like to agree um and today i i agree with you um i don't know why i would disagree in the future but the reason i i qualify my answer like that is you know we we have a good couple hundred years with the current system in terms of like um how it's been working and so um you know i would i would give credit to i would give a little bit more credit to industrial capitalism and what it did um and relating it to generations i think your opinion uh or our opinions on um each paradigm depend on when we came into the system along the curves so we we came into this system at the tail end of industrial capitalism our generation and so we are predisposed to have a negative view on the institutions that are now established and we're predisposed to have a very positive view on the institutions that we have established but this new paradigm is not um uh old enough uh yet to to show its limits and right now it's full of promise um more and we we can see where you know we can see places where um there's scripted networks that concentrate too much wealth and you know there's there's ways to address that um but i i want to bring a couple of elements from the conversation back to this answer one is um forking um part of the reason why it's it's so hard to transfer the wealth from one generation to the next it's because it's very expensive to leave um you know you had that the example of the exit tax but also in physical space it is very expensive to leave um the more we transition these systems over to digital space it'll be much cheaper to leave and and you use the example of how easy it is to move your assets from one protocol to the next if we expand that idea to the macro scale it means that we will be able to leave governance systems or that the people participating in the system will be able to leave at will without much cost and without much violence and ultimately what that does is it increases competition and this is where i like using the term hyper capitalism even if it evokes the wrong ideas in certain people because the main one of the main principles of capitalism pure capitalism is competition the idea that you solve a lot of problems through competition and the the thing that makes me most optimistic is that we now are creating the space for competition among just purely the governance philosophy in a paradigm of a system where you know you you for example may disagree with the way amazon is run um but you can't go to an amazon that provides the exact same service uh and it's just governed differently and now we can and so that may create the incentives for the um the system as a whole to be more inclusive and more in line with the needs of its participants and it may prevent the ossification um that that we see with with industrial capitalism but it's you've got the opportunity for forking and then you've also got um the um the participation is more liquid um and it's that uh conversation that we had in the beginning where political capital doesn't have instruments attached to it and so much of what prevents the transfer of wealth from say the previous generation to this generation is the policies that were established by the previous generation um but if you have and a lot of it is captured in political capital um and that's something that uh it's a market exists but we can't observe and so then that power is not very easily distributed and so we're able to distribute power more effectively among a larger group of people then we might have less of a challenge in actually facilitating that state transition so to speak to the next generations because some of the pain that you described we feel in the us today has a lot to do with the lack of representation in in government uh from the younger generations i think we had uh the yeah i knew i know that people observed that in this last presidential election in the u.s both candidates were over 70. um and that is i think a prime example of that discrepancy between the characteristics of most of the population versus the people in power and then if we have more fluent uh exchange of governance power because we now have instruments to trade that governance power then markets we can rely on markets to distribute that more efficiently and then hopefully that results in in more efficient decision making i think people can get behind the type of hyper capitalism that you're talking about uh what they reject is sort of the crony capitalism or elite capitalism but what they embrace is the ability to compete and challenge and participate against the existing institutions which if crypto plays out plays out the way we hope it will will be the case i just want to ask this this final question joel to you is this whole transformation that we've been talking about how long does it take how long will this take to play out do you think um probably hundreds of years um if we don't annihilate ourselves before that um but it's it's it's slow um and it'll it'll take um it'll take a couple generations um but i do think that we are in the middle of um a a a new turn of the wheel where we're establishing new institutions and new beliefs and new values in society that will be embedded in the systems that we create um and and that takes a while um generational transitions take anywhere between 50 to 100 years because we and part of the theory of that book generations is that you we don't really react to the generation immediately before us we react to the to two generations prior and so that's why you see them right um and so you have uh you know millennials reacting against um the boomers uh which are our parents um and so i think for people to react to our institutions it'll be two generations down the line and as we're seeing today just the reaction does not drive change um and so i think we're in for this ride for at least 100 years um before we really begin to transition to a new model we always talking crypto about this being like the internet in the 1990s i i also wonder if it's like governance in the 1770s you know this whole like generational change that we're yeah we're revolting against essentially and that's part of what the crypto movement is as well joel it has been an absolute pleasure
