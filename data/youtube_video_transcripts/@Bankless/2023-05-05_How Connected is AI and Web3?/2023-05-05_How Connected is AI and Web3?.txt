crypto and AI do you think that there's a large intersection here or are these two totally separate Technologies I think there are two sides of this in coin I think that blockchains provide a very good interface for AI to participate and we're in an era where the llms are still good they can produce really insightful content and in order for those llms to flourish they need a permissionless system that they can build on top of and that's blockchains the other one is decentralized compute how do we build models in a way that they're not controlled by a central powerful Corporation for the exact same reason why we want decentralized money we may want decentralized AI right decentralized ways for training and for inference of AI
