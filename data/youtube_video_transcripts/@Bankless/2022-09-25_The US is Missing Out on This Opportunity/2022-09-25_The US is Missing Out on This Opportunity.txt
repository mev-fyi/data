where we do need regulation and I think we've always said this is where things are centralized they should be regulated where there are more decentralized they don't require as much regulation the regulation is the code it's fully transparent it's all Unchained there aren't humans in the middle and so if they make that categorical error of mixing up the difference between centralized and decentralized and taking an entire use case like algo stablecoin pointing at that and saying that's the bad thing no more algo stable coins I just think the implications of sloppy regulation sloppy legislation could impact our industry in a big way and particularly when I say our industry I mean those in the U.S because outside of the U.S these experiments may continue to run and as Brian Armstrong said it's going to happen us will be leapfrogged right just like they missed out on the 5G opportunity they missed out on the semiconductor opportunity that's what's at stake here
