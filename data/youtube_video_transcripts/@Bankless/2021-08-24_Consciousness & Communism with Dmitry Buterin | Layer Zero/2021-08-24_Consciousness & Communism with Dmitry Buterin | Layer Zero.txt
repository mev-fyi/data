[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been on the first episode of layer zero i'm excited to have a conversation with dimitri buterin and if we're calling this layer zero i think dimitri buterin might be layer negative one uh dimitri buterin is the father of vitalik buterin the guy that kicked off this whole ethereum movement and i really wanted to have him on as the first guest because of the relationship between the dna of of the people that make up this industry and the actual things that come to manifest on it in code i think there's a relationship there uh dimitri was uh born in russia and was you know raised in communist russia and he we go through the story of what that was like his first introduction into uh into computers his uh computer science major at university uh and then moving into the world where he's in now where he lives in canada dimitri is focused as uh focused on the world of you know meditation and mindfulness and that is a topic of conversation that i'm also very interested in as well and so we start to we talk about in addition to many other things the the relationship between ethereum and acceptance and kindness and how the protocol is a reflection of the values of the people that built it as the introduction to this podcast just suggested and then we also talked about what it's like to be vitalik's dad and watch this kid go around the world trying to garner support for this ethereum thing even before we all knew that ethereum was going to be what it was going to be i think you're going to enjoy this conversation with dimitri buterin and i hope that you enjoy all future podcasts with the people that you've already listened to podcast 2 before but in a different context about how the people that compose this ecosystem make up the the code that dictates our lives and so without further ado i bring you dimitri buterin but first a message from these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d-apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitram is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord all right everyone i'm here with dimitri buterin the uh founder of vitalik i have to still steal that joke from from laura shin she was the one that made that um dimitri uh welcome to layer zero the first ever uh guest on the first ever episode of this new podcast welcome hey so uh for listeners who are trying to get a grip for what layer zero is layer zero is about the people that compose this community this fantastic community that we are all a part of and dimitri buterin is vitalik buterin's father so technically he's like layer negative one uh whatever comes right right before right before zero and so i i think this is going to be a fantastic conversation to kick off this uh new show so dmitry i'm excited to get into some non-ethereum non-defy related subjects uh and maybe we touch on them later yeah totally and i think i i love their i love the name level zero right and uh i was just reading some articles this morning about governance and this and that right and people again we people want safety and stability it's like you know code is law but the thing is like code is written by humans and uh code will be full of bugs humans are full of bugs and uh you know uh this is a never-ending process of uh you know it's a feedback loop so really it's really important to focus on that invisible layer because it's i mean invisible in the code right but it's an extremely important aspect of this whole ecosystem right yeah at the end of the day if all of the humans of the world disagree with the code then the code is invalid and it doesn't matter and it's back to back to the human layer um so i i want to go all the way back and and kind of ask you what was it like to grow up in russia what was that like and and what city did you grow up i grew up in a city called grozny in a place called chechnya so that southern part of russia are close to the afghanistan border um and you know it wasn't so much russia it was soviet union right and it was uh interesting right because end of the day uh we have all kinds of memories from our childhood some good and bad and depending on our current emotion you know some can prevail so there was all kinds of stuff in that childhood you know having fun you know i had a very curious mind and i think i still do and doing fun stuff and you know trying to blow things up and then getting interested in electronics and whatnot having to learn some disciplines going into swimming this and that getting lots of propaganda from the state you know the state was this uh uh all-powerful benevolent force that was doing everything right and the entrepreneurship was considered to be bad and again like everything is done by the state and the state is perfect and and you know we were all standing on this uh doing these concerts and singing hints to lenny and communism and whatnot but as you grow a little bit and you see all this uh you know discrepancy between what is what you've been taught and between what's actually happening right and nobody is really believing that everybody is just kind of playing the games like yeah yeah let's kind of do this but now let's talk about real life right so it was really fascinating environment to kind of look at all of that stuff i'm assuming there's some semblance of resonance with this but when growing up in america there's always the question of like what you want to be when you grow up what was that question like for you in in russia what what form did that question come in well i guess it's supposed to come up pretty much for every child i don't recall that's ever really coming up for me and uh again maybe it's part of their social cultural level and uh you know socialism that uh soviet union was right but it's kind of you just feeling like you're part of this you're a meaningless part of this huge blob of stuff and the blob is moving somewhere and you will be told what to do you you you know you will be told where to work and kind of you will be you know your the kind of money you make and will be defined for you all of this stuff and yes you will be you know the free health care and education blah blah blah so you just do what you told right and it's really interesting because it's also you can see that even in modern russia which is uh very different and went very far from the soviet union but the whole concept of uh there's a huge difference in that in in the west and especially in the states there is this uh respect for the individual and uh in in that society it's like individual means nothing you know we can easily just move a million people here we can mail we can kill you know 10 millions here and they don't matter you know just their collective matters and an individual doesn't matter so so did you have that question answered for yourself inside of your own head or did you not even think to ask the question like what do i want to do with my life later i mean when i when i got old you know as i was growing up i was just kind of following the things that were of interest to me especially as i realized that or i don't have to just kind of follow the things that i've been pushed to by my parents and whatnot and you know i always i had a huge library at home which was really awesome it really helped me uh grow and satisfy my curiosity about life and everything and there's lots of lots of kind of books about science and math and puzzles and stuff like that and sci-fi even though it was pretty hard to get books in the soviet union it was funny like actually to get some new books you actually have to uh submit into reciting like you know 10 kilos of old books stuff like that um so i got interested eventually in electronics and then i got interested in cybernetics and kind of basic computer systems and diagrammable calculators so by the time i finished uh school high school if you want then i knew that okay i really want to study computers and stuff related to that and can i i chose the university and i want for that do you remember your first introduction to a computer like what was the first time you touched a computer i probably was maybe 15 maybe 16. oh yeah probably somewhere around that age and the first my first experience was with this uh you know in school we get so we're supposed to get some kind of hands-on experience uh some you know not outside of regular learning that you get some hands-on experience with uh in a particular whatever factory organization right and in this case we're at some kind of uh i don't even remember what the organization was but they had this uh what do you call them a mini computer right like you know when you have terminals and you have this huge computer somewhere and then you have printers and whatnot and yeah it was really exciting to kind of be being able to kind of touch that and and then they had some experience with personal computers and maybe even before that probably my first introduction was a programmable calculator right like soviet union was uh like was not known for creativity but it was uh just uh ruthlessly copying all this stuff it could steal and copy from the west so i believe that the programmable calculator that they had it was just a copy of something that was created in the last couple of whatever decades or a decade before that and it was this uh scientific calculator which had 100 bytes of memory and uh and that memory was all that you had for data and for code and it was really cool as i kind of was reading some magazines and trying to and it didn't have any uh it only had ram so you switch it on you have to type in their the codes and then you run it and it does their calculation and people were actually still building some little games on that right and their inventiveness of kind of building stuff you know in 100 bytes of machine codes that kind of that fascinated me and it was so cool to to kind of learn about that and try to play with that and whatnot oh i remember doing the same thing in math class with my like ti 84 and and everyone who was bored in math class would figure out that like you could make like the different patterns by putting numbers in you press enter and you would see it scroll and you can make like yeah you make little little mazes and i don't know how many bytes of memory that ti 84s had but that was that was my introduction it was definitely just an entertainment tool for kids that were bored in math class yeah and you know also my curiosity always kind of then pushed me to explore okay so this is how it works interesting now what happens if i press all of these buttons what happens when i do this what happens when you know it says it's like there's no more memory but then i try to put the other comment you know stuff like that so like i got really interested into the concept of what is now known as hacking right but basically trying to okay so here's a complex system that does what it's supposed to do now what can we do with it that it's not supposed to do would you say that like computers resonated with you particularly or were you just a normal like you know teenage boy that gets fascinated by gadgets did you have any particular residents there were no gadgets around me you know yeah like in the soviet union like you know first of all so i grew up in like in their end of 70s and then the 80s right so very few gadgets again you like soviet union was extremely poor compared to the west uh and access to this kind of stuff was extremely limited and maybe accessible to the elite so so computers were the most i mean i only got access to them when i was in my teenage years and uh they were really hard to get access to and they fascinated me with their level of complexity you know mm-hmm and so you went to school for uh computer science or cybernetics yeah yeah computer science what's something that has like a long complex name like you know software vacations for computer systems whatever and then you what was your like first job out of school or or career path that that you got out of that the very first job i it was i was a software engineer actually in a bank in a bank huh nice and then where in this story did you uh meet vitalik's mom uh in the university yeah what was she studying same thing same thing yeah ah ah okay so we had we had two two computer nerds meet because of computers huh yeah and you know at that age computers have fun but then also oh what about blues and sex and whatnot yeah that's fascinating too blues huh but was blue russia no booze oh booze oh i thought okay can you can you tell me that story of how you met vitale's mom well it was just she was in my class you know like and then exactly how it unfolded you know it's really hard to remember that it was uh you know whatever 30 plus years ago yeah interesting interesting um so when one of one of the reasons why i was asking about computers is because like i would imagine when vitalik was growing up when if you plopped him in front of a computer he would just like magnet like gravitate right right towards it would you say that was true yeah totally right and you know also for many parents we kind of we end up trying to live our dreams through our kids right you know like when we were kids there were still things that were somehow not able to do and get access to right and you know then you buy all these lego sets and it's part of you really wants to play with them it's like oh no it's for my kid because it's also hard for you to admit that big part of you just wants to play with that too right so when vidalia was growing up i'm like oh man i really when i was younger i really wish that i had access to computers uh so then this kid seems to be really smart so let's put a computer in front of him and let's see what he does with that right so and i think like from an age of whatever it was four or five he got extremely curious and interested in playing with computers and you know you know that old ibm pc that we gave him so feel free to just not answer any question that becomes too personal but how how soon after you met vitalik's mom did you guys have vitalik i mean we met in 89 in the university right and vitalik was born in 94. okay and so by the time vitalik was born and was actually like a functional being that could actually play with a computer where computers computers are far more accessible at that point than when you were a kid yeah sure right and so you guys just had one in the home yeah we had an old ibm pc and you know we now had access to computers and even you know can you imagine laptops you know for personal use so then like okay but computers were still considered to be extremely valuable uh and rare and expensive uh so we just uh kind of had the an old one that we gave to him to explore and play with what what could you do on that computer like what were some of the what would you do were there games no not really um i mean very few but excel actually there was microsoft office installed on that and he loved excel because it was such a diverse tool you know because initially he was not interested in like excel as such but in excel then you could draw circles and you can fill them with color you can draw lines i mean you can do all kinds of stuff draw and whatever but very quickly he also got interested in actual excel functions and then like okay you put because he learned about numbers very early on and you know math was kind of obsession and joy for him right so and once he figured oh i can put a number here and then here and then for functions and stuff like that then he got really fascinated with just doing stuff within excel doing functions and whatnot and and later on when he was maybe i'm guessing maybe around seven the kind of the first programming language that are also easily accessible on that old computer that was using uh was visual basic uh for you know build uh visual basic for applications which was built into microsoft office and uh that was kind of the first thing that i was uh teaching him a little bit that's funny because people often one of the most salient metaphors i've heard about ethereum lately came out of the uh tim ferriss podcast with naval and he illustrated ethereum as just like a global excel sheet that we all can like write to and you're telling me vitalik's first two like things about him was his obsession with math and his tinkering with excel yeah that's that's awesome that's awesome you can just extrapolate that right right into the future so obviously everyone in ethereum holds vitalik with you know an insane amount of regard and obviously he like invented ethereum so odd there's some some history of of incredibleness about uh to vitalik but but when when in vitalik's like uh childhood did you would you say was the first inclination that this kid was different or special in any way what was it was it obvious or was it every child is different than special right and you know in different ways and uh and every child then they have their own peculiarities and quirks and struggles but i mean his uh uh him being very smart and you know learning very easily was pretty obvious but i don't know like three years old right like i learned to read i think around three and a half years of age and i think that vitalik i i don't really recall but he probably learned to read before that like you know maybe he was around three so kind of when you see that uh child is really taken into this abstract notions of symbols first for reading and then for math you know then it becomes kind of quite obvious that okay so it looks like his brain is really enjoying exploring those kind of concepts and you know when he was uh say six and he was playing with lego sets and uh he was not building like castles and whatnot but he was like oh i built a six and here's a five and then there were some kind of uh animated uh some kind of special digital animals and whatnot and so it was again like he was playing with math but also not just in his head but through the physical world and uh dimitri i know you're really big into the concept of spirituality and mindfulness and meditation when did that come and become a part of your life um the evolution of this i think it was like again i had always had this innate energy of curiosity right so for me first as a child it was expressed in my desire to learn science and math and physics and stuff and whatever and then computers right and then eventually kind of then curiosity is like okay what kind of other objects are there in the world and then okay humans obviously some of uh very common and extremely complex objects and like oh how do humans work and i got interested in the subject of uh personal development and things like that right and then eventually psychology and then through that eventually uh it was sam harry so i know if you're familiar with the name but kind of he's the guy whose book finally kind of got me into this whole if you will spirituality direction because also i had lots of resistance to that like uh growing up uh a lot one huge aspect of uh soviet propaganda was that uh religion is uh is bad that bad and uh so anything in that whole space you know religion and spirituality for me i consider that to be in this whole space and i was like oh no this is kind of bad stupid you know useless stuff so let's kind of not go there and kind of sam harris uh he read his book and then that kind of really helped me to find a different perspective on that do you know when you wrote uh read that book yeah i well i mean approximately it was probably when i was about maybe 40 years old so like let's say nine years ago nine or seven years ago maybe yeah okay so i mean i wrote a bunch of stuff before that so you know and i tried you know i love reading and i still do uh and i always read a lot of stuff uh and i tried reading stuff about you know meditation and buddhism and whatnot and uh and back you know before his book most of the stuff was kind of really hard for me to read but then eventually when i overcame this you know now i can talk to anybody about any kind of religion about god about whatever you want to talk to me right because i can kind of map the concepts that they use to my own understanding of the universe if you will so would you say that like when you discovered mindfulness uh and meditation and this realm of the universe which i find particularly fascinating and i also credit sam harris is kind of like being my guide into this world as as well uh would you say that like you were already inclined uh to be a mindful person like maybe you are already mindful even though you didn't really hadn't yet been introduced to the concept or would you say that this was like a brand new concept that you found fascinating that you had to like start from scratch with well mindfulness is just like one of their aspects branches of that whole space if you will so mindfulness specifically was not not a huge aspect of that space for me and i would not call myself a mindful person i was really very much in my thinking had in my analytical brain you know thinking about stuff and whatnot okay so so here here's what i've been trying to weave together for like the past like 50 minutes is because like this podcast is called layer zero uh we these these crypto economic networks are made up of humans uh you you raised the human that made this ethereum thing that we all are a community a part of and and you know sorry to interrupt right but he has not made it by himself right yes and i have absolutely made vitalik on my own right yeah really important aspect of this right because again vitalik is who he is because of so many aspects and humans and other factors right and you know and then ethereum is also is uh where is because of so many other people collaborating on that yeah absolutely yeah and i i and just to that's 100 right is like nothing is made in a silo but what i find what i find fascinating is that like generally the ethereum community at large i think it would be accurate to say is largely a uh it's a very inclusive community very friendly and i think as you get closer and closer to the core of the ethereum developers the people that are actually writing the code you find that to become more and more true uh and so like uh i i know people like carl flores who i just talked to from optimism and uh just another other agreement the circle of people that i think vitalik kind of like associates and hangs out with all kind of share the same sort of inclusion um zen-ness mindfulness about the world and i see that like instantiated in ethereum and so i've always been fascinated and one of the reasons why i wanted to to lead layer zero with you is that there's this relationship between some mindfulness in my in my opinion which in promotes inclusivity which actually dictates uh some of how we actually build this system uh because the ethereum is what maybe maybe the word mindfulness is not the best label for this yeah maybe mindfulness for me is kind of like is really about being uh deeply immersed in your perceptions connected with them and whatnot including new emotions your perceptions and vitalik is not quite that and you know i and i'm i'm not that too you know to some degree but i would call the energy that you're describing differently you know and the most simplistic term for this is kindness but also you can talk about acceptance and compassion right and i do know that when this whole ethereum thing was story and a bunch of people who are not even usually named as a official co-founders right but i know that what they were talking about is that uh they wanted to create a community that would be that would be inclusive that you know would be built on the foundation of like being open and having a dialogue and stuff like that right and again like people who have met vitalik who has spoken to him they can sense that energy of kindness and acceptance in him right and you know that's that's kind of uh this is a very powerful energy can we all all of us humans we're really drawn to that a hundred percent and i think the reason why i was using the term the word mindfulness is because to me if you practice mindfulness you become kind right you become uh or and you can appreciate the perspective of others like you get more empathy uh you become more inclusive and so maybe that's why i was using using the word mindfulness right right well and you know what that energy of you will kindness and compassion i know that in my human being that always has been a very strong energy and kind of being mindful or you know different mindfulness methods and practices that kind of help me or you know they probably contributed then to that energy being developed right and again vitalik because of uh the unique uh combination of attributes and him as a human being again their intellect for sure right but then also again he's a very sensitive person he's also very kind and compassionate person right and you know those kind of things like you know they are some of the important energies that you can sense on him absolutely absolutely um one thing i'd like to ask you is how would you define spirituality because to me everyone kind of defines it differently yeah exactly right like you know the work doesn't mean that much but but what does it mean to you like in general you know i like labels don't mean much to me right but for me uh spirituality is uh if you will investigation and sensitivity to well investigation of uh some of the most fundamental questions about uh ourselves like what we are what is this kind of what is uh consciousness and stuff like that who's in charge where is all of this coming from right so spirituality for me is the whole space so when people investigate that and there are many different avenues from many different practices from whatever meditation to mushrooms to lsd to chanting and drums and sweat lodges and whatnot right people investigate that and there's uh also you know philosophers and writers so so many ways people tackle that but really they trying to kind of hear the most fundamental questions of who we are and where this whole thing is going and what does it all mean hey guys i hope you're enjoying the show in the second half of the show i actually revisit the conversation of consciousness and mindfulness meditation and acceptance in a different context to finish off the conversation with dimitri and i relate it to his experiences with communism and kind of talk about the differences between some sort of universal coherence which is what communism is trying to produce and some sort of universal platform about what ethereum is trying to produce and how that relates to the individual as well as a few other questions like how often dimitri checks the eath price and his favorite workout regimen so hope you're enjoying the conversation uh before we get to the second half of the show we need to talk about the fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha dot x-y-z xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless do you think ethereum is relevant to the concept or topic of spirituality so topic of spirituality again if i think about this as asking those the most important questions right and when you ask those questions it also takes you away from judgments like oh things should be this way right then like you develop sensitivity like okay so where things are and then instead of judging situations then you kind of start observing and then when you observe then you actually develop what people refer to as intuition right it's uh kind of when your limited analytical mind instead of kind of trying to extrapolate very few little details into like oh i know what it is but instead when you develop more and more sensitivity to this high level patterns then you see oh you know here are all the different patterns you know that are happening in the world you can also see this as the space as the universe is doing so many experiments you know look at the us they run one experiment with trump okay now there is another experiment with joe biden right russia is currently running totally different experiment and kind of if you look at this uh from this perspective you can see that yeah the universe has been running a bunch of very if you will authoritarian experiments in the whatever last few hundred years if you will and uh and they seems to have been failing right it also tried to do this i mean collectivist experiments which kind of ended up being really the same thing you know just in the disguise they're authoritarian so it sounds to me that uh their answer of the universe their concentration of power and fragility uh is uh is not really working out in in in in life if you will right so ethereum is that uh technological uh experiment that the universe is running that very much corresponds to the findings that the humanity has their insights their humanity has developed or over a long time about what works and what doesn't right because and there are many different aspects to this but even like if you compare ethereum to bitcoin right again bitcoin is very strong it's trying to be very strong and simple right and there's a lot of power in simplicity and this confidence like we're perfect never going to change this is it and you know it's amazing like this attracts a lot of like people who wants to feel this energy of confidence and safety and whatnot but life life will never be safe you know like you know and any kind of like one analogy i'll give it to you right many people one aspect of a human journey is like many people started as victims so you know here's me i'm weak i'm small the universe is doing stuff to me then people move on to this uh achiever position like oh no i can do stuff i can be disciplined i can achieve stuff i can be strong and it's an awesome phase but it's by far not the final phase because however strong you are end up you know there will be storms in life that will mess you up you know people close to you will get sick and die things will happen you will lose money whatever right so being strong and just trying to resist everything is a very limited strategy you know like at long term it always breaks right so ethereum is a different kind of experiment if you will for me it's more reflective of uh what life has found uh actually worked kind of long term it's a much softer open and resilient system the system that keeps evolving right like talking about monetary policy talking about so many other things right and and those systems they are i think longer term will uh prove themselves to be much more aligned with how the flow of uh life unfolds right so can i have those very long answer right but you know if i try to summarize it right so spirituality that investigation of what life is what we are uh eventually leads us to see their interconnectedness of things and you know their fluidity their openness of all the systems right and and for me ethereum is very much aligned with what we as a humanity as the universe have been kind of finding uh over this millennia of existence are you familiar with the uh political compass i'm not so you have it's like a it's four quadrants yeah yeah i mean yeah yeah left right authoritarian libertarian want to run this idea by you and see if it resonates um to me bitcoin is has a specific point somewhere on the political compass and like where it actually is on the political compass is not not the point i'm trying to make the point i'm trying to make is that it actually has one specific point you can like point to it as like bitcoin has the political leanings of of this and it's right here on the on the political compass yeah to me ethereum is the landscape of the political compass and it can be built to reflect anything that humans value and we can as humanity we can push it towards a side of the political compass that we desire and it can also optimize for different parts on the political compass and so when you tell me like ethereum is supposed to be this like more abstract level uh updating protocol that reflects the people that compose it i see a landscape that humans can come and tinker with and experiment with and like you said we've been experimenting with authoritarianism for the past few hundred years uh it's both worked and not worked we are now like for the past hundred years we've been experimenting with like democracy or maybe a little bit longer than that and that has its drawbacks and now we have this like ethereum thing which is like this technocratic like political fabric thing that allows different people to do different things on it and if that thing works if that experiment works then it exists as an application on ethereum how does how does that like illustration land with you yeah i like that right you know and uh also in that model that you describe that's it's also borrowless right which is fascinating because for the first time in their life people you know the democracy again one of their key limitations of that is like you end up with this polarity it's like okay this guy is good and then you know this half of people are pissed off and no our guy has won now you know this half of people has pissed off imagine that if uh it could have been different that's you know let's say that this guy has elected then everybody who has opposed them well they can fork their own country right and they can run forward with their own experiment and whatever right that's not possible in uh existing model of what countries are right but ethereum creates this kind of environment when we can experiment with much more fluid models right and back to kind of what you have described as you know about the political compass model right uh so yes ethereum if you will it uh develo you know uh every time we humans we like models we develop models right and we build the model and we say stuff is here right and it's fine it's a lot of fun it's interesting but the thing is like every model will eventually break down because it will not be able to embed everything right you know you work on all of this physics and then quantum mechanics develop quantum mechanics and like oh man you know things are totally different than you know what we the way we're thinking about them and in their similar fashion like we have this political compass model but then ethereum's model is more inclusive okay let's take all of this and like actually you can be and many all of these points at the same time at the same time right so it's a very different model and it's actually quite similar to well again the model of a human development the human mind you know you have we constantly try to develop models and we have our models but then the world doesn't feed all models and then we struggle no things should be different you know we know how it is well but the universe doesn't care it's like you know  you you know this is how the way things are and then eventually we develop models that kind of more inclusive right so for me again ethereum is very much aligned with that overall movement in the universe that's okay we develop more and more inclusive models of of the world they're more all in campus that's that's fascinating as someone who has experienced you know communist russia and then you moved to i believe canada which is you know very very different yeah how how do you think this the ethereum will unfold upon the world using this like perspective right this perspective of new organizational new organization systems like in the sky how is how is the people of the world going to behave differently if it if they all if we all become organized by ethereum more than our nation state yeah i i really there are many dimensions to this like one of the dimensions which i really love is uh an aspect of uh any human anywhere in the world can get involved in the world economy right and you know nobody can censor their access to information nobody can censor the ability to contribute to participating in the economy right and you know again it's not ideal and many states will try to do that but eventually they will fail you know that's what we see so that's kind of one aspect of this um i had another thought which kind of slipped my mind uh about this but yeah i guess that's kind of one of their key considerations for me absolutely um when did you move to uh you did move to canada from russia to canada right when did that happen yeah uh 21 years ago 21. okay oh so and you moved with vitalik and vittalma has been really really young yeah he was uh six okay so he did most of his growing up in canada pretty much yeah yeah do do you see any i mean it probably came through through you if at all but do you see any sort of like the fact that you know vitalik was born in communist russia first six years of his life and then and then moved to canada do you see any of the fact that he was born in communist russia like uh part of his person today i don't think so because again like uh uh by the time he left he never even attended any kind of uh you know kindergarten so any kind of public institutions so his environment was really family you know his mom myself their parents of his mom they made a huge impact on him um so it was really just family environment that kind of shaped him there and then when he moved here and he started going to kindergarten and then to school and all of that so uh so uh he was never really exposed to what russia or soviet union is yeah okay what directly you know obviously you know through people around here right right um one thing that's been uh fascinating for me to uh to watch is and i i don't really know vitalik all that well like i've you know interviewed him a number of times but it's it's a very different dynamic than just hanging out with the person but one thing i've noticed is that like his social like tactiness has gotten like really really sharp in the last like few years like people used to think vitalik was kind of like this socially awkward kid but but he's actually i think can make some of the most witty like jokes and has some of just like the the best like social skills i've seen in in the crypto space have you followed how do you how have you seen like vital kind of like develop this this whole like social side of him um it was really interesting to watch that right because uh also there are many different it's a non-linear process right and yeah you know he really expanded that when he went to high school right and then in his uh in the last whatever it is now six seven years of his life that is a theorem that also has been changing right because again we human beings we constantly learn as we interact with the environment and also like my perspective for him is obviously different because also i know that i mean he has an amazing sense of humor and we we laugh at the same kind of stupid joke so we resonated with him on stupid jokes if you will uh but he was obviously in the environment of family in france he always he's much more open and relaxed because also partially to due to his sensitivity right to people's energies and emotions and stuff like that and his own that when he's in the public environment and you know his mind gets so much you know input and can be very stressful for him you know and when when you stress then kind of your mind takes over and you become kind of more constricted or whatever right but you know again we constantly learn right and you know as you as our systems get used to being in those environments more and more they kind of stop going into this kind of fight-or-flight mode and and eventually then can a more of our natural energies they they come out more and more and i think this can this is kind of what you've seen right so i'm saying that kind of what you are seeing like i've seen this you know that that's the vitalik i know but and i'm happy that that people get to know more and more of all of those uh awesome sides of things so when uh vitalik was traveling the world in like 2013 2014 trying to get support for this ethereum thing uh as a parent like what did you think that it was crazy at the time or like what were your thoughts about like your your son like traveling around the world like cause i there's the number of times i've heard of stories of people talking about how like oh yeah vitalik pitched me this ethereum thing i wish i had invested but i didn't and he like slept on the floor of the bitcoin embassy like it's all these these stories keep on uh cropping up so as a parent before we all knew what ethereum was that it was going to be this massively successful thing what was it like to watch your son like fly fly around the world and trying to garner support for this uh like you know unprecedented project yeah it's you know when he came home and he said that you know what guys i'm thinking of uh dropping out of the university it was actually interesting that you know all three of us you know me his mom and his stepmom you know he lived with me and his stepmom with you or my second wife we were all excited for him because uh we we felt that okay you know what vitalik will keep learning and you know his future will be bright no matter what but also i'm a big believer in that you know academic environment is awesome for academic knowledge but you know life is so much more than the knowledge right and i was excited for him to actually be exposed to so much more stuff right and then he traveled and he was writing this long emails to to us with updates and it was really fascinating to kind of watch his journey unfold and you know him doing all these different things and then storing the staying at this anarchist commune and califu in spain and whatnot and and i was really excited for him to get exposure to that right because again we humans we grow in a certain environment and we you know that becomes our baseline and we think okay you know what like we expect everybody to be more or less the same right and can this is pretty well off and it's a pretty open you know uh peaceful polite society and whatnot right but the world is different there's a lot of poor priority there's a lot of other stuff so i was really excited for him to kind of get more exposure to all of these different aspects of the world and uh and and he did right you know when he was writing his email updates like oh you know what and here we sometimes get one meal a day oh yeah and you know the only fruit that accessible to me is lemons oh yeah and you know we i have to sleep on this mattress on the floor it's like oh that's really cool right so you know that actually life is not just you know sleeping in this comfortable bed and a comfortable place in a comfortable country there are many other ways that people exist and let's be let's like knowing that and also knowing that you yourself can exist in many different environments is really uh important right so yeah that was exciting to see that and i mean i also have to say that at the time like i wish i i would have died i could have dived more into what he was involved but i was busy building my own businesses and things like that right so can i was watching on site was what was happening and i i still remember you know how he showed to me his first version of whatever version of the white paper i believe it was october 2013 and it was really cool to kind of read through this like oh this feels like something really big right so did you did you when vitalik was doing this tour to to get like you know ethereum support how when you were paying attention to it how much was it like you following your kid around the world and just seeing those updates versus you understanding that this ethereum thing is about to be massive did you even at all know how big ethereum was going to be or had any sort of inclination as to like what the matter is no clue i had no clue i mean it felt to me like a pretty exciting initiative project if you will and i was also trying to kind of uh import if you will might think you know hey you guys you can organize in this way and how do you communicate how do you do this and that and vitalik was not really receptive to that and like you know what i totally understand that as a young adult he has to go his own way right like you know and uh and for me i ended up also kind of learning a lot from watching this whole initiative unfold because again as a entrepreneur right and i was for most of my life and career was more exposed to more hierarchical structures right and only in the last four or five years of my life and business career kind of i really got exposed to and we actually transformed our business into a non-hierarchical structure right so for me to kind of watch how things are done in this very fluid very much the open source community it was fascinating right it's uh i didn't have that strong reaction i think it was fred wilson who was beret and vitalik that no you should be kind of moving fast and higher in this right but that's not it's like you know it's how you try to evaluate fish if you tell them hey guys you suck because you cannot climb the tree okay but you you know and uh a monkey can well can can a monkey swim in the ocean right so for me to kind of watch that and learn from from that and getting to appreciate their very different uh you know actually that their approach the structure of the community is uh have to correspond to the structure the concept the uh thinking behind the initiative that you're doing right so because of what they were doing the way they were doing it actually was if you will a much better match for this than some kind of like hierarchical structural or you know rigid uh rigid structure kind of trying to move this forward as fast as possible and whatnot i remember uh just seeing you walk by at youth denver i think 2020 but it might have been 2019. um and i if you were uh walking who i can only presume was vitalik's mom i'm assuming and i just had this this moment it's like oh that's like that's vitalik's parents at this denver conference which is this massive like 6 000 person conference that is all completely here because of this ethereum thing and like i completely uprooted my life because of ethereum and i know anthony cesano uprooted his life because of ethereum do you ever like what what is that like to like witness and think about when you're at these conferences and like everyone is here because of this like you know this white paper that your kid like went on a journey around the world with to help promote and then just garnered enough support to turn this into a massive ecosystem like this must be a crazy perspective to have yeah it's really fascinating to kind of watch that it's like this huge organism you know you you observing like how it was kind of you have the privilege of seeing and having this close ex so like oh it's like this just a single cell and you know now it's a little bit more now it's this little embryo and now it's kind of groin and now it's like becoming this you know huge enormous very powerful organism that is evolving and starting to affect you know so much of the society so it's just uh and yeah it's denver and i love that i think that's like for me it's uh uh probably my most uh favorite event in this space and you know the organizers are doing such an awesome job i've been there a few times and definitely coming back so yeah for me just kind of watching that this this is like an with a huge fascination if you will there uh and gratitude and appreciation for oh wow this is uh this whole thing is unfolding right you know um for me it's like part of the nature part of the universe one really fun and enormous aspect of this uh again that i had the privilege to be kind of able to watch closely are you ever uh fearful for vitalik safety i'm not fearful stuff happens right and i don't mean to sound colors but me being fearful for his safety will not help his safety at all right and uh like it can be difficult and i still recall uh i think it was four years ago when i was coming back from uh i was on this uh retreat in europe and i was coming back and just on the day later that i was coming back and i just flew from europe and uh this uh piece of fake news was published that vitalik was you know dead in a car accident i'm like okay that was pretty intense can i to like observe that and you know i was not too scared because something about this article didn't quite kind of feel right to me and then eventually after i was able to reach kind of metallic in asia and actually before that when i was actually able to do some google searches and find some stuff about this but it was still scary right and you know but again this is life right and uh end of the day uh fears we human beings will experience fear and the only answer to that is like of course we will try to do what is possible and i know the vitalik is a smart guy and when we talk uh he shares some of the ways that kind of he's trying to stay safe and i can i try to mention to him some of the tips and ideas and you know when the conference was in mexico can i we're trying to be mindful of that but then end of the day you take the precautions you take the actions the fear might still be there so all you can do is just to face it fear and keep moving forward right and for me is uh looking at ethereum now right uh i can you know vitalik has always been very focused on not being not kind of like if you're having less and less uh dependence on him as a single kind of human being as a linchpin and i think that has changed a lot you know since the beam of ethereum and uh it'll keep changing right there are all these amazing people doing all of this really cool things from communication to development to foundation and this and you guys you know all of this right so really this mechanism is much less dependent on him so uh while i hope and wish for with alex's long health and whatnot also uh for me it's very gratifying to see that ethereum community is much much less dependent on that particular human being totally question for you uh oh i guess you're on a podcast so these are all questions for you but uh how how often do you check the eat price um every day a bunch of times yeah i mean like when it goes down they're like oh my god it's painful right not so much for like uh what it is it's like because also you can see that when the price goes down then a lot of people that came into it it affects their mood and whatnot on the other hand also as you have watched in the last whatever long time is that when the price is frothy and it goes up then there's a lot of kind of noise and this space and all kinds of people get attracted you know when it goes down there's still lots of passionate people building stuff right so i know that by itself it doesn't mean anything this is just kind of right one of the fun little things you can look at still as a human being when it goes up it's like yeah you know it's more like uh it's not about the price itself but for me if you will it's an indicator is the world is finally understanding their enormity of what is happening are they finally appreciating this right and when the price goes up it's like yeah the world is finally appreciating what is being done what has been built when it goes down it's like yeah hey guys you know can you not really get what is happening you know so kind of that kind of vibe how's weightlifting going uh very poorly since meaning that you know all the gyms have been closed in toronto for like i thought you had a gym outside outside of wherever you live i don't no i mean i have a friend you know who has a gym and sometimes so i was able to attend his place and they have some kettle bells but actually my number one exercise for the last year and a half has been walking yeah you know that's vitalik's favorite exercise too so yeah yeah no i at some point a couple weeks into covid i just realized that i had nothing left other than to just go walk uh and so so much so much of my day was like working on bankless for the first like two thirds of the day and then i would just like immediately just like start walking and and not really know where i was going and that was my exercise during covet too what kind of lifts do you like to do you like to do compound lifts right i'm a big believer in free weights you know just because again i've been training you know i grew up my natural uh uh makeup is the same as vitalik's kind of being tall and very thin and uh as a i was this nerdy little kid who was bullied and like oh i want to get bigger so can i i found this outlet for for myself so i've been exercising since i was uh 17. um and over this time i learned that uh free weights are kind of the best versus all the fancy machines and kind of heavy free weights all the basic lifts like uh squats dead lifts you know uh max max squat uh i have a record somewhere i don't frankly record recall that like maybe 350 pounds something oh 350. oh that's pretty good dude that's way more than i've ever gotten to pretty i'm pretty sure uh for for what is right for what is where the danny ryan's record i think is uh right around 300 so you're you're beating danny ryan so who in the uh in the ethereum world do you like quote unquote hang out with like do you or do you have like group chats that you're in because like everyone who's deep in ethereum they got telegram groups there and they've got discord channels they're in are you part of that world no i'm not like in general i find like i i try to avoid group chats because there's so much noise and i kind of prefer one-on-one conversations they can be pretty quick they can go very deeply but for me that's kind of preference when you can really connect with one person and sometimes it can be you connect with them once or twice a year but it's a real human deep connection not like some superficial noisy thing uh it's like you know even in my last business that i sold we used slack as a communication tool and i was always like you know what guys i don't want to be in that because a lot of this is just short-term noise and kind of my mind tends to to work more longer-term kind of slower strategic thinking if you will the the world of 2020 has been a very like chaotic tumultuous place what are you paying attention to in like the macro world that's like outside of crypto and ethereum and in bitcoin like are you someone that consumes the news and pays attention to what's going on in the macro world uh i try not to like you know and actually uh about 20 years ago i stopped watching the news right and i i never kind of i don't have a tv or cable stuff like that i have a tv for watching movies but i never watch like actual tv programming right and that's been very uh peaceful for me and i also don't know that well i mean twitter is kind of my current preferred social media hangout place and i know that whatever is important uh then uh that will be mentioned and you know i'll kind of know what's happening uh just because of uh my historical roots you know part of me i'm still watching the events unfolding and russia and uh around russia like in belarussia and it's some crazy stuff there right but generally speaking uh my main interest interests if you will in life as uh and beyond the basics of being human you know end of the day there is nothing more important than that but you know the crypto space decentralized tech space it resonates with me a lot and then if you will this whole spirituality space but i would not even call that spirituality for me specifically personally like non-duality is kind of like this is where what resonates with me the most so can i thinking about that stuff thinking about crypto stuff and then just you know living the human life you know supporting my kids my friends you know being involved in some business initiatives and stuff like that i do for a bit of like mentoring and coaching and and sometimes certain business matters sometimes it's really like helping peop people figure out that questions like what is god what is love what is happiness and so uh when when you're just hanging out in your own time on your own terms where does your mind wander off to where does it go it's really i would say kind of this whole question of what am i what is consciousness says you know that's there and it's a question that is it's impossible to figure out uh if you will analytically but that's kind of one of their topics that really if you will the most complicated topic for any human to dive into and uh and the topic where you can never kind of dream to find their precise eventual answer but that gives me that's a lot of fun for me to explore on myself and sometimes you know also with some close friends as you've gone down the path of trying to answer the unanswerable question of what am i how is that how has that changed how you act in the world uh it really if you will as we go down that road and we realize that that the infinite nature of a human being with all of the different parts you know because typically a human being lives with that uh story about themselves i am this and i have these reactions maybe i am shy maybe i'm this maybe that right and there are there are lots of judgments in that you know like this is the way i am and this is the way it should be all kinds of stuff but when as their this whole thinking judgment gets replaced by a process of you know being curious and sensitive to what is then you realize oh yeah me is a human which has this side and that side and this and you know like i have my curiosity and i have this and i have this like desire to know and then i have this desire to be perceived as knowledgeable and the and the fun thing is like you know those aspects of ourselves that we don't quite like i mean we try to resist and we kind of we you either don't see them or we like i have to fix this this is the wrong part of me the more we resist those parts of ourselves the more kind of theirs you know we've been stuck in them but when we eventually if you will surrender to them like oh yeah so here's me here's kind of like stuff that is going through me and you know whether i like it or not they actually kind of dissolve and if you will more natural energies of a human being come into play and you know they're the same for all human beings you know love compassion and joy and having fun and playing and trying to create and trying to support other human beings you know they all foundational it's just like you know when our mind is stops interfering and trying to also like oh i don't like to be this way well you are this way maybe kind of your sexual human being maybe you're a human being who kind of wants to feel important whatever it is right whatever you try to deny will kind of keep being this you know compulsive side of you but when you stop denying that then it just kind of parts of life that flow through you mm-hmm the the there's a thought in the world of like mindfulness and meditation maybe it's one of the more like sci-fi crazy thoughts but like if everyone starts doing this we can all start to like kind of break down the the borders between humans and and like minds can kind of mesh a little bit because if you can maximally understand who you are you can actually like start to dissociate from yourself it's like oh i am a human and i'm standing next to another human and like if you can just have like maximum levels of just empathy and uh separation from who you are as an individual you can start to like kind of like uh where am i trying to go with this um there's this concept of like a universal consciousness right like a universal being like some people some people call me it's not the concept that's kind of my if you will understanding of what we are right and uh this evolution of human mind and this investigation of what we are again human mind is basically a collection of models and one of the most important models that we have is model of our cells right and kind of we're constantly trying to build better models right and they realize oh here's me but then i'm affected by this and you know this becomes part of my model and actually at some point there are borders that your mind has created about here's me and here's not me that border actually becomes very diffuse and kind of when that model of yourselves becomes very enmeshed with their model of what the rest of this that's kind of that's uh that's the natural progression if you will of human consciousness so that's exactly kind of uh again like with that model of in the universe then it makes much more sense like things that kind of when you're supporting somebody like that's all part of this whole interconnected global whole it's not like you're doing this because you want to be good but it's like okay we are this and uh we own all of this together kind of thing how did but how does that isn't that kind of very similar to what communism is trying to achieve not as far as i understand that right and the communism is really like uh one aspect of communism is trying to deny individuality and capitalism and whatnot kathleen is bad individualism is bad but you see in my mind any kind of initiative any kind of attempt of trying to move forward by denying something like this is bad we will do something good it doesn't work you know uh and actually ethereum was not built from the energy you know there's some bad stuff we're going to build something that's going to fix stuff it's more like oh wow let's this sounds like an interesting idea it's very complicated probably will not even work but if we can make it work oh look at this exciting possibilities right so it's a very different energy when you're trying to oppose something like you know down with capitalism done with this and that like from that energy like actually that perpetuates conflict right but you know from the energy of like moving forward like oh let's have fun let's try to create let's try to create more joy for ourselves and others right there's much it's much much more powerful and the economy is not that common is really built very much on denial and violence you know those are bad and and also simplistic answers you know sure and i i completely take your point and at some point like that and at a very early point this metaphor breaks down but i think you can take my point in the sense that well communism is trying to break down the barriers between the people that compose the system right like we are all the same we are all in this together we are one unified party trying to go for one unified goal and so so to me like and to your point absolutely the way that communism manifests in the real world it has to do that by like denying and violence and coercion and totalitarianism but the goals are kind of the same and so like you know spirituality and and mindfulness and and meditation is all trying to break down the borders between humans but i think it's also fascinating that like a kind of communism is trying to also do that inside of its own domain yeah and i see a point and you know the way to think about this is like as uh we develop more sensitivity and we have this deeper model of what we are but this structure within ourselves you know the ego that kind of still kind of is constantly trying to like uh come up with like no this is me i'm separate i'm in control i know so it constantly kind of usurps you know takes over all of our learning about this stuff and that's why a lot of people who go into spirituality they end up like with this new huge spiritual ego like no this is the right way it's like you should not be eating meat you should be meditating whatever blah blah blah and you know i have this i have this wonderful state and this is why i'm so much better than you are right and the same with communist like maybe the original concept was good i like it's hard for me to kind of the communism that i studied i did not feel that in there but maybe because it was kind of perverted because also if you even if you look into christianity right the christian religion is i see this as a really mostly  versus their original insights of the founder kind of they're an amazing you know uh insight into what humanity is right so like again the eager immediately comes into play and this concept of gets perverted immediately right so so that's kind of what i'm seeing do you see ethereum as like a possible vehicle to march towards universal cons consciousness is that a crazy question i don't really see that connection it's a it's an awesome technological tool you know and also it's a foundational platform for uh humans to poor like-minded to connect and do all of this stuff and again universal consciousness it's not something that you do or you build or whatever again like as soon as you think that this is some kind of result you achieve that's already again like your ego has taken over because the ego wants to to know it wants to do it wants to move forward but in fact the more you recognize that this is kind of what life is what is the actual reality then from this perspective then you can keep moving forward and building stuff and having fun so the the reason why i ask is because there's an inherent like dynamic on ethereum where like you are 100 enabled to become your own individual right like you have your own ethereum address you can have your own ens name you can have your own nft avatar you are your own individual but if you define your but if individual individuality becomes defined by like your address on ethereum or you're just like footprint on ethereum well now if that if your ethereum becomes maximally successful and defines the whole if the fabric of ethereum just blankets the whole globe well now all humans are defining who they are on top of the same universal fabric and so it's individual individuality which is expressed on the same in the same protocol and in the same social layer right and so to me that interconnects all of us yes sure yeah and so that and so like maybe asking like oh can aetherium get make us universally consciousness conscious is a absolutely insane question but like to me it seems to be like we were actually taking a step there towards universal cooperation which maybe is a necessary step to turn into whatever crazy like thing that we can achieve when all of humanity gets on the same page for the first time ever and one other way you can think about this is actually there the energy of ethereum is this kind of open all-inclusive evolving network very much resonates with people whose own perception of the world is already like you know not like it's me versus the universe but it's like it's me and i'm part of this universe so those kind of people they get attracted to ethereum and you know that's kind of just alignment of that kind of uh realizations happening in specific individuals versus like kind of bigger scale systems supporting that you know realization unfolding at a faster pace if you will one one thing i think i find fascinating and i brought this up earlier in the show is like uh vitalik who you know co-creator of ethereum did a very large uh you know role in actually bootstrapping this thing made a bunch of friends that are like-minded as people do they make they find like-minded friends they surround themselves with people that think and value similar things and i and i think of the people that i know vitalik to hang out with like i said carl floresh and the people working on optimism and uh other you know all the cryptographers they all kind of have vitaliks like similar vibe right and so there's this in the deep ethereum community the people that like write the code and do the research and development and you know work at the ef they all kind of have these same values similar values because they're all a bunch of friends and to me i i kind of see ethereum as this technological layer for this group of people that have very clear values to export those values to the rest of the world i think ethereum is actually a way for like um for the these deep ethereum community members who uh you know largely have surrounded vitalik and the other core members of ethereum and they are are instantiating values when they write like the optimistic roll-ups they are choosing specific uh design choices which have specific values that are associated with them and now that these design choices are being adopted by the broader ethereum community these values are being exported to everyone that touches ethereum and so i kind of think like this with the relationship that you have as vitalik's father you know one of two parents and then that well that's just the nature now that that's the nurture but then there's also the nature science of italics of his own person defined by the environment but still regardless like you have had this influence in actually determining the code that we all touch on the internet and that is a a a layer of values that we are all now embedded upon and so i kind of think that the long term legacy of ethereum is to all get all humans on the same value system and that value system is ethereum it's interesting right because also one of their values of this system that ethereum is is uh being inclusive being open to people who have somewhat different values and then also having a dialogue right and then it means that in our community there are people uh we welcome people who have some values who some people might be scared of like for example sexual energy is a very strong energy very few people can have good connection with that right and then somebody like i mean who's an awesome guy right and some people might get scared oh you know what is he doing like you know whatever right or let's say the recent hoopla about uh uh sushi not you know being prioritized lower than uni swap on in optimism okay so now we apparently have some disagreement about values so but the value of the community the overarching value is that let's uh it's uh in the open try to reconcile them and dialogue and move forward right so that's really interesting right so the value if you will of in authoritarian systems then the system kind of tries to become more black and white and you can i can see that in russia for example you know that government and putin is good or it's bad and it's becoming very black and white and you know like for me i really see that as extremely black and then in ethereum it's like yeah you know we have people with all kinds of values and desires and tendencies but then still our foundational thing is like you know how can we still understand and accept them right and for me it's a very important uh aspect of also what being a human is being a human and our compassion towards ourselves doing towards all the sides that we don't might not like in ourselves like oh i should not be this impulsive or it should be you know more kind of whatever it is right but well i am what i am right can i as a community as we can we don't have to deny all these different people with different opinions and somewhat different values but as long as like there is a hierarchy if you will right and again they're at the very low level of this hierarchy is this openness inclusiveness right and for me that's really kind of the most important aspect of ethereum community yeah and i think as you get closer and closer to the core of the ethereum community down down to like the layer zero if you will you'll find that the one of the core values that people have is to value other people's values and that sort of like iterativeness is kind of how there's some sort of like relationship between ethereum and the infinity that keeps on coming up in all these different brandings dimitri yes thank you for coming on uh layer zero and being the first guest i've had a fantastic time just talking about all these different different subjects with you
