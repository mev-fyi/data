if it was only proof of stake in isolation that could work fine for monetary premium if it was just proof of work that could also work fine but it turns out that we have this this competition and so we need to start comparing them we can compare them in terms of economic security this is one of the things that's most mind-boggling for proof of state for example for every hundred dollars of economic security the consensus needs to pay for that and how does it pay for that it pays with issuance and transaction fees and that's about five dollars per year now if you look at proof of work the maintenance cost of a hundred dollars of economic security is roughly a hundred dollars every single year so the the cost is much much higher for much much lower issuance you can have a much much higher economic security and we're already seeing this the beacon chain has 32 billion dollars of incoming security and if you look at bitcoin we have about 10 billion dollars of economic security and this is using like very very fresh numbers
