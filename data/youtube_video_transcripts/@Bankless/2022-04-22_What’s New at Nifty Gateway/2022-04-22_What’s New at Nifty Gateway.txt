you have launched some big changes and made some big announcements recently and i think you may even have some more coming coming up the big top line here is a migration from a custodial platform to i think a hybrid model where you'll have both the custodial and non-custodial piece that's exactly right up until i mean really this week the only way that you could buy and sell stuff on nifty gateway was if you deposited it into a custody wallet that we controlled i think it's very valuable for bringing new people into the space but then once they're started once they know what they're doing then they open their own wallet and they want to trade stuff directly from wallet to wallet so we're really excited to have both of those things under one platform we really sat down and said how can we build a next generation marketplace what that means is that it has 70 lower gas fees than other marketplaces it also means you don't have to pay any gas to cancel listings it's just the beginning i think once users use it they'll realize it's much more advanced much smoother much better ux and it really is just meant to be an evolution of what nft marketplaces can be
