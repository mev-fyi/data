back in 2013 we learned not your keys not your crypto because of Mount gox we haven't learned something like that for a long time as bad as 2018 was there wasn't anything that crazy there it was just like unsustainable business models with icos in 2022 it got bad because we had so many scammers rug us left and right but like the learning lessons is like I think we as an industry will be able to call out the early warning signs and the red flags a lot better now because of the lessons that we've learned in 2022 so I think it is going to be a lot harder to scam this industry and defraud this industry moving forward because we've seen it before we've had it happen to us
