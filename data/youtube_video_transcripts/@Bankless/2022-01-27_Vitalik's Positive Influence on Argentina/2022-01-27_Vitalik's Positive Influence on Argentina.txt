when vitalik was there you turned on the tv in argentina every news show was talking about this guy he's simply an amazing human being he's a monk that travels around the world with his backpack speaking the word you know preaching the truth hey banqus nation we're making a special episode out of the conversation i had with asante siri on the lair zero podcast um santi spoke a lot about vitalik's recent trip to argentina and just had some interesting perspectives as to how argentine society engaged with vitalik who is vitalik in relationship to the whole entire country of argentina or at least what santi saw from from his perspective for those who are unfamiliar with lair zeros it's my joe rogan style podcast which is completely free-flowing and unscripted and just having cultural conversations rather than protocol conversations is how i like to describe it and we unpacked just how crypto is uh unfolding in society and in folding on people's psyches rather than just you know on their ledgers and on their web 3 apps and santi was a fantastic guest who really was able to dive deep into the culture of argentina and how optimistic that he has become as a result of how in argentina has engaged with crypto and this particular show is really just a compilation of the components of that longer episode where santi speaks about vitalik's trip to argentina so let's go into this uh compilation episode of layer zero right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to

uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless if you walk through the streets of buenos aires and actually we did this with vitalik there are some huge slants in the middle of the most wealthy neighborhoods in the city so you have this huge inequality in the country and with vitalik we actually visited one of these slums lamps so he could get a close view of you know how a lot of people live in a country like argentina and not just the tourist version of the country and you see this inequality all over the place there's a five more than five thousand slums where people do not have access to basic goods to basic water to basic uh needs uh they might have you know the youth smartphones and an internet connection uh so the people are connected but like infrastructure is simply not there and sadly the i guess like many populist politicians uh their only solution or the only remedy to address a situation like that is let's just put you know money in their pockets regardless of taking any consideration of how that money is created they just print it and that that populist formula uh you know works for a little while and then in the long run generates this situation of the country losing value significantly and you know it's simply a very tragic consequence because it perpetuates the position people are living in the lack of infrastructure the lack of investment it perpetuates the inequality and it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy so it because the inequality keeps growing people kee you know politicians keep printing and the more they print you know the more the status quo remains it's the same and there's simply it seems to me that at least from the generations above me you know that they go over the country in the past they are simply not able to think outside the box the discussion in argentina has always been shall we agree with the imf and get some u.s dollars to strengthen our currency but get a huge debt and the debt keeps growing with the imf or we give our back to the imf and suddenly we become a pro venezuela pro cuba country uh disconnected from the financial world and you know we try to do the revolution quote unquote and none of these approaches are really you know addressing people's problems addressing the situation from a structural or from a systemic point of view it's just opportunist populist politicians taking advantage and misusing uh public resources uh you know regardless of the ideological sign of who is in charge uh and you know i think that today we have there's a generational change at least the the crypto generation or the online generation let's not call them millennials you know we have the online generation the offline generation the online generation is growing up you know i'm probably one of the oldest members of that generation but there's a lot of kids from you know between 20 and 30 years old that are now suddenly thinking in a much different way about money about the value about you know connected to the world looking you know realizing that argentina is not a special case in the planet that you know we we can certainly think globally and connect with with the world at large and there's a new generation that i hope starts thinking about these issues in a different way i see it in the development front the developer community the soft the hackers the software developers are certainly innovating in a way that has no precedent in the country for the first time there are projects being born in argentina that are global they are not looking at latin america as a market but are actually thinking in global terms uh there's a generation of engineers that have created some of the most successful companies built around ethereum uh thinking about you know crypto and technology uh as a way of addressing some of the challenges that society is facing and you know i recently visited argentina just a few weeks ago for vitalik's trip there and i haven't been there since before the pandemic and it was kind of like suddenly uh getting into a he like back to the futures car and actually traveling to the year 2034 because it really felt very futuristic everyone under 30 years old recognized vitalik in the streets they knew who he was they knew about ethereum they asked him about ethereum 2.0 or you know what is the marriage gonna happen like random people in the streets uh most of them obviously under probably under 30 years old but it's like uh in the pandemic a lot of people suddenly accelerated their uh learning skills about crypto or got into crypto in argentina we have a high inflation capital controls the it's it's illegal to buy u.s dollars even though there's a uh a dark or a black market of it uh and we have a subsidized energy so everyone and their mothers are mining crypto they're having miners at home like uh it's it's almost insane you you see that like in the restaurant where we were with vitalik the waiter came to ask him for a picture the taxi driver asked him things about crypto everyone suddenly vitalik discovered that he has big shagger status in argentina and i think that the pandemic accelerated people learning about this technology the bull market also benefited a lot of people and suddenly there's like i perceive for the first time and using asia in argentina that it's really connected to this stuff in a way that is way more significant than what i see here in spain where i live in spain it's a you know it's the euro comfort zone uh the the state the welfare state works fantastic people live a very secure life they they are everyone is in a comfort level that they are not not that anyone no one is taking any risks in europe uh in spain like very there's very few entrepreneurs very few crypto mines whereas in argentina it's like everywhere you see it in the billboards in the streets there's uh the you know the most important streets are filled with advertisement about crypto startups and crypto companies and it's i feel like the country's like making a leap frog after the pandemic in adoption not only at the developer level which is what i knew but what caught me by surprise is that at the user level uh we're seeing this kind of popular adoption of of ethereum and and bitcoin and all of this new tech and to me that speaks greatly about what crypto is achieving because from a geopolitical standpoint argentina is you know at the end of the world it's a forgotten country third world nation struggling through financial crisis to financial crisis and in the last seven years uh i've been pretty much in over 30 countries following the ethereum crowd following you know this revolution around the world and the fact that argentina is suddenly growing in adoption so aggressively speaks greatly of crypto speaks greatly of this technology because it means that the technology is being impacting the most where it's really needed the most uh in argentina it's not a theoretical quirk to learn about crypto or an investment opportunity it's for a lot of people a necessity they need it they can't buy dollars they are filled with pesos that are worthless they need this thing and to me that gives me a lot of hope about the future of the country uh the past of the country is a disaster i can tell you but it's still a great country with great people and i think that this new generation or what crypto is doing there uh is a very fertile ground for this technology and some years ago it was still a thing of us the nerds you know but today you know it's on mainstream media when vitalik was there you turned on the tv in argentina every news show was talking about this guy uh and that was a revelation probably to italic discovering that he'll probably be facing this more and more in the future anywhere he goes uh so dealing with his celebrity status will be uh a challenge for him but i think he he will do fantastic because he's a she's simply an amazing human being he's a monk that travels around the world with his backpack speaking the world you know preaching the truth uh and but for argentina was a like a big epiphany for society like suddenly everyone was like hey you're into crypto i'm into crypto also like everyone and uh i i i'm a public figure there in you know in the the crypto scene and whatnot and i realized that like the the the amount of messages and vms and emails and phone calls that i got since since that trip is beyond my my traditional level of information diet and it gives me the signal that there's something very serious brewing up there and it's coming from you know from the youth bottom up uh it's not like the el salvador case where you know el salvador got lucky enough to have a millennial president and this guy sadly he's kind of a maximalist but he's pushing bitcoin through everyone's throats top down uh in argentina it's bottom up adoption no and with vitaly we have been able to meet with an ex-president with a potential future president with the government uh with a you know left-wing activist even with a whole spectrum of leaders that the country has everyone left aside their differences that's the power that vitaly had uh not i don't think many people in the world can unite argentines uh like metallic did uh and and it's because everyone is realizing that there's this thing happening in the with the new generations that is uh very wild very well and uh that gives me hope you know so you've got some money but how are you gonna use it you me shopping now

aires and it's a nice story like vitalik arrived on saturday on saturday he met uh president macrid an ex-president of the country you know uh half of the country probably lavsky half of the country probably hates him but he's an ex-president so it was a good way of sending a signal to the country that hey this guy vitalik who might be might as well be the einstein of the 21st century is in our country and that was a very a great thing that he you know we were able to give this signal to the country to so the country learns about ethereum and and so an ethereum can discover how passionate argentina is about this technology uh when vitalik realizes that you know he might be having somewhat of a mix of status in argentina he tells me i'd like to do a conference so this is not like an exclusive trip just for me because i'm realizing you know how much people are talking about my visit here so let's do a conference i talked with the government of buenos aires we found a beautiful place for a thousand people uh to make this conference and we make the flyer we announced the the conference and in three minutes three minutes the conference sold out completely a thousand people a thousand people two two year you know we announced this on a sunday on tuesday we did the conference the major of the city came he had a private meeting with vitalik this is a guy that maybe could be the next president of the country uh like all of the thousand people that bought their ticket that got their ticket they were there packed room you know everyone wanted to be there people complaining on twitter that they couldn't get tickets and vitaly gave one of you know his fantastic keynotes we did an interview on stage to him uh he's such an easy person to interview because you ask him one thing and he will always give you at least three paragraphs uh describing uh his line of thought uh and the people there and this thousand these one thousand you know young people that came to to to see him live uh they were all you know probably between 15 17 18 to 28 29 like very very young and they were fascinated by what's going on like i i i i remember going outside to to say hi to some friends and suddenly i find myself giving a soup conference inside the conference like a crowd builds around me and we start people start asking me questions and and everyone was so thankful was so happy was so uh in this belief that vitalik came to argentina uh they couldn't believe it like uh he was you know people were so appreciative of that when we went to the islam uh we went to a school that was actually founded by pope francis and in this school some students came and again he's 16 17 years old and once you came with questions written uh handwritten in a paper and the questions were about vitalik's career he asked him well when when did you started how did you started writing for bitcoin magazine and this guy that grew up in islam that grew up you know in a disenfranchised section of the city uh you know with with definitely with much less possibilities than you know 90 of the people living in buenos aires he knew everything about vitalik uh he knew you know he was into ethereum he was already uh learning to mine cryptocurrency and and that to me speaks so greatly about the inclusive capacities of crypto and the youth is like gets it like this they they you know uh i i feel this this fractal sensation in my own uh you know whenever i go to that con or whenever i go to any event i i know i'm being respected for being the old guy around i'm 38. uh it's it's the 20 year olds are explaining me roll ups or are explaining me you know whatever is the next thing you know it's always the youth that teach you about what's up and coming with technology and it's so important to pay attention to to the youth in argentina thankfully i think that the the crypto virus is a very very strong right now and a lot of these kids will grow up they will start up things they will create stuff uh that will surprise us uh so i think that this legitimate youth and not the youth from the 70s is what needs to happen for for for the country to to change what would that lead to a you know a more individualistic society or a more market-loving free-market-loving society maybe it's a bit of an antidote to a lot of the socialist livings that you will also find in argentina but which is also a consequence of the the rampant inequality the inequality is in your face there if you're working with a silence you will find an entire family you know going through the dustbin or through the trash uh and it's such a sad image and you it's an image that is everywhere so i guess you know it's not that we're left-wing or right-wing we're a bit of dreaming of an utopia or some kind of powerful idea that can really change things for us and my sensation is that you we will if that idea exists somewhere it's definitely in the in the realm of information technology and digital stuff like it's not in the realm of legacy ideological you know economic schools but really you know the hackers that is the is the cypherpunk manifesto is the declaration of independence of cyberspace that's the literature it's the sovereign individual it's the infinite machine it's uh that's the literature that that i i think is really bringing new ideas and it's in information technology uh it's in with beats uh that the only thing that i've seen throughout my entire life that has really impacted people's lives for the better um and i think that the youth gets this uh and and this is uh i have no choice but but to be an optimist also as an entrepreneur you have to be an optimist but uh but uh what i've seen in buenos aires recently caught me by surprise in a in a significant way and it made me feel very proud it was the proudest moment of my career to have you know my hero vitalik buttering our hero vitalik visiting my country for the first time and for him to realize that my country loves him and for my country to realize that you know this is for real and it's so powerful that the entire political spectrum has to meet with him it's like i have never felt any pr i don't know if i will ever be able to surpass an experience like that but it speaks uh greatly about what's going on there and the potential it has to to change things i think perhaps one of the the best reasons to be happy about that is that because um vitalik is um very morally grounded um he's very he's a he's a realist um but he's also an uh an optimist at the same time and he definitely sees the potential of technology for good um but he will he'll never go out and like say something ridiculous or crazy just to like drum up a crowd he's always very pragmatic and and effective and the fact that like so much of argentina is seeing vitalik vitalik's pragmatism and then falling in line behind that rather than some sort of populist leader that's drumming up a crowd or you know some sort of like you know trumpian figure who knows how to like you know play the media vitals the opposite of that and people are are falling behind him as well that gets me really really optimistic because we need that in today's world there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to like you know drum up society to get them to to do the things that you want and vitalik's not doing that at all and people still like resonate with his message and and you know fall in line behind his leadership that's why he's like a monk you know yeah right you know you know i caught the attention that he always went everywhere with uh wearing sandals and socks yeah and he went to meet the president like that he want to be the minister of the country it's a and it's like that's the most cypherpunk thing i can think of like you know it's he's not not not a uh he's so grounded he's so you know if money shows the real face of you who you are the real face of vitalik is amazing because he had all kinds of offers in argentina you can imagine that when people found out he was there i got invitations for him to go on a private jet to the patagonia or to go to punta el este in a helicopter to meet you know this powerful guy or to go you know he got all kinds of fancy invitations and he got you know the opportunity to visit our slum and to meet you know how the the working class in argentina really lives and he chose to go to islam he chose to go to the school there to talk to the people there uh the people were you know obviously fascinated by this this guy that looks completely different than anyone else in argentina like vitalik as a russian he he obviously caught some people's attention uh and but you know you saw just little kids approaching him and asking where do you come from and what do you do and him very politely in spanish actually we were all surprised that he actually speaks very good spanish explaining you know who he was and what he does asking questions about how people live there how families live there uh thinking about uh you know learning uh about these social uh challenges are the social dramas that people are facing and he wanted to see that he didn't want none of the fancy programs i mean i remember every day i sent vitalik a couple of options you have this this and what do you want to do and he he he chose where his heart really is and i think he he actually said something uh in with in the first meeting we had with with president macri when he he said that one of the problems with technology is that it's probably easier to generate innovation uh in the in the information spectrum than in the physical world because it's easier to iterate and change things with digital bits and information than to iterate and change things in the physical world so a lot of investment and a lot of uh innovation is software only and it's software to make better software and he said that you know this leads to a situation where you create a society where you have these incredible billionaires uh creating a lot of wealth but at the same time you have a lot of junkies you know and homeless people who are you know doing her shooting heroin in the streets and you know the wealth side is completely blinded by what's happening on this on this social side where a lot of people are getting left behind and living you know through a tragedy in in in the very same city where this happens and he you use san francisco as an example i lived in san francisco and you know i saw that you know you walk through the tenderloin you will see it and it's it's for him he said you know it's very important to support projects that are being built on ethereum that make sure that they impact in reality that have an impact in the real world and not just you know i guess that's why he he's kind of been talking more about that you know let's defy is fun this defy is great but there's let's try to think about you know the social etherium how team can help society at large um and i guess that's why he got interested into proof of humanity and ubi and and i think that this is a a very positive aspect of his leadership that he cares that he's paying attention to stuff like this to this social aspect it's it's a wonderful thing uh it's very uncommon uh you know he's the most the strangest billionaire i have ever met for sure today buenos aires does feel a little bit like a cypher pack utopia like high inflation terrible government uh but the youth clandestinely you know using crypto for absolutely everything like another small story of vitalik's visit like there was one morning that vitalik went to a coffee shop at 9 30 a.m and the coffee shop opened at 10 a.m uh so vitalik was like okay it's close let's find a different place and from the inside the owner comes out running and says vitalik vitaly don't leave please i will open the shop for you come stay and and vitalik mentioned me that he was even able to pay with ether for his coffee and his croissant or whatever he had and uh it's it's like those things are showing me that well you know this is the the owner of a bar a random bar in the neighborhood of palermo he had suddenly you know got starstruck when he saw vitalik open the shop for him he you know he was already able to receive ether for for the coffee uh it's not like it's a strange thing a lot of shops are accepting a tether or you know some kind of stable coin a lot of shops you know you know asking the question can i pay with crypto it's not no longer like uh oh here comes the nerd asking about crypto no it used to be like that you know when i did it seven eight years ago i remember okay can i pay you with some bitcoin you know i remember doing that in some places and teaching people but now it's like yeah yeah sure pay you know pay with ether or with bitcoin or whatever and that thing becoming commonplace is a very very positive thing okay we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head
