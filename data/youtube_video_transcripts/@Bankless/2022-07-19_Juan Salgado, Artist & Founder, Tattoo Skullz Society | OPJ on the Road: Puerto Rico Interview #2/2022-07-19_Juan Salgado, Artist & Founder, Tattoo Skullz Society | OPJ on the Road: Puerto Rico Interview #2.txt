hey everyone a quick note before we dive into this episode this is the second full interview that we are publishing from the conversations i had back in february when i went to puerto rico to shoot a documentary about what's happening in the nft and crypto art scene on the island puerto rico is really becoming a hub for the blockchain and i wanted to show what was happening in real time so i went to puerto rico had conversations with a whole bunch of amazing artists and technologists living and from the island and this is one of them so this is my conversation with juan salgado who is an internationally renowned tattoo artist he's tattooed folks like ricky martin and bad bunny this conversation happened before the recent allegations again against ricky martin came out um and juan's just in general a early adopter of technology he's been at the forefront of a number of different industries including social media and juan recently made a big announcement which is that the only way moving forward to get tattooed by him will be to own one of his nfts which he launched earlier this year his tattoo program or his his nft collection is called the tattoo skulls society so we talk about his we talk about that in this episode as well as talking about puerto rico more generally again this was an interview i did for this documentary so it's not my typical interview and it did take place back in february but i think you're gonna enjoy it and i'm just excited for more people to learn about juan who is an amazing force in in puerto rico and around the world and a great person to have as part of our nft community i hope you enjoy [Music] juan you are an internationally renowned tattoo artist you've tattooed ricky martin daddy yankee others and tomorrow you are launching your tattoo skull society nft collection yes so by the way thank you very much for making time for me today i know this is a busy time for you you're sleeping yeah i'm super happy with that so if you just start like you know freaking out in the middle of this we'll know why uh tell us about tattoo skull society what is this nft so it's a collection of 5 000 unique skulls and they're all packed with amazing accesses and utilities so we're basically starting off an artist community with this with hnft you have basically a winning ticket because we're gonna be doing giveaways uh a couple of times a year including like original artwork paintings prints stickers and also vip tattoo settings so the fun part about this is that if you have the winning nft we're going to post it the whole community is going to know so you then decide what you're going to do with your nft if you're going to we can't tell you what to do with your nft when you decide if you want to resale or if you want to redeem it for your tattoo or if you just want to like ignore it and keep on going so this is a big deal and i know when i've like mentioned your name to folks in puerto rico they're like of course like juan is no longer giving tattoos except through this thing called an nfc so that was sort of the big revelation with this project is you are now only taking clients essentially from folks who who are part of this nft community exactly why did you decide to do that why is that better for you and for i guess everyone i'm already booked for like approximately two years so my schedule was getting super hectic and i wanted to put in other type of projects as tattoos as well but other projects like nfts murals i'm designing for a couple of companies now and all of that and it was being hard for me like to accommodate all those things as i was booked for two years so i took a decision just to like close the booking you know like for new clients i i still have to tattoo two years worth of people you know but uh uh this way through through the nft we can filter filter a little bit and also like people can take advantage of owning that spot so it's for me it's something that we all win so and at the end i still tattoo and that's that's what i want to do you know like there's a lot of people that say like oh you quit tattooing for doing nfc's i'm like no i'm still tattooing i'm doing nft so you you can get tattooed and that is something you and i have actually talked about before where for you the inclusivity piece of this where you had folks locally here who like wanted to get on your books wanted to get a tattoo from you and couldn't because you were so booked up yeah was that a big part of the impetus for this program yeah also i'm like my tattoos some people consider consider them expensive or out of their budget what does it usually cost uh depends uh approximately like for vip settings it's either like from five thousand to ten thousand dollars per sitting that's seven eight hours that's all so it's basically not for everyone but uh through the nft i'm making it accessible for everyone because you only pay 0.08 ethereum for your ticket and if you win you already can afford a ten thousand dollar tattoo you know so i i heard you say that you think in i think five or ten years was the time frame you gave like all tattoo artists will book through nfts yeah i think so i mean the the human race always uh tends to fix problems and and makes things easier you know that's why cell phones exist and everything is in your cell phone so i think in the future they're going to understand the benefits of having your waiting list throughout nfts and and they're they'll definitely catch up if not they're going to lose not all tattoo artists are as popular as you are uh does this also like is there an economic benefit here that you see you talk about it solving a problem like what is that problem is it partly economic yeah for sure i mean i i i still keep charging for my tattoos basically and and people that couldn't pay for it tattoo uh can get tattooed or uh if they want if they decide they could make money with the nft as well and so for other i'm trying to think of other tattoo artists who maybe don't have you know your level of sort of stature for them they're both they're still getting paid for their tattoo work but now there's this nft out there that somebody may choose to resell for some reason and they can get a cut of that that secondary is that how you see this really ballooning to more artists i don't i don't know about artists that are not well known uh i think they gotta work on that first and then do the nft thing you know because i think it's part of it i think i think you got to have like a demand there's got to be people waiting for your work yeah for this to work i think to really work so definitely they everybody can do it but they they have things to do first well that's such a a big thing that i feel like i try to emphasize to folks which is the nft itself doesn't create demand i think right now we're in an early stage where sometimes it does like sometimes it's so new that like the novelty of the nft is enough to catch attention but that won't always be true it started like that in the beginning because there was no competition for collections but right now i think it's all about utilities and utilities is what's making this a community thing because you have things in return so you have a constant communication with with your with your hope your holders and and the buyers so it makes it makes it a community and it also makes it more work is this more work than the way you were running your tattoos previously i mean it's for me maybe it maybe will work but i i enjoy it more it's working so i have a community and i have an outlet for my artwork and for future artists because obviously we're starting with my collection but we're thinking way bigger we're thinking this as an artist community you know and for example like a amazing tattoo artist from venezuela or something wants to get featured through our community we can do that you know i want to talk about that i want to talk about the communities you're bringing in um but i wanted to ask is the is the hope here you're you're you've got 5 000 of these tattoo skulls society nfts and you're you're doing these raffles and these giveaways anybody who's a token holder can get can win things like prints and art and then of course the holy grail which is the tattoo sitting with you uh is the goal that over time all 5000 nfts at some point win that vip sitting and so if you hold long enough you should win it if yeah i think you live long enough i don't know mathematically how possible is that but i mean yeah yeah for sure for sure that's that's why i want to make it an artist community because obviously like i'm not sustainable you know i'm going to get old probably i'm probably not i mean i don't know tech's moving fast man noise is living with other foreign and other artists so that's the whole point so you mentioned like other tattoo artists in venezuela i i know you're also thinking like locally here in puerto rico who are some of the initial say artists or programs that you want to bring in it depends we're still on experimentation i think you know so if this actually works at the end i already have a couple of names that i i'm gonna invite you know uh obviously people that are like well known or have a big following it's going to be priority because uh it's going to help us make the community even bigger and why would they want to come join sort of this program as opposed to launching their own nft i mean that's for them to decide we'll obviously present them with the benefits of being part of our community that's already it's already gonna be built so uh yeah that's that's basically that's a decision they have to make yeah but it's gonna be i think it's gonna be helpful for some artists you know obviously there's some artists that won't won't do it because they think they can do it by themselves and they surely can but uh artists that want our help and want to be featured like we can definitely talk well it's sort of like all jewelry stores right end up like convening on the same you know street or whatever you'll have like five jewelers if you all come together it just attracts more value to this project and somebody's coming in because of you but they also then learn about this other artist or so as long as they're getting you know a percentage and they're getting uh incentivized in that way i think it makes all the sense in the world to like partner up so and i i also see it as a growing thing as an evolving thing because right now we have like uh like six or seven utilities that we started with but in the future we want to we want to evolve that so let's save a hotel a big hotel brand wants to join the skulls we can we can talk about business and and we can offer maybe like a weekend in their stay that's one of the prices for the for the raffles and all that so i i see it as a thing that has a really good potential for growth and it's worth mentioning for folks who maybe don't know like you're pretty well connected in the branded world i know you're doing am i allowed to say what you told me earlier the mcdonald's cup design and like like you you're an artist beyond even just your tattoo working for mcdonald's i'm doing a collaboration with them and also with the with ford uh the car brand yeah so yeah so you're like well positioned to make some partnerships that are valuable yeah yeah i enjoy that i enjoyed that too and tell me like how did you first get into nfts what inspired the the tattoo skulls society like how did this all come to be so my brother my older brother he's like like a big nerd nerds are running the world man i just came from i'm a nerd too yeah but he looks like a bigger nerd than me he's my mentor in the nerd business so he talked to me first about it then i had a couple of clients that were into like they're like into crypto like a couple of crypto millionaires even billionaires i've tattooed and they started mentioning me all these things they helped me create my first wallet and all of that so it's it's been it's been uh with a lot of mentors you know a lot of friends uh i like to call mentors did you have like a click moment when you're like oh like that's why this makes all the sense in the world and we should do this yeah i mean like like i told earlier i think humanity always tends to fix their their problems and i think nfts fix a really big problem and it's the resale problem in in every industry you know like for example if if i was going to throw a concert and my concert was sold out in five minutes people are gonna resell those arena tickets for crazy money and uh i wouldn't get anything but if my tickets were nfts i would get 10 20 of each resale so i think i think just because of that i'm pretty sure all major brands in the world have an nft branch right now making it grow exploring gathering teams for that because i think i think that concept is what makes it like undeniable metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started on your nft journey you need metamask and if you need to fund your metamask account in order to buy that nft that you've been eyeing well now you can do that directly through metamask just click the blue buy button on the home screen personally i'm mad that i've spent extra gas fees transferring money from coinbase to metamask in order to buy nfts i've been using metamask directly and it is so much better you can also buy stable coins and native tokens from ethereum polygon avalanche celo and others and you can do it directly with your debit card your credit card through apple pay or google pay and there is now an improved buying experience on metamask mobile you'll only see tokens that are in your region so it's personalized to you and you'll get real-time quotes so you know you're always getting the best deal if you haven't downloaded metamask at what are you waiting for go try it out you can learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with metamask at metamask dot io slash buy dash crypto so let's talk about nfts and crypto here in puerto rico that's what i'm here to do i mean it's it feels like the scene is exploding it's such a hub for for this i think act 60 is obviously one reason for that there's sort of this obvious economic incentive for these transplants coming in and trading crypto here but is there something else about puerto rican culture or or the work that gets done here that you feel like makes it particularly amenable to the nft crypto scene yeah there's a couple of things i think the the crypto guys moving in definitely helps uh there's a this uh nft mode will call called g-money uh he moved to puerto rico he did an event here called the metal and i started selling my first nft during that time as well and ismo is a really good artist from here my friend too he saw so it was like a momentum kind of thing you know and also the fact that puerto rico is so small that word spreads out like super quick and it also seems like you have a really robust art scene and like a lot of creative people who are doing work that like fits well with the nft scene in these early days when it's really a focus on art i'm curious too this is something i was sort of hypothesizing on earlier which is crypto has a very sort of [ __ ] the man vibe to it and sort of breaking out from institutions yeah i say i think i think crypto is a true rebellion and you feel like i'm getting in trouble for saying that but that's my opinion oh no it's i don't yeah 100 you're not in trouble for that at all and so do you feel like there's that spirit here in puerto rico naturally there's like this rebellious group for sure i'm pretty sure that that people are finding economic freedom throughout crypto right now and that's probably one of the reasons that there's like a employee crisis in the world yeah yeah i've seen so many people posting i quit my day job like every day i see that on twitter yeah well there's all the jokes they make it on crypto they're like suddenly gonna work for anyone you know well there's the joke it's like i quit my nine to five to work like six to 11 in nfts which i know you know very well you're experiencing it right now um what about the tension or i i've been hearing there is tension sort of on the island around the nft and crypto scene that's emerging i think mostly towards the transplants like do you have thoughts on that where is that stemming from i mean you don't really think about it yeah there's i mean puerto rico is a place that basically to put it in in general terms 50 of the island wants to be part of the us 60 percent don't feel they want to be part of the u.s so i think that whole that whole debacle is what it's it's targeting like the the fight between the people that are moving here from the states versus the locals you know what uh i i personally like i don't want to get in into that type of conversation right now but uh i it's not their fault you know it's it's a law that our government created so if people are gonna get mad for that they should get mad for me at the government who created the laws you know like uh me personally i have really really good friends that i've made people that move in the island so i mean i'm basically neutral on the subject you talk about the financial freedom from crypto and i'm sure like in some ways your nft program feels freeing like you said you now don't you know you're you're eliminating this two-year wait list from your books in a way that probably feels great how much of that do you think is a result of again being really early right now in nfts and being early in this space and how much do you think that is something that will persist where it will always be a financial freedom you think being early helps it helped me in tattooing i started tattooing 20 years ago and i i like to believe i started in the right era like right now i think it will be way harder even to get followers right now on instagram and all that it's super harder than it was 10 years ago how did you get your start like how did you what were your what are your like tips and tricks to an aspiring tattoo artist i know you're saying it's harder now but like what was your journey first you gotta work on your skills you know i have more than 165 international awards so before even being known at all i was i was winning worldwide i was a world champion for eight consecutive years in the in color tattooing you know in the one of the best competitions that they do in the states uh so i work first on that and all of the sudden i'm a world i remember it was back in 2007 i'm the world champion right wow i'm boom i've been the best in japan the best in europe the best in the us i beat him so i'm like here in puerto rico being the world champion no clients yeah so i'm like what do you have to do then you know oh my gosh i just became the world champion so uh i understood that if nobody knows you're the world champion so i found early facebook i remember i started on myspace first and i understood like how that was an amazing tool to reach people and get clients and spread the word so i started that really really early really early i feel like there are a lot of similarities between early social media and early nfts and you're clearly on the front you're on the frontier of both i have this sort of theory that i think like in social media not every brand at this point has a social media account even small businesses you sort of have to you feel like you're not really a part of the world or not really a business if you don't have a social media account but there's like degrees some social media accounts are really good i think like wendy's notoriously has a very funny twitter account whereas mcdonald's like i don't know anything about their twitter account i feel like nfts will end up playing out a similar way which is that all brands businesses etc will will have some sort of nft program or we'll use nfts in some way but there'll be degrees to which like some will be notable and amazing and others will just sort of be there because they have to be what do you think it's cool that you bring this up because right now there's i have a lot of brands from puerto rico like uh wanting to meet with me because they want to collaborate in an nfc project like for example uh i'm gonna work on a future nft probably with the brand melaya it's our beer i just i will admit i just drank some of a madaya before coming here i felt like i needed to try it for example uh that's why i told you like i see brands really interested in the nfd i think uh as a money maker for brands right now it's i think it's a little bit early yeah but uh but i mean it's it's about time that they they start on it well and for brands i think there's an obvious play if you're nike or adidas or a brand that like metaverse sneakers are themselves an item that people want for a brand like madaya which is obviously based on like being in the physical world i i feel like nfts are really just a way to build a bond or a deeper bond between you and your customer and you and your consumer because you can build out these experiences for them you can it's really like a a brand building play is that how they're thinking about it is that what you're talking about the way i mean i talk to them so i i guide them a little bit so they're basically they want to read the benefits of the utilities so if you get a for example you got an nfd from melaya you get a vip access to all the concerts they sponsor like a free keg every year stuff like that and i think that's that like building that closer relationship with your consumer that i'm talking about like you know giving them a concert experience is gonna make them love you maybe even more than you know that they grabbed you from the particular it's just creating community you know i think i think the future is going to be a little bit different than it is now like people are being a little bit freer from the government this year so i think it's going to end up being like a tribe thing so each each brand each p each person each influencer celebrities kind of have like their tribe yeah it's a way to to show who we are like what is more fundamental to humans than like communicating who we are and what we care about i mean that's what tattoos are about right you're communicating something about yourself with the tattoos you have that's what nfts are it's like communicating it's a deeper layer of communicating who you are and what you love and the tribes you belong to and which will be probably both good and bad tribalism everything yeah everything has like two sides yeah so it's gonna have it's gonna bring a lot of benefits and a lot of problems yeah that's part of it i think in the future there's gonna be like a super big police brand it's gonna be like the the crypto police and the nft if fbi yeah it's gonna happen yeah like good things are starting to happen also like there's gonna be very clever people trying to steal cleverly or well we're seeing that i mean the scams we're already seeing are yeah they're scary geniuses yeah yeah geniuses come in all in all flavors okay i heard your first nft or your first tattoo you ever did was on yourself yeah like a little star do you still have it yeah this is this one this little star right here that that was the first nft you ever oh my gosh i keep saying nfc your first tattoo ever you should make an nft of it first tattoo non-punjab there you go it's a non-fungible yeah it's a star it's a basically a red star so i i always say that this started a revolution you know because the red star is the sign of the revolution so this is the first you really do belong in crypto this is the first tattoo i did and this brought the whole wave wow after that and what was your style at the point when you first started like did you have one just like just like do something yeah first years of my career just started like copying things i like you know so that's that's how you learn and were you an uh like a a drawing artist before like when did you decide did you always know you wanted to do tattooing or did you think you wanted to do other art i've always been an artist like since i had my brother tells me when i was three years old like he gave me a pencil and when i threw the first line i was like i can translate like that that's what he saw on me and after that i just didn't stop drawing i was super shy person like i didn't see people in the eye or anything like that so i think art helped me cope with humans at first so i kind of always was like the best that i do in my class and drawing and all that so i've always been an artist like my mom never could resell my books because they were all drawn my notebooks i never write whatever the teachers told me because i was always like growing and all that so uh i remember in ninth grade i heard about a school in puerto rico that it's it's an art high school it's called so in ninth grade i was in a catholic school i hated it with all my heart because it was like a high school movie like the cool ones the the nerds the super also every day in the school i swear and if you're born rebellious what's more of an institution than catholicism so i heard about that i i took the test by myself i decided to move schools you know like who does that in ninth grade who decides to move you know so i decided it and it opened up my whole world because in this school you're one of the cool guys if you were one of the good artists yeah i'm like yeah this is my crowd yeah so yeah after that uh i wanted to be an architect i remember and then i saw a movie called great expectations with ethan hawk you saw it ever is it based on the book great expectations uh i don't know basically he's basically an artist so his story like like clicked in my head and i started like messing around with the idea of being a painter instead of an architect so uh after that in college i just concentrated in painting and sculpture and then when did you make the switch to i'm going to draw on people oh so i started tattooing when i was 20 so i i still was studying art and tattooing part time but i started getting more known and more know i started winning prizes and i started traveling every month so i studied college for almost seven years and i didn't graduate for two classes because my career was exploding and i just didn't have time like i got to the point that teachers were giving me free grades like you know in my art school in in my art class in the the last i'm gonna say the name but in the last one of the last institutions i i studied i didn't even enter once and i got an a you know like because he he asked me for i just do do a drawing for me and i'll give you an a you know stuff like that yeah but even with that help i couldn't finish yeah wow i love that because it's like what the treatment athletes get you know like there's like the athlete track of classes it's like you're so talented in something i do think it's you know i don't know what what do you want to marry in college like too like my teachers are telling me like why are you here yeah you could be working as an illustrator right now and i just lost interest you know and my mom is a professor she has a doctor's degree and all that so she was she like she already she already got over it but it was very very very sad for her when i left you've done all right and uh i don't recommend that though like i would have finished because i mean i haven't i don't need i don't i don't need my i haven't needed my diploma in all these years but uh it's it's a pretty good tool yeah like for example galleries like art galleries there's like important art colors that you know if you don't have a diploma in art they won't even show you okay but see that's stupid in my opinion like i don't know what you think it's all old way of thinking i think it's changing it's changing but uh it's it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt you to have a diploma that's what i say you know but i feel like it so did you go to school here in puerto rico what is the cost of like higher education in puerto rico is it like in the states no no here we have we have a lot of help from the federal government oh that's lovely yeah so if you apply and you and you are available for that they basically pay for your studies but i had such a problem with it in the states just given how expensive it's gotten to get a degree in the united states and you know and you're in the states i don't know i never know how to refer to it because obviously you've got this puerto rico united states you know thai and i'm like that's ridiculous you're going to require somebody to get a degree that's going to put them into a tremendous amount of debt when they could have gone and been an apprentice and gotten a better set of art skills or something else than like college did i have exactly the same opinion as you and in the past it used to be like that like if you were like a good artist at 11 10 years old they will send you to uh to to apprentice under another artist you know so don't lose time doing things that you're not good at totally so yeah yeah i'm all up for that i'm going for that [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you
