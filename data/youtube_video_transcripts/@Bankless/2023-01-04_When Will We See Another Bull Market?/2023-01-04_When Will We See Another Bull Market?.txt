and we'll see another another bull market of some sort breaching all-time highs what would your guess be I mean do we have to wait 10 years or does this happen every four years it won't be 10 years and I I wish I could pretend that me and my like crypto OG friends don't talk about like when the bull market will return but we do you know we have our barbecues and we talk about we're just always wrong it won't be 10 years like if it takes 10 years for the bull market to happen probably the whole thing failed yeah I would guess that sometime in the next like six months to three years it also has a lot to do with the macro environment right so as long as interest rates are held high monetary conditions are tighter it's going to be a headwind that'll start changing in early to mid next year I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was at like 40K by the summer that wouldn't surprise me at all there you have it guys some thoughts from Eric Vorhees even got some price predictions uh yeah you heard it here guaranteed by 2026 we'll have a full steam ahead bull market Eric Voorhees uh just kidding guys
