come in and build the thing that you're into and like then you'll bring more people that are like you and that are like-minded welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with natasha and dina from the boys club uh the boys club is an organization focusing on onboarding women into web 3 and that's why i think that the name the boys club is just so fantastically awesome uh crypto has famously not been a very welcoming place towards women um especially during the era of just being a bunch of basement dwelling libertarians and before the world of culture and nfts really took forth there was uh just not a place where women felt welcomed and the boys club is looking to tackle this problem head-on and there's been a number of uh of these conferences that i've gone to around the world where women seeming seem to have much more presence in crypto in real life than they do on the internet and all the the crypto ladies that i've met while going to conferences all seem to uh have their part in the boys club and rep it really really hard uh and so i want to wanted to get the founders of the boys club on the show just to talk about the boys club what its mission is what its goals are what its vibe is and what it can do for onboarding women into web 3. both natasha and dina have their own day jobs dina works at the cello foundation which i'm sure many listeners are familiar with yet when the sun goes down and their the nine to five is over they are all about boys club and onboarding women into web 3. so uh if you are a lady who's looking to make lady friends to onboard yourselves and your other lady friends into web 3 perhaps the boys club is for you they do in real life meetups all over the world because they understand the value of in real life meetups and so i hope you enjoy this conversation with natasha and dina from the boys club right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users control your digital footprint with built-in privacy and ad blocking inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web3 crypto browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy

to get started when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap

idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswopgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless dina and natasha of boys club welcome to bank list how are you guys doing we're doing good so thanks for having us yeah so how does the story of boys club start where did the idea of boys club originate and why why does the world need boyd's club uh let's start with dina well um honestly we just see a lot of very smart very capable women still sort of just watching what's happening in web 3 and crypto from the sidelines and we wanted to figure out a way to give all those women and people an access point so that's sort of the the genesis or the the the founding feeling behind boys club natasha you want to add anything i mean where voice club started is really a pool site in vegas so it's a very good beginning um i i mean the dynamic between dean and i dina and i have been business partners for a long time and really good friends and like totally obsessed with each other for a while and the the dynamic in our relationship had always been or like for the past few years has been dina super into crypto we're talking about it all the time just constantly and continually telling me you've got to get into it you've got so much is happening like this is for you and me just being like i love it for you really cool but not for me like not my five just like not for me and so that was always sort of the dynamic and then we were on on this trip in vegas and it was right around the same time that like a lot culturally in my world started to happen with crypto like nfts and dows and like all these sort of projects popping off so it was more top of mind and dino was like we're gonna spend three hours and i'm just gonna download you on like what's happening in the space we're gonna look through some decks we're gonna go to crypto twitter we're gonna look through discords and like i'm gonna really brief you on like what i think is happening here what i think the opportunity is for you um and i was just like totally sold at the end of it i was like okay i'm in like what is it crypto people say crypto pill like i was like okay i'm ready for this and so i was totally excited about it but i also felt like this major urgency around it to like bring all of my friends into it like all of my peers who as dina said are like totally sitting on the sidelines of what's happening um and also give them a better sense of like what the opportunity is for them and why it's important um so that's sort of where it began and and i think for us it was really clear that that social moment like that in person interaction of someone you really trust downloading you on why this is important that you're involved and what is happening um is really special and i think for a lot of um a lot of the women in my life i know is sort of required um to get them to understand why they should care about web3 and why they should about crypto um so there's a lot more i could say but i don't know do you know if you have anything to add to that yeah i think i mean just to sort of piggyback on that like it was really the the driving insight was like man for for a lot of people for for a lot of women like this needs to happen this learning needs to happen in community and for natasha that made the most sense like irl and for other folks like maybe that can transcend online as well but like either way whatever the access point is like it needs to happen in a space where you feel like you can ask questions you can get stuff wrong like i have a lot of one-on-ones with the women in our community and they're sort of this shared sentiment where they're like i feel like too much time has passed and i have like really foundational questions about what's happening here that like i'm too nervous to ask now and so they see boys club is really a way to like just have the space to ask whatever and talk about whatever and know that they're not gonna get like shamed or judged like we cherish everyone like wherever they are in the journey and that's really like a defining value for us yeah so natasha what you were talking about i i think is is pretty universal because everyone wants to get their friends and family into crypto it's very much of like yo this thing's real and i just need to find the right words and the right like way to navigate this to get you to also believe that it's real and at some point in time i kind of think that everyone will have that moment uh and that's been been my experience with you know being frustrated about trying to get my friends into crypto and they just don't see what i see but also i would imagine it's a completely additional hurdle with women uh just because there is just different dispositions and different dynamics about how uh ladies might approach this space especially when like first off computer sciences is heavily male dominated and then also finance is heavily male dominated and i i've always had like this thesis as when you combine those two it doesn't get like linearly more male dominated it gets like exponentially more male dominated so like how have you guys helped like try to like navigate the waters of uh onboarding women into web 3 and and what tricks have you learned that has that has worked out yeah i mean totally i think that there's like for me it was always really layered in like gaming culture and like meme culture and a lot of stuff that i just like didn't get or wasn't involved in and like that was sort of like the overarching layer on top of like all this other stuff like computer science and finance that um are not like my primary thing and so there was so much to sort of like work through to try to get to what was happening in this space and i think that that has been sort of universally true in other words as we've talked to women and onboarded them to um to web 3 and i think like what has been really successful is talking about stuff that we're into and pulling it back into what's happening in crypto like doing the kardashians in web 3 like where do the kardashians make sense in the crypto verse and like that like seriously landing for people like texts and like dms being like this is the first time that i understand i like understand what the metaverse is and i'm like yeah it's calabasas like that whole thing has like been really successful and like it's it's it's us layering it with like skin care and pop culture and things that like i'm into and dina's into and like a lot of my friends like and making that have that like click like aha moment for the people in our community um and that's yeah really different than i think when i was looking at these like crypto twitter and discord channels and all this stuff that was dina was showing me i was just like man this is not layered in my language like this isn't speaking to me um and so finding like ways to produce content and education and explanation around this in a way that is culturally relevant i guess to me and my friends i think that the language and how everything is coded um just it's subtle but it makes it's an instant read for someone to judge whether or not a space is for them or not and i think that i'll just speak for me personally like sports metaphors finance metaphors like just say just don't land for me and so i think like us finding new ways to talk about some of these com you know concepts in crypto and drawing them into again things that we're interested is has been really effective and i also think that there's there there's another insight which is totally universal which is like giving people a really wide surface area of um exposure to different things that are happening in crypto and around web3 and letting like everyone sort of weigh into web3 is different right like natasha is really interested in art like the conversation around nfts and ownership and providence like all that is going to really appeal to her um you know some of my friends are more into like the d5 protocols once they get into it like that sorts to that is the thing for them like for me it's it's it's something else and so i think like one thing that we've found a lot of success with is like when we're having conversations with beginners and we're having conversations with people that we're onboarding it's like we want to expose them really why we want to cast a really wide net of like crypto's an enabling technology it's only as interesting as it is as as the sort of content you bring to it right and has the sort of direction that you decide to take it and so i think like letting people sort of explore different aspects of it and find their little lane or their little niche or their little spark has been um has been really huge for us yeah and i think one thing i want to add to that is like a lot of conversations we have and a lot of things that we talk about on it like dina and i as we think about boys club is like there's a lot obviously happening in crypto there's so much innovation that's really exciting but a lot of times they're for women they're looking around and they're thinking none of this is like interesting to me none of this speaks to like the things that i like or enjoy or like i don't know what podcast to listen to because it's not talking about the other stuff that i'm into and my like response to that is like yes because these things have been primarily built and deployed and communicated by men and they're not made by women and that's why it's so urgent that you join boys club that you get on board to what's happening that you get into web 3 because your input is so vital to what's being built right now and like your creativity and design and thoughtfulness and interests are required for this space to be interesting to more people and that was it for me when i had that conversation with dina like my light bulb moment like it felt so important for me to participate in this in this in some way because i knew okay if i don't it will be all of these decisions around how um dowser formed how power is distributed how the financial system is built in the future are going to be decided by the same sort of cast of characters that has always been decided by and it's sort of like on me at this point with an understanding of how powerful this technology is and how powerful this movement is to build products and services and communities that speak to a broader audience and speak to a female audience to bring them into what is happening and so i think that like giving the people in our community and women the understanding of like yes you look around and you're not really that interested you're like i don't know maybe this nft project like maybe this social dao and i'm like come in and build the thing that you're into and like then you'll bring more people that are like you and that are like-minded and so for me that was like that's been really important and a huge part of like what makes me excited about what we're building i think the timing of when boys club uh emerged makes a lot of sense too because during 2018 2020 that we didn't really have this nft phenomenon we didn't really have web3 web3 was kind of a lost term and what we really had were people that were really good at spending like 16 hours in their basement on discord uh like and that activity is not an activity i would associate with with ladies um ladies don't like to be in their basements staring at their laptop for 16 hours a day ladies are far more social and in and crypto started become really really social towards the end of 2020 2021 that's kind of when we actually started to form a cultural identity for ourselves something that we never had during the bear market and we maybe briefly had during 2017 but it was terrible because it was all icos so i think there's actually no no coincidence that that something like that the boys club has come about during the time where there's actually like a culture and a vibe here rather than just like a bunch of uh libertarian basement dwellers yeah well i'll echo that and say um as someone who tried to build a product for women that was in market so i built um a bitcoin wallet that was um designed for for teenage girls so i i've always been really passionate about the since i've gotten to krypton around 2017 like really passionate about finding ways to make this space more accessible finding the access point um i built it a wallet and and launched it in 2018 um and man yeah no one cared absolutely no one cares it was not the thing at all um but uh yeah i think i think i think that's i think times are much more interesting right now and i think people are like starting to see what the opportunities are starting to be curious at least what the opportunity is for themselves in this um so let's i want to learn for myself and also for for the listeners what does a day in the life of boys club look like uh just like what what is if somebody's in the discord or the groups or i know you guys have a lot of emphasis on in real life meetups uh for people that are for if the the boys club curious uh the ladies out there who are perhaps potential members of the boys club what does a day in the life of boys club look like yeah so um i can answer this just because i just came off of a couple calls that i think will be interesting so first of all like we're perfect for wherever you are in your journey like if you're totally green just starting like that's we we cherish you we can't wait to help you and to like hug you and to figure this out with you but we're also like for there are women there are a lot of women in our community that are um like dabblers or looking to pivot professionally and so there's resources within boys club that are um actually becoming much more demand around like recruiting and conversations about like what does it mean to move into web 3 more you know more professionally or more permanently um and then also we have like a few just stone cold pros that are in the group and like i'd say at any point in wherever women are in their journey like the only thing that we ask is that you come with a generosity to help the other people in the group sort of learn and that you're curious to sort of figure it all out with us because we certainly don't have it figured out like we're totally just learning alongside everyone else so um make no claims to be to be prose um so day in the life um i just got off a call so i i we have um community calls with with women who want to connect and to talk um and the one that we just had um which is a problem that we were just all starting to troubleshoot in the discord was um we did a tutorial for pool together so we love pull together we um on our last town hall we were like okay we're all gonna jump in together we're gonna do this no no lost savings it's awesome it's a great like lower risk activity for people who are like just getting started and um we got everyone set up on dharma we're all jumping in and then we find out dharma is getting acquired there's sun setting the wallet so there was like a little panic moment where everyone didn't know what to do so on the one-on-one call we were trying to figure out what she should do and then we jumped into the discord and got some advice from someone around sort of like how we how we move everything around so that's like on a regular day um and then we also do events we have a lot of events coming up i'll let natasha speak to this um yeah so i um i have we have a lot of events upcoming i would say that it's been really cool that our sort of core premise is events and like in-person activities um but there's been all of these like very organic gatherings that are happening that have been so fun we're like once a week at least there's something happening where like the boys girls are getting together and doing something fun like getting you know natural wine and pizza or like going to a talk at the williamsburg hotel um so those are happening all the time and it was really fun this past monday we went to one um at the williamsburg hotel um our friend evan was speaking and we got there and i was like wow there's a lot of like a lot of women here and so many of them were coming up to me and they're like are you natasha like i'm a boys club and i was like oh my gosh it's amazing and like started chatting and there's just like a group of like women that just kept like multiplying and this woman comes up to me and she's like what's going on like where you guys from we were chatting and she was like i was here last weekend and there were only dudes here like what is happening i was like gotta join the discord like it's happening so that felt like a lot of validation for me personally i was like this is really great um and so that's been really fun and then our in-person events that are like our true like community events that are onboarding um like onboarding at mass are our next one is february 9th um and we're doing at the georgia room 100 women we'll do like a brief keynote on um sort of like web 3 and what's happening and why you should care about it and then um a panel of like total rock stars are going to be um fielding questions and people like texting their questions and they are very they totally run the gamut like it'll be everything from like what is a wallet and how do i get it to like let's talk about staking like it's totally across the across the gamut so it's really cool to see all of those women in the same room like um yeah just learning together and caring about this thing collectively and there's also just like a really fun vibe like it's a party like our first event was like we it was so scrappy it was like dina and i and we had rented this venue and they were like hey you guys have to leave and i was literally like telling all the girls like you guys like please leave like we have paid for a very small window and you're like really pushing it out so it's a really fun um fun atmosphere and uh just a good hang on yeah so so i want to ask the meta question like what actually is it is it like a social club i don't think you guys have a token so it's not a dow uh what actually is boys club so we're wannabe dao um we're doing some dow some dow baby steps right now um we're actually in the c club final or c cup finalist so we'll learn about that this week but um yeah being a child is really important to us and it's it's 100 the direction that we're headed and um yeah we just like we're building this thing alongside a community and we want everyone to share that upside and we're like fully fully committed to that um becoming a reality i think for us it's just like is it token is it nft membership we're still trying to figure out the logistics of it but like spiritually emotionally physically we're headed in that direction for sure yeah i think like also we there's this moment of onboarding where someone is sold they're like okay i get this i want to be in and then it's like okay do i like go by eath like what is the thing that like makes you in and like gets you invested and and contributing and so for us that's why like a dad was really important because we wanted to build something alongside these women that are sort of like onboarding and getting into it um and making sure that they yeah are sharing in the upside of what we're building and i think for both dean and i we are this is not our first thing that we founded like we both worked on other projects and we did the thing where we built something and put it out into the world and tried to put a community around it and realize like wow nobody wants to sing and like this is not good timing this is not good timing or this isn't quite right or whatever and with boys club it was just so it was always it's always been like let's get community into this thing like let's get a group of women together and figure out what they want and what they need and how we can serve them um and then after that like figure out what it is and it's like okay yes this is the social club this is a wannabe dow like that feels very clear to us because the women in it have really dictated what they what they want i think that's very resonant with how um crypto works at large right like hey let's get all the people together and then we'll decide like what's next rather than deciding what's next and trying to get a bunch of people to rally rally around it uh yeah and it seems like just uh part of the inclusive vibe of this thing it's like hey we know that we all want to be in the same room but that's all that we know and like the rest is up to us yeah i think that there's like a real patience that's needed in designing for the emergence of like if it's a product studio right and we really want like some idea to emerge from the community and we want to like be scrappy about how we validate it like we have to be patient and we have to like really sort of like deeply understand the needs and wants and values of this group in order to like effectively build for it right so like that's sort of the work that we're all doing everyone in the community is doing now by having those conversations by going to the meetups like we're all just like trying to like figure each other out and figure out what this thing is and then i just like have to believe that there will be some point in time where some idea will emerge we're like okay i think this is this is interesting and this is in this is worth putting some weight behind so like let's all pool our collective like social talent capital resources to like build it together so that's that's the hope that's the that's the dream so i think i've actually uh done this interview at the by not asking the most obvious question uh why the name boys club [Laughter] um i mean obviously it's a little tongue-in-cheek to be like um kryptos boys club and then we were like throwing around some ideas like we went we went back and forth we almost called it wives and girlfriends because dina's husband is british and there's like the whole wags thing so we almost did that but like it wasn't quite landing and we just kept calling a boys club like just texting each other like okay about boys club and then finally we were like it's just boys club let's just do it whatever um so yeah i think also there's some there's like an important aspect of like not taking ourselves too seriously and having a lot of fun which is like a crucial value for the community and natasha and i both personally like it's like fun we're having a good time it's not a serious thing like we just like and and that felt like really well distilled in the name so we're we were excited when it sort of started to land yeah we had been working on a travel product before this and a travel startup and it was just so like branding wise like it was everything had to be like very elevated very clean like super crisp and like branding is like my world and what i like to do and like i was just like it was just so very stressful around like what we were putting out there and so boys club was just like just a truly creative outlet of just like look yeah that's a great let's do that let's pop that on let's put it out and like what made us laugh like what makes us what makes us like feel like the internet is like fun and which is so crypto and so when it came together and like we got this logo together and we pushed it out there like honestly it's been such a snowball of like a thing that's happened um but everything has come from this feeling of just like how is this fun for everybody how is there like humor in all of the things that we're doing um so i feel like the name sort of fits fits that whole vibe yeah i think i think it's great i was talking to ryan earlier today and he was like yeah dude that's one of the best names and [Laughter] so while growing out and scaling the organization both in like just uh just numbers of uh individuals but also vibes because scaling vibes is also very important like what what lessons have you guys learned like what works uh what doesn't work and have you guys like taken a leaf out of any other organizations that are also trying to to work on this effort yeah natasha do you want to jump in on this i mean yeah something we're thinking a lot about is like how do you we are very like brand centric and how do you have like a brand centric dao where you have like all these contributors and all these people working on different projects and different aspects of what we're putting out into the world um and it's like a pr a very present question and top of mind every day um dina like loves to joke that i'm like very bossy in taipei and like it's been a real stretch for me where i'm like okay other people just like doing their thing this is what this is um and so that has definitely been a learning curve like how do we empower community to take the spirit of what we're doing and and um make sure that it remains consistent in everything that we're doing like as dina talked about like a generosity of spirit in like every every channel and platform that we're doing like whether it's a twitter space whether it's an in-person event whether it's like a blog or newsletter like making sure that there is like a welcomeness in which we're talking about these topics um and so we're we are learning a lot about how how to do that and how to equip people um because everybody at this point who's joining has been attracted to boys club because of some element of what we're doing whether it is the humor and like the good vibes or whether it is that openness and generosity like um so we want the everybody who is contributing isn't invested in keeping that as we scale um so yeah it's a it's an open question that we're still really trying to figure out um but there's i mean so many so many people are working on um inclusivity in the space and making crypto a more diverse um community which is amazing and there's so many projects that we look at every day and are inspired by and like web 3 familia is amazing and 40 acres dao and chi fi um and went through baddies like there's all these really incredible communities that we want to celebrate and think what they're doing is incredible and like we're by no means the only people doing this in some way um so we definitely look to them and are inspired by the work that they're doing uh one thing um one thing i want to know is uh are there when you guys are on boarding women into web3 uh is there something that always comes up that it wouldn't wouldn't have come up if it was dudes like what what what do the what do the women always ask that the dudes don't um i so i it's maybe not always the same exact question but it's this a similar behavior that i see a lot with women which is that they come across a term or concept or an idea so and then this happened to me personally i i it was whatever 2014 i was reading an article about bitcoin and i came across the term mining and i was like i was like underground with a pickaxe and a shovel like i was like could not get it through my thick head like what were we talking about here what if it was mining excuse me i do not does not compute and so i came across that and i was like this isn't for me i was i can't get here i'm like it's not for me set it aside and i left just a phenomenal amount of money on the table in doing that like just the amount like i just i actually can't think about it like i cannot think about it makes me start to sweat but i do see that like in in the conversations that we're having like there's this thing where people get stuck on an idea or concept and i honestly it does happen a lot with mining like i gotta admit like that is one that definitely gets people sort of freaked out and um and and i think for women in particular like they there's this sense that they have to understand everything that's happening completely in order to be able to participate in what's happening and like part of like what we've been trying to do is like just over and over again be like it's cool just set it aside like you'll come back to mining in a couple days or a couple year like months or years or maybe you'll come back to it and you'll never understand it and like that's okay and like just sort of that mental shift of being able to like have the flexibility to be like okay i don't fully understand what like this liquidity pool thing is but i'm gonna keep persevering past it and like it's gonna be there and like that's okay and i can still be here is something that like i just const like is the number one message that we try to get out to people and when we're speaking to them yeah i would imagine like crypto is associated with risk right uh and and men are historically like the big risk takers right we we have or are able to put more on the table than than than ladies and i i would imagine that that is partly what kind of kind of what's going on here where uh it's kind of all or nothing crypto is very all or nothing and yeah uh if you're not ready to give it give it your all then like sometimes crypto like chews you up and spits you out but that's not actually true um uh maybe it once was back in the very early days but as crypto develops more and more and more like people are able to like more specialize and really just find corners of the industry that they i only care about this thing right like at this point in crypto like you actually don't have to know about mining at all i would say 100 yeah 100 and it's becoming more and more true every day i think that there's like enough in like art and music and like philanthropy there's enough really interesting little things that like i do think that people are able to sort of like find their moment but we just gotta you know get them there yeah it was really funny we were talking to one of our contributors the other day and she was like yeah i was talking to this dude and he was like he went to penn and all of his pen buddies like have a discord channel where they just like share like essentially like deal float like nft drops and stuff like that and she was like and they're just making like so much money like how can we like bring that into boys club like i wanted to and i was and we were chatting through it and one of the things i said was like yeah i think part of that is just like a dude thing where they're like dude you gotta get in you gotta do it you gotta do it where i'm like i would never ever tell my friend like buy it right now you got to like i would always be like if you like the project if it speaks to you if you think it's beautiful like there's just sort of this lightness around it like this real like gotta get just consent and like just think about it with women that like is different and like i i want to like in some ways protect that but i also i'm like push past that a little bit because there's a lot of opportunity for you here yeah does does fomo land differently with women than it does with boys i mean i have the worst case of fomo in the world like everybody who knows me knows that it's it's so strong so i i don't know that's maybe why i'm doing this but yeah i think it's not quite it's not quite as like palpable in our discord as it is in some of these other discords that i'm a part of where you see people just like lose their mind um i don't it never gets to like hysteria levels which i've seen elsewhere in western so uh what uh what do women have that the crypto industry really really needs what a question um honestly like i think part of it there's there's definitely like the social element that i feel really excited about obviously that's why we're doing in-person events and i think like when i was listening to your podcast a few days ago about like the metaverse and something that i'm like just really trying to wrap my head around because i'm just like i have no interest in going to an online cafe like i just it's like i know it's so much more than that but i'm just like what is this like what's happening here and i think like for me what i'm excited about is like what what is this what does this technology enable that allows for like more connection and more community and in and in-person experiences that are like elevated and encouraged by the technology that's being built and i think there's some things that are doing some obviously there's some projects that are doing that and there's people who are thinking about that and like um i think of like friends with benefits obviously has figured out this like amazing way to bring this technology into something that's very social and for me that's what's exciting and what i think women can bring that's like missing in some ways and like obviously i'm speaking very broadly but i think having more experiences that are in real life that breed connection with one another and more memories and moments that really stick with you and how you bring value to those through crypto and through the things that are happening in in um in this space i think is what i want to see more of and i think what women can bring to the table but i don't know dina what would you say um yeah i think it's a really good question i mean i think for me it's actually like not about women it's just about more people it's just about more people from different backgrounds with different sets of experiences that have different values like i just i want to see more folks sitting around the table and like you know women like we can speak to a certain type of women really well but like it doesn't stop there like it by no means and so i think like it's just like it's just more it's just more people more experiences like because that like no matter what creates a richer future for all of us to be living in and honestly like natasha was saying earlier like we're making decisions now like decisions are being made now people are building products people are designing products that like we're going to be living in in like two minutes and i think like just like trying to get more people in this design process for what is web3 what is the meta first like is so critical so crucial um like the sort of money and power aspect of it aside like of course i think that that's i want that to start flowing around to the table as well but like it's almost even deeper than that where it's like man like that's give me our life and like we we got to get some other folks in to help us figure out what that looks like one last thing i would say is just like more fun like yeah this is so serious all the time and like how can you just make it a little bit more fun it was definitely something i got extremely fatigued throughout like 2018 and 2019 it's like i was waiting for crypto to become fun again uh and it took a while for that to happen and i would have to say it became really really fun when all of these like in real life events started happening uh and uh i i didn't really notice it until after the fact but like 2018 2019 uh i i got through the bear market by hanging out inside of this one discord which i am now reflecting on there's uh one lady in that like 40 to 50 person discord and then and then i've gone out to all of these in real life events mainly in in new york and the number of web three power ladies that i've met are off the charts like i've met more lady friends than i have dude friends while going to all these in real life events and that's actually how i came to learn about boys club is because i met all the ladies that are in boys club uh and and so i do have to say like the the discovery of uh all the web three power ladies has happened around the same time where crypto became a lot more fun slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that combines the performance and ease of a centralized exchange with the openness and transparency of d5

one thing about the crypto industry that just like really just rubs you the wrong way is like oh god it's this thing again i hate this get this out of my face oh um i i um i mean i think this is true for a lot of people but like the sort of tribalism of it um is something that like i don't love and like i it's a it's part of why that like crypto twitter is is so valuable for me like professionally personally financially but like spiritually and emotionally i find a lot of conversations like i have a lot of feelings about a lot of the conversations that i see and i think it's like rooted from this like sort of heard mentality thing that um yeah i don't love but um i'd say i'd say that's that's me but i know that's like sort of shared by a lot of people i don't think that that's like a very interesting insight what about you natasha she's newer so she's a fresher like the dunking on somebody is just like so i hate it i'm just like what is the point of this like that that was like a lot of my first experience on twitter i was just like okay this seems like so much a part of the culture is like dunking on somebody and like i just don't really understand when so much about this is like about like the heart of it is like financial inclusivity and like a path forward for us all and then to be just like got you i'm just like that doesn't click for me uh if uh if uh dina if you were the one interviewing natasha or vice versa what question would you ask uh we'll start with dina um i would ask natasha what has surprised her the most about her journey in web 3 over the past few months what has been the most surprising aspect of it for you i mean my whole experience of web 3 has been with boys club so like it's impossible to separate those two things and i think how much it's working like it that has truly shocked me like i thought we were gonna the original idea for boys club was literally like let's bring 10 of our friends on my roof and like have a chickudery board and like pull up a dow deck and like go through it and be like you should get into this like that was what it was and it just worked like so much of it has just clicked for people and i've been floored by that and i have worked on like us i've having had a startup and just every day you're trying to get people to be excited about what you're doing like that is the work of every day and when it's not working it is so hard and you know it every day you're like nobody cares about this thing and then when it's working like the shift the gear shift has felt so extreme that i've just i've been really surprised by it and like it's speaks a hundred percent to the incredible people that are a part of boys club and like the women that are participating and just have such a warmth to share with one another and like it's not any credit to what dean and i are doing i think it's just a need that is right place right time and like right people who are excited about it so that has honestly i've been really shocked by that natasha what would you ask dina dina i want you to talk about like what got you into krypto in the first place like i feel like it's so much part of who you are so what was interesting to you about crypto what was like your aha moment um well the first thing what got me like my hook was so 2017 it was like altcoin bad day trading i and so the behavior was basically gambling i was basically just gambling and doing it very badly losing money like i was not good but there was just so much price action that was happening at that time that i was like man this is hot i want to get into that so i started there but um it i you know you fall down the rabbit hole as everyone says fell down the rabbit hole for me it was bitcoin at first and i was learning about it and um just felt so inspired and excited by what a new money that was being built from the ground up with a new set of values at the helm like what that could mean for things like financial inclusion and banking the unbanked so that was sort of that was the thing for me that got me just really juiced and at the same time like 2017 lambo's in front of crypto conferences like it was it was a different period and i was also just sort of recognizing that there was a systemic issue around access and accessibility for um frankly the folks who i felt could benefit from it the most and who who who um yeah who could benefit from it the most so that was that's like the sort of my mission and that was my mission then that's why i started that first company and that's what i see through with with boys club today but um yeah i just like for me it's about um like i'm just so excited by um just building new access like there's there's again like there's this huge amount of wealth and power that's being transferred like huge huge we're all seeing it it's running right before our eyes and like i'm just i just want to create spaces to ensure that like we're not just like copying pasting the same hierarchies of wealth and powers exist with traditional systems onto crypto onto what's happening now and so that's sort of like my reason for being that's my mission um great question natasha um so i'm sure you guys are faced with this scenario a lot uh and each scenario is obviously different but uh when you are talking to the cryptocurious ladies of web 3 who are trying to get into the space and they perhaps they say something along the lines of oh i don't think this is for me um obviously the answer as to why it's for you is very very unique to every single individual but if you're just meeting for this person for the first time maybe you've only talked to them for five or ten minutes and they've already given you the uh i don't think this is for me uh line what do you say next i mean usually i ask like why do they feel that way like what and honestly most the time it's rooted in an experience that made them feel stupid like they did something they felt dumb and then they thought oh this i gotta go like i'm not gonna do this and i feel like that's been so much of our community calls are basically therapy where people are like i feel really dumb like can i ask you this question or like i had this experience online or in person or listening to something and it's do it's like undoing that work for first because i think people are clouded by that negative experience and so i would say more often than not like that's been what has happened and they've sat at a dinner party where a bunch of dudes who know very little about crypto are talking about crypto and they're like oh they get it i'm like i've been at those dinner parties and i've been like we don't know i know what's going on and you're actually wrong and i'm like that's that's just a shared experience that i think a lot of women have and makes them feel left out and and it makes it really hard for them to want to participate in any way i also think like money is so emotional and it's also like it can be so taboo to talk about between women and i think one thing that people have found really powerful and empowering in being in community and boys club and talking about money and crypto whatever all the stuff that's happening here is like there's a freedom to it in the community that they don't find elsewhere in their lives like there's it is what it is we're talking about what we're talking about it's money basically it's all these other things of course as well but like that we've all sort of opted in to have this conversation with each other like there's this sort of freedom there that um i think is a big unlock for people but i'd agree with natasha like 95 of the community calls like we're talking about feelings we're talking about emotions like i had i actually have my notes right here today someone used the phrase deep-seated fear they were talking about deep-seated fears with me and i was like i'm here for it i can't wait to have this conversation with you like i'm 100 but like this is a lot but we're going to go there like we're going to do it together so yeah so in the in the future when boys club is maximally successful and it's fulfilled all of its hopes and dreams what does it look like do you want to take this or do you want me to you tell us no we know like we are we're we're creating a space where women can have more more money and more power like whether that means their projects being funded whether that means giving them investment opportunities um whether that means them just participating in our community and sharing in the upside of what's happening like that is the goal like women helping women win is like all of this is about and like we're doing that because we believe that crypto is the way to it and like everything that's happening in this space is the most direct path but i want to see like whether you are an artist who is seeing an opportunity for yourself to actually sustain your living through nfts for our community to be the place for you if you are an entrepreneur who has an idea and you want to make that happen in web 3 then i want you to be part of boys club if you are a teacher who is trying to build wealth for yourself and and you do not know how because this is the path that you're on i want you to join boys club and i want you to be a part of our dow and share in the upside and like that is that is the mission that's the goal and like it can become like it is it's it can become so political when you're like we're doing something for women people are like why are you you're doing such a political thing and i'm like no i'm not like i'm just inviting my friends to the table and hoping that we all like share in whatever happens next and so i think for us like there's all these different paths that we could talk about of how we get there but that's really the heart of it is like seeing seeing a more inclusive version of what is happening in the space with all types of people but our mission is for women to be at that and be at that table you know what is a maximally successful version of boys club look like yeah i think natasha nailed it i mean i guess my my sort of joke in that is that like they're just the paths that are in front of us where we take this next um rn like it's it's almost like that there's so much flexibility with what a dao is and how it comes together and how you get people to participate what type of people you're attracting to participate like there's it's so flexible that um that's almost like a challenge right like how what what decisions do we make in the next couple months in the next couple years um that get us to that ultimate end goal which is you know a community that is sharing in wealth um so yeah i think it's it we're totally aligned on goals it's just like the the details and the execution and and how we get there and so we're thinking a lot about product studio um as we talked about earlier we're thinking a lot about an investment syndicate um and and but you know also like sort of our heartbeat is is events and and community in in that way so um yeah i think there's there's a lot of open questions about like where exactly we go next but directionally that's where we're headed uh how can one other thing that i feel like we've left sort of out of the conversation and that we're doing is like we are curriculum is also like a part of what we're thinking a lot about and like how we onboard like tangibly on board to different protocols and projects and things that are happening um in a way that is like really supportive and very different from at least the exposure i had when i first started getting into this stuff um and before our first event like we put this like like thing up on our website that was like your first thousand dollars in crypto and it was like just stuff that we were doing and um like just to get people get the ball rolling if they had that aha moment like here's tangibly like go home and do this and it's working like all the time people are like in our discord asking questions about i'm on lesson two like i'm i'm getting stuck here can someone help me and that has been so cool and like this woman dm'd us on twitter the other day and she was like i'm going through it with my mom and i'm wondering x y and z and that's perfect that's so perfect and so we're really thinking about how how curriculum continues to evolve how we continue to produce alongside all these other things that are open questions and and projects we're working on but that feels really um content and curriculum feels really important as well to to tangibly help people get through the door on on these different projects do you guys have like a memory that you have out of boys club that just warmed your heart oh my gosh there's so many i mean i think one that stood out for me was at our first event um know we're there we do a little keynote we have a panel and like it's sort of you know you're first our first event it was like we're like beta testing it we shipped something fast and we're just like saying i had no idea what the feeling was gonna be and um this woman came up to me at the end of the event she was like uh so i'm like really uninspired in my current career i like working whatever and i really wanna pivot to what's happening in crypto web 3. i know nothing about it but like this is the path that i want to be on and um now she's one of our core contributors in the dao and like we've obviously nurtured her through like onboarding her into the space and getting her involved but like that for me um was just really special and it's really special she's you know still on very much on that journey but like i think just like again figuring out ways to let people see the opportunity for themselves and for this particular woman it was like she wanted to pivot professionally it's not gonna always be the case but that was like for especially for her first event was like okay i think i get why we're doing this like this i think we're on the right path here or something um man i truly i mean i do a boys club hang out like once a week so every week i'm like this is so so awesome but i think for me like after the first event dean and i had like dina had flown in we were both staying at 11 howard and i was like doing a staycation and the next morning we like got breakfast and it truly felt like the day after my wedding where there was just like so much love coming in like texts and dms and like emails and people just being like i am and all these women who had gone to this event and texted their friends and been like how do i get involved or they had seen it on instagram and they were like i've been looking for something like this and truly that feeling of being like wow that's so there's so much inbound excitement around this thing that felt like the first like oh this this worked and that was really amazing and that sort of like network effect of like 60 people were at that first dinner but they all went and told their friends about it and then all of them were like do you guys have a telegram and that experience was really special because so many of the women at that first dinner like my close friends like my like buddies who are like oh i'm really excited about what's happening and i've been sort of like too scared to ask these questions um so that was a really special like uh just eating a croissant at 11 howard going through some games on instagram was a really good moment if there are so there are for all the uh other dow leaders or industry leaders or people that that work in the space are listening to this how can they how can they support boys club what are you guys looking for yeah um first of all get in touch we i had a conversation yesterday with russell from 40 acres dow and it was amazing because it was like we're struggling first of all like building so many of the similar things and also struggling with a lot of the same questions so it's like when you're i think there's like for especially community jobs like i feel like there's like some knowledge sharing and transfer that like can be happening and we're so like primed and would love to do that with anyone and have a lot to offer but also i think can can learn clearly a lot as well so i think it's like that's something that we're really excited about collaborating with other dows and sharing some of these like what what are the pain points around like onboarding people at scale like how are how are we doing this and also preserving the vibe like natasha said like that's a really big open question and like we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time like we can like we can we can share some stuff especially when it's like a community-centric dial that's like sort of thinking about the same thing so um i think that that's um [Music] that is a big one for us um and i also think that like we're starting to think about product so that's like as that becomes interesting for as that's interesting to other people like definitely get in touch and like we we want to build for our community and then um like sponsorship dollars we're doing an event new york we're doing a fantasy we're doing event la we're doing event in austin like yeah come on down write us a check put those logos all over i'm sure we want to work with you they are mission online partners we're talking about of course i'm like no no no no no no no um so yeah for our first event we have um rabbit hole in public.com both perfectly mission line it's amazing they're incredible and um yeah we're um we're looking for folks that are you know clearly share share the same values so yeah so you guys put a big emphasis on in real life meetups uh what cities uh does boys club really have like uh strong like prominence in yeah new york for sure obviously um and then los angeles san francisco london we got like a a bunch of london london babes miami oh we're having we're doing another event in miami um so those are like our main hubs that we're seeing um come together and truly like as people are starting to form around that we're like creating channels in our discord for them to hang out and it's been cool to see like okay there's like like a few days ago i was like oh there's a ton of san francisco people like people asking for that and so um yeah obviously as that grows that will continue to to expand but those are really like the main cities that we're seeing um seeing boys club take hold and i think that sort of network effect around events um will i know will be true as we continue to do more events in other cities so i anticipate that um as we do that we'll see that sort of like spark of a new community form while we do that so for the women that are listening who are already a boys club pilled uh how can they find the boys club uh boysclub.vip and uh there's a big uh button that says enter the chat and basically just come in you fill an application and then we'd get in touch and send you the discord link so um definitely come one come all we're designed intentionally for women and non-binary
