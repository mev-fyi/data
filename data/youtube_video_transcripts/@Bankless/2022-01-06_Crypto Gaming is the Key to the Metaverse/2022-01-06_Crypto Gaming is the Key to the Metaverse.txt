david what are your thoughts on on crypto gaming and maybe as the key to the metaverse because i think both you and i see crypto gaming as basically a portal of first instance a manifestation of the metaverse what do you think about this category of bet yeah i think in 2022 the story is going to be a lot of gaming studios wanting to do crypto gaming and then getting a lot of pushback from their fans who don't want nfts in their games at all and then that friction leaving a lot of room for newer more indie upstart gaming studios to innovate and tinker with crypto asset powered games i think there's going to be a big story of like gamers and game studios having a lot of friction because game studios knowing that it's the right direction to go but also trying to answer to their very committed and loyal fan base and not trying to undermine them because you know in gaming communities everything
