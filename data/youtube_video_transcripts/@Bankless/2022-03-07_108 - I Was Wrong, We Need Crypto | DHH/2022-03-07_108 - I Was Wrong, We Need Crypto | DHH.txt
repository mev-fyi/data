you have your bank account canceled like how are you going to pay rent how are you going to buy groceries how are you going to do anything in modern society without access to your bank account right and this was one of those moments like they're willing to do that for this welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys the title of this episode is i was wrong we need crypto from david hannemeyer hanson dhh a crypto skeptic who's turned into a crypto advocate and this conversation will show you exactly why a few things to look out for some takeaways number one we get in the mind of a crypto skeptic how do they see crypto on the outside number two why most people won't actually be convinced until they have a catalyst for dhh that was the freezing of bank accounts in canada it's another thing i took away from this episode number three why crypto is the most important release valve for preserving civil liberties that we have right now david this was a really cool conversation with somebody who's been on the periphery of crypto and been super skeptical for the entire time but due to recent world events has just become crypto pilled and so uh it was a really fascinating discussion we don't get to have these very often on bank lists i'm grateful for it what were some of your thoughts i think the value of this episode is uh being able to view the crypto industry from a bird's eye view um dhh he's got a lot of just alignment with who he is and what his disposition is as a person with people that you would find inside the crypto industry uh he's a big picture thinker he's a futurist uh you know he's a coder uh and he's also a first principles thinker that is able to connect things like code to philosophy which are all the ingredients that kind of make up um somebody that generally becomes like crypto woke or crypto pilled and so the fact that he wasn't prior to this was interesting to me and hearing why he wasn't i think is a useful lesson for everyone in the industry because it paints a picture as to like what do we look like from the outside and i i've seen this happen many many times before it's like when big big name celebrities people with like over 100 000 followers on twitter that are anti-crypto and they are publicly anti-crypto on twitter uh their first interaction is with like the laser eyed huddle army like they they get to them first and then when they flip their minds it's also the laser-eyed huddle army that like starts to like give them praise and it's just that a lot of the people's first impressions of crypto come from like the crypto twitter armies whether they're like the the frog armies or the the bitcoin max maximus laser armies that's people's first impression about crypto and it's not often the best like best first impression doesn't often leave a good taste in people's mouths and so like that's kind of what we are up against because in my opinion the more pragmatic people that promote this industry don't break through the noise of just like the moon boys the chil the schillers the pump and dumpers because those people are super loud and super first and so learning from dhh that it takes a moment like the the freezing of canadian bank accounts to break through the noise that people see in this industry it's it's an important lesson to learn and i hope as an industry we're able to reflect on like hey how do we route around all of the negative uh loud noisy parts about crypto and get straight to the hearts of people without them having to be exposed by some of the crazy shenanigans that we see in this yeah absolutely it's a very fascinating story and dhh very eloquently kind of takes us through his process from going from from skeptic to advocate and he's very early in his bankless journey so far so we sort of end with uh some next steps that i think he's going to take to dive deeper down the rabbit hole and i hope you are diving deeper down the rabbit hole as well listening to bankless a fantastic way to do that as well is to stay tuned for these awesome tools from the bankless sponsors that make a bankless life possible we'll do that and then we'll get right to the conversation hey bankless nation just a quick disclaimer before we get into the podcast with dhh uh he holds nothing back so there are a few f-bombs and other naughty words of that nature

excited about our next guest this is david hannemeyer hanson dhh he's many things he's a product guy he's the creator of basecamp it's one of the first software as a service projects in the space also a technologist the creator of ruby on rails which is an open source application framework he's an entrepreneur as well talks a lot about building high margin businesses with no vc funding he's a writer as well i've read a couple of his books a bunch of them on digital work culture and lastly and this is the topic we're going to discuss today he's a former crypto skeptic who recently changed his mind on crypto on bitcoin and that's what we're going to be talking about a lot today his thought process and why he changed his mind dhh welcome to bank list it's great to have you thank you so much for having me on well we're gonna uh divide this show into two parts and i think the first part is really to try to get into the mindset of a crypto skeptic because uh everyone is in a bubble these days including the bankless audience honestly we are we are crypto natives we are hyped on the the crypto kool-aid we've fallen deep down the rabbit hole as you might say and we want to hear what it's like being a crypto skeptic kind of us a few years ago so talking through that and the second part is talking about why you changed your mind like what was the catalyst for that and what you think about crypto moving forward but first i think dhh uh some in crypto might not be familiar with with who you are uh so let's start there who is dhh can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do sure well i am originally from denmark and now i'm actually back in denmark but i spent 15 years in the us building a business called basecamp it's a project management and team collaboration tool that we started before sas was even called sas back in 2003 we started working on it back then when you actually had to talk to a real bank to get a merchant account to be able to accept credit cards there was no stripe there was no easy path to get on with this so we very much were not bankless back in 2003 and had to deal with that whole legacy infrastructure madness um and then i spent together with jason fried my business partner the next 15 years building a series of different businesses some of them we started some of them we wounded back down basecamp was the red threat through the whole time and then two years ago we launched a new email service called hey.com where we finally mustered the ambition to take on the gmails and the outlooks of the world after spending many years kind of shying away from a challenge of that proportion um went really well we thought we were going to go up against google with gmail and we ended up having our existential battle with apple over the app store monopolies and the gatekeeper roll which i'd probably say is one of those seeds that made me more interested in the crypto story um having to deal with gatekeepers who can block you out of marketplaces definitely radicalized me in certain ways but over those 15 years we also spend a lot of time thinking about how to build a business i was an employee before i was an employer and it left some deep scars on my psychic about how not to run a business and i wanted to do things very differently when we had our shot and jason or i documented those decisions that we took from first principle which is one of the other things i've been liking about crypto and bitcoin in particular rethinking some of the fundamentals of society and monetary policy and um methods of exchange from first principles anyway we spent the time thinking about some of those things from first principles putting them in action actually doing something which is another thing again on the bitcoin side i like a lot of people talking like well we should have different ways of organizing society which is just sort of philosophy which has its place but there's also practice and actually trying to change things i have a tremendous amount of respect for that and that's what we try to do we try to put our ideas our conclusions from analyzing things from first principles into action and then after we tried it a bunch of it didn't work and the parts that did work we wanted to tell other people about it so we wrote a bunch of books starting all the way back in 2006 with a book called getting real about how to start essentially a sas business um on the cheap without venture capital and all those things that led to a book in 2010 called rework which is our big best seller sold half a million copies around the world and that really was the greatest hits of 10 years of thinking 10 years of experimentation and 10 years of doing then we wrote a book called remote office not required in 2013 and at that moment i thought as perhaps um people in the crypto space they're like once i've gotten the wisdom and the gospel of course everyone is going to come over of course remote is going to be one of the dominant ways of working and it turned out that it didn't until about spring 2020 all of a sudden people were interested in what we had to say about that book we had a spike in sales that we hadn't seen for many years um so that was kind of interesting is a lot of this is timing and sometimes you can be so far ahead of the curve that you might lose faith a little bit that like the curve is ever gonna grow mainstream but then boom something happens and it does um which i'm sure we'll get into about this whole canadian business and and bitcoin that that was that sort of moment for me as other people had remote once the pandemic hit um and then finally we wrote a book called uh it doesn't have to be crazy at work which is one of the other things i'm really passionate about is um beating down the hustle mania this idea that we all have to work uh 80 hours or 100 hours a week otherwise we're not real true entrepreneurs um total [ __ ] i've spent 20 years working in technology on a 40-hour work week taking fridays off in the summer enjoying vacation enjoying hobbies racing cars having a family having other things go on outside my life instead of just this one thing um i actually just wrote about this this morning diversifying your life not having a single pillar that tries to hold up everything i think is a good idea and then of course during that whole time i am also a programmer and i've been a tireless evangelist of the ruby programming language ever since i adopted it back in 2003 and ruby on rails is the tool kit that i made for others to build web applications back then and i'm still super duper pumped and passionate about it um i know that several of the uh major players in the crypto space use that uh coinbase is started and run on ruby on rails and and many others so that's been a delight to see um and i think that's a good quick tour well that's yeah that's a very very robust resume uh david and actually i think there's a lot of uh alignment with how you lead your life your uh your a technologist uh also a futurist and you i think focus on um just the cultural relationship between technology and future society uh but also i think are interested in big big picture thinking like philosophy and first principle thinking and i think there's a lot of alignment there between a lot of the the crypto industry the crypto people where uh a lot of us are coders a lot of us are heads down builders but they also zoom out and share their like philosophy about like how the world works and and how how first principles thinking might um uh suggest changes to how society works and so uh i think as we go through this conversation there's a lot of uh uh and there's i think there's a lot of people like you out there um and it's just a matter of crypto finding its way into uh the minds of people like you and finding the right angle to convince you that like uh crypto has tools to enable all of those values uh is that kind of uh what you've seen out of crypto in the last year or so i think that's very fair and i think that part of why i had a particular slant on crypto in a particular take on crypto for many years and quite forcefully so was because i saw echoes and shadows of other things i really despised about the existing ecosystem of entrepreneurship i was forged in the dot-com boom and bust and i saw the charlatans i saw the scams i saw all that [ __ ] that went on and even though i'm i'm now far more sympathetic to some of the fundamental theses around crypto i still also see so much of that um but perfect in in some bizarre way that is comforting that the whole technology world could go through a dot-com boom and bust that was so jam-packed full of scam and [ __ ] and fraud outright and still survive get out on the other side and turn into this that we have today where in some bizarre way we're actually happy that the dot-com boom and bust happened because it allowed some totally ridiculous investments in fiber uh cables across the the continents and so forth that were fueled by some of that fraud and some of that uh um whatever setup so sometimes you have to go through an awkward phase i think with any new thing um and when it comes to crypto i've been perhaps overly focused on those aspects of it and not seeing as much of the big picture because it smelled too much like all the nasty stuff from the late uh 90s early 2000s actually uh dhh let's camp on some of the nasty stuff a little bit longer um because you wrote this fantastic blog post about this and and by the way i've been a follower of your your writing for quite a while the signal versus noise uh days uh and uh your original manifesto and really appreciated your clarity of thought uh in many of these things and this this blog post was was no different a very clear concise writing um but you titled it i was wrong we need crypto and you started talking about all of the things that you saw that you didn't like in crypto you said there's so much to oppose uh and i was interested to learn that you've actually been skeptical about crypto you must have heard about it in the early days since the early 2010s you said in your blog post but then you list a number of things that that you were skeptical and i want to go through these because i think a lot of people listening or a lot of people who need to to break outside of their current crypto bubble need to hear the criticism they need to hear the skeptic skepticism you talked about the huddle army you talked about laser eyes that that kind of feels like a flavor of culture that you didn't identify with you talked about the proof of work energy consumption is this bad for the environment that doesn't necessarily hold with your your value system uh the ridiculous fees and i imagine that kind of uh traps out those who aren't wealthy from the system that's probably a criticism the [ __ ] coins which are everywhere permeating the scams the volatility the tether as an example so definitely some some sketchy things going on the lack of real decentralization and on and on and on you say can we talk about some of those and parse them apart i'm wondering about maybe the the first section uh the huddle army and the laser eyes sounds like you've had some up close encounters with them on social media before what is that culture from from the critics perspective how does that culture uh feel to you and how did it ring previously yeah it rang like i was faced with a cult because it would be a set of of theses of talking points that were just repeated ad nauseum over and over again by people who dressed a certain way and looked a certain way and usually with the laser eyes right um from a motive i i had a hard time to find genuine that it was felt like a bunch of people talking their own book hey i bought some coins five minutes ago i'd like them to go up please so shut the hell up if you have any criticism that might make them go down um and then i thought a bunch of the arguments were almost tenets of faith that it had some of these religious widths to it that it wasn't necessarily so much about practical um applicability today which ties into some of these other things like for example the the throughput and the transaction fees like how realistic is this as a as a currency how well can it be used as a replacement of the dollar today um and i very often found the arguments for that lacking which is is perhaps part of this um notion where you come into like what timeline are we looking at are we analyzing what crypto and bitcoin is right now in this moment which is sort of what i was doing and i was getting some answers that i had a hard time squaring with reality a bunch of people saying no no you can actually buy a hamburger in venezuela or wherever it is um i was like that's not an argument in my book or i wasn't accepting that as like okay that means that this is a credible alternative to fiat currencies right now where i missed um and where i was wrong was a little bit on that time horizon yeah a lot of things aren't ready for for sort of the long haul that doesn't mean it couldn't be in five years or in two or ten um some things does take a long time like you look at uh virtual reality for example i remember watching the lawnmower man in 95 thinking holy [ __ ] we're all gonna live in the metaverse in about two years from now and what happened nothing that's what happened for about 20 years right so that was so far ahead of the curve and now my kids have this uh oculus thing they can jump on and like oh yeah that's actually the lawnmower man it's just like 20 years late or look at self-driving cars elon was telling us no no 2017 you might as well sell your car because all the cars are going to drive themselves and he's going to have this robot army and obviously he's like yeah that didn't happen did it and then now you get like oh yeah actually it was a slightly more difficult problem than we first anticipated then maybe now the correct time frame for the self-driving army of taxis is uh 2075. so sometimes it's really hard to gauge when that glimpse of the future is actually going to happen um you have these uh whatever jules warren's video phones predicted in 1872 right and it took a while until we got facetime but now we did and i will say that um i like the optimism of that and this is where in retrospect i'm a little disappointed in my myself because sort of the pessimism of today is has utility but a diminishing utility and i it needs to be counterweight by the optimism of tomorrow it needs to be counterweighted by some people seeing that there's a future that may not happen in two years even if they predicted it but like i'd probably be on t milan about the self-driving cars if the time frame was 2050 which in the grand scheme of thing is not that long human history is is is quite long and what we've accomplished in a few short years in our in my lifetime is incredible right so um this was one of the things where you fall into this trap of analyzing everything about today does it work today is it good today and you're like yeah you know what i find it coming up short which actually to be perfectly honest i still do i've just changed my my bias and my bias is for the future not just today and the bias has been infused by some of these things that have happened around the world where don't just like oh that could be neat if it happens where i'm like i really want this to happen which is also a bit of a shift i mean all the things i mentioned that i oppose i still oppose those things like the fundamental analysis of crypto and bitcoin's problems have not changed for me i have simply decided that i've seen that the costs in terms of [ __ ] and energy and all this other crap are worth it right so that's a the changing to different from cost to looking at value and you go like holy [ __ ] the value is substantially higher than what i thought this is the same thing i have about stock analysis right you can look at the best company in the world and you can go that is the shittiest investment in the world because it's way way way overpriced the best company in the world can be the worst investment in the world at the wrong price and a fairly shitty company could be a phenomenal investment at the right price right and i was simply mispricing crypto and bitcoin's value in terms of what i want in the world and what i thought was possible like we crossed some rubicons here with with the canada situation that just fundamentally changed my perception of western society there's a you started off this conversation talking about like the the the bitcoin twitter army the huddle army the laser eyes army and calling them like a cult and i mean i i see it too there there's there's just many of them they all have very similar profile pictures they all have the red laser eyes they all come chanting the same the same lines and so like inside of the the crypto industry we kind of get that perception as well but also i'd also make the claim that well the crypto industry as a whole is a little bit cult-like definitely less cult-like than the concentrated amount of like hodol army laser eyes maximalists but as if you zoom out to the whole entire industry we all kind of exhibit similar behaviors uh we'll all kind of chant the same things as like the uh the sacred values of open source software for example is something that almost everyone in crypto values uh and so like even though we're less cult-like i think when you zoom out and view the crypto industry as a whole like we're still it's we still kind of get that cult-like branding and i think a lot of it comes from a little bit of what you said where first principles thinking is so important in crypto because that's kind of all we have at the very beginning of this industry we only have an imagination we only have something to extrapolate upon it's like yeah bitcoin 21 million hard cap proof of work these are very simple components but according to the bitcoiners out there in 100 years and 200 years these two ingredients create like a utopia of fairly valued assets and and free money uh and i think as crypto has developed uh it's become easier and easier to imagine a a better future because we actually have made real innovations uh but we're only like 12 years into this into this whole crypto industry and really in my mind most of the crypto industry has only really been developed in the last four years or so the crypto industry that people know it today so it's still a large amount it's still a big ask for the rest of societies like hey use your imagination uh when which is a hard ask when there's like scams pump and dumps like how how the audacity to ask people to use their imagination to look around these things uh how does that reflection land on you it squares very well and this is also one of those ways where i've sort of grown milder on the cult aspect of it because i actually think they're necessary when you're trying to bootstrap a vision that broad that large that different you need delusional people because only delusional people will push against reality in the face of all odds in the face of all feedback in the face of all sanctions you need delusional people to change the world now the thing is just because you're delusional doesn't mean you'll change the world but most people who ended up changing the world were delusional they had outrageous ideas and imagination and i think this is one of the things with with musk and sometimes these things connect where i i had a sort of bemused slash fairly critical perception of musk as a character and he's obviously a huge character in crypto particularly for people who are not in crypto right like he's the foremost spokesperson on off um for this and and you sometimes go like well is this a referendum on whether i like musk and people like him because if it is and i don't like musk for whatever reason then i also don't like crypto like that's pretty lazy thinking that is not first principles thinking it is very motivated reasoning and i got sucked into perhaps a slight little bit of that which is also perhaps how some of these things soften right you go like well i didn't think musk was going to sell a million teslas i thought there's no [ __ ] way and [ __ ] he sells a million teslas he bootstraps this thing or not just bootstraps it he rockets it pun intended into space to the moon in much shorter time perhaps not the timeline he originally proposed but much shorter time than anyone else would have thought and go like do you know what um yeah i was wrong on that i didn't think he'd do it um just good time to revisit what other things might be wrong about what other delusional camps because if there's one thing musk is it is absolutely delusional he's probably one of the most delusional people on earth again doesn't mean he can't make his delusions come true and there's inspiring aspects of that it's hugely inspiring and i'd rather see delusional people try and then fail than everyone just going around in this hyper realism of like nothing is ever possible anywhere anytime everything has to be the way we've done it for the past whatever 30 or 100 or 200 years and that's just it this is the end of history that is just a deeply pessimistic view of human ingenuity and i want to be on team human ingenuity i want to be on team like we try new [ __ ] and it won't all work um now all of that has limits and it doesn't mean there are negative externalities and that doesn't mean that there aren't reason to criticize things and so forth but i want to be able to hold those two things in my head at the same time i can be skeptical about all these things i list to propose while still being like go on let's see where this uh where this goes because i uh particularly now or after this business in canada have just come like i i would very much like this to be true i'm not 100 sure i'm convinced it's going to be but i am convinced now that it is very very worth trying and we're going to get to the business in canada and why you changed your mind but uh there's one more thing i want to camp on before we get there because um you just said it a couple types of this podcast and the title of the article uh has has this in the title as well i was wrong you know i feel like no one ever says that dhh no one ever says that anymore like it's a ver it's very rare to hear people say flat out i was wrong and i changed my mind and here's why is this something you've just started recently doing or like tell tell us how to be wrong about things because i feel like people today um like myself included it's very difficult to admit that we're wrong about things uh what have you learned about even just saying those three words clearly that they have a magic power because i think half of the virality of this post was in those three words i was wrong like the tweet ended up being tweeted like or seen five million times and the post was read a lot and i exactly because this moment of all the moments that i recall is such ideologically divided we're all in our little ditches here we all have our helmets on to protect us against the other side and it makes it very difficult to go over to the other team and say like hey you have you had a good point but this is something that i've been really interested in for quite a while this deterioration of our shared debate and i think twitter actually is is one of the key catalysts as to why this has fallen apart why everyone has fallen into ideological camps that they can't get out of and their minds just close in on them until they can only recite the same points that their team is chanting um and i particularly saw this in the handling of the pandemic are you able to process new information and update your world view according to that new information or do you just stick with whatever you decided at the time you decided it um i was quite forcefully for the early and harsh response in terms of lockdowns and masks and all these other things that we needed to do something this was a critical threat um and then as things carried on i kept keeping up with i was about to say it but i won't say it because even that has fallen into a goddamn camp which is like follow the science um sidebar it seems like most people who go capitalize that follow the science or the people least likely to actually follow the [ __ ] science um but that's sort of a besides things i just saw enough during the pandemic i saw enough of myself being thinking something is true and then finding out it's not true because data came out and disproved it finding a bunch of people who were so certain about what was true and not true fall flat on their [ __ ] face when what they thought was true wasn't true or when it changed five minutes later and just being incapable of saying those words oh i got this one wrong right isn't that by the way what the science is supposed to be that it's a process where we get more and more right over time and that requires us to be wrong and accept that we were wrong over time so i've just been incredibly frustrated by just this deterioration of the debate and because i love debate is one of my favorite things in the world is to engage with people about topics that really matter and go at it bring my best arguments to the game and then if the other side brings even better ones go like [ __ ] that's good i learned something i am now smarter and wiser and i will incorporate this into our world and this is how we improve like otherwise you're going to just sit on this stationary point where you accept a set of tenants that's handed to you from your team leaders and like that's what you just keep playing over and over again that that's just an utterly uninteresting life to me an unexplored life a life incompatible with first principle thinking no thank you so um i wanted sort of distinctly with this to set an example to the other side particularly on this topic where i have been a ferocious critic of crypto and bitcoin like if you search at dhh bitcoin on twitter you'll just find like 10 years of me um alternating between [ __ ] on the idea to uh fighting with the huddle army to just all these other things right all the stages of it how much of that was just trying to tweak the community a little bit like just trying to like you know poke at them it actually it wasn't i mean this is what i often get accused about because i have fairly strong opinions about a unreasonable wide array of topics that people think i don't have them in good faith that like enjoy being a troll i don't i enjoy debate i enjoy learning and i also enjoy communicating my ideas and my conclusions once i've reached them but like there aren't conclusions forever trains my mind on so many stuff so much stuff over the years and if you've been on the internet for 20 years as i have and you have not changed your mind about stuff there's something wrong with you you're simply not capable of computing and digesting new information and new data because there's no way that all the ideas and preconceptions you had 20 years ago are still accurate and spot on 20 years later no way like right now actually our half-life is more like six months right like it seems like we we keep getting things uh increasingly wrong so that should come with some humility and this is the other thing i've really gained from this pandemic thing is that like nobody knows anything on sort of a broad scale everyone is wrong about so much stuff all the time and that should imbue us with some humility that when we think we're so right about something that we could be wrong and um that's perhaps even likely that we are and internalize that and use that as a method as a scientific process for learning and becoming better and wiser and updating our world views and this is what i'm trying to do not even trying to do i mean i kind of feel like it was shoved down my throat with this canadian business like it wasn't just i like oh actually um bitcoin i've been shooting on it for 10 years let's just go back to the books here and study things again from first principles and maybe i'll arrive at a different conclusion that's usually not how it happens right like usually there's a catalyst and i had a catalyst it's just the question is whether you grab that catalyst and let it drive you somewhere new with your thinking or if you're just gonna ignore it and say that's a really inconvenient fact it doesn't square with my world view let me shut it out that's gotta be some propaganda the other side is lobbying at us um no no no no no stay in my box la la la la la la la that that's what's so fascinating about this story is is reality forced you to consider crypto and let's let's talk about that catalyst then so what was it and you know i i think bankless listeners dave and i have been talking about the the events in canada over the last couple of weeks so broad strokes they may be somewhat familiar with with the story but maybe you could go through the story as well as uh you know as you as you you talk about kind of your your wake up to crypto so what was it about the canadian trucker protests and subsequent government action that change your mind on crypto so it starts with my conception of canada as a stable western democracy with solid mainstream perhaps even bland leadership that is polished and will play within sort of the overtone window and will stay within the guardrails of what we establish democratic norms and due process and rule of law and so on to be with right so this is my idea this is what canadians are right like these really again this is a stereotype but polite people will apologize if they bump into you or if you bump into them um and this is sort of just what i'm thinking and then this trucker protest starts and first i go like huh interesting it starts in canada of all places that's uh that's that's some gumption there that these truckers decide that like they've just had enough okay first of all um i have sympathies to the to the fundamentals but i tried right from the beginning and maybe this will seem like well you're just talking up their civil liberties case because you agree with them but i try at least to adhere to principles that i can have some principles that apply to people even the ones i don't like or whose causes i don't like like freedom of speech or freedom to transact that that's not just rights and principles for people i like but anyway in this case which actually perhaps complicates the the argument i actually did have sympathies with it and part of this was i've been living in denmark and we essentially have what the canadian truckers wanted and end of restrictions an open society and acceptance that like um we're going to carry on with life and we've made it through the hard times and da da da right so first of all there some sympathies then this weird thing happens to me which is wow they are remarkably and i've learned my lesson now i'm not going to say peaceful remarkably non-violent like you look at a bunch of other uh protests that have been happening over the last few years like it takes about five minutes before [ __ ] is burning right and you go like huh it's not it's not burning now i know because i've heard from literally hundreds of canadians that there is great dispute over peaceful non-violent uh where the bouncy castles just the pr this that and the other thing but i think generally there is somewhat of a consensus i hope that this was not breaking out in looting and rioting and burning buildings sort of five minutes into it right which ended up frustrating some of these motivations for for dealing with it because that doesn't mean it wasn't a serious problem i can recognize like shut bridges and cut trade and if i had an apartment in downtown ottawa that had been listening to honking horns for two weeks i'd probably be out of my [ __ ] mind too right so accepting all that but here comes the sanctions at first this thing would go fund me happens they raised 10 million dollars through fund me gofundme gets a request across borders not even in their own jurisdiction that like hey could you like not give them the money and go [ __ ] go fund me like an american company american exactly domiciled yes gofundme is in the u.s um here's some [ __ ] police in ottawa saying to go fund me that they have no jurisdiction over right um hey could you like not give them the money they raised and they're like sure what else would you like would you like me to re-donate that money to some other causes we can do that too whatever you want boss and just go like wait what the hell is that's weird do we know why gofundme was just just rolled over so easily because i don't because i think they agreed essentially with the politics of it that um the politics was that these are essentially domestic terrorists of a sort um there may be some weird happy terrorists that set up bounty cancels and have cookouts and and don't burn down buildings but domestic terrorists nonetheless um so if you have that sympathy you're obviously sort of likely to follow which to some extent you can go like private company their own terms of service i guess they can interpret it how they want i thought deeply problematic but maybe someone else will do it right and someone did go send me or give send go i think it was called or something another side um then raised a bunch of money were foiled hacked and all these other things and this was already troubling but there was nothing compared to what came next in my opinion this is where things just went like this can't be real when they introduced the emergency powers act first invoking it on the ground they invoked it on a an act created for essentially sort of like mass casualty events mass terrorism mass the country is in serious disarray we need rewards like powers emergency right and i go like this is that the trucks annoying cutting trade serious um all these reasons but emergency at this level that is just bonkers bananas and now you can just invoke this power on your own accord you have seven days to get it ratified by the parliament and so on this is just crazy but then the crazy thing is is what this gives you power to do what they interpreted as giving you power to do hey i can cancel your bank account with no due process with no opportunity to defend yourself on like i think you're involved with something and not only for the people who were involved with the protest but for the people who supported the protest that was the one that really just exploded my brain you donated to one of these uh campaigns to raise money for the truckers and you could see your bank account cancelled because of that that's an incredibly serious uh sort of sanction you have your bank account canceled like how are you going to pay rent how are you going to buy groceries are you going to do anything in modern society without access to your bank account right and this was one of those moments like they're willing to do that for this just to be clear this was a possibility as in the emergency law that was invoked enabled that to be true but we don't we didn't did we see any uh donators actually get their bank account frozen we did yeah there's some dispute about uh where there there was some um sort of anecdotes of uh donators getting their bank accounts frozen i think a bunch of this stuff is still murky what is not murky is that more that several hundred people had their bank accounts frozen for perhaps uh participation or alleged participation without a due process process um and then that in itself like not only did they say these powers were going to be used they used them so that just really was like a break in the matrix where you just go like this is not supposed to happen in this country according to this thing if this can happen then i always go this is one of the things inside of our company right like we have this minor thing and i go like i'm really surprised that could happen if that could happen i think a b c and d could also happen so i go like if the canadians are willing to cancel people's bank accounts without due process on the basis of this kind of protest i i don't think i okay now we're outside the norms i thought governed western democracies and if the the um the canadians will do it what will the french do what would the austrians do what will the danish do and i go like i don't know anymore i thought i knew i thought i had this idea of what it meant to live in a western democracy it's it's been undermined and the ramifications of that must adjust well it had to adjust my world view and that was the second order terror that i felt was the number of people who looked at these acts and went like yeah what's the problem i don't see a problem these people are bad people they [ __ ] deserve that and i go like what didn't we spend hundreds of years like since magna carta ford to have due process to have constitutions to have charters of freedoms and rights and you're willing to throw all that [ __ ] out over this oh jesus this this also blew my mind uh you know and i i want to you know dwell on we talk about it free freezing a bank account like what that actually means for for somebody because likely everyone is listing is you know many people who've listening have not been in that position um but it means no longer being able to asset access your assets it's your life savings a lot of it's in a bank account unless you're going bankless which which hopefully you are if you're listening the ability to strain your money cancel all your credit cards stopping mortgage applications like this is complete elimination from the economic system that's the power that centralized governments wield when they can do this sort of thing and only maybe 200 were affected this time but i think what you're saying is yeah this time right like and this is such a this is such a troubling um power that governments now have that i think when we were framing the the constitution the u.s and charter of rights these sorts of things in western liberal democracies um we didn't have a concept of of digital money did we at those times i mean we're using like gold as a backing and there's there's some some element of paper money but it was all these these were all bearer instruments they weren't generally custodied anywhere and they certainly couldn't be frozen with a mouse click by a central government so we're living in a completely on mass arbitrarily so we're living in a completely different world in this digital era and i don't think people realize how much power centralized institutions have over their population and i i'm saying what you're saying is it's straight scary and not only that i think what you're also saying is it's scary that other people don't see how scary it is so i'm curious about some of the feedback from from your post dhh because we wrote a few things uh we talked about it on a bank list uh we wrote a few posts on our newsletter uh one entitled um canada needs crypto uh and i got a lot of pushback um from canadians in particular uh from other folks around the world but in particular from from canadians and uh just for the bankless audience who doesn't know who don't know this i was actually born in canada i grew up in canada so and i have many of my family in canada so i've been talking to them through this process but what have some of what has some of the pushback been to what you've been saying about this that's perhaps the sort of third order scariness is how shallow that push back is that the pushback essentially boils down to um it was the other team what do you mean the other team doesn't deserve rights they don't deserve freedoms they're bad people and why wouldn't you want bad things to happen to bad people like what's wrong are you one of them right essentially that's the insinuation and not even the simulation several times the actual accusation that you are one of the bad people if you sympathize with this um which connects to this other point we were talking about like the debate breaking down the um tribalism that's forming and now we're getting into the stage that tribalism is powering essentially discarding these fundamental principles of western democracies that we have due process which is one of the just iron-clad um elements of this right that you don't just throw away due process you don't throw it away this lightly and you certainly don't throw it away just because you don't like the accused of what they've been accused of this is why we have due process because a sometimes you're wrong happens all the time people are accused of things that they are not guilty of and they are not convicted um second of all if you don't have that process you don't you don't even have an opportunity as an individual accused to defend yourself what am i being accused of was this actually me all these other things you think these are cornerstones and the cornerstones are just it's like they're made of sand for these people um so the fact that this is all just boiled down to like do i like these people or not and if i don't like them [ __ ] them that is where i've often found these comparisons to uh the former yugoslavia or the soviet bloc or these other genocides or any other things you got to be quite careful making those comparisons because it very quickly becomes overwrought but you can see sort of the kernels the sparkles of that in it that once you demonize dehumanize the other side that they're essentially just irredeemable and rights should not apply to them and freedoms should not apply to them like there aren't that many skips and hops before we're in a really really dark place the other thing that blew my mind is just a purely tactical one are you so short-sighted that you can't see that these new norms that are being formed will be imposed upon you that five minutes from now when the other team is in power they will now follow the road map you've laid out and particularly when we go of some of the support that's come from the us you go like we're about five minutes away from a major wave switch it's going to be red come november it seems like everyone is predicting that right wouldn't you want to prepare for that eventuality um one of the ways to think about it is is um that you don't want to grant the the people you love the power to to hurt someone in a particular way if you don't want the the people you hate to hurt the people you love that way too right that there's sort of a symmetry here do you want that if you show up for a protest and you get identified on a photo and that gets mapped somehow your bank account is canceled tomorrow and that's just it because you're guilty without any process without anything would you want that applied to you this is what i really don't get when this argument comes from the left which is like hey have you seen a g20 meeting lately do you know what happens at those have you seen sort of a protest for for black lives matter or anything else like how often some of these protests devolve into something serious and would you want the repercussions of that expression of democratic basic freedoms to result in this i don't think you do i really don't think you want this to be a power that the other team has and that's how we should set up the rules so that when you're in power you're constrained in this way when they're in power they're constrained in the same way if you remove the constraints don't come crying when the other side then goes at it with well i'm already crying i think this is just terrible and and this is why i'm getting to this point of like do you know what we need some release valves here we need some basic protections in the way that cash used to be because getting in someone's cache had a lot of friction they could hide it it couldn't be tracked easily when it was spent it had all these properties where i was actually thinking of like do you know what if cash was the new app that came out tomorrow it's like wait no one can track my purchases i can just give it to other people without a record uh i can hide it in the shoe bugs as they feel i feel like cash sounds pretty cool we should we should use some cash um but there's all these other reasons for why cash has has issues in in modern day and and digital cash and crypto currencies solve a lot of those things and i don't actually necessarily want a world where all currencies are crypto and everything is on track and everything but i want the release valve because i've seen what can happen to people if it isn't there and again when i talk about this some of the pushback i get is like well uh bitcoin wouldn't have helped them there's some truth to that like they weren't set up and there aren't enough off-ramps and all these other things and if you go through a um an exchange that's still a single point of failure and it can still be shut down as it was in canada when they expanded these powers to crypto exchanges and basically said like hey if you transact with any of these people on the no fly list then um you're going to be in trouble so we need the ideals of something like decentralization to be actually true that you don't need to go through any of these exchanges any of these points of pressure and that isn't fully true today so again i'm speaking to the vision i'm speaking to the ideals i'm speaking to tomorrow to some extent but like i want to see that tomorrow can't come a lot of what you're saying i think we echo with with similar words one thing i'm i'm concerned about is like this whole uh team trucker versus anti-team trucker like the whole in-group out group thing you we can extrapolate to almost what seemingly like the rest of the world right now like the the both the left and the right in the united states rioted in 2020 for their own respective reasons like the the democrats and the republicans it seems to be less a matter of governance these days than it does seem to be a game of chess uh and it really just seems to be like what move can i make that harms the other team the most and people are not extrapolating to that where it goes to just it's the bottom of the barrel race race to the bottom uh and i'm and you you cited um one of the reasons why some of these dynamics are playing out is because of twitter and social media which i think we are most of society is generally familiar about how like things like facebook and the algorithms behind twitter promote rage and so it seems to be like the social systems that we have are really doing a fantastic job of convincing people that it's okay to remove due process from the world like one thing i tweeted out recently is like there's find me a better duo which is anti-government protests and the 2020s like pick your team because they've all every team has like had a protest against their respective government at some point in time and and we're watching even russian citizens protest against the russian government right now also getting their apple pay google pay cancelled at this very moment which is a topic that we might return to um but but but dave you talked about how like you're a fan of a fan of a release valve do you think some of the properties about crypto the decentralization the censorship resistance is that the release valve that we need not just for the trucker issue but also uh just for a lot of this the dynamics that we see in modern day society yes but it is not as clear in other domains that there's something promising there right like this is one of the reasons i've actually been quite pessimistic about u.s society for some time is that like i'm failing to identify even the promising future release valves for a lot of the ills that are currently plaguing that society and that's what has me excited about bitcoin and crypto uh more broadly is that like there's something here it's not where i wanted to be to be this fully functioning release valve but there's something at least and it now has been validated over serious amounts of time with serious amounts of interest and money and so forth so that gives it a credibility that uh other ideas don't have because they're just ideas this is something real um it's not quite there yet but the other thing that gives me hope is i've been living in a country where this broadly didn't happen uh denmark is a western democracy and i don't know sometimes it's just luck right like the random permutations that run through societies but for whatever reason uh the danish society ended up on the other side of pandemic with higher trust in the media higher trust in each other higher trust in government you're like that was not what happened in the u.s it seems to be perhaps not what happened in canada i'm not quite sure i haven't looked at those polls but it gives me some hope this is possible eve i mean twitter exists in denmark but it's not the same defining character as it is in the us it doesn't set the political agenda on a on a daily basis so it is possible somehow to survive this i'm not sure what the secret trick is yet i'm trying to diagnose it i'm trying to figure out like what is it that make it makes it different and perhaps some of the um sort of depressing conclusions could be like well these are complicated social systems that evolve over hundreds of years well okay great i don't have a few hundred years i'll be long dead by then i'd like to see things be better in the u.s before that um but maybe there are also other things and we just haven't discovered them yet and bitcoin and crypto at least is a answer to a release valve on some of this stuff um in ways where ironically i'm not i'm not exactly a big gun fan either but like the principles about around the second amendment have that in them they're like we want to release valve here if tyranny rises above us we will have something to defend ourselves which by the way i mean cue ukraine and shouldn't get too far into that but like a bunch of people were just suddenly handed weapons because they were invaders um who showed up in their bedroom more or less literally right that there is some sense of like i need a defense when the state turns against me and bitcoin and crypto offers the most credible defense when the state turns against me that i've yet seen now that doesn't mean that defense is impenetrable and doesn't mean that defense is perfect but it's better than anything else i've seen um and that seems compelling in much the same way that encryption is compelling a huge fan of encrypted messaging end-to-end encryption i think the revelations that came out from snowden's 2013 stuff again was one of those things actually to me it was very much like the canadian trucker situation you're like wait are you telling me that the tinfoil hats who told me that the nsa was listening to every email in the world they were right that's crazy um but they were they were right that there was an agency that was ingesting essentially everything and that our best defense against that was mass end-to-end encryption that this is how we throw sand in those gears such that the automation and ease of surveilling an entire world just can't proceed um so signal to me is one of those it has like a bitcoin-ish quality to it it's one of the most promising like here is an app that is very difficult to penetrate not impossible a motivated state actor can do almost anything um but you can't do it at a mass scale hopefully i mean until the next revelations perhaps come out but right now best knowledge is you're not going to surveillance uh signal users at the 10th million scale right could we get to the same thing with the bitcoin thing where a target operation against a single individual through great labor and effort could still happen i mean if you're physically inside the borders of canada eventually they're going to get you if they want to get you right but that's different than clicking a button or passing it on to someone hey banks could you just like shut off this list of 200 people and i think societies need that level of friction it's too tempting otherwise to go down extremely dark paths that are scarily effective very quickly again if you do those comparisons which you always have to be careful with but like uh the stasi or whatever was going on in east germany and so on you like what they were trying to keep taps on people if they had the powers that are currently available where would they go i mean and the depressing thing is you don't even have to look back in history now we're looking in reality what's happening right now what are people with these powers doing with these powers [ __ ] i don't like it yeah i i i mean there's there's such an element of how how fast this all happened right and it's it's one of those things i think dhh we haven't really had to think about very much in uh our adult lives over the past you know 50 to 70 years right so when we think about our uh civil liberties and how they're actually protected we just take for granted that they're protected but how are they actually protected well we we have kind of two mechanisms in place don't we we have the constitutions and the charter of rights and all of these things and kind of the law at the base layer and then we also have like legitimacy and social norms to enforce those law and what was striking to me about this whole canadian trucker incident is both of those things were revoked in a very short time frame okay so like the you know chart of freedom bam 30 days is gone now a centralized government can decide what to do and social norms which is is kind of the backstop to protect that uh the society's saying no this is an unacceptable government you can't do this that completely collapsed as well and it all happened in a hurry um so i guess the thing that we see in crypto and i'm wondering if you see this is we see not just bitcoin but in all of crypto a set of credibly neutral protocols that can't make these types of decisions they can't freeze your assets they can't stop you from transacting they can't censor you you can always use them to trade and facilitate banking and that's why i think it feels like a release valve that um western democracies need that classical liberalism needs maybe that we need going into the the 20th century like i don't know about you but like i plan to teach my kids encryption how to use crypto how to use defy not just as like geek skills but like these are becoming 2020s life skills you have any thoughts on that yeah i that that's what um why i also went so forceful out i was wrong because i had far more faith in the fact that those norms were going to hold and the fact that we had those constitution those charters that that couldn't just be trampled over that quickly for that little and it really had to reorientate my my beliefs and all sorts of other things and reorientate my priorities because i do think that the states for example have a right and a duty in fact to collect taxes and the tax evasion is bad and there's all these other things right um but then when they just when what happens happened you gotta go like okay um i believe all those things still but now i believe that there's higher values that if the charter of freedoms and rights won't protect canadians and the constitution won't protect uh americans and our constitution in denmark might not protect danes we need something else we need like a final line of defense um and as you say the ideal version of crypto and this is one of my criticism how true is it actually in practice today uh how decentralized are these things actually today to which extent are the exchanges now just the new modes of of pressure points but let's just take the idealized view here that like you're holding your own bitcoin and no one can really stop you until they physically uh get to you that feels like um when the fbi shows up at apple's headquarters and say hey i have an iphone can you can you decrypt it it's just that we can get at the messages and they go like even if we wanted to no can't do it don't have the keys the stuff on here is locked now is that actually truly true in all the cases i don't know but there's a sort of an ideal here and also a reality for a lot of people in a lot of cases what this is true encryption does provide some of these fundamental last line of defense protections against these things and they will also protect people who are quote unquote and not quote unquote bad this is one of those fundamental tradeoffs here that freedoms allow bad people to do bad things accused bad people to do good things and and vice versa and all of the above right but i think what we have not appreciated is some of the basic technology of society like cash the friction it had the privacy it offered we just thought those were inconveniences and we never stopped to think about like what purpose does this actually solve what's problems what stability does this infuse what sort of backstop does this offer in the same way at least in the original interpretation of the second amendment when a single person with a gun was actually a credible threat to state oppression provided a backstop there where you could say that is a credible backstop here if if this turns into a full-on tyranny they're gonna have trouble with a bunch of people with muskets right that part is perhaps not so true anymore but i think it is true on some of these uh other factors and we're just we took it for granted we didn't fully understand it um i read a wonderful uh thread here the the other night about uh honor systems that i hadn't even thought about honor systems in the sense like do they serve a purpose like what is the purpose of an honor system where you go like some of these high honor systems you you insult someone and all of a sudden you're in a duel and just think like well that's that's really stupid that's really dumb it doesn't have a purpose and you dive into it and you realize no there actually is a purpose that society evolves these norms and practices and in the honor case it's a way of essentially projecting that like hey we have a bunch of people here that that are um benevolent characters and if they show up at their your doorstep they better damn well know that you'll just go to a duel over an offense because that means you can't just be easily cowed and oppressed and and so forth that was anyway the thrust of that threat but that we don't understand all the working blocks of society and when we start tinkering with them like phasing out cash and facing in digital payments that are fully surveilled and controlled by the government we haven't fully understand what we've lost and these are some of the realizations the canadian thing is is bringing us like oh this would not have been possible if we were still cash based you just couldn't i do think i do think if if you tried to propose uh cash in most most parliaments most congresses in the world today and you described what it would be they'd never they'd never it would never get approved you know it would be it would be derided as something for terrorist financing and like you know uh child pornography and all of these things and states would never approve it which is happening right now with encryption every seemingly two years some country around the world goes like encryption is really bad because child pornography and terrorists right like these are the two recurring boogeymans we have um and you go like yeah but also no right like most freedoms to some extent um have this freedom to to be used for bad things it does not mean we should not have freedom the safest thing in the world was it we'd all just be in a rubber cell right like we can't hurt ourselves we can't hurt anyone else would you like that life would you like to live in a perfectly safe rubber cell um no please bankless is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit

assets over to arbitram using bridge.arbitrum in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free david you've definitely seemed to be pretty well convinced on the whole non-sovereign store of valued non-sovereign money outside of the the hands of government and that's like the first crypto rabbit hole that people go down it's the rabbit hole that bitcoin invented bitcoin came first but since the crypto industry has developed there's we've created a number of other rabbit holes as well and i'm wondering since you've definitely gone down the bitcoin rabbit hole and seemingly come out with the thumbs up if you've also gone down like the defy rabbit hole for example you've brought up the issue of well we have centralized exchanges as choke points uh but in the crypto world we kind of have an answer to that in in defy but then there's also like the nft rabbit hole and the web3 the web3 social media rabbit hole i'm wondering if the fact that you've uh given bitcoin the thumbs up if you've uh have since opened your mind to other areas of the crypto industry as well bitcoin's just the gateway drug man i know um i'll say that like i'm not as far in that process i'm still highly in some cases extremely skeptical about some of the things but at the same time i'm intrigued so one of the defining moments for me was growing up with computers in the mid 90s with the demo scene so it particularly in europe there was a strong scene around the amiga computer and the commodore 64 where you had these demo groups that were competing with each other to produce cool digital art and they all had avatars and they all had pseudonyms and like it was really cool and then everyone it kind of rolled into the web right and then the web got all business now we were all with our formal names and our one identity and our very serious jobs and our commerce and so on nfts for to just take one example feels a little bit like that early demo scene in ways that are just like interesting um even though i still have uh grave misgivings about like yeah but you're buying a url that points to a thing that could change and it's not the actual thing and and all of that stuff um but this is also one of those um um i i quoted this thing and i'll probably butcher the quote but it was essentially something like um disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real what is not [ __ ] about like traditional art and paying 200 million dollars for a picasso or something like how different is that actually i understand that there's a physical piece and there's only one piece and so on but you could also just get a poster of it getting a poster of uh uh monet is basically like right click save it's not that different from right click save yet a bunch of people who like art go like those idiots with enough teas like right click save gotcha and you go like yeah that's what a poster is more or less too right yet there is some value to holding the actual [ __ ] monet on your wall right like it has some social cachet and like that's mostly a social convention in many ways the poster is better it's more durable and it can be replaced and all these other things so there's some of that i'm still highly conflicted i still have these issues of like you're just buying a url that points to something that could disappear and also by the way that so much of that space actually is centralized and now the api is about open c and so forth if that goes down and the whole thing goes down where the [ __ ] is the decentralization all these other things and then of course you also have the endless scams and the the juicing and the pumping and the dumping and all this other stuff that just really muddles the water but i've gained some clarity to at least like squint and see kernels of interestingness and also like do you know what i don't have to buy an nft if i don't like an mmt or if i don't even like the concepts of it i don't have to do it i could also just not like no one is forcing me to buy an nft right um so i'm also pretty happy with the idea of consenting adults um i've been this way on drugs for a long time like hey i actually haven't done a lot of drugs but i totally respect people who want to do that within some limits and you find there's certain things where it tips over and so on but i'm also curious yeah i'd like an lsd trip please can i get a totally safe one where i'm assured that's going to be 100 lsd and i'm laying on this couch in a padded room where i won't jump out the window that sounds great um so i'm at like that stage perhaps somewhat with with some of these things um on the web 3 thing perhaps is the one where i have the most trouble and perhaps that's part because i have worked in the web world and done a bunch of things with web application uh setups and when i look at a bunch of the problems that are supposedly being solved um i once saved this ad that i saw on twitter from ibm bragging about how they were using the blockchain to i don't know pass apples around or something and i just thought this is the stupidest thing i've ever heard in my life just use a goddamn relational database what the hell is the blockchain going to do for you in the tracking of apples or whatever right and i just there's so much of that but what this experience have given me and what this canadian situation and this revised view and bitcoin has like hey bet on optimism better tomorrow better on the fact that i may be wrong and maybe i just like maybe one day nfts will click for me in a different way and i'll totally shed my ideas of it and like hey this is just a another make-believe like everything is [ __ ] make-believe and all these social conventions uh we build up about things um and and it'll work i'm not there uh one step at a time right like one uh one foot inside one rabbit hole uh once uh first and then we'll see where we go i uh one next rabbit hole maybe that that probably david and i recommend that uh that you journey down is the decentralized finance rabbit hole because you mentioned a few times about like exchanges centralized exchanges being a vector of control for governments and and third parties and of course they are in the case of canada i believe canadian authorities white uh blacklisted a whole bunch of bitcoin addresses and told their their canadian exchanges do not do not uh allow withdrawals or deposits from these addresses uh one solution to that and i think the the most exciting solution the bankless solution is to centralize finance where over time we need less of these centralized custodial services to actually do our banking service so one thing for you to check out when you have some time is something called uniswap for example which is a leading decentralized exchange automated market maker you can you can grab your own you know crypto assets and then exchange them one to one for something else and you don't need a third-party bank it's a credibly neutral protocol can't be stopped the user interfaces can be but the guts of the contract cannot be uh and uh it's super exciting anyway some some some more for you to explore there but i've got another question for you and this is this gets into maybe some more current events as well because right on the back of the uh the canadian you know account freezer freezing and everything that's going on uh the world has now come down and started freezing accounts uh in in russia so um you know we've got swift sanctions cutting off the russian banking system we've got the u.s and the eu freezing russia's central bank assets we've got like apple pay and google and all of the fintechs they're cutting off support for russian citizens and of course a lot of this affects uh individual russian citizens who have nothing to do with you know what's going on in putin's war and that sort of thing nor do they but also at the same time um like this is kind of a united front against uh putin and russians actions in the ukraine that a lot of people would say hey this is a good thing and if we had crypto if the world was on crypto rails then we couldn't impose these sorts of of sanctions and so isn't this uh isn't this a good thing and therefore isn't crypto bad why should we want a crypto enabled world i'm curious if you have any thoughts on what's just transpired in the last few days in in russian some of these sanctions yeah we're tackling all the easy topics tonight um i think that first of all i haven't fully made up my mind and i don't think anyone should make up their mind fully about like what things mean on the long scale in terms of the philosophical underpinnings when you're in the heat of the moment this was one of the problems too with the canadian situation and it was actually one of the reasons why i mean maybe this is self-serving but i think it was easier for someone detached from the situation who weren't on the grounds next to the trucks honking to have an analysis of this that was a little bit more dispassioned um and right now i'll be fair to say that the situation in europe is not very dispassioned it is very high passion for very good reason um so we're probably not in the best state of mind of like what should this fully mean for everything but i'll portray my sort of fundamental thesis here which is one of the reasons why i call this an uh release valve i'm not sure i want a world entirely wrong on crypto i'm not sure that that is better um i think this idea of the release valve that there is a way when kind of like the again we go back to the second amendment and i really should stress that like i've never owned a gun in my life um i fired a few and that's surprisingly fun and i do that again but um owning a gun and having a society full of guns generally not my um speed but this idea that like the second amendment was a release valve for tyranny right like it wasn't that we were all supposed to carry a musket around everywhere because what if the government jumped us right like no it was supposed to be there at home and then we could organize into a militia we could oppose tyranny if it came um i think a little bit at least that my initial take of this is the same with crypto like i'd like to have some crypto around if like [ __ ] happened like in in some ways like prepping like i i live in california for many years like and not a bad idea to have a little extra water to have a bag packed in case the big quake comes or in case the fires come right i don't know if i want to organize like every moment of my day around that concept um that's i'm not there who knows maybe you get there some way maybe this is even like you can't do one without the other although i'm not so sure about that like we've historically had all sorts of stores of value that were not the only one we never transacted primarily or only in gold even though that was there and that was an important part and it was a release valve and it was a credibility check and all these other things but it was there and it was one component of it i'd like to see a strong um cryptocurrency like bitcoin be one of those alternatives that's like fully solid but i don't know do i want the russian state to be able to move 650 billion dollars around in it you get a little squirmish right which is often the case with these fundamental rights that they can be used for bad things right the freedom of speech you can start seeing some nasty [ __ ] where i'm like now i'm really getting uncomfortable here but um i'd like to err on the side of the principles and the fact the reason we have these things and protection against these things is more important than the fact that they will occasionally be abused again what does that mean does that mean i want putin and kim jong-il to be trading their billions in crypto back and forth i don't know if i made up my mind about that yet um but i do think this idea of collective punishment is a seriously troublesome idea the fact that every russian everywhere now gets this on them and you could say like well dude they they what they voted for the guy [ __ ] no they didn't right this is this is the thing this is the trouble with collective punishment of all sorts um so yeah we and this is the interesting thing about living in the world that there are very few clear cut answers that are just universally applicable when it comes to the big dangerous questions of both our time and any time um right now yeah i'm happy that there are sanctions that hopefully do work i'm sad that they're individual russians who don't support this at all that are getting hurt and hit by it um i don't have a unified theory about how it all plays together and the role crypto should play for all eternity in it that is a serious bunch of hedges that i usually don't like to make but i think this is the other thing about getting injecting some humility in it and in the moment like when can you make a recent assessment about this maybe when war is a little further than i don't know how far it is to uh ukraine from here but not far enough if i could add my take on that uh before i ask ask my my next question is generally the the pattern that we see in in crypto no matter if it's about bitcoin and self-sovereign bank accounts or if it's about defy and self-sovereign finance or nfts as like they all seemingly provide an escape hatch and that escape hatch is uh the easiest to use the closer you are to the individual like the the escape this escape hatch itself that tool that it provides is most conducive to individuals more than it is institutions and the the larger the institution it is the harder it is for that institution to fit through the crypto escape hatch because it's really meant for individuals and so we're watching the volume pair between the russian ruble and bitcoin be at all-time highs in this present moment and that's not the russian government that's the russian citizens using bitcoin as an escape patch and certainly russia has just as much ability to use the bitcoin network just as any any other institution out there but it's a lot harder for russia to move 640 billion dollars in secret using bitcoin or defy like it's easier to find these institutions the larger they are and so while there's a bunch of just unpacking we need to do as a global society as to like how do we do these sanctions on rogue states in the way that basically everyone approves of is like the most consensus i've ever seen nations have is that we need to sanction russia how do we express those abilities while also allowing individuals to to seek seep through the cracks because they're they're innocent and i do think that there's a path forward on that um and so david my next question for you is um uh you know ryan and i we try to be stewards of this crypto industry we try to promote the best of what it has to offer uh the bankless nation is not a nation of laser-eyed crypto army people i like to think that them a little bit more pragmatic and a little bit more realist but when i uh see a bunch uh when i see people uh hating on bitcoin hating on crypto and then changing their mind later i consider that a failure because we should have gotten to you sooner and so how how could we have improved what could we have done better as promoters of this industry to help you to help convince you about the merits of this industry before it actually came down to the freezing of of bank accounting in canada what were our failures that you would have liked to have seen us execute on better it's a good question sometimes i think like you can make the best argument in the world if someone's brain isn't open it's just going to bounce off and i think i was probably a little bit in that space that like if the door is closed it just it's closed um like i'd like to have higher standards for myself i'd like to think higher of myself that like if the perfect argument came along before there was an opening it would have opened the door in a way that the crypto community could have done but this is i don't know if that's possible i the my theory of sort of human behavior and human responses um has taught me that a lot of times you simply have to wait for your moment like we talked about remote i thought i made some very very good argument for remote in a whole book about it and i tried to evangelize it and try to talk it up i provided an example happy people this then the other thing and just like bounce bounce bounce it didn't really make a big impact then 2020 happens and then suddenly door wide open everywhere oh let's learn how to do it oh it's actually great you can do it right so sometimes you can just kind of bide your time and wait your moment and i think that this is the best thing the thing that sells bitcoin the best or in crypto in general is these kind of events that question the fundamentals where before again 2013 there's before snowden and there's after snowden there are people who think before snowden you're a tin foiled loon if you believe these things that there's the nsa listening to everything right and then there's the undeniable reality once given proof that this is actually happening you cannot exist in the old reality anymore this is what happened with remote there's not their own reality anymore you'd be laughed out of the room if you started to say well you can't actually start a business today remote unless you have the whiteboard and the water cooler it's all going gonna fail and no creativity can be unleashed and blah blah blah all the [ __ ] people were spewing like five minutes before the pandemic it's just over forever those arguments don't get to be reintroduced and i think at least for me this is what that can in canadian situation have introduced it's one of those defining moments like 13 20 20 and you go like do you know what i will remember this this is when i changed my mind fundamentally on something now the door is open let me hear what you have to say you know what's funny about uh remote by the way at dhh i feel like the entire crypto industry is built on remote workers like these decentralized autonomous organizations that we've set up complete remote workers the these new style of digital contractors that are coming to space it's all remote david and i have never met in person despite running a podcast uh at bank list for the last two years gave an example of that and we started in kovitz so i do think that timing is uh is and catalyst event driven catalyst is such a factor in what you're saying uh this has been so fun and such a pleasure to to hear from you um i'm curious as we kind of draw to a close what else are you gonna do in crypto so like are you gonna go further down the rabbit hole you plan to explore a bit more are you planning to buy some are you you know gonna spend some time learning about it develop some products what are your plans now that you have been i i don't want to use the word converted because we started talking about this as a cult but now that you've seen the value that crypto can bring to society what are your plans well i want to experiment firsthand with the cold storage i want to get the most idealized version of the decentralized setup buy some bitcoin use it actually try to transact and see like where are we still short um one of the main pieces of feedback i got too about slowness of transactions and high fees was the lightning network love to check into that how did that change things um just get some real life experience with it because this is one of the things that otherwise breeds i don't know ignorance if you haven't just actually done anything with it right who knows maybe i'll buy an nft or something else like that just to get the experience and actually use it firsthand so i think that would be um step one um the thing is though the price of being a 10-year skeptic is that like you're obviously behind the game by the time it flips so i'm not in any position to build anything of interest in the crypto space right now because i'm totally ignorant in many ways about all the fundamentals of how things work but i'm curious now in a way i wasn't before i'm curious about how some of these things work and i've seen other people like go down the curiosity hole and come out on the other side and not be convinced that's a possibility but i think that's still better right like at least you go through it and at least you can observe some of these things so um day one buy some bitcoin i mean as everyone wouldn't have been fun that when i posted my first tweet i think it was maybe 13 or something and i was laughing at bitcoin's price at 20 or something saying like who the hell would want to buy this that was really dumb um hey we don't get every call right i also thought that uh facebook wasn't exactly going to be a big stock and uh it turned out at least pretty well for them over that time horizon so you don't get on every call right um you you recognize hopefully when you get them wrong and then you like integrate that experience so i want to integrate that experience um i want to read up anymore i had downloaded the original white paper on bitcoin to understand just sort of the fundamentals of the network and what's being proposed and already there suspending my disbelief a little bit when i think unlike paragraph three talks about the most what they talk about the most important thing being irreversible transactions and i go like you know what i've sent money to the wrong address before in the regular bank world i'm pretty happy that these things were reversible i'm also happy that i can dispute charges on my credit card and so on but i'm suspending some disbelief here and part of it integrating with this idea that there's a release valve i don't have to see it as a binary world haha where it's either all bitcoin or no bitcoin i could see it as like hey i could be fiat most of the time with my musket in the closet my bitcoin on cold storage for a dark day when i say the wrong thing on the internet and the freaking canadian state reaches out to danish states and tried to cancel my bank account well let's hope that doesn't happen and uh definitely hope you come on again on
