what are the first thoughts that come to mind when you hear the word macro in recession I've heard all it takes earnings might go down the recession might be bad there's a lot of evidence which suggests usually stocks bottom before the economy actually does I don't find any of the macro Doomer predictions too compelling there's a lot of people who thought the world was going to end last year the oil was going to 300 and we were going to be trading sticks of butter for like wood but that just didn't come to pass and I think now with interest rates hopefully having peaked we're on the other side of a market that's driven by liquidity and interest rates and that's how I think about macro I mean macro doesn't need to be super favorable it just needs to be like not entirely hostile
