ens bull market i've always seen this and i think uf2 as like maybe the best nft out there one of the og nfts and what's happening now is ens registrations are going like crazy particularly four-digit ens names yeah yeah three digits are also hot but there's just so few of those so four digits are the ones i think there's like something like sixteen thousand combinations of four digit ens names so not that many we're if we're talking about like the url of the future internet 555.eth went for 55.5 eth so people are like basically buying the you know their board ape number or their or their crypto punk number that's some of the speculation do you see that oh snap is one one available but this is crazy if you look at the revenue ens revenue is now greater than all the fee revenue of bitcoin right now yeah but like at this point like so is everything else is higher than bitcoin like bitcoin just doesn't generate revenue dude
