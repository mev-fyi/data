welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto Community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer 0 we are once again talking with Natasha hoskinson and Dina Burke from Boys Club I've had them on before but I didn't really know them as well as I do now and I didn't really know the boys as well as I do now and also I didn't have this fantastic studio behind me as I do now and and so this is the first ever episode in the bankless studio TM in my apartment in Williamsburg an in-person shows are just so much better uh you know you get all the quality and scope of conversations by doing shows on the internet but nothing beats The in-person Vibes of a in-person face-to-face conversation so it was a real treat having Natasha and Dina from boys club in the in the studio on the podcast once again and and like I was referring to with a lot more familiarity with what they're doing at the boys club and what the boys club really is and personally I really want the boys club experiment to work first what is the boys club let's get let's define this the boys club is a social doubt a social organization focusing on women non-binary transgender communities you know the communities that like aren't in crypto that should be you know crypto is typically uh I mean the meme is like you know basement dwelling libertarian uh types right like that's where we started with in 2010 to 2015 we've slowly expanded the pie of who is in crypto but it's generally like white dudes uh and at the very least dudes uh and so boys club is in my mind focusing on the rest of society and figuring out ways to get them represented and having a voice in crypto and one of the reasons why I feel so strongly about why I want voice Club to be successful is because I consider myself a crypto citizen I'm in crypto society and personally for my own selfish benefit I would like it if crypto Society looked like the rest of society and that is really how we're going to onboard the world on board the rest of society is when what crypto is starts to look like and emulate more what the rest of society also looks like so we need these less advocated for populations to come into the crypto industry so it can look a little bit like normal society because again this is where I'm spending my time and so the boys club mission and my mission for crypto are deeply aligned which is why I care so much about boys club and that's not all actually it's the other cool thing about boys club is that it is a Community First and there's still soul-searching for their product but the community is the hard part actually uh usually communities form around things that already exist boys club is is taking the we're going to make a Dao uh but inverted it they inverted it they don't have a token uh so like they can't really call themselves a dow yeah they call themselves a Proto Dao but they have this super engaged super committed Community they have this core team that is all doing Sweat Equity no one's being paid a dime but everyone believes in this Mission yet they're still working on defining what that mission is and defining how the Dow works so I think this is a fantastic experiment is what can you build when you have a community but you don't have a product and so they are currently pioneering that Frontier and if the if the boys the boys club can do it then it sets a template it sends a model for so many other people organizations douse movements to follow in their footsteps I see a lot of alignment between the bankless movement and the boys club movement and overall just super happy to see this experiment unfold and happy to support it as best I can I'll stop rambling here and we'll get right into the show with Natasha and Dina from Boys Club but first a moment to talk about some of these

going on hi hi how's it going we're doing good this well loving the setup you've got here yeah thanks thanks for helping me uh inaugurate this whole entire studio so honored I'm very honored so so deeply honored so you guys start off your podcast which you guys are also podcasters yes sir with the same question every single time which I thoroughly enjoy it's a little bit of a bit yeah and you guys ask yourself you guys to take turns asking each other what is Boys Club yeah why do you do this we are constantly evolving it's a moving Feast so feast ly sure I think it's part of it just that we're like trying to figure it out I feel like every week we're like putting something out there trying something new and that sort of evolving what boys club is what it can be yeah but what is it do you know what sports club uh as of this week it is a social Dao a media company and a product Studio and it changes every single week the answer changes it it yes we might stick with this for a couple weeks and see how it feels yeah yeah this feels good this feels really good and also like it is a combination of a lot of the same topics each week but like trying to find the through line is really what we're getting at like there are some things that are definitely set in stone around Boys Club but then how you package that is evolving and also how you talk about it to people who aren't in the community and like people who are not only coming into boys club fresh but like maybe coming into web 3 or crypto fresh and it's like how do we how do we like where are the proxies that we can find in like the real world that people will understand and so that people have like a framework for thinking about like what poor scope is so that's sort of the work of it so what actually is boys club and why is it so hard to Define um I would say the the like core of boys club is a community and that can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people and it can also mean a lot of things in web3 and so when you have a community that's sort of Bridging the Gap between web 2 and web3 or just getting into it um what their perception of what community is outside of crypto web 3 and what it is in it can look very different so the core of boys club is like really smart people coming together and thinking about web3 um I don't know what would you add yeah I think we're a community I think we um are for people who are um building in or interested in or curious about web3 or crypto we Center the voices of women we Center the voices of non-binary people but we're really open to everyone um and I think the the reason why it can be one of the reasons why it can be so hard to Define it also the sort of people's understanding of what community is for sure but it's Dao and the Dao like is at least in how it's taking shape in boys club is like sort of this amorphous thing that is like more sort of like World building or like nation-state building than it is like a startup with a one product or one service that we're like really narrowly focused on so because it is like this sort of nebulous thing where like people different people come in and energize different sort of verticals whether it's content and media or whether it's a product Studio or whether it's an investment indicate like it's like starting to get really wide um and so I think that that's like yeah kind of yeah one thing I would add is that it's a brand and that that feels like the tourist probably statement around Boys Club um and so and that feels very distinct in web 3 when brand is sort of in the back seat for most um companies that you see in this space and for us it's definitely the driver and we I first met you guys uh we were introduced by our mutual friend Evan and as I learned about it I was like oh this is this is quite interesting because it's a little bit inverted of a model as to what cryptos used to seeing there's initially there's like a startup and then they need to create a community around them and create and then a community might arrive if there is like upside potential yeah but this is a little bit different in that the community came first and now there's question marks remaining yeah so like you know what's next and when we I first had you guys on what was it six months or so ago so how has that journey of of exploration gone like can you update us on the road map first of all I just want to say you want to know why that's happened why we started the Community First just because we both we both have startups products that did work and so we're like we're never doing that again and now we're doing that again so honestly that's like the shortest reason why like we started with Community First um yeah I would say like the biggest Evolution over the last six months is when we started boys club in November the motivator was really we see a ton of smart capable women sitting on the sidelines of what's happening this whole new economy is being built and they're sort of just watching and we felt a lot of conviction around making a change and designing for a space where women and people who didn't feel known and seen in web3 could learn and grow and do things together and what's been amazing is we started with that premise and then we got a bunch of women in a room and they were all like yeah we're in like what are we building together and so that's really been the journey that we've been on is okay now what are we building as more and more people who didn't feel excited about the space or known in the space are coming into it and feeling really energized by what's happening yeah I mean now we're yeah we're all here we're like okay what's next let's like do something together and I think that that's like that's been such a fun thing to do in like a community and and the Dao like format the Dao like foundations has like allowed us to do that really seamlessly right like bringing people in and and working with people and collaborating with people and having contributors come in um and out of the Dow like that that to me I think is like actually the true innovation of boys club where we're able to like harness this Collective like human collaboration and in a way that like in web 2 would have been impossible and now with boys club like we have like 40 people like around the world that are like sort of aligning around this sort of shared vision and world view and I think that like that's actually what's really special about um uh about like doubts I think generally is that like it it really allows for that and I think um that's just been so fun to do one distinction that I want to make based on what you said is like the way that we think about so there's about 40 people in our in what we would call our Dao which is like the main founding the founders founding team core team contributors and then that's sort of the center of boys club and then around that is our community which is anybody who's in our Discord anybody who's going to our events consistently those are individuals who are really invested in boys club and engaged in the actual like work of community building but aren't contributing and then the larger sort of um reach of boys club is audience and we've started to make those distinctions because we have seen that it's really important to have a distinction between your community and your audience because those two types of engagements with the brand are very very different so anyway you said yeah and we want to keep the community intentionally small like they're that Their audience is unbounded right like that can grow to whatever but like the there's an intimacy in the community right now that like is really special that we want to preserve and maintain that experience for existing members and for people who are coming in and I think that that's like that's why we're sort of like the community does have a ceiling but that's appropriate I think um at least for us and and then the Dao is sort of this we're we're uh what we call like a contribution gated Dao so it's not like token I mean maybe token at some point but like token one token um but in order to to be in the Dow you you have to be contributor so um that's like sort of the nucleus of of what's going so yeah a lot of other Dows other projects they have this like massive carrot for people to join them and it's usually because the token price is going to go up yes uh boys club doesn't have that yet not not yet but people have joined the Dow anyways uh and it's seen great success in producing a community without all of the other carrots that are or other orgs typically do have yeah so what is the carrot like why do people join Boys Club why do they commit their energies to contributing to this thing that doesn't have like VC investment or like a protocol or any of these typical things I think it's because because we have a genuine belief that everything in web 3 like what is most powerful is using this technology to enable more meaningful and engaged human connection like that is what we're truly after it's about connecting with people it's about doing interesting things together Building meaningfully Together in this space and it's like truly that's what we're after yeah like and I think people are drawn to that and people are excited by that and have found genuine friendship and connection and like when we talk about Community it's not just like we're hanging out online we are doing that but it's about feeling known and feeling seen and having that drive your work in a meaningful way and having that drive your interest in a meaningful way um and so I think people are drawn to that and people talk about like The Vibes and the energy and that's all true but it's because of this like the heart of feeling a deeper connection to other people around you yeah I think that something that we've seen is that like uh the the team and the contributors and to a certain degree the community like there's there's intrinsic motivation there for them to be involved in force club and like that is so rare and so special and like it's not lost on us that like that's like magic and like laying in a bottle um and I think that I I think that that's a product of like yeah some brand that resonates a shared Vision certainly that resonates and like people sort of like be feeling that they can like show up with their full selves in this community in ways that like maybe at their day job in web 3 or web 2 or whatever like that may or may not be the case um and and so and I think that also there's a lot of people like people see opportunity as well like there's you know I know you guys do a shout out to the bankless job board but we have one too and like that there's a lot of women have found new jobs better jobs um have recruited for their startups and so yeah there's there's a powerful Network in that too I also think one of the things that has pulled me into web3 and got me excited about it last summer was this idea that this world is unfinished like it's in its design phase whatever it's going to be it's not crystallized yet and that presents a really exciting opportunity to be a part of Designing what web3 is going to be and I I think a lot of people in our community are see us as an entry point and a launch a launch pad into that world and into designing what the internet is going to look like what human coordination is going to look like um how like value is distributed through boys club and I think that's attractive to a lot of people and I think that's that's a great articulation as to like what minimum viable boys club is is that it is a platform for people that come into web3 and feel intimidated yeah or skittish or scared when they join Boys Club they no longer feel those emotions yeah and it's very very empowering yeah and so like in the in the most bearish future of boys club possible all it is is a tribe of people that are grateful for the people that help support them in their early days and maybe they go off and do other things but they feel that loyalty and alignment and they bring back some rewards some treasure some Bounty that they earned out in the broader scope of web 3 back to Boys Club yeah to me that's like the most bearish version of yes I think you're right and you're right I think that there's like there's a like a confidence building I mean like truly like at its simplest form like that is a lot of I think the value that people get is like they come in and and there's like just yeah some confidence that they then bring out into the world and their web3 or like whatever turning in yeah it's been so fun to see truly and you guys use the the word nation building a lot can you go into like what why that what does that word mean to you and why are you doing that why are you Nation Builders because that's a big that's a big term yeah that's a statement um I think it's because it's really hard to boil down what boys club is because there are so many sort of tentacles of what we're doing what we're launching because of the nature of the Dow and like the flywheel effect of that um and so talking about it as sort of World building is I think a clearer way for people to start to understand okay they're like doing these events they're doing this Media stuff they're building these products they're doing consulting like all of this is still under the umbrella of sort of the world that they want to see and the the work that they're doing as a community of people to build the future together and so that language really has come quite organically around some of the stuff that we're doing well we also ripped off Balaji and this is we also often rip off a Blog so that's what he's for yeah so shout out to Bellagio when you're gonna come on the podcast totally um I don't know would you add anything yeah I would um I think that that's totally true and I think also like so we're like there's a lot of different plate spinning one plate is like where is the revenue like where is the money what's the money coming into the treasury how does that work what does the business look like like so we're like working on our like GDP I forget really we're working on like what it what it is foundations of the economy and then also we are like how what's the governance like how do we did the DOW form like what's voting I mean Shadows Parker who's like designing the like you submit a proposal and that like the whole Dow governance piece so we're creating also like a government right and then also at the same time we're creating an economy like the tokenomics of like what you know the future boys token looks like how that gets distributed what so it's it's Revenue business it's government and it's economy that we're all that we're trying to build all the same time and all of a sudden that looks like and they should say that looks like World building so I think that that's like an extension of sort of why that's come about and a part of what I see in the boys club doubt the only other Dow that I see like it is actually the bankless style yeah and a lot of that came from the fact that that when me and Ryan made the Dao the bank was Tao we issued a token we gave it to our community that we knew were aligned with us we didn't we didn't spread it far and wide we were like yeah you this population of people have provably showed their alignment to like the bankless vision here's a Dao yeah and also me and Ryan are busy with bankless yeah yeah yeah yeah and so we've like left this like void to them to like figure it out yeah and as a result of that you're starting to see uh not any sort of like top-down leadership which is actually something that it does differentiate boys club and bakeless style yeah but what I do see as alignment is like there's these different like appendages growing in different parts of the Dow that are for now like unconnected or uncorrelated with each other like we have like uh bankless Consulting over here we have bankless Academy over there uh there's the rug somewhere else the rug is like the onion of crypto historius uh and all the the only Real Alignment here is that it's under the bankless umbrella it's under the bankless brand it's under the bankless value systems and one of the things we've been impressed by this is that without too much curation beyond the initial distribution that Community has done of bang up jobs staying aligned and using the brand uh appropriately yeah uh and like these things and the other thing is that each one of these things makes some sort of Revenue they pay most of that Revenue to the contributors yeah and then a small Kickback to the treasury to the greater org but the cool thing is is that it's not the greater org coming down with a top-down vision of what needs to be done yeah it's you go and do that Vision under the bankless brand and make your money you know pay yourself first make sure you can keep on doing this give us the kickback of whatever you can but it goes right into the conversation of a GDP of an org is like go do something that is inside of this country inside of this nation make get yourself paid get yourself a job uh do it under the bank list brand and then also you know pay back payback stone soup kind of model or you know pay back to the to the org yeah and like these are the only two Dows I see really like pioneering this model I mean I think for us the like the thing of it is we want this to be a business where we love all the things about boys club but I mean my conviction I think your conviction is that like we have a belief that Dows are going to be the future of what organizations look like and to be able to prove that out this needs to be a sustainable thing for people and it needs to have Revenue it needs to pay people and we need to be looking for those opportunities consistently so that that continues to grow the larger pot the opportunities that are available like it is sort of the cycle that if you can unlock it starts to feed itself but for me it's like I'm interested in in building a big business and doing that through a dow structure where incentives are aligned and people feel like they're getting value out of their work they're doing besides just getting you know a salary and that's what's most exciting to me so I think that drives a lot of our decision making around it yeah totally I think that I mean we'll see like we're yeah we'll see like we're experimenting that's really what the phase that we're in right now is like let's just like throw a bunch of stuff at the wall this seems to be a structure that could possibly work with like yeah feeding back a percentage into the treasury and um and like allowing for as much like permissionless Innovation as like the brand allows for um in the phase that it's in and and I think like well see I I mean in bullish but like we're like we're very much like in the design phase right now which honestly is why it's exciting right right yeah it's a blank slate of opportunity of course and one of the one of the reasons why I give so many [ __ ] about about boys club is that for first it's okay it's the hard part is the community if you have the community that's what so many companies like other entities people that raise money wish that they had yeah and Boys Club has that uh they don't have the other half of the thing like they don't have like the product they don't have the protocol it's not a protocol but like the getting people to like believe in your community is is the hard part yeah and there's so much like thesis and like infrastructure and investment going into infrastructure around this idea like uh variant fund for example and the Creator economies like they fund anything that can support this kind of ideas like if you have a community let's build tools and things for you to use to make sure that this is viable and so part of like the web 3 ethos is that if you have the community you can have a world you can have a nation and my boys club to me seems like one of the most promising uh organizations out there that has a very engaged and committed community and if you can if boys club can Pioneer and like carve this path if we're going to use like bankless terminology and like go into the frontier of we don't have a business model we have a community but that's all we need and if you guys end of the boys club can and figure that out a thousand other Dows can follow in the boys club footsteps have you guys thought about it I mean I would love if and when we have that Playbook or that road map and like there's like some infrastructure that we can point back to like I'd love for there to be a countless number of forks of boys club right where people are like taking the model of the Community First whatever come that comes next and because like not everyone feels seen by post up right like there's an infinite number of other communities and people who like it's not their Vibe which is like of course and so I think like yeah we'd love for people to like take this model and Fork it and then I think like there's also you know we sort of have half of mind that like there could be does that look like sort of a dow Dows where we have like a lot of these Community First brands that like take the the sort of Playbook that we've built and and then do it themselves and then like does that feed into sort of a larger universe of like this I I don't know so that's sort of like you know half baked but that's something that we're starting to think about as well yeah and for us sort of the trajectory that we're on is okay we've built this community that's been very validated to us especially in a bear market right we felt like wow this is real like this is not just a life cycle and from there it's how we have all these sort of evangelists for boys club which presents an amazing opportunity to grow your audience and to have these media experiments of having a podcast having a newsletter like thinking about like a Zine and doing these things that aggregate azine what's that it's like a little magazine a mini magazine okay that's that's the more we can talk about that more but like um essentially having these media Outlets that continue to grow your audience which is really powerful and then those channels present revenue streams and those revenue streams feed into the treasury that give your treasury enough of a starting point your seed funding to launch products and do our D and have all these experiments that you're launching so that's really like the model is like okay you have all these evangelists within your community you build up your media properties to be able to bring in revenue and then that revenue is building a ton and incubating small like product studio type tests that then like a few of them click and that's when like you have 100x margins and that's when you like that model really starts to take off so that's like the trajectory that we're on right now subject to change if it doesn't work who knows but that's how we're thinking about it at least and then your audience like what's I think really smart about this is as you're Building Products you have an audience that you're launching them into you're not starting that's incentive aligned as well which is like the really crucial part it's not like just some random newsletter it's like no people who like really care about like the the success of whatever product is coming out of boys club and probably have been involved along the way in beta testing and giving product feedback and helping whoever founder brought the idea and to like shape it and so because we're like so building in public with stuff like there's just like some juice there that I think is is different for folks ZK sync is an ethereum layer 2 Network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge Roll-Ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need ZK sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge Roll-Ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of cryptoeconomics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future-proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eats with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a note rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish is staking you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the Google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social that building in public part I think has been pretty interesting and it's also just a very core part of the ethos of boys club Yeah by by probably the product yeah I can't go into that a little bit more uh was it an intentional choice and how has it kind of impacted how boys club has unfolded um start um not the boys club podcast um and we have a segment called the feelings check-in where every week well two segments we talk about what's happening in our Dow and then we do have feelings check-in and it is unbelievably transparent and I think part of that was a lot of the feedback we had gotten from our community was like or from people in boys club were just like we want to be flies on the wall like how are you guys thinking about this what are the decisions that are being made the calls that Dina and I have endlessly throughout the day what are we talking about and so we were like okay let's turn on a mic and see if people will listen and it's been really amazing the sort of response to that and people feeling really invested and really again feeling really seen and saying like these are the things we're thinking about every week these are the questions we're asking these are things that did not work these are the things that I have feelings about um and I think a lot of people do that in behind closed doors and you don't have an affinity as deep of an affinity to the brand because you're not journeying along every step of the way with them so it that makes it sound more architected than I think oh it's not architected I think I would have not done it this way Dina was like we should just do it we should just do it I would not I'm always like we've got to protect the brand we've got to protect the brand and Dina's like no but I also know I guess what I mean by that like there's also like that's just how we are naturally as people and so I think it's like part of it was like I don't really know how else to be and so if we're gonna do this like also like we're creating the world that we want to live in and the world that like we want to live in in boys club is like for radically like feelings first transfer like we just because that's just who we are that's who we are and that's like the community that like the especially the core team that we've sort of attracted to this and it's just like I don't know like anything else would feel inauthentic right and so I think that that's like it's just like why like we're we're beholden to no one at boys club we don't have any investors like there's no we're the only people that we were responsible to is the community and I think like because that it's like man like it's a community of people who I don't know want to hear about all these things that we're thinking about I think another piece of it is like which is like an added benefit is that so much of the Dow like Dows are wildly inefficient as someone who is running one like just the the most inefficient thing right and like there's so many challenges and so many problems and like could do a whole five podcasts on on that but part of part of why they're so inefficient is because it's like all these desperate people who are distributed whatever and there's just like so much context sharing that needs to happen all the time in order to get people up to speed so that people can like be making decisions that are like aligned and like we're just like constantly and so I think part of like the benefit of us being so transparent on the podcast and being so transparent about our feelings is like there's context sharing in that where it's like here's where we're at this thing is moving and changing all the time like we might as well just share with everyone and like and so that we're all coming around we're all on the ride together and there's no like surprises I think yeah I mean I think you've you've taught me how to do that I think I would have felt more guarded to be that transparent and then I think there's there's two other things one is that when you when people talk about like human coordination they're so much of that in our experience of adao is having people feel like they can be transparent about the stuff that is coming up for them and designing for a culture where that is encouraged and appropriate because the fact of the matter is up until now there's been zero dollars that anybody has paid themselves so they're we're dealing with like Sweat Equity in every aspect of what we're doing with boys club and so feeling good about the work feeling excited about the brand is essential because you have to have so you have to be so bullish on what we're doing and I think designing for a space where people can say hey this is coming up for me is really important and the only way you can do that I think is doing that by example and and having hard conversations every single week that you blast to your whole Community um and then the other thing for me is I think I really wanted to what I've thought about a lot in sort of my career and as a Founder is how can I if I'm looking at the world I want to see in my workplace and in the work that I do I want to show up in my full self and I think for there has been an example of what a leader looks like and what it means to be a Founder that is very polished and sterile and doesn't allow for a complexity of what a human being is and I feel really strongly that if we're going to do something and if I want to be on this journey then I need to I want to see a different kind of workplace and I want to see a different type of leadership and that's what's convinced me and you know being like we should just talk about this on the podcast um but it is it is alarming and frightening when people are like whoa I can't you guys are so like open about super trans I was like oh man what man and I think a lot of this goes to the very ethos that I hope web3 brings to the world um one of my personal Fascinations is that we are have all these code things you have the Bitcoin blockchain we have the ethereum blockchain we have Layer Two protocols but it's really about how these systems impact culture that is what moves the needle for like under a society totally and a lot of that comes down to like a need to be authentic because you could imagine like imagine if ethereum was created behind closed doors at IBM yeah and it would be like IBM to us not us to us yeah yeah and that's really the the difference between building in public versus uh building in private producing a product to sell to others right totally and so there's like the the story of like the moloch meditations on molok which is something uh that's like this blog post that's ingrained in like deep ethereum culture is that it's not the top versus the bottom it's not the one percent versus the 99 it's not US versus them it's US versus us and when you lead with authenticity you make the listeners feel like this is us not this is them yeah and I'm not being talked to I am a part of this journey because I'm in the heads of the people that have more influence and control over the organization than I do and it kind of like brings down the barrier of what does it mean to help Boys Club down to just like listening to the podcast like that's the minimum viable contribution and I think it's like we're we've talked about like what are this the carrots for bringing somebody into the club and like feeling resonant with the leadership has got to be a big one yeah and I think that's I I also resonate like with so much of what you guys said with why people like bankless is that when people meet like me and Ryan and Ryan's only been to one conference so this has only happened once for him but like when people meet us in real life a frequent comment is like oh you're exactly the same on the podcast as you are in real life yeah and people feel that the more that they listen to the podcast it's like oh Ryan and David don't actually have the capacity of being inauthentic and that's why we tune in and that's why we listen yeah and it goes back to a little bit of how you guys have not raised any funding because then you're beholden to your community not to your in investors yeah which are absence yeah uh and so it just leads with authenticity and that's part of the culture that we hope web3 brings if we stop having intermediaries uh VCS being an intermediary between a product and the public yeah then you actually are beholden to the public not not the upside of like a smaller minority of people yeah and it makes these things scale out broader it starts to blur the lines between the leadership and the community yeah and everyone can feel as if as if they can actually have influence and control and upside in this thing yeah yeah totally would raising Capital be on the menu great question um I think that um I think uh for discrete and specific projects so for the boys club like Community or Dao like as sitting where I'm sitting right now I can't really see that could change it's all subject to change I mean we're changing all the time but like I can't really see that in like the model as it exists right now just because like I think we have like a sort of interesting revenue or business model that like we want to try but I can see like yeah there's a product that spins out totally then like for for software like it often makes sense to like scale up in that way um so I think maybe for that um maybe for a product to spin out but yeah we're really protective of our community yeah and we're always thinking about how are we driving value back to this community and there would have to be a really clear exchange between the value that was coming in and how it would would benefit the whole of our community um for it to make sense yeah and right now I don't really see how that could work again that could change but I do see okay in that model that I was talking about where we're incubating and launching products when something clicks then it makes sense and um for a protocol or a product like that that is a very clear value alignment because you know exactly what it's going to do for you yeah I think like we like our decision making framework was like does is this in benefit of the community and so I think it's like if that type of opportunity would come up and like there was a structure that made sense and everyone was like yeah totally then like great let's go but like I think right now it's just can't really see it yeah we also had a we had a really interesting conversation with um Amanda daddy a couple nights ago she's great she's amazing Amanda yeah yeah she's just incredible and she was talking about um how when you um don't raise Venture it's sort of like you're riding in like a low rider car that doesn't have any suspension and so you can like feel every like Stone and stick as you're driving but like that that's there's something in it where like you're you're really in touch with what you're doing versus when you raise Venture you're like cushioned you're cushioned you're like in a SUV right and like you have like a nice cushion but that makes you a little bit removed from like the realities of like what's actually happening in the business and of course for some projects and for some circumstances like it makes perfect sense to raise Venture but I think like that just like really resonated with us we're like man okay that's that's the game that we want to be in right now we want to be really close and really in touch with like everything that's happening in this business so that we're building it responsibly and like we're shepherding it in the way that like it should be and we're like turning over every stone yeah and it's hard to do that when yeah you have the luxury of like cash cash does Boys Club have a road map of sorts or how far does that thing go if it does exist um yeah it's got a road map we've got um so in the two like Media company and product studio so on the media side we're working on a Zine which is basically a Lo-Fi magazine for those who don't know um a cooler a cooler magazine um and working on what is a web three sort of native approach to that type of media and what's sort of an interesting experiment we can do around that really thinking about the touch point of like culture and crypto which is I think sort of The Sweet Spot for us um and then we're also I think just to say a little bit more about that like right now the the way that the revenue from media is coming into boys club it's web it's web two right like that's not it's there's no innovation there the only Innovation is I guess sort of like the content and that we're talking about with three but like I think we're like really quickly wanting to transition to like what's that what's actually the web 3 native iteration of that from a media perspective and are the and I think the big outstanding question is are those margins more interesting than like web 2 native media which aren't really and so I think that like that's sort of the those are the experiments that worked and how people seamlessly contribute in and out of those media properties yeah so uh we're also launching a second podcast yeah shout out to us podcast number two podcast number two yeah wow as the more yeah under the same RSS feed or a new RSS feed under the same nice RSS nice um so that's coming content yeah for the record there's very very few podcasts that I listen to every single episode and Boys Club is so kind of honored so kind um so that's the media roadmap and then the product roadmap we have one product that is almost done that will be launching soon and that is sort of an nft portfolio tool um and then two products that are in the works so and very much with the with the like spiritual concept that these things are like we're throwing them out there like we will have many many products is the vision and a few of them will stick and it's not like this is the boys club product it's like this is one in a suite of things let's just like try some stuff yeah and like it out there yeah yeah and like how quickly can we get some people around it to build it and put it out in the world and see if there's traction um so that's the roadmap and then obviously I mean we haven't talked about this at all which is kind of funny but like we're big on in-person stuff lots of events yeah so we're doing some stuff at Devcon and we're doing some stuff at our basil so that a lot of that that's just like all the time because we love it and we have truly this belief that when people get in a room together amazing things happen and doing that with some natural wine is sort of the way to know there's a meme about the crypto space that it's all dudes right like 90 dudes and it's probably true but also at the same time every time somebody goes to a crypto event whether it's a dude or or a woman they're always surprised as to how many more women they are there are than their expectations yeah and so like on the internet on crypto in Discord it's like maybe 90 10 85 15 men to women but in real life it's like closer to 70 30 sometimes 65 35 yeah like it actually starts to balance out pretty damn well in contrast yeah uh and so it makes sense that boys club is present in in real life where it actually matters yeah like culture only goes so far inside of Twitter like where crypto is here to change the whole full scope of the world and so it has to show up in real life and so this is why I'm we so bullish boys club is because cool we're doing the protocol stuff like on the ethereum like whatever side but in order for ethereum's values to be expressed it needs to show up in real life and Boys Club is like one of the first things that's like our value prop is the real world is real yeah totally one of the things that we're experimenting with is something that we're calling boys club Local which is like how do we like how do we like first of all there's this concept of like a headless brand right and like how does that grow and how does it sort of evolve and how to how but while maintaining the Integrity of the vision and the mission and the brand like identity and voice and Vibe and all these things um and so that's that's showing up especially in this idea of boys club Local which is like um giving sort of the brand to people in different communities um to sort of create their own little thing and their own little like network and to to grow it and so we're starting off with two experiments with postal local one in Austin and one in Singapore and basically these were both women who came to us and were were like hey I think there might be sort of the seedlings there won't be the the fertile soil for something that could look like another Boys Club Outpost in Austin or in Singapore and we want to like explore it and so that's like what we're working through right now is like okay great love it but like how do we do it in a way that like doesn't doesn't like dilute the brand that adds to it right and I think that like um that's totally possible but we're like we're we're really like at the very front edge of like how to execute on that execute on that because it's also something that is so integral to boys club is a sense of humor and like uh that is very contextual like we talk about things that are happening in pop culture and in New York and like all of those things are funny because there's something about it that you know because it's your world and we want that to show up in these other offshoots of boys club locally and that are very context specific and so we don't know what's funny in Singapore I have no literally no idea and so how do you give somebody the tools to show up like boys club but with the context and the sense of humor and their sort of culture um is a really really interesting question that we're facing very actively right now but I think that the only interesting like there's such a more interesting flywheel effect if we can figure out what that model looks like and do it a hundred times over um that's like that's brand and Community growth on a scale that like is really new and like really compelling so we're really motivated to figure it out despite there being many many challenges and risks around it yeah so what does uh what does Boys Club need the most thank you um one thing that's really cool about boys club is there is a lot of Dev talent in the room which feels very unique um but we're sort of looking for like a leader around that um and maybe it's in our community and that's still ongoing but I think somebody who would want to step into like okay we're gonna we're gonna be like the ultimate CTO of boys club um again that that is something we literally were talking about this morning so it's like real fresh and honestly who knows someone could be sitting in our Discord who's like oh excuse me that's me um but we do have like really great Dev Talent who like Angela did our nft um drop like there is a lot of that in the room and it's like amazing and it's sort of how do you um continue to like nurture that Community um we're always looking for like sponsors yeah parties um I think yeah I'm trying to think of like I think it's just like sharing boys club with like the people in your life who you think would resonate with I think that's like that's the biggest gift that we could get how many full-time people work at boys club zero full time I mean I it's so funny because people are like oh you're not you guys aren't doing this full-time and I'm like no no we're doing this full time and then we also have full-time jobs so that's sort of the world exactly it's not when someone's like oh you're side hustle I'm like wow um that's one way of putting it um but everybody has jobs like everybody's you know has jobs and then they have for now voice club for now um so but there's about 15 people on our core team um and then that like Dao nucleus uh including contributors is about 40 people and weaving again that's intention we've intentionally kept that very small um and so glad we did so glad we did version one of the Dow so good as a small thing because honestly you're like you read all these Dao blogs and threads and you're like okay cool like Dows are awesome and then but you don't know like what it's like to face like a a dow proposal and vote and you don't know sort of all the challenges and all everything that comes around it like until you do you're doing Amy town and you've done one and the first proposal of the cancer the first time we were voting about it the first team conversation I was like wow I'm so glad we didn't roll this out to the 2 000 people in the Discord right first I'm so so glad and so that would be like actually my one piece of advice is that if you're considering starting it down just like start with that small minimum viable Community minimum viable doubt is like as small as it can possibly be big enough so that it's like sort of statistically relevant you're getting all the insights and all the learnings and everything you dull the data back to like make decisions about what it grows into but like man so glad we did that because that first proposal and like the feelings check in post first proposal voting was like they were raw and it would have been like had we had done that with 2 000 people yeah it would have been like maybe something that we wouldn't have been able to walk back right yeah and so I think that that's like yeah um yeah and then there's about 2 000 people in our Discord and that's been also intentional to keep it gated at that um we have about 150 people who apply a week to be in the Discord and it's like how do we balance an intimacy that we want to keep in in that but also like let great talent in so that they can be a part of that nucleus so that's enough and also like not even necessarily great talent like just people who what we're sort of looking for in the application when people are applying so we're an application gated Discord we're not a token get a Discord yet we're not like a pay gated Discord it's just like we need to have something there to um protect detect the Integrity of the community and I think what we're looking for in the application is just like intention is like are your intentions good are you looking to pour value into the community as we are every single day and as the core team is and the contributors is like pouring value into or are you looking to extract from this community are you looking to like show your thing or to like whatever and so that's just like really what we're voting for um in that application it's more than anything else why should somebody join the boys club man I can think of so many reasons I'm trying to think of like the one that would resonate with the bankless community the most um what do you think I mean honestly for me if you're in this space and you are really thinking about building something and you're wondering where to start if you're looking for interesting people to work with for interesting people to talk with about what you're building um I think that's one great reason yeah I think also like um if you're like interested in sort of this like culture and Technology crossover or like culture and web 3 crossover um it's a really fun place to talk about it um is invoice Club because we're thinking about it and talking about it all the time so I think that that um is another great reason and if you if you're funny funny if you're funny it's very very important yeah the humorous humor is a core core tenant speaking of funny why is it called Boys Club um it's just a little bit like tongue-in-cheek middle finger type vibe to one I think two it's twofold one it's like okay this is a this is a boys club let's like take that back and make it fun and and um do it our own way and then the other is a little bit of a middle finger to like the women's empowerment movement of like I don't need people to tell me to be empowered and what's a great way to signal to like-minded people that were intentionally designing this space for women but it's like not about being a woman and that was just came naturally it's a hard needle to threat it's the hardest it is the hardest extremely fine line to walk yeah um yeah I think there's just like a little subversion in everything that we do and everything that we that's like where we have a lot of fun and so I think that like that's just like what we wanted to come through and then as well yeah how do people find the Dow um they go to an absolutely insane website that makes zero [ __ ] sense um boys club dot VIP um also we're on Twitter we're on Instagram yeah uh boys club.eth on Instagram um those are the best places um send
