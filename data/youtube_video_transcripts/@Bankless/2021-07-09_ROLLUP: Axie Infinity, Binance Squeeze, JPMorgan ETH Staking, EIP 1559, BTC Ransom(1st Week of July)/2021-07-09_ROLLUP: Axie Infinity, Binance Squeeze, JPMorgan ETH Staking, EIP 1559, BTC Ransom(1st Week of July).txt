[Music] happy friday morning everyone it is the first week of july and it's roll up time david you ready to dig in i am ready to dig in to the friday weekly rollups the best episode in all of crypto at least i think this is where we go through what's happened in the last week of crypto we go through the markets what's happened in the markets we go through the releases what's got what got released and then we go through what's happened in the news cycle and then we finish off with who had some interesting takes in the crypto ecosystem and then we finished things off with what david and ryan are excited about and then we finish that off with the meme of the week still not finished until the meme of the week comes then you know it's over david we gotta talk about this though man you doing okay how's your face going uh yeah so the viewers of the youtube will notice i got some blemishes on my face i took a little tumble off of an electric scooter here in san diego the other night and uh protected my brain with my face uh and uh a little bit worse for wear but but the bankless ecosystem does not stop producing content and that is no excuse so the march goes on look at this guy injured in everything still doing the roll ups that is dedication my friend i think the meme of the week might be about that [Laughter] all right man you ready to dig in yeah let's do it ryan all right before we do we gotta talk about kyber's rainmaker program going on they are making it rain making it rain knc tokens this is their long awaited liquidity mining program that they've just launched 25 million over the next three months they are dishing out to liquidity providers we've got uh eth usd c pairs uh wrapped bitcoin pairs die pairs everything and across two chains not one chain two chains ethereum and polygon that's uh that's pretty cool uh love that kyber is doing this they are an og d5 protocol so click on the link and the show notes if you want to learn more about how you can supply liquidity and start earning some of that rain yourself kyber is one of the oldest projects in d5 and they are in the capital efficiency game with their dynamic market maker which changes fees according to market conditions to make sure that you are optimized in your lp position so check that out david wanted to fix the words capital efficiency and i know i know you did david you wrote a fantastic article on that david let's start market time man let's start with bitcoin price what is bitcoin price doing for us i'm gonna scroll out to the uh the five day and see where we started i think that was like the third or something yeah we started at thirty five thousand dollars it fell down to thirty 32.7 thousand dollars then we jumped to 36 000 then we dumped to 32 000 and now we're at 32.8 thousand dollars so flat on the week basically where we started but crap but also did jump up a little bit it is nice to have a pretty high in the middle of the week even though we didn't end there it's nice to claim some of that high territory which i said yeah good wednesday we had to get humpty had a good wednesday yeah yeah a good one there was a hump on the hump day nice you know what though um i feel like bitcoin's in maybe a bit of a rut i don't know if you feel this way it's like coming off of bitcoin miami we had the el salvador news that kind of spiked things a little bit but that's sort of died down right people aren't really excited and i'm talking narratives of course you're not fundamentals um but the happening is behind us too uh michael saylor putting bitcoin on your corporate uh balance sheet that hasn't quite spread like wide wildfire where the the bitcoin bulls were saying would maybe in january of this year any takes there do you feel like bitcoins in a rut too and how does it get out of this rut yeah i'm sure michael saylor would like a few more allies than he thought that he would have gotten by now um but at the same time i think bitcoiners will say that the happening event doesn't manifest in the price until like two years later right that is like what the happening is apparently uh and so they always will say hello right yeah stock to flow right um if you believe in that uh and so there the when i talked to my bitcoiner co-host over at pov crypto ck he talked about how like you know it's going to take the world the world a while to integrate the el salvador news into their understanding of bitcoin and so like the price appreciation happens later right there's always a lag which sounds both true if we look at the historical evidence of bitcoin the catalysts always appear in the charts later but there's also like you can also say that that's just an excuse uh you know if the markets integrate everything in the moment of uh and so you know who knows um but yeah like unlike ethereum which has like a bunch of positive tailwinds coming its way ethereum bitcoin just kind of feels like floating out at sea like where's it gonna go next we don't really yeah there's not another happening for a while right so what is the next what is the next catalyst that remains to be seen but let's uh tap root let me tell you that it's not okay all right let's talk about uh ether for for a second so price of ether where are we now where did we start yeah we started the week at 21.70 20 2 170 dipped down to 2 000 then we jumped to two thousand four hundred dollars which got everyone really excited and now we are back down to literally exactly where we started at two thousand one hundred and seventy dollars there's some good news about this david and that is eth as is at an all-time low on exchanges like a two and a half year low so people are pulling their ether from exchanges this is awesome this is great for banklessness because it means they're either holding it uh you know privately self-sovereignly which is awesome or they're using it in some sort of a d5 protocol maybe they're trading it on uniswapper providing liquidity on something like kyber rather than uh rather than hold it inside a crypto bank so i feel like this is pretty bullish it also probably means david they're not not exiting or not planning to exit to fiat which is another good sign and he takes here yeah the ethon exchange metric is always interesting when there's low eth on exchanges that always means that like price can be volatile and people generally think it's volatile to the upside just because like if there's no eth to sell because the eath isn't on the exchange so there's only people who can buy eth who want to buy it and if there are people that want to buy it because there's not a lot of ethon exchanges it moves the price faster to the upside granted defy is also a place to buy and sell eth right so a lot of eth could be moving off of the exchanges and going into defy to be sold on uniswap so it's not necessarily that there isn't eth available to sell it's just not like like you said it's not available to sell to go back to people's banks bank accounts so this is a bearish metric for people who are thinking that people are trading their eth like you said to go to fiat um however you could still trade your ether and go to crypto dollars but that's you can you can go to crypto dollars and crypto dollars to me feels also um somewhat temporary or at least it is net positive for ether right you're still using those transaction fees on ethereum you're still using d5 let's let's take a look at some of this eth is definitely going yeah beacon chain deposit contract dude happy 6 million man 6 million in the deposit contract that's great there's over six million ether in the deposit contract right now so i guess like the quick math on that is what's just over six percent of all eth's supply a little bit less a deposit contract uh yes a little bit less yeah cause there's roughly 117 million ether and there's six million ether in the deposit contract right so a little bit less so i mean super impressive though i mean um i remember do you remember the discussions we were having in like winter or late fall of 2020 is like oh is anyone going to put theirs it's a one-way bridge what was the threshold we needed half a million yeah are we gonna be able to make it are we gonna be able to get half a million either these were the questions we were asking i think we made it i think it's okay it's gonna be okay let's talk about that if bitcoin um ratio uh what's that doing so i'm seeing some ups i'm seeing some downs but more ups than downs no last week you're seeing up man then that's really really the the story uh i think the eth btc ratio tells a bigger story than the ether dollar or bitcoin dollar uh the biggest story maybe i think yeah and the same story is also being told we're going to get to this the on the dpi ratio which is also looking just like the eth btc ratio we we are establishing this floor at .055 eth per btc and we could definitely range between where we are now at point zero six five and point five five like there's definitely room to bounce back and forth here but what the story that i am seeing is that when it does hit that point zero five five level it rockets back up maybe not rocket but it sets up it's got a very solid foundation floor at point zero five five which again is historically a high e btc valuation uh and so when when i see ether hitting point zero five five and just rejecting it and going back up that's indicating to me that people are still risk on this is a in my opinion a great proxy for overall the bull market if you are asking if you want to ask the question is the bull market over i think you should look to the eth btc ratio because that tells the story you know david i think you're spitting a lot of wisdom here man because especially we're just talking about the you know bitcoin price in a rut the doldrums no tail wins ahead in terms of narrative for uh bitcoin that we can see in the future but there are a ton of tailwinds ahead for ether we're going to talk about some of those when we get to kind of the news and uh and and some of our takes on that but like eip 1559 uh the merge all of these things are going to be tailwinds for each so if we're going to have a continuance of the bull run we need eth to run yep yep and we need this ratio to continue uh go in the direction evan van ness will happily say that ether and ethereum always leads bull markets uh and so when we see the eth btc ratio rising that's that's where we get to say is like oh this bull market is still still looking good yeah absolutely all right well let's uh talk about other bull market indicators uh value locked in d5 so that's been slightly up slightly up a little bit so 55 billion dollars of value locked in in d5 hanging in the 50s or so not too bad um let's talk let's talk about defy defy tokens as measured by the dpi the d5 pulse index which we talked about every week so a little bit up on that on the week up on the week yeah e5 tokens were catching a bid this week we started started at 260 dollars to start the week ended at 300 but also hit a midweek high again on wednesday hump day uh of 350 dollars and so i think we should go ahead and go right into the dpi conversation ryan you've been waiting for this oh yeah look at that number look at okay so i called the bottom at 0.13 it broke down below 0.13 for a solid like eight nine ten days but i think and you said to be fair you said give it two weeks if it doesn't break for two weeks right you said two two uh weekly roll-ups ago then you're still in the clear so you're still feeling okay it's not i i will admit that i did not call the absolute bottom so like i guess if you want to be really strict about this and say the number fell below 0.13 yes the number fell below 0.13 so part of me wants to be strict on this david but i'll give you some grace too yeah okay so like let's let's think about things in six months in 2022 2022 say for example that defy tokens finally get the bids that they deserve and dpi resurgence back to previous levels and maybe even goes on the bull market that we've all been wanting the d5 tokens to go in the bull market for and they break previous cycles then then what are you going to say like oh david didn't call the bottom of 0.13 because it was point one two even though dpi is is at point three or something like it's gonna be a great bottom call i'd also say so if this bull run turns into like ash and sadness right and um we're ranging in this you know 2000 or so range for eth i'd also give eric connor some credit for calling like 2500 that's a fair point because he kind of deserves that because it shot up above but not for too long so like the spirit of the prediction is intact so david the spirit of your prediction is intact and that's what's important we'll see for now we'll see what happens we're gonna be checking up on you that is a really good point i think about eric's uh top call for those that aren't following air connor had made the top call of two thousand five hundred dollars for eth price then we rocketed above that to four thousand three hundred dollars making eric wrong but we have spent a lot of time below two thousand five hundred dollars even in contrast to how much time you spent above it right and so like while the call was technically wrong the more and more time we spend below that number the more and more eric is in the spirit of things correct which makes me really angry uh and so i i really would like price to get it back above 2500 so i can start gloating against eric connor again there you go we could do that anyway all right let's talk about this you know uh this is a metric i wanted to include in metrics david because nft bear market is what people are saying ain't no bear market apparently that's just a meme that's just a thing that people it is it's a thing that people said you say because look at this open c volume so this is like kind of a um an ebay let's say for nfts where all of the nfts are being sold on kind of secondary markets um best volume ever in june best volume ever 150 million in volume higher than the peak of the mania higher than the peak of the mania so quote-unquote meaning yeah like there are some categories of nfts that are down like um you know top shots maybe um a few other categories but there are others that are up and in aggregate ain't no bear market here nfts are still plowing ahead full steam and like that i think that just makes sense i think when people are saying oh there's an nft bear market what they are really saying is like oh my nfcs are down my nfcs are down i'm no longer getting really rich really quickly on nfts like this random nft project that i just aped into didn't make me any money like yes that side of nfts is in a bear market there are some nft projects that are going to zero just because the market didn't want them nfts as a whole nfts as an industry uh doing just fine and so there's definitely a con consolidation to quality going on in the nft market and we are seeing that play out but this makes sense too right if you think about like collectibles which collectibles are in in style you know 90k for 90s kids it was like pogs right and then it's like at one point in time it was like beanie never forget about babies you didn't know what pogs are okay so like some of you guys listening remember pogs and like anyway collectibles as a whole has not gone down but individual collectibles uh and categories of collector collectibles have had their their their cycles maybe nfts are starting to reflect some of that anyway david we are going to get to releases but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer gemini is the world's most trusted

almost release but it still counts because of a release it's a release of a release it's a release date which is super exciting for eip1559 we're talking about i haven't heard of that one oh oh you're about to hear about it then sir august 4th is the date uh august 4th so that is going to be maybe an ethereum holiday in the future i don't know it's a really it's a really exciting milestone for ethereum and tim baker who is kind of the i guess coordinating lead for this eip has been checked for ethereum as well yeah yes he has confirmed this so it's merged it's in github the date is merged the go live date is um is set so unless something big happens between now and august 4th looks like august 4th is going to be the day for eip 1559 which includes the the the new gas transaction auction mechanism and also the ether burn super exciting man to have a date finally yeah uh and granted asterisk if something goes wrong on the test nets then it will get kicked out but if nothing goes wrong then it's going to be the fourth that's basically the the two paths that we have for with us it's really awesome to have a date august 4th like holy that's so cool it's so close uh bankless and eth are going to do a live stream we are talking with anthony and eric to get that going so there will be no matter what time of day no matter what time of day like whatever yeah we woke up at four in the morning to do the the eth 2.0 beacon chain launch uh live stream and there's there's no other time that we couldn't do if we wouldn't do four in the morning uh so whenever that's happening uh there's gonna be a live stream so stay tuned for that yeah we'll be there this is cool this makes it real too is when you start to see ether scan showing the fee burn look at this at the top here this is on the gorilla test net by the way yeah girly gourley testnet but in gourley testnet and by the way everything's going well in gourley testnet it seems like um there is a fee burn of over 80 eth so far uh of course results will be totally different in mainnet but it's so cool to see that on ether scan you can also see get this david on etherscan you can see uh on the transaction like an overview of the transaction you can actually see the transaction fee savings which i think what this calculates is what you maybe would have paid before versus what you're paying now is that what it's calculating or what is it so i think what's going on here is that with eip1559 you can set how much you are willing to pay and then you will pay the base fee and that's kind of like saying just like how you are when you go into metamask when you want to do a custom gas transaction if you want to really tinker with your gas and make it specific say you say you want to prioritize your transaction so gas is at 50 and you want your transaction to go in asap so you put in 70 and then you overpay by roughly 20 20 gray if your transactions would have otherwise gotten included for 50. with eip1559 you can put in 70 but if base fee is 50 or or the right payment is 50 then you are not paying that extra 20 you are paying 50. and so this is reporting to you like hey you bid up to this amount but you actually paid this amount so this is how much you saved and this is actually where a lot of the confusion about eip-1559 reducing gas costs came from the the if if eip1559 does reduce gas costs it's from reducing the cognitive load of users who have to think about the right price to put in their transaction and also perhaps getting that number wrong so that's where if there's any fee savings it's coming at the human brain level not at the protocol level but that that human brain level shouldn't be underestimated right because like if you're if you're bidding like 70 on that transaction and i get the inkling that you're bidding 70 i'm gonna build bid 71 72 and it just kind of escalates in a very rapid fashion that's how the mechanism kind of incense people to just keep out bidding one another in this model um it doesn't matter right like because you'll get the savings back anyway super cool so just to be clear eip1559 does not save gas fees at the protocol level it makes gas fees easier to reason about and that allows you to make more precise choices about how you spend your gas which can cause you to spend less gas and it also burns that sweetness and also burns it contact that uh all right let's talk about this this is the beacon book david super cool this is kind of an nft an actual physical book this almost looks sorry to me like an almanac of some sorts you know after a team like wins a sports championship like the world series they'll publish a book it'll be quotes from the mvps all of the players on the team that's kind of what this reminds me of only it's for the developers of ethereum two and the beacon chain all of these researchers that have been hard at work bringing this thing to market this kind of commemorates them uh super cool yeah this is uh led by trent vanepps and other contributors to the uh stateful works project which is producing the beacon book this is an actual book uh you can go and read it that's online it's just really so it's a wall of text but you can actually produce a physical book and purchase a physical book if you want to compete for one of those they're going to be in high demand um this is a a uh i think how would i want to describe this this is like as a time stamp of ethereum progress and development right this is going to the ethereum developers the actual protocol of ethereum people who work at client teams people who work at the ef and they talk about their their experience of building out ethereum right this is a going to be a one-of-a-kind piece of of this art uh because or book or illustration uh it's free for you to read uh but purchasing a physical copy is an nft so that there's gonna be competition for that but this is really just instantiating a lot of just just blood sweat and tears of the ethereum developers the ethereum builders to get ethereum to where it is today so so trent and the state full works team have done a fantastic job just honoring all of the labor of the ethereum developers that they have put into ethereum over the last six years into the beacon book and so go ahead and check it out go give it a read get your learn on this will be a great learning moment and then if you want to compete for some of the nfts and some of the actual physical books go right ahead absolutely collect a piece of ethereum history david let's uh talk a little bit about polygon this is part of kind of the layer two summer i know polygon is is a side chain but layer two summer nonetheless kind of a test ramp for all of the layer twos that are coming out balancer joints polygon uh with a 10 million dollar joint token incentive program this is kind of what we're talking about with layer two summer where you have protocol plus the uh the layer two itself rewarding users and incenting them to deposit liquidity into their protocol on layer two dual yield farming is hot so if you are bullish on bao and you are bullish on matic you can go and get liquidity incentives using balancer on polygons so congratulations to bouncer for launching on polygon i'm sure that they are also probably going to be building on arbitrary and optimism too uh and so maybe we also see some bow rewards over there as well you know what's cool is this is starting to get all of the infrastructure i remember probably uh just a couple of years ago when when it hit me that oh my god all of d5 is going to have to re-architect itself on layer two and like what a lift that would take but do you know what david it's happening right and it's happening much more incrementally than i thought it would here's zapper now supporting balancer labs on xerox um on on polygon so you could just zap into a position the same way you would on mainnet now on polygon which is super cool um this is doing analytics integrating with with polygon and the same recipe the same playbook of that they're they're pulling off on polygon that's going to take place in the other um notable layer twos like optimism and arbitrary and it's going to happen really fast from this point on so it's great to see that infrastructure support pouring in as well and we have to see that infrastructure report uh infrastructure being built out on these on these uh l2s because like it's one thing if the apps are there but like the infrastructure is crucial like i think people underestimate how important infrastructure is uh using matic before there was a polygon scan the fork of ether scan was was kind of like using a black box like if your transaction did something weird it was impossible to go and check out what happened to it without polygon scan and so getting all of these like classic infrastructure tools up and running for all these l2s is really going to be what makes and breaks an l2 uh you you need the infrastructure to go along with you that's also that's also why arbit uh optimism has uh been more slow to to launch versus arbitrary uh just because they are just really dotting their eyes and crossing their teeth to make sure that they have the infrastructure to go along with all the apps at the same time so when arbitr optimism rolls out it should come with a suite of infrastructure so it really emulates the experience of using ethereum at the base layer on optimism on day one that infrastructure man really provides such a moat for the evm as well right so if you're if you're launching a a layer two or even a layer one evm support just gets you some of that infrastructure right out of the box um david let's let's talk a bit more about this like the distinction between side chain and layer two we've made before but what about the distinction between a side chain and a test net we're just talking about gourley testnet of course that this is a test net for ethereum mainnet this is where eip1559 is running in the london hard fork is running but this from uh andre my friend andre um from the yfi you know uh a d5 builder extraordinaire when some of the newest stuff that he's built he actually added support for gourley testnet okay so like the d5 products he's building like in addition to other player twos and side chains and ethereum main net he's also adding gourley testnet as an option but what that does david is that makes gourley not a test net anymore because it makes the uh gorly eath go eath it's called makes it valuable potentially what's that distribution like man people used to like i i have some somewhere i think unless it kind of expired or disappeared i'm not sure but like a ton of developers have um this go eath and it kind of clouds the difference between a test net and a side chain if there's actual economic value attached to some of these go eat tokens and he takes on this yeah my my gut take is this is weird and i don't understand why they're doing this but but andre and then also banteg from from urine they're both like bullish on this they're both excited about it they both think that gorly could be an l2 scaling solution to ethereum it sounds like they know more than me and so let me ask what i'm about to say with saying that they might just straight up be more informed about what this could be but gourley is an ethereum fork right it's a it's a clone of ethereum that's meant to be an ethereum testing it's not any more scaled than ethereum itself to my knowledge and if it is it's it's scaled in the same way binance smartchain is scaled which is just tinkering with some numbers that really shouldn't be tinkered with and the reason why you can tinker it with with that on gourley is because it's a test net there's nothing at stake it's it's if it explodes it doesn't matter because it's a test net in my opinion test nets should be test nets and there is a there's terrible gorly distribution i'm pretty sure there's like two people that have like more than 50 or two addresses that have like more than 50 percent gourley ether or there's some like terrible distribution of that if you're starting to use gorilla eath as money or as some valuable asset the distribution of gordon becomes really important and it was never meant to be money it was never meant to be distributed so that it's become very concentrated i'm skeptical of using test nets as l2's testings are test nets or l2s yeah look it just it just makes it a different thing right and i think this is why some of the people like developers of ethereum particularly who have test net deployments are kind of pissed off about this because it kind of ruins the test net i mean like are you going to how incentive are you going to be now to give your go eat to someone who's just testing something out right if it's an economic vet we're going to start doing like go eat improvement proposals now yeah exactly so so what it what it kind of does is it um it makes it a different thing than what it was so if you if you make if you make um gorilla test net an incentivized side-chain system then you just need a different a new test net right we have to go create another test net and i think people are angry about this because i i would like some further analysis on this from people who are more privy to these conversations but also you can't stop it right and stop it like once it starts you can't stop it so we'll have to talk about this as it emerges a bit more um ave pro coming in july david we did an episode stayed in the nation with robert lester on this all about institutions coming to d5 this is the d5 mullet no no no no no no no no take on this defy coming to institutions ah yes important distinction important distinction yeah so so what is this ave pro seems like kind of like compound treasury yep yeah so it's uh it's a the same ave that we know and love same thing with compound treasuries same compound that we know and love there's just a new interface or a new wrapper around the whole whole protocol that is uh you know institution friendly right and so with a compound treasury and with ave pro they solve a lot of just like the issues of using d5 that we all know exists like private keys are scary like once you get used to them they're not but initially they are right and also you need to have certain compliance and reporting requirements well if you just make a wrapper around ave and make a clone of ave a fork of afe that uses ave as the protocol but only allows certain white listed players or certain entities in there who who need that sort of control and allow them to use that wrapped version of ave uh you know protected ave if you will um that is and then and then again it hooks into ave underneath the actual ave protocol that we are all using uh so it's d5 with training wheels a little bit of a bubble boy defy uh which is which is fine that's what the institutions are familiar with uh and so the the the and the fact that we're seeing this in ave and compound at the same time is actually really interesting kind of tells you the rate of progress in this industry like if if and and we also saw this with uh with l2s like it just so happens that optimism and arbitrary releasing both in july like funny coincidence of a pro and compound treasury are also releasing around the same time the rate of change the rate of progress is like breakneck speeds because these these teams keep on releasing the same products around the same time anyways this story is that d5 is becoming institution ready and we are not waiting we're not waiting on our hands for institutions to learn how to manage their private keys we're just figuring out how to solve that problem for them and making it easier for them to come to us so defy is building the bridge to institutions rather than institutions having to build the bridge to defy and that's just how ethereum works ethereum just solves its own problems that's it's a really cool really optimistic story this is this is uh also going to bring a ton of liquidity right a ton of like value from institutions and you know what i love about this too david is like um it's the the in this banking system it's the institutions who need the training wheels not the retail investors we can use the power tools at will if we want i feel like the traditional banking system is the complete opposite the institutions get the better banking system and they give all of us retail consumers the training wheel version of the thing that's an as an interesting take like robin hood is just finance with r with training wheels on it and then here here retail have robin hood here the way they front run you alone right like robin hood that's their business model no fees retail but we're going to front run every trade and you don't actually see that cost there anyway let's talk about some raises this week uh the first is this index co-op the dao just raised 7.7 million from galaxy ventures 1kx a few other vc companies super cool i think that like a native dow is now raising from vcs right it started off with any outside without any outside vc investors but now outside investors want to jump aboard this uh i think that's kind of cool it is cool and the other the other thing that's cool is that um the there is a one-year lock up on these on these index tokens with six months linear investing and the price that they got them at was pretty competitive usually when like organizations like like with you know not too much liquidity on their tokens try and sell their token they give them a pretty good discount there was not much of a discount on the index tokens being sold to these uh into these investors and so i believe uh i'm regurgitating this from from anthony suzanna which i do happen to do a lot uh they were sold for roughly 24 and a half dollars a piece where index token is currently trading at 27 um so uh and i don't know when when these tokens were purchased do you know what's cool about this too david is that like retail had an opportunity to buy index co-op tokens before all of the vcs i did i did i love it right and like and then um you hear the vcs have to get kind of our our table scraps that's kind of nice yeah again training wheels yeah if you've been paying attention bank list if you've been paying attention to defy like you can't you cannot have missed index co-op index co-op is one of those tokens that i never feel like i you're not for nintendo advice blah blah blah but like i'm just super bullish on index it's like the dow is super greased like it works it's a fantastic product it's got tons of revenue now it's finally getting the attention it deserves from from uh you know larger firms uh i'm bullish on index man bullish on index bullish on dows in general bullish on this kind of capital coordination super cool all right also zarion raised 8.2 million in a series a fund just a great d5 dashboard xerion is uh is fantastic it's kind of a user interface it's like a banking interface on top of all these d5 protocols i love what those guys are doing too are you ready for news david let's do it all right let's get to the news hey we got to start with uh a bank jp morgan they say ethereum upgrades could jump start 40 billion a 40 billion dollar staking industry so they're saying ethereum eth2 beacon chain that's going to jumpstart a 40 billion dollar staking industry it's like yeah guys we've been telling you this but like cool hey you guys better start learning solidity oh man well i mean the banks are saying it though now right better late than never yeah yeah if the banks are saying it you know it's like oh yeah this is starting to really breach into the mainstream do you know why they're saying it to you look uh so the first bank this is a swiss bank called um syndrome i think signum signum thank you wow i ventured that signum signum bank is offering e2 staking services right so this is super cool because it is the first time a bank a registered financial bank institution in the jurisdiction of switzerland is offering a staking service and this is recognition that ether is as we've been saying an internet bond this is going to deliver yields to people um this is not my favorite way to stake of course right because this requires that you give this bank custody of your your private keys although you can uh you can dictate a separate um withdrawal contract so there might be some intricacies where you don't like you just give them kind of validating rights i'm not sure how this is configured how this is set up um what's cool i think is that the banks are coming aboard and if ether is going to be a global reserve asset which we think it will if either is going to be an internet bond for the world a non-sovereign bond competing with sovereign debt type instruments and bonds this kind of thing needs to happen so it's it's starting man this is domino one and the rest are gonna fall jp morgan report this bank is now coming to staking how soon until j.p morgan wants to start offering staking of course important that we can still stake at home and we don't have to to to use that non-sovereign um or that we don't have to give up our sovereignty and our private keys to a bank but still they're coming along for the ride it's kind of cool this is the beauty of staking is that like any entity because you can stake at home any entity can therefore stake right this isn't mining you don't need to have like privileged access to supply chains or just be interested in a multi-million dollar investment to a mining operation all you need is a one computer to stake and then banks can stake you know funds can stake anyone can stake anyone can make a sticking product so that improvements could stay governments can stake and that makes staking really really competitive and from an ethereum security proto from an ethereum protocol security perspective that's really really good because you want there to be an extreme amount of competition in the sticking world uh and so i invite all banks to open up you know staking products staking services because i want more steak to happen because that makes ethereum more secure and it's also bullish for for ether and so this is one of the many little um tiny little flags blowing in the wind that say hey uh ether is going to become the world's internet bond and it starts with just competitive staking and many it starts with many many different things with many many different ways but one of the ways it starts is competitive staking across the globe yep absolutely uh david let's talk about this andre the creator of wi-fi and the y-iron ecosystem he's on a tear again i feel like it's back i feel like this is why this is in the news section it's because andre is back and he is building so these are a few things he's built lev x is one um protection market some sort of on-chain insurance uh ave delegate like he's just like pushing stuff out there's about five or six things here that he's pushed out and um into into github and uh you know one of d5's biggest builders is is back maybe from a brief break or hiatus or what's your take on this yeah and this actually isn't all of the the entire list of what he's built he also released another project uh on his own medium that he announced as well um people are stoked that andre is building again um there's there's some mixed opinions on this um because whenever andre was building something right after a year and it attracted all the attention it actually kind of pissed andre off um and then andre kind of like went dormant went quiet just because he didn't enjoy being the person that was like oh andre's building what's he building next what am i going to ape into next what's the next wifi uh and so he looks like he's just releasing a bunch of prototypes a bunch of code it looks like it also is just infrastructure for other prototypes these aren't going to be tokenized products none of these have tokens these have tokens yeah and so maybe that's kind of what andre does nowadays it helps just build in little attachments or little add-ons to already existing projects i don't really know um the day that andre does build a project with a token is going to be an interesting one if he even decides to do that or not i don't maybe he's lost the taste for it we should have him on again david that's what we should do now he's back we should have him on bank once again it's been about a year it has been about a year yeah you're right david let's talk nft world so axie is on an absolute tear look at this uh revenue yep um up and to the right oxy infinity what are what are people doing with axi uh actually infinity is kind of like a pokemon game but with on-chain scarcity mechanisms built in so you raise and breed little axey creatures and then you make them fight which is the death i i i mean to the metaphorical death i think you i'm pretty sure you get yours back uh you level them up uh each one has different properties um and people are really they they have been one of those i wouldn't say dormant but you know kind of heads down building projects with a very committed community fan based following that would play this game but it has absolutely taken off in the last uh in the last like maybe two three weeks or so broken into the absolute like mainstream news cycle of crypto we are actually bringing jiho on the state of the nation next week on tuesday to talk all about axi infinity and the explosion of growth that they've seen in the last two weeks so if you are interested in this story we will be reporting on it on the state of the nation on tuesday here's the meme term to remember uh you ready ready for it play to earn play to earn that's what's happening in axi and i think this is a model that is just beginning that crypto game studios are really pioneering i expect to see a lot more i expect to see more from like even gods unchained in the future around that all right david uh bitcoin world there's really not too much to talk about this week all is quiet in in bitcoin land um so let's uh let's hop over to regulation um china's central bank worried that stable coins pose risk to the financial system do you think this is also because it's kind of a usdc it's sorry it's the dollar seeping into uh chinese markets and they want to protect the sovereignty of their currency and the reserve currency status of the chinese um you know one it's it's absolutely that there's nothing that china wants more than to dethrone the dollar and place the yuan there uh and so of course they don't want you know stable coins to exist because stable coins are dollars they're not you yuan you're yen or whatever um and so yuan thank you um important note uh and so this is completely antithetical to what china wants china doesn't like free markets china doesn't want you know permissionless finance they want you to use their currency on on their rails uh and while the us isn't 100 aligned with crypto dollars and they also kind of want their own cbdc they are much more cool with stable coins out of the private market than than china yeah you know it's you know as funny as the game theory of this is if china hates it i bet the us will start liking it more it's like oh stable coins private stable coins they're great now we don't need a central bank digital currency right privatize it all and export that way the private markets built our cbdc for us oh thanks guys guys kind of could be it could go in that direction so uh remains to be seen it's but there's so much game theory going on about the world reserve currency status particularly with with fiat um let's talk about this ransomware hackers demand 70 million in bitcoin and they claim a massive u.s attack as biden investigates possible russian involvement david i didn't even catch this story what is this story talking about yeah this has been a reoccurring theme over the last last few months there's just been more and more ransomware attacks that have been using bitcoin as a currency and so it's an unfortunate pr issue for our industry i'm not even going to say just bitcoin just for crypto at large uh even though all these attacks have been happening with bitcoin people kind of associated with crypto at large because it is um and and so this is going to be a fight that our our industry is going to have to tackle head-on and also there's no reason why this can't happen with crypto dollars or stable coins as well uh and so nlw had a really good take on this is what who do you think is going to get blamed do you think bitcoin is going to get blamed or do you think russia is going to get blamed probably gonna be both to be honest um but overall this is uh an unfortunate reality of the world that we live in it's a bad pr for our industry uh and permissionless finance allows you to do permissionless finance things like you know one thing i've learned about politicians it's they'll blame who whoever it's most politically expedient to blame right and so one day it might be russia the next it might be bitcoin depends on what the political aims are going to be but yeah it's not great pr that's for sure especially when bitcoin doesn't have a single representative to defend itself it's easy to defend or to attack something that can't defend itself yeah the bitcoin cyber hornets can can yell on twitter saying no this is fud but like there's no actual like satoshi isn't coming to say like hey this is this is don't attack bitcoin on this one um like there's no strength also strength right double-edged sword there um all right let's talk about this uh stable coin firm circle is going public via a spac merger this is pretty cool brand new this is brand new as of this brand new couple hours old yeah the numbers are crazy um look at this the deal value circle at 4.5 billion whoa i know we're just talking about stable coins right and uh usdc is one of the most popular stable coins definitely the most legitimate stable coins out there tether is the only other competitor but doesn't have the legitimacy that usdc does and circle is a primary issuer of that four point five billion that's a big bet on stablecoin congratulations congrats to uh to uh jeremy alaire and everyone at circle and probably also coinbase is involved with this one as well uscc just really planting a flag as the de facto crypto dollar fiat-backed crypto dollar uh in in the ecosystem um congrats this is this is a really this is really uh i feel like a monumental moment for the industry like there are many monumental moments but like it's a mini coinbase site it's a mini coinbase very it adds to the legitimacy of the industry all right david uh speaking of legitimacy and the industry america's first legal dow was approved in wyoming wyoming has been a state that's been very friendly to crypto regulation and overall i'm really enthusiastic and like excited about the approach that they've taken even recognizing dao's as a thing is just amazing so very bullish on that although not perfect um i read an analysis from a uh legal substance crypto legal sub stack that i follow and there's some weirdness about this right so dow's dowse in this structure cannot be manager managed so people can't actually be behind it has to be algorithmically managed so um that adds some weirdness to it yeah there's some description here but it just means it's more it's like it's more difficult to have um you know a centralized institution kind of give up control uh it has to be completely decentralized at the start so there's some some some issues there also if you're going to do this in wyoming you have to put dao in the name right all right like it has to be called uh something dao right it can't just be bankless has to be bankless dao which is convenient for bangladesh but not so convenient if you're ave or uniswap and you don't want to be called uniswap down necessarily this also really kills my interest and effort in trying to promote digital organizations or oh yes yeah it's not a doubt it's a do but no apparently apparently i'm giving up on that fight yeah well we'll see maybe you'll win in the next round um the bill also requires the dallas to maintain a person a registered agent in wyoming so there's still so again it's kind of a first draft right it's good that wyoming is doing this but it's a little ham fisted on the implementation still no discouragement like kudos guys you're actually pushing the right direction with some revisions this could be something really cool so yeah we'll look forward to the future they're trying they're trying their best they're trying to is that this is the nation state telling dallas what they need to do and the whole point about ethereum is to not have to do that uh dao's i know dows belong to ethereum they owe no homage to any nation state i guess if they want the perks of being instantiated in the nation state this is like the culture should be like a legal coupler yes this is a couple there should be a bridge to the nation state right and this is kind of a ham-fisted bridge but at least it's a bridge yeah i mean something i'm i am most bullish on pure dows as in dows that exists on ethereum and ethereum alone and the only rules that they abide by are the rules enforced by the evm that that's the most bankless maxi the most bankless future uh there is absolutely a time and place to be coupled to the real world and i don't want to discourage anyone uh from doing that but like the grand vision of dao's belongs to ethereum and right now it's gonna be a little bit ham-fisted if you try to couple into the real world right um it's it's hard okay uh a few things we're gonna just breeze by david the first is this visa is crushing it with crypto linked card usages that top a billion dollars so this is all the visa cards that crypto banks are issuing which are cool some of these are coming to market one from gemini one from blockfly coinbase is doing something uh crypto.com has already has uh something going visa's like hey we love it hop in a billion this is working keep it coming uh bullish yeah uh david why don't you do the next one yeah the binance squeeze barclays customers in the us barclays as a bank in the in the or excuse me in the uk can no longer transfer funds to binance finance the undomiciled crypto bank getting the squeeze from nation states that's all i have to say there it's like that vice grip slow squeeze rather than a than a quick hit um why don't you do this one too david elizabeth warren gives the sec july 28 deadline to quote figure out quote crypto regulation uh elizabeth warren has started really started to stamp her feet about crypto as an industry the the thoughts behind this is crypto or elizabeth warren is really bullish on a central bank digital currency and so she wants to diminish their role and of the crypto industry and wants to regulate it in order to you know implement implement her cbdc overall she is really just drumming up a lot of noise about how our industry needs to get regulated and from what i can tell she's extremely informed about it i think elizabeth warren is a great politician uh i think that she does a great job i i overall support her i have not heard a single good noise out of her as it relates to crypto and the industry that i pay attention to and so all of a sudden i feel very uh resonant with like the libertarian cohort who just get pissed off at politicians who come in and start regulating other people's industries and other people's businesses while they have no like informed position about it that's what i see happening here there's definitely some intent at play here and uh yeah there's there's a broader plan here all right um david before we get into the takes we got a lot for the week a lot of hot tips big takes episodes this week you're gonna love these takes guys but before we get to them we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave dot com all right guys we are back with the takes for the week let's start with this one from chain link god who says a blockchain without oracle's is like a computer without the internet he got the meme correct this time his words a blockchain without oracles is like a computer without the internet what's your thought yeah i thought that was a pretty cool way to illustrate the role of oracles when it comes to blockchains blockchains only know what is true according to their internal state ethereum only knows about ethereum so it needs oracles to know things about the rest of the world and so chain-link god who is literally the instantiation of bullishness on chain link itself uh he kind of compares and contrasts this to like well if you just have a computer but no internet the computer only knows things that are on the computer but if you connect it to the internet you can google what is the weather in argentina or whatever uh and so i think that's a pretty cool way to illustrate the role of of oracles and blockchains okay oracle's super important agree with you chain link god on that um what about this stake this is kind of a contrasting tank or here's the yin and the yang that was the bullish chain link here's the bearish train link give us the yang what's going on here uh yeah this twitter account which i've never seen before edgar a root says wake up chain link controlling all information inflow on chain is the worst possible coming dystopia and then goes through a thread about all the risks of what happens when ethereum only receives inbound information from chain-link oracles and chain-linking oracles alone it's a centralization risk like chain-link is the only thing providing external data to ethereum uh and he goes uh think uh indisputable history blockchain plus a gaslit army of zombies calling it fair private mem uh i think that's referring to the chain link army and then he also says a private mempool with unverifiable node software that's the chain link chain link infrastructure and then edgar says think more widely than just token prices which is largely what train link is currently used for real estate deeds oil prices passage of law marriage deeds all funneled and control controlled by a tiny cabal with insane power again referring to chain link here uh and then and then he kind of goes into the nuances and critiques of chain link uh in a kind of a nuanced way which i won't go into on the on the bankless weekly roll up here but he is saying that there is just too much centralization and consolidation on oracle power to the chain link network and we need to diversify some of that power outside to other oracles well i i think we should always have some skepticism about oracle's um particularly off-chain oracles this is why i like um ether so much as an asset like ether's price isn't based on anything external right we've called it the the most trustless form of economic bandwidth for ethereum right other assets are not like this even something like maker dao requires an oracle to function unit swap is pretty beautiful in that it doesn't require an oracle i love the sorts of defy primitives that like come without and don't require an oracle so oracle design but with that said oracle's my god they're super useful for getting all sorts of different you know synthetics and d5 products and you know as this person's saying uh real estate deeds oil prices commodity prices all these things on chain and so they're useful in the here and now but they could become a centralization vector and they are dependent on the degree to which chain link is actually decentralized right um i don't know if i'd prefer to live in a world with many different oracles i probably would i'm not sure all of the details of chain link's level of centralization versus decentralization but also david there's an element that look anything coming off chain into the blockchain is going to be centralized at some level so can you really get around all of these things what are your thoughts yeah chain link is supposed to be a decentralized oracle network as in like even though there's there's only one chain-link network the participants of the chain link network are sufficiently decentralized whether that's true in practice is up for debate and that is the subject of a lot of debate in the oracle world i am i am bullish on all kinds of oracles maker dao just solved their own problem and made their own oracles and now other people can use those oracles compound has hooks into its own network of oracles using both centralized and decentralized options coinbase offers oracle services a lot of exchanges offer oracle services coin gecko offers oracle services the pattern of robustness is that you have redundant and redundant and redundant oracles and dependence on chain link is not redundancy i want to see competition amongst oracles and i'm not seeing that i'm just seeing people just hook into train link over and over and over again all right david let's take a look at this next take uh this is from bellagi the creator economy is becoming part of the crypto economy he says because legacy social media platforms have no real concept of digital property rights this is a hot take and he goes on he talks about sub stack twitter facebook they're all great but they are intermediate steps ghost goes further you can run it at a domain they control decentralized media platforms go further still you hold the private keys he goes on to make the point that oh no that third tweet i think is really really important all right he finishes up with under communism there was no such thing as personal property everything that transpired in the prc and ussr was downstream of that economic illogic the root cause the restoration of private property was one of the keys to unlocking the chinese economy and nick carter uh wrote an article a while ago kind of a kind of a niche article that didn't really make make through the name mainstream i read it i love that one which one you you which one are you talking where he talks about like property rights right you talked about like yes the success of developing nations and the economies of nations as it relates to how strong their property rights are and he made the made the association made the claim that the stronger the property rights the more innovation and development is allowed to happen because people have assurances as to the assets that they own so ryan you and i are big on twitter big degenerate tweeters we don't own our twitter handles even though we made all the work to produce the value of the content of for people that follow us on twitter if we actually owned our own twitter handles which we don't we would have longer better assurances as to what we could do with our twitter accounts and that could blossom into something new and so this is what bolajis is talking about he's saying the crypto economy or the the creator economy is is coming uh and and with the web 3 world the world where we own our own social media platforms there's going to be a blossoming of just like content and innovation and creatorship because people own the land that they are settling on i think that's a really good take yeah we are basically renting our twitter accounts twitter could deactivate us at any time we can't take the communities with us they can um punish us via algorithm uh you too any social media property that you added to a president right any social media property you have is is rented property not owned so it's like it's like um like building your house on someone else's land right and in particular a faceless corporation's land that has no notion of individual rights i guess there's a user agreement but that is not like a charter of freedoms or a bill of rights you must sign that in order to have that anyways who reads it oh my god how can you read it um anyway that's a great take by bellagi he follows it up with this take why don't you read this yeah from internet influencer to crypto creator the internet influencer was forced to rely on legacy media and social media platforms the crypto creator uses decentralized media to become completely independent from them this reminds me of just how like there was once three channels and now there are like a million youtubers right like there used to be this one approved form of information and media and now there's going to be like a bajillion of them bankless being one of them uh and and that is a take here totally everybody can like social media allowed everyone to become oprah winfrey if they wanted to right it wasn't just like one place to go for that level of influence but what this also means david is all those influencers that the internet has built up over the last 10 15 years they're going to find a conduit into crypto and they're going to come into crypto they're going to bring their communities into crypto with them we've already seen this with with gary vee um his nft sales platform is doing pretty well i read recently that he's already booked a million dollars in in terms of um you know uh it was like volume or something there was some metric that was important anyway he's bringing his entire clearly wasn't that important it was something it was i can't remember it's too many numbers going on in my head but um thanks for that oh my god we have a sound board now on on weekly rollups gonna be my bane and only david can control it talk about centralization anyway all of these influencers if there's anyone listening still all of these influencers will be coming to crypto and bring their communities with them i think that's what this this means that's what blaji's saying here's another take from dcf god he goes this is a take on binance and c d phi or really just crypto banks he goes binance literally at the point where i need to upload a selfie video of myself doing random to get my funds uh and so he is trying to withdraw his assets from binance and he has a withdrawal appeal page ups he has to appeal to withdraw and here is the upload statement video instructions you need to appear in the video and hold the information page of your id document please clearly state the following today on month day year i'm applying to withdraw x amount of x cryptocurrency for my account i confirm that it is my activity and i am contacting binance customer service to enable the withdrawal function of my binance account here's my email address and phone number uh and you have to actually do this a second time for a whole different you have to do two of these things and that sounds annoying and troublesome especially when i compare it to just borrowing or trading or whatever on unit swap and all my ledger asked me is to approve a transaction or not and it's one single button stark contrast start contrast uh crypto banks not looking so hot yeah look this is not self-sovereign finances the finance squeeze finance is getting squeezed for it look at this i mean this is this is terrible you have to like record yourself saying these things like um wow and that this is not just for the initial sign up process for aml kyc this is just to withdraw every time you need to withdraw can you imagine saying this yeah right i mean i don't think that's what's going on i think if you want to withdraw most customers can just withdraw like normally and put your ethereum address which is already cumbersome to begin with because you want to check your email like approve it blah blah blah but i think this might have happened if like i don't know i don't know like his account got compromised either way it's like a part of the binance ecosystem and they're making people do it uploading a video it's hilarious yeah all right bellagi again audrey again he keeps dropping the takes this week this one's this one's completely new though i'll read this one blossom goes i'm not the first to observe this but the speed and depth of innovation happening simultaneously in several fields is just not something that current societal institutions can handle what balaji is saying is there is so much innovation happening in this world not just in crypto but also definitely in crypto that people just can't even come to terms with it like there is advance massive advancements in ai there's massive advancements in bioengineering there's massive advancements in in in crypto and ryan i think if you click on that text or click on that tweet he might list uh maybe it was a retweet that he retweeted himself he just listed a bunch of things that like societal institutions can't handle right now because they're really complex they're really hard to understand and they're advancing at an accelerated rate and so i'm just reminded of our podcast with rosenthal about the crypto renaissance you need to be on the on the fringes of at least one of these fields that's about to change the world because if you don't then you're behind and so be a part of the revolution undergo the revolution rather than it uh happening to you uh and so if you are it would be unfortunate to be part of this legacy legacy world and have all this massive rate of change happening that you're just ignoring because it's too complex and you can't keep up with it uh change is coming to the world again this is almost a completely a conversation outside of crypto change is coming to the world and you need to be on the ball in the 20-20 decade absolutely yeah you can't just trust your financial advisor right you can't just trust your college admissions like officer you can't just trust you know who whoever saying yeah if you just sock away your funds in a 401k and work at a steady job for 20 years right there's going to be like retirement there is no steady job for the next 20 years not one job will last for 20 years it's gonna be completely different yeah so you got to get ahead of this this is not the you know not the era our parents grew up in um you know what's really cool too is he said current social institutions can't handle this uh crypto is a new institution remember when we had bellagion he talked about like the crypto nation state actually creating a little literal sort of nation state that is built on crypto institutions that's the sort of thing he was talking about if we're gonna handle this rate of change we need new institutions um let's do this one why don't you read it out david yeah okay so this is a retweet of a stani tweet so it starts with tastani saying that a kind reminder that 60 of dai is backed by usdc which is a little bit of a knock-on die like what good is a trustless stable coin if 60 of it is backed by trusted collaterals trusted assets which is just a dollar so diet it's a good take i it's a good take yeah uh dye is basically 60 usdc is that really what we want when it comes to a trustless stable coin maybe not and then stefan from the rye reflexer project goes another reminder that if you simply backed your peg coin with eth you still have a broken peg and so that is harking back to the days where die a single collateral die or back when multicollateral die was largely just eth dai had a lot of trouble maintaining the peg it fluctuated between 95 cents to a dollar and five cents until they really opened up us dollar backing of dye and so stefan is saying there's a trade-off there's a trade-off here and perhaps it's actually not possible to have a pegged trustless stable coin without compromising the coll the composition of the collateral that is behind it uh and so what the what the through line is and stefan he's the ceo of reflexer so he's very incentivized to promote rye as a product so there's his bias there but i still agree with him is he saying that perhaps the pegging is the problem perhaps we want a stable coin that's unpegged because then we can have ether as collateral ether being the only collateral behind rye and then we have our trustless stable coin maybe we just lose the peg and we keep the stability and that's what rye is but whatever he's saying he's saying that like well if you back die with uh centralized stable coins that's a problem because you're backing it with centralized table coins if you back it with just eth well then you lose the peg anyways between because die so ryan is doing that's what ryan is doing yeah backed by ethan right we're okay with losing the peg to the dollar we can create our own unit of account here yeah and so the the through line is trustless stable coins are hard uh dye has its problems and it and it's you know solutions it is still a great product um but if we really want to have the self-sovereign trustless stable coin that we've all wanted maybe we got to lose the peg to the dollar oh it's funny too because all the algorithmic stable coins without collateral without any collateral back have failed failed they've all blown up and they've blown up relatively quickly yeah um so maybe there's no way to solve that problem too there's so much so many so much experimentation that goes on in the stablecoin space i'm i'm really excited to see all of it how about this one mev negative externalities alert this is from robert miller this polygon bot has been active since june 29th and has sent two million transactions failing almost all the time these failures cost close to nothing but they bloat the state while the few successes pay for the failures many times over this is mev at work but on polygon the transactions cost almost nothing right so it's just mev with no cost and a lot of upside but there is cost to the public system right the public good that is polygon in the form of state bloat what's your take here yeah so there is a spectrum of scale and trade-offs right and so polygon has really optimized for a very very scaled side of this of the scaling spectrum and that that's why polygon transactions on polygon are actually going to be like a lot cheaper than transactions on uh arbitrarium or optimistic roll-ups uh transactions on arbitrary optimistic worlds they're going to cost like a number of pennies up to 50 cents maybe even up to a dollar they will be an order of magnitude better than the ethereum main chain but they're not going to be free and instant oh they still will be instant they will not be free like how they are on polygon polygon has scaled differently it's made some trade-offs it has even more scale than optimism in arbitram and you can get even cheaper fees but when you go that far down the uh down the spectrum of scale um then you have externalities and so because they have made transactions so incredibly cheap it has been economically rational for this mev bot to spam the polygon blockchain with random transactions hoping one of them hits and in the certain scenarios that there's probably some sort of strategy that this mev bot is trying to trying to do make trades on quick swaps or something i don't really know it's not the point the point is is that it's economically rational for the spots to spam transactions over and over and over again trying to like catch a fish and the every time it catches a fish it just makes it all of the spam worth it and this ends up just adding more and more state into the polygon blockchain which means that all the polygon validators are downloading every single transaction that this bot is doing and downloading that into the state that they are downloading it and then the whole network has to absorb all of these spam transactions because the transactions are so cheap uh and so this is uh the mev is causing negative externalities which is what robert started this tweet off is adding bloat because of how cheap transactions are and remember trend you pay transaction fees because we need to meter resources when we use these public systems uh and so the while our uh polygon is so awesome because it is so incredibly scaled it has its own network costs to this which we are starting to see yeah yeah state is definitely a negative externality it's a public good that no one pays for in these chains right now and that is the issue because it because it can lead to that centralization now binance change just like removes all the um all the guards on this and right like their their state has swollen um you know so much above a terabyte now yeah it's very difficult to to run uh binance validation but that's of course okay it's because there's only like 10 or 11 of them and they're all appointed by binance polygon has the same issues they have some more guard rails in place for state and so they're trying they're limiting it in other ways but the interesting point i think is that whether you're a side chain whether you're the main chain ethereum or whether you're a layer two like optimism or arbitrary you're all going to have this state bloat problem and it's going to be a centralizing factor now i'm waiting to see the first um kind of iterations and changes to this uh vitalik i don't know if you caught the post recently that vitalik wrote might have been ethereum research where he proposes a few um solutions to ethereum may net state blow right um one of them is this idea of like it's not quite um state rent but it's state expiry where like state expires after a certain point in time archive nodes like distant archive nodes can still keep it but if you want to reactivate that state you have to send a special transaction to reactivate that state so that's like one idea that's floating out there um you know there are some other ideas um as well that that some of these chains have i know when we had optim when we had arbitrary mod they talked about you know some of their concepts that they were pursuing in the future but the key thing is state can't be free right in these chains and if it is free it'll just bloat and become centralized so somebody has to pay for this in the future uh anyway all these chains will have to work through it i think polygon will work through it as well i think it'll be okay but it's just a hidden cause somebody tweeted at me the other day dave there's like yeah um i'd be bullish on define crypto as soon as gas fees go away it's like okay i wouldn't gatherings will go away on l2s but like you said i wouldn't wait until until becoming bullish at that point yeah no but i also mean like you have there has to be a cost to this stuff it can't these transactions can't be free um we're just used to the whole like facebook you know free me freemium model where we're like oh yeah we don't pay for our products we just get we just pay for them in other ways like you paid with your soul yeah yeah um i i just said just uh for the people who are newer into this ecosystem and want to understand why this is so important think of state blow as literally it's just it's the size of the chain in in like gigabyte terms in this and and just think about a cryptoeconomic system that is like 20 gigabytes versus 20 terabytes if you are only 20 gigabytes your literal footprint on the internet is smaller and you are more anti-fragile more uh more you know spreadable more viral anybody can run it and more decentralized right and so a smaller more lightweight system which which is what bitcoin when small blocks in the small block wars and the block wars for bitcoin that was this fight this was this fight is can we make our blockchain crypto economic system lightweight and easy to manage and one of the big critiques of ethereum is that we allowed our state bloat to grow really really quickly in the early days of ethereum now we are trying to to corral that it's a big problem of crypto but overall we like our systems to be smaller lighter easier to download easier to sync and that's and the more state you have the more state bloat you have the harder it is to achieve those goals so there's trade-offs balances there's your little learning lesson there we go let's talk about this last one so this is um jacob uh whether it's mev performance of unit swap v3 or economic exploits let's take a minute to recognize that a transparent financial system means that people all around the world with nothing more than an internet connection can openly examine flaws and collectively work to resolve transparency is the most under-recognized property of decentralization it is a basic requirement of decentralization a non-transparent system can never be decentralized and then he goes on every critic every troll every die hard anti-coiner makes the system stronger critics can crit criticize precisely because the base system is transparent regulators can call crypto systemic risk because they can actually see how many stable coins exist on chain think about how incredible it is that um less than 24 hours after an exploit there are dozens of twitter threads postmortems and blog articles flush with data revealing the precise flaw what does this look like in tradify a back page bloomberg article two years after the event open public systems allow society to scale they increase the speed and efficiency of information coordination collective learning and collective resolution i'm just going to finish this david this idea of open decentralized finance is bigger than bitcoin ethereum or satoshi and if preserved if we choose to value it above all else we'll live far beyond any implementation of it that's a great tweet thread great tweet thread yeah i don't even have too much to add jacob did just like does a great job summarizing this basically systems that are inside out have all of their flaws exposed and so sure there are plenty of critiques about our industry people critique our industry all the time it's because it's transparent and they actually can find things to to critique about and that actually makes the system better because our flaws stick out like a sore thumb forcing us to have to address them rather than sweep them under the rug this is this is the metaphor of andreas antonopoulos made this metaphor of bubble boy versus like the sewer rat where like crypto is the sewer rat right like it just eats diseases for breakfast because it's become immune to them whereas legacy finance is the the bubble boy like any one little ounce of bacteria that like gets inside the bubble causes the whole system to just like die right and so because we are an inside out industry we wear all of our flaws on our surface everyone knows what our flaws are and we know how to answer to them and correct them and route around them uh and this is why our industry is anti-fragile and why our industry is going to eat all the the legacy industries nice yup i agree even like so i've been part of some conversations about mev and like criticisms of minor extractable minimum extractable value on that maximum extra maximum excuse me extractable value on ethereum lately and what what the critics fail to recognize is that in uh traditional systems right they're extracting the value but you just can't see it right so there's nothing to criticize there's no data points here like how do we know whether you know gamestop had a conversation with citadel to halt trading or treat one uh group different than another same with bitcoin by the way like so much activity mev activity in bitcoin doesn't happen on bitcoin because you can't trade on bitcoin you can't take out a loan on bitcoin what can you do on bitcoin you can move it from one address to another all of this activity happens inside of crypto banks can they be front running you like how about bitmex right i mean like black box derivatives model it's so much better when all of this is up front in the open completely transparent even when we have to deal with mev problems at least we see what we're dealing with that is something the credit critics don't take into account well that transparency with mev really creates a completely different like context for what this industry is trying to do with mev like like you said the the concept or the same patterns of mev exist in the legacy financial world there are people who with like fiber optics cables that are measured to exactly the same as others because people want to get their trades in faster there's order routing routing like deal flow mev in the in the legacy world is is massive and it's just got captured because no one really tried to collaboratively solve the problem in the crypto world we all see mev and the problem that it creates and now we are trying to collaborate collaboratively solve the problem rather than just like raising the the white flag and say you know what like we're just going to let some company win and capture all the value here and we'll just give up that's what happened we are actually because it's transparent we are actually trying to solve this problem and make a more equitable financial system because you can view it your though your only choice in the legacy world even the crypto bank world is depend on regulators that's it that's how the existing system solves it if we catch you doing something that's against the law if we catch you right then you know you you have the threat of the the long arm of the law yeah oh you you extracted 100 million dollars from your clients and we you did it in a way that's against regulations here's a 5 million dollar fine god how how often do bankers go to jail remember 2008 one guy went to jail wow good good i'm glad we got i'm glad we got him yeah there was a scapegoat all right that's it david let's uh let me ask you what are you excited about this week man i'm gonna invoke my anthony suzano here where he tweeted out how the stars are aligning for ethereum and so i'm going to play off of what anthony was saying this week we got eip10559 on august 4th we got the merge coming in q4 q1 2022. got layer two is coming in july it's july now by the way we got arbor trump and optimism uh rolling out probably this month uh the rebirth or renaissance of nfts we got institutional defy now we got banks staking ether like i don't know like what more bullish fundamentals like you want i can ask for but like i feel like i'm getting all of them i feel like i'm getting every single bullish fundamental i've ever asked for in my time in ethereum and it's all seemed it all seems to be on the horizon like that's what i'm excited about like it seems to be finally here yeah dude we definitely have a lot and i'm gonna just uh my what i'm excited about is i'm just gonna riff on the eip1559 because that's something we've been i remember when you wrote an article on bankless 2019 called the missing puzzle piece the missing puzzle piece to ethereum's monetary policy and it talked about eip 1559. this is uh proof of work issuance i'm going to display this because like ether is proof of work yeah sorry this is ether's proof of work issuance i spent some time creating this uh and this is um annual percentage on the left access started at 20 annual uh issuance percentage so block time increases issuance reduction one issuance reduction two and now here we are here which is uh august 2021 eip 1559 goes down ether is going to start to be burnt don't know how much that depends on block space demand at any given time but it's going to go down it's going to be burnt until the merge and then guess what falls off a cliff all proof of work issuance ends we're at about 4.1 4.2 or so annual issuance and proof of work there's also proof of stake issuance on top of that um but all of that comes to an end and then we get into this new era david this new issuance policy monetary policy era post eip 1559 post the merge which is kind of the ultrasound money era basically where we're gonna be like less than one percent issuance likely negative issuance for ether for the rest of the platform's life cycle right that that's the plan right now so i'm excited about that because eip 1559 is the first step to ultrasound money get to the merge later probably early um 2022 but this first step is absolutely a monumental event in ethereum's issuance policy monetary policy history it's great for the asset totally this this chart of ether's issuance or ether's monetary policy is a favorite chart of bitcoiners to like fud ether as money or ethereum's monetary policy because they've got a few here oh yeah they show you this chart and be like look look at how irregular this chart is it's jagged it's not stable who knows where it's going to go next but if you go if you look at that chart it tells you a very very solid trend of just a down and to the right and also stabilizing over time it was chaotic in the first in the first two years of ethereum i will give you that in 2019 onwards it has been very stable and it's now going into the final phases of ethereum's monetary policy where we just don't have to touch it forever or maybe maybe this is not it's just not even that hard to understand this constituent's policy there's been like two issuance reductions right the the the places where it's gone down and risen back up have been because of a difficulty bomb that's been embedded in the in in the code to force ethereum to upgrade to get to proof of stake hard fork when that difficulty bomb is uh taken away then uh issuance goes back up temporarily for a period of time but it's always down it's always down and it's it's also stabilizing over time which is the really the important thing it is becoming exactly what bitcoin you're saying or bitcoin maxies sorry excuse me bitcoin maxis say that ether's monetary policy they said they say it's like the fed right it's like which is ridiculous excuse me but it's becoming more dependable more stable over time and importantly extremely low and so like this this chart is again historically a favorite chart by bitcoin maxis to flood ethereum and i think it's about to flip into ether people's ether maxies whatever our favorite chart to illustrate the power of ethereum's monetary policy look how low it is and look how stable it is it's about to become a bullish ether monetary policy chart not a bearish one minimum necessary issuance all right man we pr we promised everyone the meme of the week of the week the meme of the week what is it oh my gosh what's this guy's name harold harold harold yeah a meme favorite and harold's uh is drinking a cup of coffee looking at his laptop and he says i don't want a nine to five job no one in the crypto world wants a nine to five job we want to work in crypto so ryan take us to the next panel oh there's the next panel there you go now now i'm in crypto now i work 24 7. and ryan you and i were talking before about like how we like resonate with this meme a little bit too much never worked so much in my life i could never imagine myself going back to like a nine to five like show up show up at nine close it clock out at five type job anymore i don't know how i would do it but then also i realized like oh yeah now i just like uh i'm not really ever turned off when it comes to working that is a downside right not ever turned off but like i also when i am working don't feel like i'm working exactly as much i mean there's some things which just feel like work but like so it's a double-edged sword here too but oh my god i can relate like yeah too much time on crypto markets don't turn off crypto twitter doesn't turn off crypto is a is a global phenomenon so announcements go out at two in the morning whether whether you are awake for them or not uh and so like the overall working in the crypto industry the lines are definitely blurred between like what is working working work and play yeah which is you know pros and cons like sometimes you just don't want to have to be working but also it's not that bad also it's just not that bad yeah that's right you could you could definitely set your own schedule consume as much or as little as you want all right guys
