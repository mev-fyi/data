all right guys we are back gonna start with the crypto contagion the three arrows capital meltdown uh the story continues into this week here is a story from the wall street journal crypto hedge fund three arrows capital ordered by court to liquidate david's going to go through all of the details but just a little bit of background on this through his capital is absolutely massive during the bull run um 10 to 18 billion maybe assets under management it's still kind of unclear but a whole lot of money and a whole lot of prestige through this group and now there's a complete meltdown david what's the story here like what take us through the timeline of what happened now that we have seen the fallout from some of this we get to start to peer inside the black box that is throughout his capital and all of this really started and this behavior started at the very beginning of the bull market for those that were here around the beginning of the bull market the grayscale gbtc trust that it's gb dc is one to one uh towards bitcoin but not there's no redemption window and this is because we cannot have a bitcoin etf because of the sec they we had to make a trust out of things and so you could come to the grayscale gbtc trust you could deposit one bitcoin you would be issued one gbtc share and then six to 12 months later you were allowed to liquidate that share on the open market and this is for accredited investors only as the bull market got underway and like uh institutions did not have coinbase accounts or ftx accounts they used the grayscale trust to gain access to bitcoin and since they're not one-to-one redeemable since there's not a credit window the grayscale gbt's trust could have a premium i think the premium got as large as like 148 percent as in like one bitcoin was uh one gptc share was worth 1.48 times a bitcoin when it should trade at par but it doesn't because it's not an etfs so it's a nice arbitrage it's a 48 arbitrage right there if you can take the six months illiquidity illiquidity window right so here's what three hours capital would do they they went out and borrowed as much bitcoin as possible from the market to turn it into gbtc shares to milk this premium they would borrow bitcoin from some source and they would put it into grayscale six months later they would have this like 48 like arbitrage and that number would fluctuate because this premium would never go away right it was so persistent for so long uh that that's what people thought but then even even the most average person well like yeah if there's a premium people are going to milk it and throughout capital were the people milking it the thing is ryan they weren't selling their gptc in to capturing on premium they were giving it to they were using it as other collateral so like this starts off by three years capital borrowing as much bitcoin as possible as much bitcoin as the market would lend to them from any lender facility possible which is where this contagion starts and so they put all their btc that they are borrowing into the grayscale gbt trust to get gbtc back and then they start using that gptc as collateral to borrow stable coins so they're now borrowing stable coins based on their gptc and they started to invest in order to try and get the alpha try and get the premium to start to pay their some of their loans back for borrowing bitcoin in the first place they invest bigly into tara we all know what happens there uh they bought a bunch of vested avax tokens uh well i mean avax is down bad and they're probably still vesting anyways and they started to take more and more capital from wherever they could get it because they also have like loan and interest payments to get back right they get a 660 million dollar unsecured loan from voyager which is a crypto exchange not a lending facility but somehow they convince voyager to give them a 660 million dollar loan unsecured loan they get a billion dollar loan from blockfi over over collateralized uh i believe the numbers were some combination of bitcoin and also gptc shares uh we'll talk about that later on uh so they they get a billion dollar loan from blockfi uh with a hundred with a 30 over collateralization so like a 1.3 billion dollars inside of block five they get a one billion dollar loan and they go and speculate on the market with that they get caught up in the staked eath trade like trading the merge thinking that the merge is going to happen like everyone's going to buy into staked east but then instead of the merge happening markets go down bad because of fed fed risks and like their staked eath instead of being worth one eath turns into being worth 0.96 eth and they can't redeem that because that's how state eath works in the first place uh and so also like there's a legal stuff happening too uh and so the singapore central bank uh just uh gave three arrows accentures accentures i don't know what that means actually three hours capital for alleged misleading and false disclosures and there's evidence for this that's going around on crypto twitter and in throughout the markets there's evidence that they falsified records to lenders in order to access more capital so the fraud basically they committed fraud so that they their balance sheet could look healthier so they could get more and more loans out from other people there's also public reports that three hours capital allowed other trading firms to use their account on crypto exchanges to trade through their accounts right three hours capital they had billions of dollars they could they could negotiate with crypto exchanges to like hey charge us less fees on your on your exchange because we're going to put a bunch of volume there and we don't want to pay those fees and the crypto changes are like yes totally you guys put all this volume through our exchange we'll totally charge you less fees and then through capital let other people put money into their account to trade on their account on crypto exchanges so that these third parties could access less fees as well you know what that is ryan that is an unlicensed prime brokerage with brink secrecy act and wire fraud these are criminal cases uh and then there's also representation that they there's also evidence that they represented to otc desks they had relationships with other entities and other otc desks that they didn't in order to like presume some legitimacy to other oc otc desks so they start off with this like very normal like i'll just borrow bitcoin to get this gbtc tray premium they never sell they never they never manage their risks they instead of instead of closing their risks they just open up more loans on those risks then they somehow like give this crypto twitter uh like a brand about themselves that they're huge chads who make a ton of money uh and so people loan them even more money they took money in from defy treasuries who like d5 treasuries like they raise 50 million dollars they're sitting on it they don't need to go get yield during the bear market so somehow throughout capital convince them just give us your treasury and we'll we will give you like this percentage meanwhile they probably like stick it into something like tara and get 20 percent and then that thing goes to zero so like a bunch of d5 treasuries are down bad uh down to zero because they trusted through his capital to give them the yield and so like not only did they like they are the one of the sources of contagion because they borrowed from voyager they borrowed from blockfly there's if they didn't borrow from celsius they are one degree away from borrowing from celsius well what's crazy about this is like this is the point retail uh it starts lending to three hours capital without knowing it so if you're putting funds into block fi right and you're generating some sort of yield you were effectively lending to three hours capital now this is an over collateralized loan right of course so people think that's super safe but we'll talk about why that wasn't so safe with gdbc a little bit later but i think the important point here is it wasn't just institution to institution this became a retail phenomenon when you're depositing uh funds into these crypto banks like a block fire celsius you are actually giving some funds to su zoo and the throws capital team and that truth is rampant throughout the industry right like a voyager a crypto exchange not a lending desk customers would come and deposit their money into voyager exchange to do normal exchange stuff and voyager lent that money out to three hours capital so three hours capital is at the center of the contagion they are the contagion ryan they have they had their tentacles in every single entity that would ever lend the money either over collateralized or under collateralized and so like it almost doesn't matter where retail entered the industry money flowed into three hours capital because they took every single lending opportunity that they could and max that account out that is crazy does this blow you away like it feels like they just made all of the new mistakes in like one market cycle they just did them all it's like check the box i'll think that the gdpc trade goes on forever i'll get into tara and see if that i'll do this eat staking trade expecting it like some sort of timing on the other side of this uh i'll do the uh alt layer one trade with avalanche and all of these other things like they're just checking the boxes of all of the mistakes a noob would make to lose their money during the bull market right and like it they made such a staggering amount of money during the upside of the market part of that was on the backs of they borrowed it and then like you know it works in bull markets and then they lost it all in the bear market right and so like i can't remember where i heard this quote from but like the venture firms or like you know hedge funds that do extremely well in one cycle aren't going to be around it for the second cycle because if they were levered up they were if they were levered up on the way up they're also levered on the way down and they don't make it the second time around so like having too strong a performance on the upswing means you're getting liquidated on the downswing and that's definitely what happened you want to see the uh cherry on top of this whole entire uh this whole entire saga ryan yeah give me the series has a 50 million dollar mega yacht that is being seized uh and i can't remember what i i can't remember what the name of this yacht is but it's some like internet meme this is a triple decker yacht that suzu put a a down payment on somewhere in like i think it's the british virgin islands or somewhere who has also made a court order to liquidate three euros capital because that's where three hours capital i believe is domiciled uh anyways uh yeah so like this is something that suzu still has is this like 50 million yeah that he has his down payment on which is absolutely crazy absolutely uh crazy absolutely brutal um and uh it sounds like the like authorities are stepping in nation states british virgin islands are ordering the liquidation so like the collectors are coming probably for that yacht as well i would imagine all the assets are going to get liquidated um it's pretty right this is this is not a matter of like three hours capital going under and like we're not we're not seeing three hours capital again like this isn't happening yet this is still in speculation phase but this is a criminal enterprise this is a criminal enterprise well kyle davies and suzu are in my mind i am not a lawyer i do not have insight to these things do not
