the merge is gonna happen soon and how do we know it it's because developers are talking about it the people actually shipping the code you know everyone's usually asking these people like okay when's it gonna be done when's it gonna be done so when they say it's coming when they say there are prs that are one major pr away from being ready for the merge that's a good thing and i think that's what peter is saying peter is an og open source uh just open source maximalist i think is the right way to call him just believes in open source and has been working on the geth client for since the beginning of ethereum avalanche is built on geth by the way peter tweets although not really visible from the outside the go ethereum code base that's geth is one major uh pr away pull requests away from being done ready for the merge and that pr itself is also done it just needs test tm basically sayings like yo guys like we're kind of ready to like start to break this thing and if we can't break this thing that means we're ready ready
