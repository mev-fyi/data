David you're not gonna fire me are you I'm Not Gonna Leave You yeah I think it does take two people to do this podcast at least you and I are not prepared for that right um well can I see you in my office I'll be better David um Bagless Nation happy fourth Friday and the final Friday of February 2023. David what time is it Ryan it's the bank List Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere into the frontier nonetheless like we always do with coffee got coffee I don't know if that's the coffee speaking right now David or that excitement in your voice is just like all of the incredible awesome news that we're gonna tell have happened this week yeah like what the hell this is a it's a good day to be going bankless my friends you know what we shouldn't tease them any longer we should just get into some of the headlines that we're going to discuss in this epic weekly roll up the fourth Friday of February David what's on the agenda coinbase drops the base a new blue Layer Two on the scene yeah that's right coinbase has its own dedicated Layer Two a two blue Layer Two and a blue Layer Two yeah you like that one uh and so we're going to talk about all those details what does that mean what does it mean for a coin for coinbase that have its own layer too uh how did they how are they building that what is what are all the implications behind that so we're gonna unpack that and more because bankless got this scoop uh so coming up after that and the sad sad news uh SEC sues terraform labs and do Quan which I mean that's not a surprise but the implications of what that lawsuit might imply are bad so we've got to talk about the details the precedent that that might set if that goes forward and then third Spotify the app that some of you are using right now to listen to this podcast is gonna have tokens in it soon yeah which is pretty cool seems like it seems like maybe podcast nfts podcast nfts music nfts are a thing token gating we're gonna get into all of that and more David before we do we gotta talk to folks about something we don't often talk about on bankless and that is what does it mean to become a citizen of the bankless nation I'm gonna close that URL do you know why because that was uh this is our new beta site by the way this is going live in about weeks times week two weeks and you have the opportunity to become a bankless citizen it includes our token reports where we dive in our analysts uh talk about token ratings for all sorts of popular tokens which is getting these tokens are getting an update by the way as a result of today's news so these token reports always stay updated as The Meta shifts yes and it's because um David and I are um look we're not plugged into the day today we hired a talented team of analysts to actually put these together and they're a small smarter than us okay these are in the frontier yeah Dave and I are losing our reflexes all right we were top of our game three years ago we are no longer but we have the best people who are doing this we also have a bankless Nation member only Discord we talk about a lot uh a premium podcast feed with a ton of goodies and David just this week we released the debrief on the premium podcast feed we also released a um a special q a yeah Twitter sessions that we had with Eliezer Eleazar udkowski of course and that was the Q a that we had promised after that um crazy episode that we recorded so all sorts of goodies come on the special premium podcast feed you can only unlock that when you become a bankless citizen all the extra content that we have that we don't have space for in the normal RSS feed all the extra content gets on the premium RSS feed but those are only some of the details you get to go to our in real life Denver Meetup you get to go to all the future meetups that we'll have at ECC and permissionless uh you'll get to unlock Future access for things that we can't yet talk about and there's a bunch of reasons to become a citizen of the bankless nation you can also join my q a channel and ask me questions if you want to ask me a question well I've never done that in my q a channel sure just I can't realize I have to reserve it for the Q a that's what the Channel's for it yeah okay fair enough David uh anyway all this 17 a month it's like a Netflix subscription that much Netflix costs and uh anyway we think you should become a member of the bankless nation we'd love to have you on the journey with us David let's get in the markets this week what is bitcoin price doing for us and we're viewing this of course on our favorite place to exchange tokens Kraken Kraken our number one recommended crypto exchange these are the charts for Bitcoin and the dollar what are we looking at on the week uh looking at on the week start of the week at twenty five thousand dollars ending the week at twenty four thousand dollars which means Bitcoin is down four percent uh you are zoomed super far out you are looking at like a gears time frame but that's why if you zoom in that's what we are now we are down four percent on the week lost a thousand dollars off of the Bitcoin market cap all right how about ether what's that doing on the week ether down 3.3 start of the week at 17.25 currently ending the week at 16.50 yeah so wait you said is up or down down down three are we down because like seven days ago was like the top tick of last week so like sometimes we just fall victim to unfortunate timings of what was exactly 24 or 77 days ago so it was basically a flat ish which is pretty but it just looks kind of down we we dumped it down like ether hit sixteen hundred dollars Bitcoin also kind of hit a recent low but then we bounced right back off of that and so the the Bulls and the bears are in a very strong game of tug of war right now look I'm not even using the browser tabs for this I'm using the cracking tabs for this Bitcoin ratio what's that looking out like 0.069 uh which is relatively unchanged on the week up about half a percent all right but still not up uh in the re like to the recent highs below 0.07 is like kind of a low for ether uh in the ratio in local terms Bitcoin having a bit of a recovery we might say some people are really celebrating that um we'll see if that lasts uh total crypto market cap what do we above a trillion above a trillion so down on the week but 1.15 trillion dollars all right David let's uh cover what's going on in the FED real quick because I just really want to get to some of the crypto news this week um the first is this the fmoc had their meeting here here's what you need to know all officials almost all the officials favored moving 0.25 percentage points or bips Point 25 bips uh in the next meeting I'm just saying bips bips bips because David hates that um yeah but you also fumbled it which kind of goes to my points are dumb uh the next meeting anyway we'll probably see a 25-bit basis point increase uh in March and then some of them want a 50 a point five percent all right never mind I'm not doing the bips thing some of them want a 0.5 increase and they're probably not going to get it but the FED says basically forget about the pivot we still got work to do on the inflation we're not pivoting now and the market doesn't expect the federal funds rate the inflation uh the sorry the interest rate to increase Beyond about 5.3 so we're kind of close to Peak at least according to Market so that's what's going on there the the interest rates aren't hiking as fast as they used to be we might get close to a top what is going on in the world of ultrasound money though David uh it's at all time lows in Supply since the merge so that's just great I think how much ether have we burnt since the merge so 35 000 ether wow in 160 days so almost 35 000 35 000 either in half of a year that's that's just great that's just right the down only on the supply yeah this is all-time lows big time every single week we've hit all-time lows every single week for like um over a month now I think we are negative six bips David can you see that inflation I hate that you just said that 6.6 Pips to be precise yeah so yearly deflation is .066 percent negative that's pretty cool why why do we always talk about this the zip context for this here's a tweet we pulled up what does this say yeah so this is from data always uh who has been pushing back on the focus from eth influencer so data always retweets their own tweet the first tweet says the ultrasound money cult really confuses me if we match the highest ever yearly average burn we see a supply decrease of two to three percent with constant uh fully diluted value it's an insignificant price pump deflation is a meme that both cases flows and then they continue and say most of their responses to this just go to show how few in from people understand flows and how much information asymmetry still exists the issuance reduction matters a lot the Nuance is that the rate of burn deflation means almost nothing for flows okay what do they mean when they when they say this tweet what they're basically saying is that the real uh price Catalyst was the merge not the burn as in the elimination of proof of work issuance is the thing that changed the flows as in killing all of that if issuance uh kill the outbound Flow Away from ether the asset as in the cell pressure was eliminated they are saying that the burn the thing that you and I talk about at the start of every single weekly roll up Ryan is much more insignificant because in comparison to the actual total market cap of ether how much we are burning is insignificant and it doesn't impact the flows of the cell or by pressure of ether so they are saying that the deflation is a meme the people that focus on the burn are are focusing on amim and not the fundamentals the real fundamentals is the flows which is a combination of eliminating the proof of work issuance which I said but then also just net new buying pressure so just because like we're burning ether doesn't mean anyone's buying it so that is the pushback from data always here I just heard ultrasound money called and I stopped listening David are we in a cult what's going on here hey you know I think we're pretty reasonable about it I think this uh point is a good point of course um and yet it's also what I think uh many in the so-called ultrasound money called I don't know what call and when people refer to cult I don't know who they're talking about but at least on Bank list I think this is pretty consistent with what we've said from the very beginning the reason we uh talk about this and are celebrating this is not from a flow's perspective and never go up it's because guys look ethereum has a monetary policy now and it's pretty badass right I think I think takes like this don't remember the time from uh 2018 to 2019 when eth as money was in complete dispute and the 21 million hard cap was the only way you could design a hard money cryptocurrency market cap that's the only way that we know it's the only mechanism yeah what we're celebrating is this mechanic and what we're trying to spread is the knowledge of how this works that is the purpose of the ultrasound money meme so I don't dispute the facts in this case but um I'm gonna you know continue to talk about this and celebrate it more people understand click into that tweet and then scroll down because I think I gave a response to this tweet yeah and so here's what I said it's less about the raw numbers of deflation and more about the fact that ethereum is a self-governing economic system that's able to capture its own energy so like the East Supply chart the thing that we look at is a cool way to illustrate the activity of ethereum if there is a strong vibrant economy that means ether is deflating and so deflation is a symptom of high activity on the ethereum app layer so that's that's why I celebrate deflation it's because like oh there's activity happening the crypto's not dead yet like if we are deflating crypto's not dead yet yeah well data always replied and said all I want is for people to stop worshiping the chart so stop worshiping the ultrasound money chart Maybe what do we got today this is a big week for arbitrim they just passed an important Milestone what did they accomplish oh just transaction volumes through the absolute roof uh so the new all-time high in transaction volume of for arbitrary I think 2x is previous all-time high uh so just really healthy activity speaking of healthy activity on an app layer Arboretum past ethereum Arboretum in Layer Two by itself past the ethereum L1 transaction first time this has happened ever ever and it won't be the last definitely not I mean these uh LTS are gonna go Sky High relatively or two is going to come onto the scene and absolutely blow past all other layer twos and transaction capacity and my prediction for this will be uh talked about in a short what do we got here David here's another take on Arboretum uh getting some details of this data yeah same same conversation uh take a look at this efficiency says Hunter who I know is an arbitrum fan because he's got the small brand pfp February 24th on 2022 which was pre-nitro upgrade arbitrim's Nitro upgrade Arboretum did a 106 000 transactions which cost a 165 000 in fees uh a year later February 20th 2023 post Nitro arbitrum did basically a million transactions it with 155 000 in fees so basically a 10x in total transaction volume 9x and then basically a zero change in the actual fees it took to get that done so yeah 8.7 X increase in capacity uh with seven ten thousand dollars saved in fees and that's what it costs like they are able to compress more things in an ethereum uh transaction in a like piece of ethereum block right so they're compression technology has gotten better uh over the last 12 months that's what that means that's exactly right and then last thing in the markets I will talk about coinbase is Q4 2022 earnings are out and uh an interesting note here is the how much each asset Bitcoin ether or other coins represented of the total trading volume on coinbase and so if you zoom into that little graphic Ryan so last year in Q4 of 2021 it was 16 Bitcoin 16 ethereum 68 all other crypto assets of trading volume this year it's 35 Bitcoin 33 ethereum 33 other crypto assets uh so I think this just shows that like speculation on the long tail of crypto assets has kind of gone out the door and people have flown towards Blue Chips totally and uh ethereum and Bitcoin neck and neck yeah for that title of trading volume King at least on coinbase that's pretty big David but we got some bigger stuff coming up give us a tease coin based coinbase drops the base we're gonna talk about the brand new coinbase Layer Two uh which there's so much to talk about there uh and so we're gonna unpack all of those details uh not only did we have the opportunity to interview Jesse Pollock from coinbase about this Vision uh the bankless Zoomer analysts were able to put in some Alpha report so we'll talk about all that and more four huge revelations in the sec's charges against dokwon and Terra Labs why so late why didn't they do this earlier um maybe they were waiting for a more uh warm climate for them to push past more precedent that's stricter perhaps we'll talk about all that uh and then royalties caught in the crossfire of the nft marketplace Wars uh we got an update on withdrawals we gotta talk about Spotify so much to talk about but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible especially Kraken our strategic sponsor for 28 23 check them out Kraken has been a leader in the

list we have huge things planned for 2023 including a new website with login with your ethereum address capabilities and we're super excited to ship what we are calling Bank list 2.0 soon TM so if you want extra help exploring the frontier subscribe to bankless premium it's under 50 cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord guys it actually happened coinbase is going to be the first exchange the first U.S publicly traded company to launch a layer two David that layer two is called base it's based on optimism technology it settles on ethereum it is fully evm compliant David what are the details here so the base test net is live today that is what is being announced today the base test mat test net Layer Two uh mainnet soon TM there's no date launched for the mainnet um we'll get this out of the way base the token does not exist there is no base token there is no base currency there's no airdrop there is only a test net for a roll-up called base from coinbase that is built on the op stack from optimism but there are significant second order effects of this and like first off just like think about this from first principles coinbase is building a optimistic roll up to enter the arena alongside optimism arbitrum polygon and now base and so like you can add bass to that list it is going to be the uh intro Like official chain of coinbase so this is kind of like the binance smart chain but for coinbase it is fully permissionless for developers to build on so unit swap you I will expect to see governance votes from like things like uniswap Ave saying hey we should deploy our application on base I expect all of those votes to be a resounding yes uh you're going to see other like optimism native infrastructure to also want to go over to base there's going to be a huge land grab for defy apps to be on base so I think that is what we're about to see so how did this project even get started uh and so both coinbase and optimism were both working on eip4844 Proto dank sharding also Proto Lambda which proto-dink charting is named after uh is on the optimism team and then there's a few other developers on the coinbase side of things they were all working towards 4844 so they were all in the same room together and that's when the conversation started about like hey coinbase we there's this thing called the op stack if you guys just wanted to I don't know perhaps Fork the op stack and make your own op chain uh you could easily do that and that uh peaked the interest of coinbase and when we interviewed Jesse uh Bank list we have an interview with Jesse for more details he said that coinbase had been interested in starting their own chain twice before they looked at doing this endeavor twice before they already had the base name for years now apparently but it was the op stack technology and their partnership with optimism their collaboration with optimism that really unlocked the door and so really that's the news there's so many more things to talk about some percentage some unknown percentage of all base transaction fees are going to the op Collective we don't know that this percentage but some percentage of transaction fees are being routed towards adding uh to the op Collective treasury report public goods to support well that's actually up to optimism governance that is what optimism governance tends to do is to support public goods but that will be for op governance uh how will you pay for gas on base you will pay for that for gas with ether uh coinbase is going to be the only sequencer the one-of-one sequencer of the base chain but Jesse in our interview did say that the long-term vision of Base was to be a fully permissionless network not just from a builder perspective but also from a validator perspective so they have the same aspirations as optimism and arbitrum to eventually become a fully permissionless chain with a fully permissionless validator set now Ryan we explicitly asked Jesse is there going to be a base token and he said no and then I specifically asked Jesse well is base going to be a permissionless validator set in the future and he said yes and those rights are conflicting statements so one of these things has to give I is that true could you not could you not do a permissionless validator set without a token well don't don't isn't the only thing that you need is some sort of kind of collateral to stake so couldn't you could could you use eth as part of your sequencer set right because that's true a native token I guess that's true or something like eigenlayer maybe right where like I I wonder I think the design space is broader than just um l2s that are spinning up tokens but anyway we'll see you did all of the details so I I bet that answered like a hundred questions for the bankless nation I I want to zoom out and and talk about this from a high level perspective because I think that this is a a really big deal for crypto I think this is like top five things that have ever happened since I joined crypto David um it's definitely behind the merge it's behind a few other things but like this is top five and I think people are probably asking why like why are Ryan and David talking about this so much uh why do they think it's such a big deal so another you know an exchange launches a chain like who cares it's not it's about how they launched the chain all right that's the big difference when we had Brian Armstrong on the podcast in October of 2021 we asked him the question when coinbase chain when's that going to happen he said when the technology is ready we'll do it when we feel like we can launch in a way where we can maximize a maximize decentralization and when the technology is available to do that then we'll launch a chain they're launching a chain now the technology is here David and the way that they're doing this is different than the way say binance launched their chain right binance controls uh the validator set binance if it has you know two-thirds majority it could do all sorts of Nefarious activity on chain coinbase launched with a layer two they are a sequencer on the layer two but they cannot steal funds on chain they have limited powers why because this entire chain settles to ethereum so this this is a maximally decentralized way to actually launch this chain and it's the maximally bankless way to launch this chain as well so it's aligned with those values the other thing I'll say is coinbase has like 110 million verified users okay a tiny tiny fraction of this maybe like one percent maybe one to two percent are actually um going full bankless and going on chain after they create like a coinbase account why is this because the tools are really hard today David it's like we talk about this every like the user experience isn't there it's it's it's um difficult to get into crypto coinbase is going to onboard a vast majority of their verified users and let's say they they onboard you know maybe 20 right it's 20 million 20 million new people we we will have like 10xed the amount of people uh on chain using crypto and of course this was not possible a couple of years ago uh transaction fees were so were too high but now that you have a layer two now that you have EIP um uh four four eight four four transaction fees can be fractions of a penny so the Technologies here and it's ready and I think that they are going to set a a cookie cutter for other publicly traded companies to start going down this path to other other crypto exchanges other crypto Banks we start to get rid of the the overhang of why do you have to use a um centralized lending provider like a Celsius or a block fi when you can have an easy onboard experience into a layer two with completely open source auditable code on the back end anyway so many reasons this is so exciting but but that is the big picture of of why this is a big deal it's the way that they are launching this chain I mean using eth as the money rather than doing like a pump and dump token uh it's it's just a really fantastic way to uh to approach this and exactly what we've predicted uh that um exchanges would do over the long run yeah so we put we have so much more information uh we have a YouTube video an interview with Jesse Pollock I put in a Twitter thread we have a newsletter release on the on the bank's newsletter which goes through some of the the implications of this uh just some of the stats that are in the Tweet thread 110 million users on coinbase with 80 billion dollars in assets so some reaction to this like oh a brand new optimistic roll up alongside arbitrum optimism and polygon and base is it in in test net like how is it going to fill up its chain how is it going to compete with all these fully developed player twos um arbitrum only has half a million unique addresses on it coinbase has 110 unique verified users 110 million 110 million yes and so like one percent of coinbase's users if they can get them onto the base chain is already more than double the most used layer 2 on ethereum today and so don't like coin like we have all the apps on layer twos coinbase has all the users and all the the money and so this is going to we asked Jesse the question like how will coinbase present base to their users this is going to be the like coinbase approved Layer Two And so so many people come into this industry through coinbase and coinbase is going to be like oh uh would you like to withdraw your assets from this centralized crypto bank that we are feel free to deposit it onto base a layer 2 on ethereum and so like this is aligned with the crypto idea and so the tweet that I wrote in the Tweet thread I say base makes coinbase bankless because coinbase can encourage its users to withdraw from coinbase and deposit onto base while still being inside of the coinbase ecosystem so it's adding in a layer two into the product offering from coinbase reserves yeah it's automatically proof of reserves on the whole entire chain so with base it's still a coinbase product but users are self-sovereign and self-custody so it is the coin is the bankless version of coinbase which is just so awesome um there's gonna be there's gonna be haters David that say uh but it this is all AML kyc that you know this is it's not uh it's a permissionless network it's not now but like every every account that withdraws of course is AML kyc by coinbase because they have to be um I care a lot less about that right now than I do about this massive amount of users that are being ex like that are being onboarded into self-sovereign Technologies all right like if this is still um yeah I I in fact I don't even know how you get around that problem at this stage and and still use a centralized Exchange in some nation state right um but I still think this is like this is going to onboard Millions tens of millions of people into the bankless money system that we all love and I do think it's it's just there's also some symbolism here in that like there's so much crazy crap that went down in 2022 with centralized entities stealing the funds right this is the answer to 2022. okay we'll use decentralized technology where you can audit the code completely where we can't steal your funds has proof of reserves right out of the box uh and D5 will facilitate this um I I do kind of Wonder do you think this will eat up uh The coinbase Exchange business model a little bit uh not zero but I think the net value ad I think is significant and coinbase is always looking for new products that are providing Revenue Beyond exchange activity because they need to diversify their income because like 90 plus percent of their uh like quarterly revenue is always exchange activity so that's why staking ethereum staking is so valuable to them because it's an it's a diversified Revenue source that puts less risk on Exchange activity and this opens up so much surface area for on-chain products this is one of the things that Jesse was really hammering in our interview base is where their coinbase is going to put all of its on-chain products and so they have their own little domicile Network to play favorites they get to play favorites because it's their own network and they're going to put all their products there and so this is just opening up a massive new world of opportunity for for coinbase uh I wanted to take this conversation into why optimism uh and so like I said Jesse and the optimism team uh started collaborating on eip4844 and that's I'm assuming where uh op stack conversations uh happened um so the op stack is the scaffolding for optimism chains so optimism's Bedrock upgrade is built with the op stack base is built with the op stack the op stack is this like open standard the scaffolding for you know build your own Layer Two build a layer two workshop and so when all and when more and more Layer Two Chains are built using the op stack standard because they're all standardized there is more synergies between interoperability composability just fluidity between these different chains so as more and more op stack chains come into existence the boundaries between all of these chains can start to blur so coinbase is making a bet on this super chain Vision they caught the optimism team calls this the super chain Vision so coinbase seems to be in on this Vision that the more and more change that build on the op stack the boundaries between these things blur and this is part of the ethos as to like why layer twos in the first place like why build a layer 2 Chain instead of your own customized blockchain like BNB chain or your own app chain it's because it apparently is Jesse's and coinbase's philosophy feed that building a layer 2 is building a bridge not an island that's a line from Jessie in our interview the coinbase wants to build Bridges not islands and so the layer two building a layer 2 Network on ethereum allows bass to be connected to all the other layer twos on ethereum and all the assets on the layer one and all of the users and so they are bridged right into ethereum's ecosystem but in addition to that the op stack also provides that same interoperability with the optimism super chain that is slowly being built and so not only is it building bridges into ethereum and all of its layer twos but it's building more direct bridges into optimism and all of its other future chains that are totally going to come because the op stack code base is the most forked layer 2 coin code base that exists yeah I guess like optimism basically wants all the forks so they develop some sort of network advantage for super chains I am hopeful that super chains can talk to other super chains in the future I know we've sort of like hinted around this slowly they will I want the ZK sync to be able to talk to the optimism to be able to talk to the arbitrum and all of that you know one other um a side product of this too we mentioned that coinbase is not launching a token and the cool thing about a layer two is because you don't have to that's what's cool about it right if you're launching your own layer one side chain you have to have a token because you have to inflate that token to pay for security budget a layer two already comes with its own security intact it's a less expensive it's a cheaper way for a coinbase to do this and part of our conversation with Jesse was like hey the reason we couldn't do this two years ago is because it was infeasible like the tools weren't there but then when we tried to get support for this project internally at uh at coinbase like um in you know 2022 with OP stack the code is ready it's like here's a chain out of a box just Fork it and by the way it comes with its own Economic Security you don't even have to launch a token the tools are getting easier this is like the WordPress this is why we're going to see an explosion of chains too anyway we could say more and we probably will throughout this episode but but that is the news for you I just one thing though I'm already seeing uh some apps start to uh there's a land grab okay apps are trying to grab as much real estate on base chain as possible this is Euler Finance right is it Euler yeah so Euler saying Euler can become the main trading venue for CBE I think it kind of already is uh first off what is Euler it's like compound or Ave but with a few other extra uh governance free mechanisms uh and so they're already planning their migration onto base uh and so the migration from another chain but more a conditional support right a deployment yeah so this is Jesse Jesse's uh tweets out uh today I become I join a hundred plus contributors from coinbase to launch build on base base is the Builder's chain for coinbase the Builders of the world uh and and he is also coinbase as a result of of this uh announcement also becomes the second uh protocol Dev development team of the op stack so now it's op labs and coinbase which are collectively building the op stack so that's pretty cool just congratulations Jesse also just shout out to Jesse who not only pioneered this effort but also pioneered the kzg ceremony being prompted to all coinbase users just like the alignment that Jesse is creating between coinbase and the ethereum decentralized ecosystem is so strong so there's like Well Done Jesse well done uh really cool um and so if you have if you want to learn more we interviewed Jesse that interview is available already on the YouTube I'm sure some of you have already watched it we are also live streaming with the optimism team at 10 A.M eastern time this morning Friday morning the 24th uh and so we're going to get the optimism perspective on this as well no shortage of content guys from Bank list I should mention an interest of disclosures both David and I are um advisors for optimism support that project think it's wonderful also early investors in Euler Finance as well uh full disclosure you can always find that at bankless.com disclosures um I don't own any coin though like the actual stock yeah I don't own Boomer assets uh all right well that's it man let's talk about the SEC shall we all right here we go we tried to hold off the SEC as long as possible okay here it is some breaking news SEC sues terraform labs and Quan terraform Labs of course the protocol team behind Terra why so long like it's like Tara collapsed almost a year ago why so long Ryan is it behaps the political environment is more conducive for the SEC to get away with more things now that uh ft access collapsed is that possibly why I don't know I don't know that's pretty cynical David that's pretty cynical uh SEC files a lawsuit against terraform labs in dokwon for allegedly orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset Securities fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating loss for investors good so far though right that's what they should be doing he's a scammer the scammer yep yep okay good job SEC right yes Gary genzler says that terraform Labs failed to provide the public with full fair and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset Securities uh genzer commended the SEC staff on their investigation adding the defendant attempted to prevent us from obtaining important information about their business uh this case demonstrates to the links to which some crypto firms will avoid complying with Securities laws Okay so so trying to paint all of crypto as just as bad as dokwan I'll throw a flag on that but this is the what we get into when we're a bunch of djans who ape into algorithmic stable coins also worth noting that dokwon was actually served by the SEC at Missouri mainnet in New York in 2021. so this story has actually been going on for a while okay what does all this mean so here's a coindesk article that says four huge revelations in the sec's charges against terraform laps SEC findings describes the entire Terra system as a fraud similar to Sam bankman's Freed's FTX so I'm going to read out all four points and we'll go into each of them here number one Tera USC's stability was a complete and conscious fabrication conscious intentional that means intentional yes two dokwon and his allies were cashing out big time the whole entire time Shady three the chai deal was even Faker than we thought I don't know what the chai deal is chai payments platform an e-commerce system in South Korea that's right it was it was sort of the um the pump around this see retail's really using this we have adoption we have real world adoption in South Korea That's What Chai was okay and then fourth it turns out U.S regulation does matter uh is again the the headline from this article uh Quan and his team are accused of committing crimes in the United States that affected several U.S Victor yes I'm sure are you ready to take these one by one yeah sure so what's number one uh the stability was a complete uh farce apparently it was never stable yeah so terraform and Quan secretly arranged for a third party to purchase massive amounts of UST to restore the one dollar Peg when Terra USD experienced a small debegging from one dollar from its one dollar Target price when was this was this when Tara started to wobble in 2022 no this was a year ahead of that in May of 2021. so uh this The Narrative of UST being Rock Solid was a complete fabrication because the Terra USD price was wobbling in as early as May in 2021. so the SEC Compares this fake to the fake laboratory tests that led to Elizabeth Holmes decade I can't disagree with that David I mean they they were advertising a product that was stable and they knew that it absolutely wasn't they were just propping it up by the way who is that third party that purchased the massive amounts of UST to restore the peg when Tara was in trouble who was that who did that Ryan that's a four-letter word I think starts with a J is that am I right about that job good job and his allies are cashing out big time uh a variety of tentative attempts to trace funds flowing out of terraform Labs after the collapse found that do Quan cashed out hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin while he's in Serbia and that was after Terror collapsed um the SEC claims that Quan and his accomplished transferred over ten thousand Bitcoins from terraform and the Luna guard foundation and converted over a hundred million dollars of that Bitcoin into Fiat withdrawals through a Swiss bank in June of 2022. you remember the Luna guard Foundation this was the non-on-chain like a group of actors like just trust us with the money we're going to purchase this Bitcoin with uh Luna and then we're gonna use that to prop up the price of us remember when we suggested that why does yours why does your algorithmic stablecoin which is apparently perfectly stable need an external agency to help maintain the peg off chain with a few sets of key signers that we have to trust and apparently they were taking that weird huh huh who could have seen that what else we got uh anyways um okay so try deal even bigger than we thought uh SEC describes that not only did dokwon exaggerate the tri-terror relationship in his own statements he created an entire fake server to move fake money around to stimulate fake transactions with the clear Call of Duty deceiving investors wow look I I I'm grateful for the SEC for doing this part of it dude it's great man no it's like this is the public didn't know this we need to know this um good job I mean we want the SEC to help us prosecute the scammers uh last but not least evidence suggests that Kwan used his Twitter account to promote Tara USD to Americans and insult critics who warned of flags that led to the currency's collapse and so wow I I that I was personally I was there did you were you inside I mentioned in that sentence are you named in this whole uh you know Court Document here uh they insulted Davidoff critics who warned of flaws yeah that was us all right damn okay uh moving on who got rich question mark we found out who got rich apparently according to these documents jump Capital jump Capital say the name jump Capital it's actually jump crypto which I think is a subsidiary of jump they made 1.2 billion from Tara 1.2 billion retail got destroyed David they were also the ones responsible for helping maintain the peg after it was known that the peg was unstable I'm just so tired of the Sharks and the mercenaries in this space like they should be called out guys this is not okay this is do you remember like this was kind of like Peak Finance bro culture and crypto that I absolutely hated which was just like yeah let's just make tons of money it was just like Wall Street infecting us look we have nothing against making money right like we're all crypto investors we we just think you can do that by betting on things early right and waiting until something is built that's useful and then receiving the upside after the useful thing is built kind of the Traders The Mercenaries coming in here don't care about that they made money they're not even they're they're named in this report no charges against them they didn't do anything illegal David right technically 1.2 billion dollars I ask you does that feel Fair retail gets completely destroyed by this and uh they may they made out fine jump Capital incentive to do it again David give it back anyway that's uh so there are a bunch uh this is a tweet from Cyrus who's like one of the most Savage people on Twitter and he's always right in my opinion drum trading propped up Tara after it almost broke early on instead of letting it die in the early stages they covered it up letting the bubble grow significantly larger than it needed to get exacerbating the pain for the entire crypto Community uh and this he's retweeting fat man Tara who's a Twitter account that focuses on the Terra news uh and Fatman Tara says the SEC filing also indirectly confirms the fact that jump secretly bailed out the USC Project without disclosing to retail leading to the shim the scheme ballooning even further and destroying many people's lives in the first place okay so this is only half the story because the other half of this story is the implications of this lawsuit against Tara because there are precedents being set and so this SEC case against doquan and terraform Labs says that UST the stablecoin UST is a security because it is redeemable for Luna which is a security so I think implying that like the Sable coin itself wouldn't have been a security but it had this enshrined formal relationship with Tara or with Luna the equity asset of the terraform ecosystem or the the chain and so because USC was natively convertible to Luna the SEC and the SEC determined Luna to be a security then UST therefore becomes a security because of this enshrined form of relationship and not just USC all potentially algo stable coins in the future not just that Ryan all wrapped assets and so what Mike selig says is that this precedent ifset means that any rapper can make an asset into a security we're talking about like rap teeth rap well not necess not rafties because of steak teeth yeah so uh Ave sea Ethan compound s e derivative tokens anything with a wrapper that has some sort of like you know money Lego component to it could potentially become this is the thing that is so pernicious and so Insidious is you know uh thank you SEC for for helping investigate and take down a scammer is using this as a land grab opportunity to get more control over a crypto and he's setting a precedent it's it's Evil Genius I tweeted this gensler's next strategy is to go after dokon UST because he knows no one will defend them how can we defend them how can we defend it we didn't we didn't defend them at the time and if he wins he'll establish broad precedent for more control over crypto it's Evil Genius uh I don't think though I I don't see a friend here uh yeah do Quan a bunch of others screwed this up by the way you know what we should do is go back and listen to that lunatara debate that we had in was this April of 2022 before the thing blew up like two weeks or three weeks before we said this would happen we said in the exit like there was a bull bear case uh we were quite clearly on the bear case and we said hey we're just worried if this whole thing's blows up the regulatory backlash on us will be severe and significant and Del Quan and the lunatics and the Terribles won't have to pay that cost but we will because we believe in this technology still be here yeah and that's exactly what's happening and it's so frustrating to see I got it's just so frustrating to see dokwan's got 100 million dollars and he's hiding in Serbia somewhere and now we have to clean up his mess he's sick all right well awesome look a little bit of good a little bit bad um I'm choosing to remain super optimistic this week because uh we've got a lot more to talk about David what's coming up next uh update on the ethereum withdrawals got some good news on there Spotify is gonna get some tokens inside of it our NBA Top Shot nfts Securities uh so much more to talk about we got some flashbots update as well uh so uh we're gonna get to all this news and more but first I wanted to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling Arboretum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to option Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free David is Spotify rolling out token support I don't know but that's what this screenshot looks like what are we looking at here what it looks like yeah so here is a screenshot says welcome to spotify's token enabled pilot we're happy you're here so what we are looking at is a sign in with a wallet metamask rainbow wallet Ledger xerion inside of a Spotify mobile experience wow and then once you connect your wallet you get to connect your uh you and then apparently it changes the behavior of spotify and unlocks certain experiences so this is this is um available for Android users in the US UK Denmark Australia and New Zealand I think good job cool thank you and so token gated access to music content so cool Spotify that's awesome it's so that's awesome podcast nfts music nfts token gated content this is a huge Boom for creators I I wonder a few things like first of all implications of this is like uh does Gary Gensler want to control music nfts to you and all of the tokens on Spotify that unlock it like does he really want he probably does he probably does yeah come on so stupid the other thing I would say is uh the experiences for Android users only not apple and I I almost have one pilot it's a pilot it's a pilot but I almost wonder if apple is go it's it's maybe it's not going to be available for Apple you know Apple wants to tax they want to do their 30 tax on all nft transactions but yeah I don't think there's I mean I don't know anything about this but I can't imagine that there's like actual trades or transactions going through you're just loading up tokenated access that's just the start though like there's gonna be a button in Spotify of like yeah I want to download that like buy this Drake nft yeah of course they would good point and and apple wants to take a chart I just think that these sort of stupid like gatekeeping just cannot stand because a competitor will just be like fine if you want to charge we'll just support Android and then maybe I'll get rid of my iPhone because I want to do nfts and then Apple will have to submit and bend the knee this is it's it's a competitive Dynamic and you know the the gatekeeping is just not sustainable with uh web3 that's just not what we do here we can't charge rent on all this stuff I 100 agree with you I just find it kind of funny and ironic that you're telling gatekeeping will not stand I want token gated access in my apps keeping is totally fine this is power to the creators it's uh decentralized it's distributed so um cool nice job Spotify and whoever is leading that really really good work there okay uh withdrawals the sepolia chappella scheduled for February 28th say that three times fast what is chappella chappella is a combination of Shanghai and capella because we just love our words in the ethereum ecosystem uh it is the upgrade for withdrawals for the sepolia test net and that will happen on February 28th uh so that's pretty cool uh granted that this I can't imagine that this upgrade is all that complex we're really just enabling withdrawals but we have a testament for that this is March is do you think it's going to go we're gonna go live in February but do you think we're gonna get uh the next ethereum upgrade in March then this is sort of like March early April right that sounds right that's bullish yeah uh flashbots announces Mev share a programmably private order flow that empowers users redistributes Mev and takes a step towards decentralized block building okay so so what is this Mev flashbots of course uh we know flashbots uh they're the people that help uh actually reduce some of the gassies on ethereum by creating a private off-chain Marketplace for Block building and block proposing now they are doing the same thing for uh users and putting their transactions into blocks that allow for users to recapture some of the Mev that they might be creating and so what how does this work uh users can choose exactly what transaction data of their transactions to hide and then also reveal through programmable privacy so Searchers uh this if you are familiar with this whole like how it block gets built Searchers build in a competitive order flow auction for the right to execute against users private transactions selectively revealing transaction data can help Searchers better optimize their bids which means higher payments back to the user so because users can keep their transactions private users can bargain for the Mev that they create without permissioning search or competition basically your transaction on ethereum through this thing called Mev share will create some sort of Mev by keeping your transaction data private you can actually Force Searchers to pay you for the Mev that you create and so this is a way to get back some of the value that you put into the ethereum ecosystem you know this whole time we were talking I was just admiring these heart messages who's the graphic designer that came up with this okay the day after Valentine's Day and we got these Hearts m-e-v-u Matchmaker yeah zero x81 babe relay on me I would buy these I would buy these for sure David some uh layoffs that came down the pipe this week polygon Labs cut staff by 20 so a 20 cut for polygon Labs also immutable has reportedly laid off 11 of its staff uh what's your take on some of these layoffs it's you know we saw a whole bunch toward the end of last year um some more early this year do you have a high level take on this yeah laying off people when the markets uh go turn down it's just a symptom of just like when you've optimized for growth uh and so when the markets turn away a turn against you you have to uh trim and cut back this is just the natural process of things it doesn't mean that like polygon is doing badly it doesn't mean immutable is doing badly it just means they hired a lot during the bull market and now resources have uh dried up and so they have to cut back a lot of companies over hired and so in order to optimize they are cutting back this is just a normal part of the process David you're not gonna fire me are you I'm not gonna let me know I think it does take two people to do this podcast at least you and I are not prepared for that right well can I see you in my office I'll be better David uh NBA top shots moments they might be Securities do moments of time are now Securities well awesome yeah what what else everything's a security this podcast security if we tokenize it um bankless podcasts or oh I don't even want to don't say it don't say the words that will be used against you my friend uh but what is this headline and what does it mean uh yeah NBA branded Top Shot moments nfts maybe Securities judge rules and Dapper collabs case uh ultimately the Court's conclusion was that Dapper Labs offered was an investment contract under Howie the judge wrote uh so uh we're gonna have to follow this story but um turns out with the scope of what a security is is in expanding itself to top shots moments great so basically we have even less Clarity on what's the security and what's not a security as this is going through the court system and digital collectible of a moment of time is a security okay so a video game item that drops if it's an nft is that a security totally a security you think so yeah that flaming long sword of fire that does 172 damage it needs a 10K report exactly yeah little Bobby shows up and little Bobby picks that up off the ground Gary Gensler shows up at your door and says hey hey uh that's a security hey Bobby do you know put that down put down that security Bobby look and if you have questions just uh go to Gary gensler's office hours he's happy to answer any of your questions and throw you in jail um all right open C versus blur what's going on here David yeah so openc as a result of the blur dominance in the NFC Marketplace has changed their openc fee to zero percent so opency now charging zero percent on trades for a limited time uh they have also moved the optional Creator earnings uh half a percent minimum for all collections without on-train enforcements and then lastly marketplaces with the same policies will not be blocked by the operator filter so this is really just the collapse of margins in the nft marketplace when you have a competitor is this because in response to blur is that what's going on yeah because blur blur volumes are eating Open Seas lunch and so they had to drop all their fees in order to stay competitive like didn't blur exceed open Suite open C volumes last uh last week yeah yeah for like the first time that's right yep yep this is take from Frank to God's a harsh reality nft marketplaces are trying to maximize market share so they can raise bigger VC rounds and the best way to get market share is to have the lowest fees for high frequency trading godspeed I don't care about that because the user's benefit bring my fees down to close to zero except for artists this does shoot artists like artists are caught in the crossfire because artists really really like royalties does this uh so this Cuts royalty or is it just Open Seas so blur blur is trying to minimize royalties because they want to maximize the value to trade nft Traders and so they're routing around Creator royalties because that is an extra fee that Traders don't want to pay I still think that creators will just respond in kind and they'll just like do a thing where I'm at 100 and then I keep 100 and then I sell those back it's one option there's also the option for creators to make a nft contract that enforces royalties at the contract level so you have to pay a royalty um that will make it harder to be composable yeah into other nft marketplaces but it is an option very cool I like the competitive Dynamics David um yeah there's that tweet about blur dominated this month it's a whole month of January or it's a February uh accounting for 46 of January's total that's January January is total nft volume outpacing open C so open C was 40 blur was 46 granted this is the month that open or that blur dropped there token so that is going to be a very hot month yeah that probably excuse things David do we have any bitcoin news maybe um I did look at the ordinals data ordinals volume is down um and so if the trending down to the downside uh but it's been a very very healthy no matter what so it was definitely not dead but uh ordinals activity down a little bit the only other bitcoin news that we have is this uh tweet from Patrick Hanson this this is a take uh Patrick is at um the EU side of circle so he believes in stable coins of course so that is his bias he works for usdc basically Patrick Tweets in El Salvador after hundreds of millions of top-down public Investments only 1.6 percent of remittances are sent via Bitcoin meanwhile driven by natural bottom-up demand one-third of Latin American consumers have used stable coins for everyday purchases the market is loud and clear uh so this is this has been a growing um sentiment again like an indictment against uh naive bouquet of El Salvador of just like really forcing Bitcoin on its citizens using a lot of uh El Salvadorian capital and money to buy Bitcoin and make Bitcoin Investments when uh the critique is that that money could have been used to support you know public goods wasn't the remittance use case always dumb for Bitcoin I mean I I never understood this because it was just basically like um hold Bitcoin hold it it'll go up in value the the use case of Bitcoin is you hold it well the money printer is printing it if if I'm holding my money like that's the last thing I actually want to spend I want to spend my inflating currency I want to hold my Bitcoin and the same is true of of ether really it's not a good medium of exchange right it's not a good unit of account it is a fantastic store of value so it wasn't destined to fail from the beginning uh I would I would say so yeah because like the whole you use Bitcoin for remittances so like actually I'm not a believer in the whole blockchain not Bitcoin thing but that's what a blockchain is for evidence is I could pay my gas fees my eth gas fees in USD I would usdc I would just have it like because then I don't have to be like ah well you know I paid an eth and now I gotta do taxes yeah I gotta do taxes thank you exactly uh what's this from Caitlyn long this was interesting last week yeah so moving on to a new subject uh Caitlyn long uh tweets out this tweet it's time time for me to review a few reveal a few things I've just published a post shame on Washington DC for shooting the messenger and so Caitlyn tweets out today I'm publicly disclosing for the first time that a I handed over evidence to law enforcement of probable crimes committed by a big crypto fraud that started months before that company exploded and stuck its millions of customers uh with millions of dollars of losses she talking about she might be talking about fgx Iran she doesn't name them by name though no it does not and then B I also warned Bank Regulators of a mounting Bank Run risk inside Banks servicing the crypto industry before the bank runs ultimately hit so Caitlyn long saying hey I told Regulators in law enforcement about the FTX fraud and then I warned banking Regulators of all the contagion that might happen what happened as a result of that well her bank which is a fully custodialed uh this is a custodia bank uh which is like a full fully backed reserved uh Bank out of Wyoming uh what happened to custodia uh custodia's banking license banking Charter I believe was denied and now disparaged for daring to even come through the front door so Caitlyn long founder of this custodia Bank who's trying to be a a responsible fully custodian uh Cassidy uh crypto Bank reported to law enforcement about FTX talks about all the incoming contagion and then gets the door slammed on her face so she actually went to the regulator's office and and asked and not only did they not help her they actually didn't listen when she was trying to whistle blow on the things that she saw going on in the industry yeah so Jesse Powell uh retweets this and and says Jesse Powell of Kraken says I can't tell you how infuriating it is to have pointed out massive red flags and obviously illegal activity two Regulators only to have them ignore the issue issues for years quote they're offshore it's complicated we're looking at everybody end quote is what Jesse's saying that the Regulators are saying four years and then and then to be used as their example so like I mean this is obviously hitting very personally for Jesse because you know Kraken just got uh staking inside the US shut down by the SEC uh even though it's sort of relatively low risk good product and Jesse's been doing some of the similar stuff as Caitlyn for years now and then also like this is what our complaint about dokwon Ryan is like all the bad guys come in they make a bunch of money they cause a bunch of Destruction they cause a bunch of chaos and then they go hide in Serbia and all the people who believe in this industry take all of the blame take all the good people like Jesse right who is actually like uh whistleblowing talking about the red flags two Regulators actually showed up to Gary gensler's office Joc to him what does he get for that a 30 million dollar fine yep and sorry you can no longer have a staking product yep meanwhile sambaekman freed it's watching football on his VPN is he watching football or playing video games uh probably moving assets around if you're saying watch he would if he could we know that's that's what that's what the claim is it's like the court is like hey why are you on a VPN and Samba compete was like I'm watching football that guy doesn't go away really yeah you haven't heard this part of the story no so he got in trouble for using a VPN when he was a big football yeah I'm watching football he's like dude you're at home turn on the TV you don't need a VPN for this oh my God the Griff don't stop oh this is more Jesse uh he says this I have a theory Regulators let the bad guys get big and blow up because it serves their agenda number one destroy capital resources and crypto to burn people deter adoption number three give air cover to attack good actors the bad guys are actually on side good guys are the enemy man it does feel like that sometimes doesn't it David yep doesn't it yeah yeah the so Gary Gensler is trying to say like Jesse of Kraken that man sold an unregistered security he's bad and meanwhile like our perspective is like Jesse Katelyn many others calling out the actual frauds the actual risks and that if like they're Our Heroes they're our good guys but from the outside in like Gary Gensler and his like office hours campaign is trying to paint do the same thing that Elizabeth Warren's trying to do which is super coders but Jesse's saying and that's all intentional so it's all part of the Evil Genius play uh I hope that's not true but it it feels like it is and it that you know the evidence is Weighing on and that being the possibility here David um collabland launched a token what is this what does it mean yeah so people who are familiar in the Dow space or in the Discord space uh will definitely know collab land it's basically very very important uh Discord infrastructure uh so collab is a governance token and used within the collab land ecosystem uh so holders will be a part of the collab land Dao feature requests bounties career at the marketplace uh token claim will begin on February 23rd which is today so that was yesterday if you're listening to this on Friday and so if you are an earn a Phi subscriber I'm sure you'll be getting a notif a notification of your eligibility for this so if you're not an earnify subscriber and you don't know what that is go to earn.fi and sign up to get notified of airdrops like this one David uh what's going on at superfluid did they introduce a new feature here yeah super fluid vesting so what is super fluid super fluid is streaming payments so micro pennies per block sense over time uh just super fluid payments so like instead of just um streaming Money Baby streaming money yes thank you uh and so the superfluid investing is a way to vest using the super fluid contracts over time so you can now put investing contracts using super fluid so the tokens for a specific specific protocol or whatever stay in the sender's wallet until the very moment that they are vested in a stream directly to the recipient's wallet with or without a cliff so there's no token lock up in a smart contract and these tokens can be this is the thing dydx should have done do you remember a few weeks ago like go and we were talking about uh they made you know promises investors made promises and we could have just done this on a smart contract that's what superfluid is is doing it's enforcing vesting at the code layer which is like hey that's a good use a Smart contract that's a great use uh and and then also uh out of out of uh phylan this week we've talked about phylan before but they've announced their two million dollar seed round uh what is Phi land it gives you this like little 3D landscape to place little objects and you can only place the objects if you have done the thing in web3 that enables you to claim those objects so for example you can place a uniswap object on your land if you've traded on uniswap what's yours look like David hoffman.eath brother it's uh how do I find you uh search accounts right there David David Hoffman Hoffman that's my little my little Finland yeah yeah I know this this was included just so David could brag about his violent here yeah exactly yeah uh and so if you've trade it on unit swap once you can get the uniswap land but if you've traded on a unit swap like 10 times then your unit swap Icon like grows bigger it's like the level two version cool you have 16 000 uh experience points here whatever and so I can use that experience to buy other things in the philand ecosystem uhland is on uh polygon look at these quests you've achieved right look at all my look at all my achievements yeah the busy little B over here there we go there's my fine Land look I got got a bunch of little trees I got my open sea ship uh so you can even you can even like I've linked in uh the Youtube channel which goes to bank list so not only can you do your web 3 achievements you can also put in your web 2 identity and you can link like your Instagram your YouTube your sub stack uh so this is just a fun cool little experiment in on-chain identity that I thought was pretty cool yeah social signaling uh you can connect with the best wallet ever the best wallet ever the best meta master of course sponsoring this yes thank you uh and so you can go in and like you will have your land out of the gate you I think you do need to have an ens name so you log in with metamask into your ens wallet and then you can start building out your phylend uh and then of course just as a disclaimer both Ryan and I are investors in both superfluid and phyland as well I'm not in superfluid just you oh that's right you forgot to sign moving on jobs this week uh bankless.palot.com jobs uniswap Labs is looking for a senior software engineer thankless is looking for some writers some social growth leads overpriced jpegs needs a producer Bank list needs a growth marketer consensus a director of an engineering Adidas Global head of web 3 strategy and planning pre-pio senior web 3 front-end engineer I could go on even though some companies are laying off many more are hiring crypto just keeps getting bigger go look at the job opportunities at bankless.palot.com and check that out David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got questions from the nation hey Ryan David what do you think vitalik would be working on if he wasn't working in crypto great question we'll talk about that as well as some takes from the week as well as what are Ryan and I bullish on moving forward and also one of the best moments of Zen that we've ever had ever so stay tuned for all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets

Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i make sure you never lose another airdrop questions from the bankless nation Discord here we go question from proxy people always say layer twos do inherit the security of their layer one when compared to side chains but what does that actually mean that's a very relevant question this week given the base announcement so the difference between base as a layer two and base as its own side chain is what what does it mean to inherit the security of ethereum for a chain-like base yeah so a layer two has a formal and specific relationship with its layer 1 in a way that a side chain does not and so a layer 2 makes certain cryptographic commitments to a layer one that binds itself to the layer 1 to follow certain sets of rules and so it makes it makes promises commitments cryptographic commitments to the layer one that it will abide by the rules that it sets for itself and those rules are things like being able to make a transaction on the layer 2 from the layer one and all the other crypto cryptographic assurances that you need to make a blockchain a blockchain and so basically it allows people on the layer one to make transactions happen on the layer two that means that the validator or sequencer of that layer 2 does not have more power than the layer or one has and so if the sequencer for a layer 2 on ethereum goes Rogue and they stop processing transactions they stop propagating blocks and you are as a user left abandoned and cut off from interacting with the layer two you can use the layer one to go get your money a side chain does not have that power does not have that relationship because a side chain is just another blockchain that posts data to a bigger chain a layer one chain but doesn't make any formal cryptographic commitments to that how was that explanation does that does that check out for you yeah that checks out you know once one kind of analogy I use in in my mind is I think of Like These Chains as like imagine these big cities in the cloud okay so ethereum is like the biggest city of all in the cloud so it's a CD in a cloud all right side chains do not have a bridge back to ethereum that is like Everlasting and eternal and that can't be broken okay they're their own independent cities so if the side chain goes down and like someone takes all your funds something bad happens there's no way to exit back to the big cloud city of ethereum with a layer 2 like arbitrary or optimism or now base there is an everlasting cannot be broken no other dependencies Bridge back to ethereum so if bad things happen in the uh cloud city of Base so the cloud city of optimism users can always run back over that bridge back to ethereum and I'm saying users I mean like the assets there's always match yeah that is one big difference from a user perspective and yeah the escape hatch I think analogy is really right it's it's the escape hatch exists and the power who has power over that escape patch is the layer one to ethereum yep so what is really the difference between a layer 2 and a side chain is that a layer two gives up certain authorities to a power that is uh Stronger Than itself which is the ethereum layer one and so that's how users always have assurances that they can be bankless if they need to be even in the event of a rogue layer 2 operator yep absolutely and Layer Two is really the only configuration that kind of um you know takes takes this form right so it's it's much different than a side chain from that perspective all right well it gives a layer to its name as in like without without creating that relationship it's not a layer two because a layer two implies that you can't you can't jettison the layer one the formal cryptographic relationship is what makes something a layer two because it gives itself it gives power to the layer one it's corruption resistance too it's like so if the if the city in the cloud gets corrupt and if you're on Layer Two you're fine because you can always go back to uh ethereum another that was a great question proxy a question from uh proy actually is the name uh sorry um hey Ryan and David what do you think vitalik would be working on now if you weren't in crypto what about both of you um that is palu asked that question David what do you think vitalik would be working have we ever asked him that if he wasn't in crypto what would you be working on vitalik I don't know if we have yeah I mean we'll take a whatever podcast with vitalica that we can get so maybe we'll offer this prompt to him the helic does a lot of things outside of crypto um italic podcast but we can't talk about crypto the entire but no crypto yeah how would that be uh so Vitality does a lot of things outside of crypto a lot of people don't don't realize this uh he's uh very interested in longevity he's very interested in Ai and he's very interested in charity and charitable giving and impact basically so it would probably be something maybe all three of those things um and so he's uh where he's he's very tapped into the longevity world so maybe he would be fit like helping promote research in longevity science what about the public policy type stuff you know quadratic voting and that kind of thing he's like very interested in sort of the the underlying protocols and mechanics that govern society that govern society and I think help us coordinate I mean ethereum is one gigantic coordination technology unlock right that you're creating in the protocol layer but he's done other things like quadratic voting could be applied to uh nation states or you know yeah I think the the uh Denver city of Denver is is experimenting with quadratic funding uh for its own publicates yeah uh it'd be very interesting how about you if you were in crypto what would you be doing uh I think uh let's see how many years have I been crypto I would have graduated from PT school I would have a lot of debt and I would be working as a physical therapist would probably be my answer really is that what but like I think the path that I was on prior to that's the path you were on but but let's say maybe another phrasing of this question is um if uh you had to do something right now that wasn't crypto what would you be doing and it's probably is it physical therapy is that your you know passion okay so that would have been that's the path that I jettisoned in 2017. uh probably okay so if crypto deleted it but I had all my same skill sets yeah it would probably be like content production and writing yeah I just like I'd be a podcaster in a different field I guess what field uh maybe AI some some future yeah exercise was definitely a part of it but like um I don't know I think I would have landed on some like futuristic sci-fi technology to be some sort of content producer about that's probably the easiest answer that was going to be my answer too especially after that Eleazar episode is like uh AI podcaster should we pivot the podcast David but but seriously we don't we have more AI content coming so maybe this future is actually going to manifest that's a great question all right let's get something wait was that is that that was your answer is like AI podcaster I look it would have to be some you know nothing quite like there's nothing like crypto on the planet it's just like it's just it ties so many of my interests together it's just like Finance investing startups economics politics um social theory like psychology is just everything right yeah I think I would be an investor though no matter what sure like there would have to be some cross-section of Entrepreneurship and investing and it probably gravitate more towards that than content production I mean you're the one who is like David Ryan we should start a podcast and I was like so I don't have anything I don't really see it yeah I don't have the content producing Gene but there's something I love about investing and that is like investing is just um you get rewarded when you're right it's this like so many fields um it's impossible to ever find truth like how do you find truth how do you know if you're right right investing fulfills that gratification for me of like uh you're in the game and you're playing and um you could be right you can be wrong and there's like some underlying truth to it and I I don't think I could um I could leave that side of things and that's more more interesting than the investing side is just you think about something apply a thesis and you get you get an answer to the hypothesis right if you're right or not and uh investing I think rewards that more than just about anything else maybe science does but yeah science I don't have the patience for science I think yeah yeah I think that's a good take uh Elon Musk that's the take of the week what's he saying okay says Elon what should we do about it question mark uh what is he talking about uh he is replying to a tweet from lyron shapira Lira and shapira who tweets out what if AI is going to literally Slaughter every living creature on this planet in the next three years watch Eliezer udowski's new interview on Bank list and see why that's not even a joke uh and then he makes a tweet thread with clips and and other threads and then Elon responds to this tweet uh okay what should we do about it which Ryan uh when I saw that tweet I'm like Oh I thought I thought you knew isn't that what you said yeah isn't that your job Elon yeah I mean what should we do about it David My Only Solution Ryan is to help further this conversation that's my only contribution I have to solving this problem is making more content about it so people can know about it so that will not be the last word on AI that you hear on Bank list all right Dave and I are thinking through some some next guests we've got some names in mind we'll be doing some some reach out um at least I think had a really interesting perspective but it's not the only perspective in this in this space and I think look we're not going to Pivot the podcast into a an AI alignment podcast but we are going to explore this topic what did we just say earlier crypto touches everything everything and certainly touches artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence touches it this is um I think between crypto and AI these are the most interesting Technologies at least to me for the next decade no question about it they will intersect in all sorts of interesting ways yeah and and it was interesting we put out the uh this podcast with Eleazar titled we're all gonna die which talks about the AI alignment problem which in tldr is like if we make a super intelligent AI we don't know how to make it care about our existence it might consider us completely uh it might be just be completely indifferent to us and we it might use at least you think that's a base case it's not a he thinks about the basic ability he thinks that's like the very so far no one has really been able to argue against that some people diminish how big of a deal that question is but that is I think the issue we released this episode a week early and then the bank list Nation Discord was an AI Discord for a week because that's all they would talk about it in there and then there's like another Discord that I'm in and like I brought up some of these questions in here and they started talking about Ai and then this this uh this episode goes public and all of crypto Twitter for at least a day starts talking about Ai and so Ryan I haven't told you this but vitalik messaged me this morning he goes by the way I'm not sure if you realize the extent to which that one episode has made a huge public impact raising the awareness on the AI safety issue and so like this is how much this conversation the eleazer is like warnings have been like pushed to the back of people's minds and so like now it's actually kind of good that I think a non-ai podcast is promoting this conversation because no one else is doing it um so absolutely we're also uh privileged with the ability to ask the really dumb questions which I think we did the dumb questions are what's on everyone's mind too so I um I actually like I was in a bad place after that episode but at the same time I'm very glad that we did it and I think there'll be more uh from that too okay David what do we have a tweet from Frank Degas who's also a podcast guest this week what problem do nfts solve that's in quotes people want to buy digital Goods that's it that's my chocolate sauce mic drop like I think it's so like people who think like does that really need to be an nft I think is an invalid question it's like why not people people like sometimes you you must like this guy Frank the gods because like sometimes I hear you say this sort of thing people like the jpegs like but why is the jpeg going up this is the early days people like jpegs that's all it is think about it isn't it you don't have to overthink it okay so this is a take that I put out that I want to get your judgment on Ryan can I read it yeah okay this is from from you uh if you bought a token on the open market you're allowed to Shell to your heart's content any any other form of acquiring a token probably requires disclosures in order to promote a token that you specifically issued it's never appropriate to promote okay let me look through that again three rules three Hoffman rules here if you bought it on the open market you can shell it number two any other form of acquiring a token probably requires disclosure in order to promote okay so if you got it as an advisor or you got it as a gift or something like this or it's a sponsorship number three a token that you specifically issued it's never appropriate to promote um I agree with all of those one thing that I might put an asterisk on in number one is not just if you bought it on the open market but if you bought it on the open market and you have some kind of um like a bias in that like let's say you own over like two percent of the supplier five percent of the supply or let's say that it comprises like a substantial portion of your net worth like it's fifty percent of your net worth or something like that then that's the asterisk I would also put that that also probably should be disclosed or people should be generally aware that that's the case too uh otherwise I think that these are Hoffman rules are fantastic rules uh for disclosures and I think more people should be following them yeah um thank you uh and I would say that these are all just rules of thumb there are plenty of instances where like some of these things won't apply for example a token that you specifically issued if you're an artist and you're making nfts and that's your like uh income absolutely show that if it's art show that to the nth degree you're an artist this is more about like these things as Financial assets I would say I agree and then even then you're Shilling the art which is the product and you're not necessarily showing the finances yeah exactly yeah David here's the take here what's this oh God uh so this is uh Xerox Edgar uh who's tweeting out the SEC case against Sarah Luna by the end of May 2022 UST Luna wrapped Luna and Mir uh were essentially worthless wiping out more than 40 billion dollars in Combined market value domestic institutional investors experience bills billions of dollars in losses in Market valuations countless retail investors lost their life savings and ended up in debt as a result of collapse here's the punch line for example a pharmacist in California borrowed 400 000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment a painter in Vermont invested twenty thousand dollars in USDA set aside for his son's college education but lost it all in the terraform ecosystem collapsed oof um don't do that don't I mean yes do Quan is at fault also take some responsibility and don't invest your College Science Education or your home to buy a financial asset what do we do about this David I don't know like at some point this is this is always how frauds and like scams and Ponzi schemes like work for some reason they just attract the reptile brain of so many people out there who don't know how to think about these things and then they do stupid stuff like mortgaging 400 000 against the value of your own home to purchase UST one one take I think is just you have to have a investor mindset and that includes like an investor psychology right so you can like feel yourself fomoing into something like that is a that is a feeling you know that feeling yourself if you start to feel rising up in you this feeling of like Get rid of it now yeah I need it now this could be an overnight thing like bye bye bye you should always cast doubt on that feeling go go for a jog take a hot shower like really consider it give it due diligence wait three months and see if you still feel that way like it's we can't no one can protect you Gary Gensler can't protect you against all of the different ways that you can kind of like think you're investing your money and you're actually investing in a scammer scheme um so that's on you and my hope is that people just develop better instincts and better defense and uh better investor psychology around this stuff that's that's the only protection yeah what else do we do uh okay this was a fun thread this is uh Pac-Man from blur uh when I did my interview with him he was the person on the right uh this uh AI generated um not AI generated but just like cartoon version of anime yeah but it was also animated so when he opened his mouth the anime person opened his mouth and also moved around uh but then so this is a web to me versus web 3 me person uh tweet thread yeah and so uh Pac-Man and most of the blur team have all been Anonymous but Pac-Man puts out this thread doxing himself and telling a little story about how blur came to be and who he is and so I always think it's a fun story of when Anon Founders decide to on and on themselves to docs themselves and so if you are curious to hear that story a very human story of the founder behind blur uh there's a link in the show notes very cool all right David uh what do you bullish on this week my friend uh I mean uh so I'm bullish on layer twos uh I'm bullish on the op stack uh I'm bullish on so much of this being proving a lot of the bankless Theses that we've been beating the drum with for years now um it was more to say I'm also bullish though uh East Denver which uh in about one hour I'm taking a flight out to eat Denver to go and so I will see all of you there especially those going to the bank list Meetup I have never missed an East Denver it is the most magical time of the year uh and so I'm abolished on all these things right more magical than Christmas David yes it is the most magical time of the year for David uh wow it's definitely go say hi to David he'll be wearing a big bang this shirt I think a lot of the the bankless folks will be too we have a community nine bankless team members but then there's huge representation in the bankless nation if you count count the number of uh bankless shirts that you see yeah shirts that you see um Dao punks Bangles Dow shirts yeah a lot of culture there exporting culture exactly what are you uh what are you excited for around I agree with you and look um you promised not to front-run me this time and then you know I did it I got front run but you kept it shorter it's a great day to be going bankless um I think this is uh you know with with with the the launch or the announcement of the launch of Base this is further proving out a lot of the Theses we've had in this space for a while um protocol sync thesis okay this idea that the most credibly neutral Technologies and coordination structures will kind of sink to the bottom and form the base of everything else they'll be forced to build on top of this the idea being like a ethereum for instance or a D5 protocol that is incredibly decentralized like like a uniswap for instance will be at the basis that's a thesis that we've talked about from the very beginning we've been bullish on layer Twos for a very long time in fact David we predicted that a major exchange would launch on a layer two um when people thought that that was stupid and foolish and like why would they why wouldn't they all launch their own chains and create their own tokens and isn't that the game theory of it turns out it's not the D5 mullet this idea that we'd have kind of banks in the front fintech in the front and defy in the back ethereum then Network being a settlement layer for the world a settlement layer for other crypto Banks first and then for all banks that bank Ledger systems would essentially become either layer twos or side chains on ethereum I mean this is how we go bankless this is how this movement wins and it's just very gratifying to see this thesis playing out like um the bankless thesis works sometimes you just gotta wait yep right and like I don't know I'm just I'm very excited about um this this movements and the ideas that we've talked about from the very beginning actually coming to life and this week was just a major event for that so A major exchange 110 million users now launching a layer two so essentially bending the knee to ethereum in the process bending the knee to decentralization betting the need to the people and um doing kind of the right thing embracing crypto values and it's really cool to see so this is another um this is getting me out of the funk of 2022. you know he's like it's such a hangover from 2022 it just I felt gross at the end of 2022 and this kind of thing this Builder's momentum it's not even about prices who cares about prices the prices aren't pumping on this news I don't care I don't care at all it doesn't matter Wall Street doesn't understand this why would we expect um the price of coinbase stock to pump uh I don't even think the crypto Market understands how big this is coin price is down 1.5 good that's great like that's the thing I don't even care anymore because I know that this thesis is going to play out in um you know in kind of the right direction and uh anyway it's just it yeah slowly slowly it's not overnight again get rich slowly yeah and uh anyway I'm also very excited for uh for these things and that's all I have to say about that I'm excited for just millions of more layer 2 users right maybe we can get our grandma to use uh Grandma's to use uh layer twos that is the bull case for bass is that coinbase is the front end for its own yes grandma is the front end for the base chain and they just fix all of the ux and UI issues that are playing I'm working on my parents you know my parents had just they have funds on an exchange they've never really done much in crypto right like in crypto they're not crazy that's like the base case yeah yeah most parents yeah I don't know I don't know about Grandma she might be a little uh you know I'll help Grandma it's okay if Grandma doesn't sorry uh that's it meme of the week time you ready let's do it what do we got do it this is the change my mind format and we got Gary Gensler sitting real comfy drinking some coffee saying everything's a security changed my mind I can't change I don't think I can change his mind but I can hopefully help people make that invalid not that the opinion of the United States government Gary I remember my wise co-host once saying Gary Gensler if everything is a security then nothing is a security you can't exactly right everything be a security Gary uh that's where we'll end it David we got a really cool Moment of Zen coming up that I think you should tease and provide some context for it so this is the second um song put together by El Coco No who's a bankless nation citizen also part of the bankless Dao uh they this is a a ballad The Ballad of Alexi uh the of course software developer behind tornado cash who is still in jail uh and so it's a very long song it's like four plus minutes written by El Coco No all by himself I think you are absolutely going to enjoy this one and if you are interested in collecting this this is an nft that is available on openc if you really enjoy this song guys I should uh end with the wrists and disclaimers as always before we get to the Moment of Zen crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] Holland is simping for the U.S for the big strong government they're trying to impress and they don't give a [ __ ] about the scared young kid that they've locked in a cage when all he did was fight for the fundamental rights for which our ancestors paid the ultimate price the trial's not over there's still time to fight for Alexian all mankind inequity just grows and grows and often this results God knows in rebellion and war against the bourgeoisie and all kinds of things we don't want to see till we said instead of starting a fight we'll build a city in the sky where we treat people right and you can keep your Banks and your powers that be and will pay your taxes and if need be will contort our Dows into create for free and help undermine totalitarian regimes and we'll even jump start your economy and give you what you need to withstand the Chinese even for it's something you know that you need and will help to build a future may be less captured by greed and you didn't say stop when we started the building we thought it was because our city fulfilled all the freedoms ideals and rights that speak to human nature of all types but as it turns out out and that wasn't it you just ignored what you thought wasn't a threat and then you went and broke down a Lexi's door and you drug him off like a prisoner of war and for three long months there was no charge as you've had each other's backs in your heads got large but you didn't realize when you snagged your prize that history will write you as the bad guys our Tech is neutral but our movement is not and personal sovereignty is what we want you crossed the line now make it right cause we're an enemy won't know how to fight but Holland is simping for the U.S for the big strong government they're trying to impress and they don't give a [ __ ] about the scared young kid that they've locked in a cage when all he did was fight for the fundamental rights for which our ancestors pay the ultimate price the trial's not over there's still time to fight for Alexi and all [Music] thank you foreign a lot of folks struggled fought and died so certain rights wouldn't get rushed aside and when we think back we're filled with pride citizens politicians side by side but there's a hungry Beast that we just can't say and that monster's name is the nation-state and no matter how much we all want to believe the monster just grows without reprieve well we have a new weapon to fight this fight and we ask our officials to do what's right forget your power and your [ __ ] greed the world's changing quickly and we need for you to fight for Humanity instead of destroying people's lives just to bolster your career because that's a shitty way to get ahead so Highland go tell Alexi go home to your wife she loves you and is afraid for your life we overreacted and that's on us we hope the rest of the world will trust that they can still visit Amsterdam because we're actually not an authoritarian regime [Music] and we regret our actions regarding Alexi to the extreme okay [Music]
