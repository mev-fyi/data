welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless well maybe bankless nation becoming more bankless requires more privacy that is what we're here to discuss today with zuko who is of course the founder of zcash an internet protocol a blockchain protocol centered around privacy and i think david will have discovered that maybe we've just entered the crypto wars 2.0 a few things to look out for in this episode some takeaways for you we go through did we just enter the crypto wars why this looks a lot like the 1990s all over again the crypto wars that we had previously we also get zuko to answer the question why do we need privacy unless we're hiding something it's a question we're constantly asked when we advocate for privacy but zuko makes the case that privacy is the foundation for any free society that is what we want to live in of course a free society also we talk about crypto falling prey to the same surveillance dystopia of the original internet the internet that we find ourselves in now where facebook and many large corporations have control over our data how do we prevent this from happening in crypto and lastly is zcash going to become a rollup on ethereum why do we ask this question of course because we have to it is an interesting question and zuko certainly had an interesting answer to this david what do you think of this episode i really like zuko man he's like a really friendly personable guy with a ton of personality uh and the timing of this episode is obvious after the uh banning of tornado cash uh we need to go and explore and do an episode why privacy like fundamentally from first principles why do we want privacy as a society why is having a having privacy a requirement for having a free society and i think one of my biggest takeaways the biggest angles that i appreciated the most from zuko here is we really explored the question when we give away our data either accidentally or on purpose why does that net like almost always create negative outcomes it's like giving away your data is like a neutral thing to do it's neither positive nor nor negative but systemically when everyone does it why does that create dystopia at the end of the day and now i feel really informed it's like why we need to have privacy by default why like it's not transparency by default but privacy by default that is the best equilibrium for society the one that doesn't create a dystopia where like google and facebook are harvesting our data to like sell us stuff that we might not necessarily want or you know god forbid swing elections or even worse cause civil wars like all things that actually have happened as a result of this data leakage um and so that was my my big takeaway and of course the allusion to the crypto wars was there was a crypto wars in the 90s of which zuko was a part of uh and this were the cryptography wars and now we're talking about crypto wars 2.0 which is now the cryptocurrency wars where we're doing it all over again but previously we did it with cryptography now we're doing it with cryptocurrency and zuko is one of the few people who's going to be here for both wars so a very special guest here today on the bankless podcast yeah absolutely uh definitely we want to restore privacy by default privacy as a norm that's what zuko makes the case for today of course if you're a bankless premium subscriber you got to stick around for the debrief where david and i give our thoughts on the episode after the episode our raw unfiltered thoughts for the bankless nation directly

before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eth by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your node to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish east staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist

introduce you to our next guest zuko zuko is an og cypherpunk one of the few remaining i think in crypto who's still very involved and he remembers a time when crypto just meant cryptography not cryptocurrency as it does today and he's been a privacy developer since the very early days a contributor to digicash uh which is of course one of the precursors to cryptocurrency as we know and love was founded by david chom we've had david on the podcast as well recently too and of course more recently you know zuko because he is the co-founder or founder of zcash and he is the ceo of the electric coin company which is a for-profit company leading the development of zcash zcash of course being a privacy-centric cryptocurrency zuko welcome to bankless thank you it's an honor to be invited um error correction yes well it's not an error you said electric coin company the thing that i'm the ceo of is a for-profit company and that's kind of true but the owners of electric coin company donated 100 of it to a non-profit charity which is called the bootstrap foundation so ecc can make a profit but there's no owners who are allowed to take the profit into their own pockets instead any profit has to be used for the public good through the non-profit charity so so more like a public commons rather than a traditional you know for-profit company that we might think of that's the the yeah i i like it because it's a hybrid mode where we have like startup structure we have a ceo we have like all the departments and processes that are that we learned from startups but then the only thing we don't have is owners who can take profit out for their own pockets instead all the money all the profit has to go to the public good but that is very very a cypherpunk of you yeah that's very neat uh you know thanks to the owners for donating well i it's been very clear i think your your kind of your history in the space in cryptography and then later in cryptocurrency that uh you've been here um you know primarily for one big reason and that reason is privacy i feel like this is a very timely conversation because um the crypto world is asking the question of can we have privacy in our cryptocurrencies in light of recent events i think the the outside main street world is is asking the question of why do you guys actually need privacy so i think in this episode zuko we want to make the case for privacy and i just want to get your your gut reaction here because something's happened in the last few weeks that have sort of shaken uh the cryptocurrency community maybe to its core it's it's it's been quite a rattling and put privacy back into the conversation and that is an open source developer may have recently been arrested just for publishing privacy code now we don't know all of the details of this case but of course i am uh talking about the one of the developers behind tornado cash his name is alex he's now in a prison right now in jail behind bars um no charges have been laid at this point in time in the netherlands so so it's unclear but it may be the case that he was just arrested for publishing privacy code uh zuko like what's going on here what's happening well first of all [Music] another tiny error correction you're not wrong that my motive throughout all these different things i've done has been privacy but not because privacy but rather because freedom and there is a difference like i think privacy is necessary for freedom because if you don't have privacy if people don't have privacy then they're subject to the biggest most powerful pushiest organization around whether that's a corporation or a government that can surveil and manipulate them but so you need privacy for freedom but privacy not is not really its own value to me it's just that it's necessary for human dignity and people's authentic selves you know you can't be your authentic self when you're under scrutiny especially scrutiny of someone who's powerful and influential on you and this is doubly true for people who are less privileged than i am right people who are are on the margin or have more to lose or can find themselves in a in a desperate position more easily they're all the more vulnerable to being pressured and manipulated if they don't have privacy um but i like to emphasize something that's more important than privacy to me which is consent and i see this a lot with younger generations of people because a lot of them choose to share a lot on social media right like they shared their stories and their videos and their opinions and whatever and people who have sort of a privacy focus interpret this as the new generation doesn't care about privacy and i think that's kind of backwards i think they actually care or they understand better than the old generation about the choices you have with whom you share and what you share with whom and stuff like that and that notion of consent like people who choose to share something about their private life or their feelings or whatever with specific people that they want to share with that's 100 as valid as someone who chooses not to share something with someone does that make sense so it's not like if you use the word privacy people can interpret that as like secrecy it's like the people who share less the people who are more individualist or or more private you might say is a private person who doesn't tell anyone what's going on with them and that's not a value to me and that's not what i want to support what i want to support is people having their own choice it's your choice who you share with and it's your choice what you share it's not someone else's choice what you're what what they're going to get to find out about you without your consent i don't know if that answered your question at all but you triggered me by using the word privacy yeah no i i already love where this conversation is is going and uh it reminds me of a line that i've used here and there before that crypto isn't here to make you rich it's here to set you free uh and oftenly we also echo that you know decentralization isn't an end goal it's a means to an end for something else and i think that's also what you're saying with privacy it's like we don't we're not here to be private we're here to have freedom and to choose what we disclose and and uh i i've heard you say this before that you're actually like more optimistic that younger generations are interested in privacy more so than than older generations and i was talking to ryan earlier today i believe actually uh on like a recap from an episode we just with justin drake where uh i think younger generations feel a little bit perhaps like nihilist about their privacy in that like what's the point like apple's got all my data google's got all my data these are just extensions of this date uh but also at the same time we've contrasted that with people inside the crypto industry are way more like optimistic than outside of the crypto industry and i think it's because we see options for to move forward we see paths forward that like non-crypto people do and i i'm wondering if that's kind of what you see with with perhaps like why you are so motivated with z cash and creating privacy because you think that there are positive effects of society of having privacy options that are could be imbued into society i'm wondering if you could just kind of share your thoughts on that and what you what you see as like a privacy-enabled society yeah i totally agree with what you said and i agree that there's a generation or a few generations that were born into this world i saw some random person on the internet recently say something like well of course the government watches and tracks every expenditure you make and every income you receive it's always been that way and i thought to myself wow this guy's got to be way younger than me because that came into effect with richard nixon and like got more and more sort of invasive and powerful every decade but that's all new like it's never been that way there's there's never been a long-lived civilization that's lived like that are you talking about like the what did nixon do what did that air do was the bank secrecy act stuff was it uh yeah well it started with richard nixon's war on drugs and that led to the bank secrecy act what year was that 1970 big secrecy act and at that time it was sort of a sort of minimal invasion like we're going to deputize all the banks but all they have to do is a few um a few things to monitor their customers behavior but then since then the the policies around it have grown to where the banks and the other companies and the tech companies and the governments um are exercising more and more fine-grained and constant uh surveillance over everyone's finances so i really agree with what you said david that people in the crypto industry see more possibilities than people outside the crypto industry do but i also think and you asked like what kind of society could we envision with freedom built in and i also think it would basically be a lot like society was 50 years ago like there would be um effective law enforcement there would be limited government and there would be a lot of innovation and free social decisions people could choose like authentically because they are choosing in private or they're choosing only with the people that they want to share with what they want to be so one of my points is i don't think of it as radical exactly it's almost conservative it's like okay we've we've slid into a radical experiment in a totally new kind of society a totally new kind of life in which people have to live in a way that no humans have ever lived before and a nice conservative position is let's keep doing what already worked so you're saying that uh while crypto perhaps like feels very futuristic and very sci-fi yeah it's actually pulling forward some old conservative values that perhaps like we've had in society forever now well it's it strikes me that what you're saying too is like um what we're living in now this kind of surveillance state where we we have no consent we're just sharing all of our financial transactions that is not normal right and what you're saying is like how about we just go back in time through every other era of history when that was when normal was privacy this assumption of privacy and so rallying cry privacy is normal well does it feel does it feel like weird to like be making have to make that case just because the the water we swim in right now is complete surveillance of everything that we do digital financial uh social communication social or otherwise so like why it's it you get your news yeah from your framing of things it seems kind of odd to have to make the case for privacy but like that is the place we're in because uh the the minute we start asking for privacy um there's pushback from people there's kind of the devil's advocate perspective i want to hear you um on this you know some people say you know too much privacy is a bad thing zuko uh some people say that um like they'll get the charges like what if bad people use privacy to do bad things you've got terrorists you've got criminals you've got despots and if we remove this privacy thing that you care so much about we could stop those bad people so how do you make the case for privacy that privacy is normal when we have these these types of objections yeah that's a great question um bad things like terrorists and criminals and despots have always been with us in every human society like the framers of the bill of rights who enshrined privacy as part of the constitution of the united states and the fourth amendment were very familiar with those kinds of threats right um one thing you can do is look at human history and for that matter i don't know pre-history or all the different societies that exist today and have existed and until this radical experiment of surveillance capitalism and surveillance government of the last two or three decades there have been societies in which they tried to institute surveillance and control over everyone but those were not the societies we want to live in right um those were the the dystopias and they were the failed societies they were they they were terrible for the people who lived in them and they failed and they're gone um every successful thriving nation and society ever has had individual freedom and involuntary cooperation between people and a balance between social and governmental needs and societal needs but there's this like new player in this game which is the internet and i think the internet just makes it really easy to make everything very open right like like the internet is kind of like a blockchain i think it's like a little bit open by default and we have to actually add privacy to it in order to restore our privacy and so it's it's not like we're living in this weird experiment where like all of a sudden like nation states are in super invading of our privacy they're like well like all this data and like you know mind you also the business model of google and facebook is like well all this data is available so like we'll just go and take it it's just like perhaps maybe it's more of an anomaly like hopefully in the very long term future of the internet that this base layer infrastructure of like communications on the on across the internet actually goes from being transparent to private uh and and maybe that's the thing that like fixes this like weird anomaly if we are calling it anomaly but i wouldn't necessarily say that like this government has like forced this door open they've actually just been like playing with the cars that they are dealt would you agree with that absolutely like the original cause of all of this is probably the advertising model because when the internet came along people tried various ways to set up businesses and the only one that worked was advertising but advertising means collecting more and more fine-grained information about people so that you can manipulate them so that you can influence them better and better and that means surveillance capitalism and that's what scaled up starting like 25 years ago there's nobody i think there's nobody aside from possibly the chinese communist party who intends our society to work this way right like the um there's a hundred different arms of the u.s federal government and they all have different opinions about how society should work but very few of them think that like mark zuckerberg should have control and insight into everyone on the planet uh but he does right or facebook the institution does and so on my point is this as a society like radical technological revolutions take a long time like decades for people to learn about and consense around how we should live um like i'm reminded of like the gutenberg printing press i think it took almost a century for the sort of disruptive ripple effects to to start settling out around the world from that and here we are about 25 years in to surveillance automated mass surveillance of everyone all the time of everything um and i don't think anyone wanted this i don't think mark zuckerberg wanted this either actually so we've so as a society we've just kind of stumbled in or slid down a slippery slope into this radical dangerous unprecedented situation and cryptography and other new technologies like blockchain and zero knowledge proofs like we're saying earlier they are almost a way to slow the descent or to re-institute some of the principles in the social organization that are are pretty much quintessentially american really i'm an american uh patriot so you'll you'll you'll find me speaking from uh a real like american exceptionalism point of view um and so these these technologies even though you say they're like sci-fi they're like freaking lightsabers uh but the social impacts of them are really in alignment with american values uh such as uh freedom from unreasonable search and seizure freedom of association freedom of speech um the rule of law things like that yeah i think um dave and i have found a lot of red resonance with um kind of american values of the kind of the the original founders values the original framers of the constitution many of the the rights that were preserved in the constitution which we might call a protocol it's almost like code but it's social code these things are very important and um it's harder to go back in america's like more recent history the last 10 years and 20 years because i feel like the u.s has become this is not a political podcast but like the u.s has become much more cloudy in terms of what it actually values right but if we if we dig deeper uh in terms of the the fundamentals of of uh why this country was was founded there is so much to like in crypto and the constitution it's it's almost like a one-to-one match like and you were talking about the fourth amendment which is just um basically baking privacy into our social protocol but now we're in this place where we have to justify privacy uh to everyone else and and i i just wanna like make that case kind of um one more time or hear you make it because i really like what you said when uh you're saying hey it's not actually about privacy it's about freedom and it's about informed consent okay so how how do you make the link between freedom and informed consent and like privacy why does privacy equal freedom that that that's a piece i feel like uh that's not linked up in everyone's mind right why do we need privacy it makes me think why did privacy deserve to be included in the first 10 amendments in the bill of rights yes when the whole purpose of that protocol was freedom and decentralization um and i have two answers one is political and one is psychological and i think maybe in the long run psychology is more important than politics but politically speaking or practically speaking when you lack privacy then you're vulnerable to the most powerful and least ethical actor around because they can extort and exploit anyone that they have that much information about and um and there's a weird thing that's hard for people to understand which is that it's also like the information about you that gets leaked or mined and stored up now makes you vulnerable to the most powerful political entity in 10 years right and a really horrible and vivid example of that is the way that during the holocaust jews that lived in countries that were really well organized countries with full databases of everyone's identity and location survived a lot less than jews that lived in countries where they weren't accounted for in a centralized database or computer and that's an example of where when that database or computer was set up by like the government of the netherlands before world war ii or whatever it didn't look dangerous because the government of the netherlands before world war ii was not that bad right but politically the leakage and accumulation of people's private information forms like a a lake of exploitable control over people that future rulers or future corporations can exploit so this is a negative externality yeah that's a really good point it's a negative externality which is economics jargon for something that harms society as a whole um even if it's not that big a deal to each individual person like toxic waste yeah it's like it's like pollution or toxic waste or something that threatens everyone at least in the long run uh even though it for any given person if you see some kind of pollution happening it's not it's not a um a crisis for you that day i don't know data accumulates right and it collects it aggregates um which we've seen just uncountable demonstrations that that aggregated data gets exploited by other actors than we originally anticipated right like cambridge analytica like so many us government databases like the office of personnel management was hacked by foreign enemies and their database of all of the operational and personal details of all usa national and military and contractors was extracted by some foreign enemy that is the kind of thing that that's a good example of what you call what you correctly call a negative externality where these accumulations of data about everyone um pose like a substantial risk to whole organizations and whole societies because we can't control going forward in the future what it'll be used for and by who so so privacy is important because it levels the playing field between the big and the powerful in you know the small and the less powerful down to kind of the individuals of this of society and what we're concerned about is when we have this toxic waste negative externality privacy leakage it's not just about the the potentially um evil actors centralized actors today but we also have to look in the future of who might be in power and control i'm also curious about this maybe a negative externality an effect on society is um you recently you know i've been talking about this term chilling effect on uh bankless a lot and you know this also has a legal definition as we've kind of come to understand but um imagine i'm trying to imagine kind of the the chilling effect if you know that you are being spied on uh potentially by corporate actors government actors all of the time foreign enemies foreign enemies all of the time and what will you not do as a result of that what will you stop doing as a result of that uh intrusion and as as a result of somebody looking in on you yeah and that's that was the second thing i i mentioned the psychological which i think in the long run is more important than the political is um people need to feel safe in order to be their authentic selves and people being their authentic selves is what we need in life both because that's moral that's that's human dignity and that's kind of the point why we're all here yeah yeah but also because that's necessary for a healthy thriving society it's necessary for democracy it's necessary for families and friendships and innovation and education and everything like we we need privacy and consent and freedom not just for the it's an externality again it's not just for the sake of the individual because to do otherwise is just evil and wrong but also because it's necessary for like national defense right it's it's necessary to survive um against internal and external threats and to thrive and grow instead of decaying and collapsing i think i want to just take a moment and really drive home this like negative externality thing and so from what i've gathered from this conversation is that um there's a lot of data out there and me as an individual i just don't really have the means or the capacity to like harvest it all it's out there for me i can go and get it maybe not all the data is out there for me like uh facebook has its own proprietary data google has its own proprietary data they own that but that's not all the data and so like the people that have the means to collect every bit of data that i leak out onto the internet like where i am on like sunday afternoons and the hobbies that i search and like the products that i buy and like all that information that i leak out to the internet it's like almost like accidentally like public information and the only people that can really commercialize that information are like well-capitalized highly centralized who have a lot of power and they have centralized power they're centralized actors with a lot of power and i'm guessing that like the only there's more like ways to do things with that information that i dislike than what i like and so there's more ways to manipulate me than there are to benefit me and so like my brain's trying to wrap around like okay all this data is out in the world why does it tend towards evil that it's out there like why does it tend towards bad and i think it's just because of that answer is that like if everyone's leaking all of their data there's more ways to do bad with it than there are to do good with it and then perhaps bad is like um manipulate manipulate you into like buying something or manipulate you into like voting in some particular way and like um that's my gut take but i'm wondering if zuko if you could kind of help me like define and parametrize this like why does us leaking all of our data fall into the negative territory more than the neutral or positive territory one answer has something to do again with consent and dignity that when people have control over what they share then they can exercise their unique human ability to change themselves the other answer is who has that copies of all that data and the the money and the sophistication to use it take advantage of it and like you say that's big centralized entities and big centralized entities they have money and the main best predictor of what's going to happen is that they're going to try to make more money and again that can have catastrophic effects on the rest of us as we saw many times throughout the 20th century um i think um i want to hear what you're going to say but i'll cue something up for after go on yeah um and this this idea of consent i think is really important and very much is aligned with this ethos of cryptography where cryptography puts power into the hands of the defender and if instead of google like automatically getting all of your data google has to have to has to ask you for permission it's like hey i would like to know this information about you please all of a sudden like all of that power that google would have accrued and all that money that google would have made or all of that power that the authoritarian regime would have accrued all of a sudden that goes into the spreads out and decentralizes into the hands of the individuals yeah because instead of accruing and centralizing in one central focal point like it's if they have to ask you for permission it's like hey do you like this product or do you like this leader they have to ask you for permission and all of a sudden it goes from being siloed and concentrated to dispersed and decentralized yeah i really like this idea because we said that 25 30 years ago the only business model that worked for the new breakthrough technology of the internet was this centralizing business model in which some central party prof makes all the profit uh and everyone else gets services for free in return for somebody making all the profit and that seems to inevitably lead to increasing concentration of power and money in a small number of actors and like we said it seems to me pretty inevitable that it will lead to the centralized powerful actor benefiting even when it is harmful to a lot of the users right well what's really interesting to me is what if the user is profited like there's an alternative path where 25 30 years ago we had cryptocurrency or something like it we had the ability for the profit that's pouring out of this machine to go back at least partially to the people that are the source of it and so it would be a very different evolutionary path right one thing that i'm really thinking about a lot is the development of ai so as we all know it's reached quite an inflection point right in the last couple of years after decades and decades of development and you can clearly look back especially if you're as old as i am to sort of the origin of the worldwide web there's a client which is a web browser which is really uh it was kind of sophisticated for its time that it could take these like html files and display useful information on the screen for you right and then the other end of it there was a web server and that was really pretty simple for its time like it would just look up the file you wanted and send you a copy of it right and now we can really see over what what happened because of the surveillance capitalism business model is that the server side of that had an evolutionary pressure to grow into an ai and so now what we have today is you've still got the web browser today is not a lot different than the web browser was in 1997 right it just it serves its user in a very simplistic way but the other end of that connection is owned by google or facebook or whoever and it has seen this tremendous exponential growth and complexity over the last 25 years which we think which i think is now reaching an affliction point and what this means for society i think for now is that the surveillance capitalism and the surveillance government that grew for the first time ever in human history over the last 20 or 25 years is about to transform into a surveillance and control system or it's already in there it's already starting like with cambridge analytica and things like that that once you have like what we didn't have before the internet was the ability to scale up surveillance so there were these totalitarian regimes like the statsy of east germany that did their best to like hire every other citizen to spy on and inform on every other citizen or whatever and so they had dossiers and filing cabinets and warehouses full of spy material on all their citizens but that was nothing that was like totally not scalable right that was nothing like what has spontaneously evolved to the last 25 years but we still haven't seen the next biggest effect of this which is once you have an ai in the centralized center that has all that information about people and that i ai can exercise control and it's already started by exercising control or influence over what people are able to read or what people do read right or or what what voices they hear even among their friends which of your friends do you know what's going on with them that's largely controlled by an ai at least for most people i don't know about you guys um and you know which of your friends are you losing touch with that's largely for most people controlled by an ai and i i feel like we're probably at an inflection point where those centralized ais are going to have increasing like number of levers over people's lives which again the chinese communist party has been pioneering by making it so that the citizens who the ai frowns upon find themselves unable to check into hotels anymore unable to board trains anymore and that that kind of extension of the the fingers of the ai into our lives is likely to accelerate the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and

peter tells teals thing where he says it's just ai and cryptocurrency ai is a centralizing force and cryptocurrency is a decentralizing force and these are the two uh opposing forces kind of like a ying and a yang and the the idea being that like cryptocurrency as david was saying or crypto cryptography is power back to the people the individual it's decentralized by nature whereas a technology like ai what does it need needs centralization needs massive data sets right and that is uh by necessity going to require centralization and i i think we are in this world and the water we're swimming in right now is like this world where um ais have the upper hand you know centralized data providers have the upper hand that that is what the internet is today and the reason at least one probably the big reason i'm in crypto is because i think cryptography writ large and then cryptocurrency is a subset of that is the only chance we actually have in a digital world in a in a world where uh increasingly as a society as the world's entering the metaverse it is the only chance we have to embed some of the ideas written down in the 1700s by the framers of the constitution it's like the only shot we got because if we just continue on our current trajectory towards ai centralization what we'll feel is what we've been feeling is gradual erosion of all of these rights we used to have and we won't even notice and so new generations will just be born into this environment without even knowing uh like the prior possibilities so that's my worry and i think uh yeah i wonder if that resonates with you ai versus cryptography these are the two polls i hadn't really heard it before um i immediately disagree from uh like a science and engineering perspective that's that's my background is like writing code and algorithms and papers and stuff um so i immediately think it's an accident of history that the ais are under the control of the corporations and that they're centralized it's not information theoretic or computer science necessity if if the economics were different so that because remember the story about the evolutionary pressure caused the server side of the web connection to grow into an ai and that's a centralized thing um but if the economics were different the client side of the web connection could have grown into an ai um there's a concept from albert wenger venture capitalist from union square ventures a few years ago he said in in well-governed societies with the rule of law we have a really important right which is the right to a lawyer the right to be represented by a lawyer right if you're engaged in especially a criminal proceeding but in a lot of conditions you have rights but you are not competent to understand and exercise your rights without a professional's help who does understand those and can help you exercise your rights so that's an important part of american society in particular is that you have a right to be represented by a lawyer for cases like that and what albert wenger says and i really resonates with me is in the future we need to have a right enshrined in our legal system and in our society to be represented by an ai because like david was saying earlier what if the ai that is overseeing a billion facebook users at once wants some information from me or wants to strike a deal what if it had to ask me well that's fine but i don't have the time or the expertise to negotiate with the facebook 1 billion unit ai right as a as a as an average human any more than i have the ability to go into a court proceeding and represent myself and and know all the relevant law and how to how to handle the situation so we should what we should have to contour if peter thiel's thesis that you told me is if you as a human are dealing with an ai that's loyal to someone else to some other entity or organization corporation or government or whatever you should have the right to have the ai loyal to you represent you in that relationship there's a really important thing in in american and other like well-organized rule of law countries about the lawyer client relationship which is that the a lawyer has to have a duty of loyalty to the client right and that means a couple things one it means you can't have any conflicts of interest of any kind if you're depending on a lawyer to represent your interest in an illegal matter it's a a totally disallowed situation which everyone in our society is very vigilant about works very hard to make sure that lawyer doesn't have any side deals with anyone else involved in your situation right he has to represent you and only you and he has a strong duty to do his best to represent you well and so forth should be the same with an ai it's it just strikes me as wrong for the same reason that you don't go into a legal proceeding and agree that someone else's lawyer is going to represent you right like the other side or some third party that's not okay in our society for a really good reason it evolved that way over hundreds of years right and similarly if you like if you're trying to live your life which friends are you gonna stay in touch with with over the years which friends you gonna lose touch with i don't think that should be i don't think we need to rewind to the pre-ai era like i'm sorry if i'm rambling but there's a big difference between before and after facebook and then later twitter changed the information feed from timeline temporal to ai mediated you remember this yes and so if you have these conversations with regular people there's a false alternative that facebook and you know the surveillance capitalism corporations of the world can offer them which is okay well do you want our ai to manage your social life and your education and your values and your political input and everything for you or do you want to go back to doing everything yourself and that's a false alternative right the only valid alternative that matches human values and american political values is that you have an ai that helps you manage your social life and your political input and your education and everything that's a really subtle but important point what you're saying is it's not that the ai is bad or corruption prone or like that's like what you're saying is the problem is what we have right now is regular individuals don't have access or control over the ai it's not on their team it's only on the side of large powerful people and entities and the ai is not working for individuals there's no equal playing field here right computers we don't started beating humans long ago yeah and so we nobody it's not plausible to like go back to the pre-computer era right let's just start doing everything by hand or even to go back to the era where you you didn't rely on an ai you already rely on an ai for your social feeds and your scheduling and your email composing and lots of stuff right um but like you say the problem is the the question of loyalty to whom is the ai loyal who whom does it serve and zuko uh this was a fun rabbit hole that i didn't expect to uh to go down and i kind of want to like go all the way back so we went pretty far into the future maybe maybe not that far into the future maybe just five years into the future god forbid um but i actually would like to go back to like the crypto wars of like the 80s and 90s which is kind of i think where you got a lot of your beginnings and i'm wondering if like this feud this comment this very futurist conversation that we're having right now of just like making sure that the uh power goes go to goes to the individual making sure that we're in like you know keeping things um emphasizing consent over exploitation was some of the conversations that we're having now these very futurist conversations like predictable back then back when in the early crypto wars of the 90s and what kind of what was it like to be like a cipher a pre-bitcoin cypherpunk having some of these i'm assuming similar conversations yeah i've been having like deja vu um this morning some people from my team at the ecc electric coin company reported back to me that they'd had some a meeting with some high level usa uh what's the word politicians officials whatever so government types and based on what they reported back i started reviewing what i know about the biden executive order about crypto which really seemed to be mostly about cbdc to me and i started thinking you know what i don't know if i'm just getting old and old people like always relive their childhood or whatever but cbdc equals the clipper chip and so it was funny to me that you brought that up at the beginning of this conversation you were like is it like the clipper chip that's exactly what i was thinking this morning cbdc it so for people who don't know in the 1990s the internet came out and the world wide web by tim berners-lee and it was a revolution because it allowed everyone on well everyone on the internet to communicate with everyone else on the internet directly and that led to a exponential takeoff in people being able to benefit themselves like improve themselves improve each other cooperate on more and more sophisticated projects and so the internet changed everything for for the better largely um and if you're if you were born after the year 2000 you assume it which is always like that but um at that time there was uh this is called crypto wars one and uh i was merely a foot soldier in crypto wars one i like sat up my keyboard in my dorm room typing crypto code in order to perform like civil disobedience or empower people with tools which they could uh use under their own consent but crypto wars one involved some factions of the us government not the us government as a coherent entity it's not a coherent entity right it's like a a hundred headed hundred armed monster and none of the arms are coordinated with any other arms i'm telling you um well the biden executive order was mostly about cbdc and it was mostly about ordering the other 99 arms to start cooperating with each other so we'll see how that works but um the same thing i felt in the 1990s for people who don't know was that the a certain faction of the us government that basically turned out to be orchestrated by the nsa although at that time the nsa was very secretive and very strategic about it and so they used the vice president al gore and the fbi as like their front men and that faction had this intention the strategy which is okay the world is going to get an internet the internet's totally taken off here in 1996 or whatever year this was um but we're going to arrange so that everyone in the world can use the internet they can all talk to each other but the nsa has a back door into everyone's computer and can read or control what everyone says on the internet that was their plan and it was called the clipper chip and so there was going to be a law that if you make a device like you know a tv a router a phone whatever device a computer yeah uh pc whatever devices they had back in the 1990s if it's the kind of device that can connect to the internet then it has to have a clipper chip built into it in order to give uh the nsa control over the internet that was the plan and um there was it was really interesting there was civil disobedience from activists like the cypherpunks there was policy debates and policy battles both in open and behind behind closed doors in washington dc then there was the fact that they bungled it the clipper chip was flawed so the protocol didn't work and a cypherpunk activist scientist named matt blaze investigated how the clipper chip worked and pointed out that it didn't work as advertised even if they had gotten it deployed um and then i think so there's different stories right so one one story that people like to tell is that the heroic civil rights activists won by disobedience and there's a lot to that especially i think it's a story that's not told as widely as it should be um but there was a generation of cryptographers these are mathematicians right they're like computer scientists mathematicians they mostly work in universities and they're a generation older than me they were the people i looked up to when i was a kid and these folks correctly saw that the nsa was attempting to um seize the new public key cryptography that came out in those decades and nationalize it make it into a national secret and they uh and i will say i will enter i want to interject really really quick here uh i'm reading this book zuko called uh the code book and this is a pattern throughout history of somebody in like some private individual creates like a new breakthrough in cryptography and as soon as the local government discovers it they like snatch it and hide it and keep it from themselves as a national secret this was this is not just like something that happened with the nsa this happened in the in britain in the 1800s this happened in france in the 1700s like whatever nation state discovers one of their citizens made some cryptography breakthrough breakthrough they take it and steal it and cover it up yeah absolutely the most important cryptography breakthrough ever in all of human history was public key cryptography which was discovered in the 1970s by uh diffy and hellman raveshmir nadelman and they correct those five and others including david chong who you mentioned who you had on your podcast recently correctly detected the nsa attempting to hide to take over this new discovery and hide it from the world and keep it for their own sake and those fi those six and others like them ralph merkel and others performed an act of courageous civil disobedience it took personal risks to defy the united states military and publish this new scientific breakthrough before they could hide it and nationalize it and if they hadn't done that we wouldn't have an internet you can't have the internet without public key cryptography i just say just pause and say how badass is that let's just pause and appreciate that that's badass yeah those guys are heroes absolutely those folks they weren't all men um so the lesson i'm trying to draw from crypto wars one it was a long drawn out thing so that that was crypto war zero in the 1970s and early 80s when the nsa attempted to hide the existence of public key cryptography and courageous civil disobedience won crypto war zero because all they had to do was defy this attempt and publish it to the world so it became part of humankind's shared legacy of science public key cryptography cryptography did there's a really cool story that they enlisted the uh the puzzles and games columnist for scientific american magazine his name was martin gardner and they contacted him and said hey you write a puzzles and games column every month in scientific american magazine on the back page and we really need you to publish this this month instead of what you were planning to publish and he did it that was one of the ways that we got public key cryptography as part of humankind's legacy instead of a national secret and by the way you said in the book you've been reading the code book this has happened many times it actually happened to public key cryptography only a few years earlier public key cryptography had been discovered independently by some british mathematicians and the british government nationalized it kept it a secret did nothing with it right it just would it reminds me of indiana jones and the rate of the lost ark when they have like the artifact and then at the end of the movie they just push it on a trolley into the warehouse with all the other artifacts that they're never going to get around to that's what the british government did with public cryptography a few years before diffient helmet independently rediscovered it i did not know that okay so so we've got the crypto wars uh zero we were talking about and the crypto wars one with the clipper chip now you're saying you're having deja vu so we've got maybe the beginning of crypto wars 2 that is emerging and of course we've got now uh open source developers potentially in jail we've got um ofac banning tornado cash addresses so we've got some of that going on but how does this link to the cdbc why is that like the clipper chip um my imagination that i just started thinking about this morning so it's funny that you asked you compared clipper chip to cbdc today it's the same kind of vision that okay we're going to have decentralized economic fabric like i think the government is not the government as a whole there's no government as a whole it's just a hundred different organizations competing with each other but a lot of elements of a lot of different governments around the world are gradually coming to terms with the new technology being a real thing and being important and um and that they have to think about it deal with it and then like with the internet in the 1990s it sounds to like the whole concept of cbdc sounds to me like okay we will have a decentralized global economic fabric but everyone around the globe will be vulnerable to us having like a back door into everything they do that sounds like the clipper ship to me so you're skeptical that we'd ever have any real privacy on a cdbc that didn't have some sort of backdoor uh i wonder if there's different cbdc's operated by different governments that might have different policies around that um it's kind of depressing to me not to get back into politics but i'm gonna get back into politics it's kind of depressing to me that a lot of u.s public discussion public discourse and national government policy kind of seems to be aping the chinese communist party like oh look at those guys they're doing so great let's try that um i don't think that's a good strategy for america our and the reason i'm thinking about this is the chinese communist party has got exactly this model in the digital wan which is that users have privacy and autonomy from one another but all of the users are simultaneously subject to the control of the chinese communist party and it's distressing i hope i'm just wrong i hope this is just i don't know what i'm talking about but it's distressing to imagine that u.s society and u.s government emulate anything like that both because it's a violation of our principles and our values as a people but also because it's a losing strategy we're not going to out ccp the ccp what our comparative advantage is as america as a as a society and a nation is freedom and decentralization that's what makes american government different from other governments and that's what makes american industry different and better than all other industries including the chinese industry so you asked do i see a cdbc having privacy i don't know i don't see the united states producing a cbdc anytime soon like the clipper chip never shipped right that might be into his defective that might be one of the biggest factors and it was a a loser in the marketplace um people did not buy it yeah what's interesting is and it remains to be seen what what uh you know china's gonna do with its um digital one but um yeah i i would echo what you just said uh of it seems to be the us's policy these days to pursue some strategy of half-assed authoritarianism as we've called it before which is like it's neither good freedom nor is it good authoritarianism right like china is like doing far better so we got to pick a lane and stay in it um but right now i think that the hope is as it has been in the past with the advent of the internet is kind of the uh the non-public sector it's citizens and entrepreneurs and cryptographers and mathematicians coming up with these privacy solutions not only for the u.s but as an export for the world as we did with public key cryptography as we did with the internet but i gotta say um it feels like we haven't made that much progress in uh crypto on privacy maybe not as much as we would have liked and feel free to disagree here zuko but like we've got the top two cryptocurrencies right now we've got bitcoin of course which is just it's it's use cases store value and transaction we have ethereum which is more smart contracts none of those are privacy by default okay and then some of our privacy-centric coins like monero and zcash don't yet have the utility nor um the use and the statu and the saturation to kind of get us where we need to be in crypto so private crypto is still a small sliver and i'm wondering if a you're disappointed by this and b why you think this is why haven't we made privacy baked it in by default it's a good question to in both of your questions to answer it let me tell you a story once upon a time i was um a scientist and hacker and technologist and i ever since i'd worked with david chom before i worked with david chom i was reading his science papers um and it was what i thought was one of the most important things in life okay let me back up and tell an even longer story how much time do we got we got time when i was like 19 years old i had seen the fall of the berlin wall and the sudden unexpected dissolution of the soviet union and i had seen the internet appear out of thin air and then when i was 19 after i've seen those two things i discovered the science papers of david chom and how we could have cryptocurrency although at the time it didn't have decentralization it was centralized cryptocurrency and i thought these are the three things we need we need political freedom we need freedom of uh speech which is what the internet gives us and we need freedom to transact and to cooperate freedom of economic cooperation between people and with those three things humanity can take care of each other and improve each other and improve ourselves and innovate faster and faster from here on out and then that third one didn't work because we didn't yet we had not yet discovered decentralized cryptocurrency and um fast forwarding many years bitcoin came along and it was the first thing that actually achieved decentralization of money at least of digital money but it sacrificed privacy for a technical reason um the satoshi and hell finny and everyone else who had anything to do with contributing to bitcoin throughout the early days the early years considered freedom from central bank control or manipulation of the economy and freedom from centralized powers control and manipulation of people's private decisions to be hand-in-hand those are those are the reasons for bitcoin so privacy in the sense of censorship resistance and freedom was baked into the bitcoin culture from the beginning but they or we and as much as i helped a little failed at the execution because we didn't have the technology then and satoshi knew that they had a conversation in 2010 i think where they said could we use zero knowledge proofs these newfangled scientific discovery of zero knowledge proofs to fix our privacy problem in bitcoin and what satoshi said about it i think is really telling because it was about it goes back to what you were asking about uh use cases and usage levels and utility what satoshi said about it was if we could do this if we could use your knowledge proofs to fix the privacy problem in bitcoin we could have a much more usable easier version of bitcoin something like that was how he put it and it turned out in 2010 when they had that conversation they couldn't because your knowledge proofs were still in their infancy and four months after that conversation satoshi disappeared from the internet forever and then about three years after that some scientists found ways to do zero knowledge proofs that were sufficiently better that they were practical so around 2013. so then one of those scientists called me and said we figured out and i had already read their papers they're really good papers and they said we figured out the science concept of how you could combine decentralized digital money like bitcoin with end-to-end encryption like the signal instant messenger or whatever and it requires this latest breakthrough in zero knowledge proofs that scientists have just discovered and we want you to like productize it and scale it up and make it industrial strength so that people can actually use it around the world and at that moment i said no because of what you're asking me about ryan which is i thought well bitcoin has a head start this is like 2014 i think we had this conversation maybe early 2015. bitcoin has a head start and bitcoin can be the mainstream thing that everyone uses for all of their payments and store value and whatever accounting and things and so if i work on this new thing it would only be a niche thing it would be a minority number of users like you're saying right and then i slept on it that night and i called them back the next day because having slept on it i realized no wait bitcoin can't be the mainstream thing something that leaks your information to everyone including your enemies and your competitors and foreign armies that are trying to destabilize your society and hackers and thieves and so on that cannot be the mainstream thing that everyone can use for payments no it's going to require built-in privacy in order to be the mainstream thing and that's why i committed to working on z cash ever since zuko i'm reminded of a conversation that we had with uh mark andreessen who talked about the advertising model of the internet and how that set the internet off on a particular path that you know after a butterfly flaps its wings creates this like accidental like semi-dystopia that we currently live in now where all of our data is gone and also productized and commercialized by google and facebook et cetera and also cambridge analytica that forces elections um i'm now worried about like are we recreating history with our blockchains where bitcoin uh transparent by default ethereum number two transparent by default uh are we accidentally kind of doing the same thing that's a really uh where we have like our number our number one and two market cap blockchains with the most activity are transparent by default uh are we accidentally falling down and you're saying david that's like what if we're right about crypto and it's so successful 10 years from now 15 years from now cool crypto wins but we don't have privacy by default and we've created some other panopticon like oops right another a brand new problem yeah yeah i do worry about that that's what we'll put i um i guess one question i have for you zuko is there is um another idea out there that the crypto experiment would not have gotten nearly this far if privacy was on by default it's kind of like the idea i think from uh people who've been bearish on crypto all along with this common sentiment is now the government's not going to let you do that governments around the world do not want people to have a non-sovereign money okay they'll just take something like gold during a sovereign a self-sovereign money a self-sovereign money let's say yeah using the term non-sovereign to mean like not state controlled money so let's use the term self-sovereign money um and so you either get yourself sovereign money or you get privacy you can only pick one and that's essentially i haven't heard this it sounds like a rationalization from someone with heavy bags well you know what do you think about that though so what i think though yeah go ahead so that's my instinctive reaction sounds like rationalization we see a lot of that um but um i mean rationalization but what i think about it is yes there has been this discussion discourse debate public negotiation between the u.s different arms of the u.s government in particular um and the crypto industry and yes the crypto industry did a thing which i don't think they should have and i advise them against um and they didn't listen to me uh which is they said oh don't worry us government you don't or dif this and that arm fencing offac whoever don't worry because this blockchain thing is all 100 transparent so you can see everything all the time and i disagree with that because i think it's both an immoral and a doomed society to live in but also because the these specific arms of the us government and the same is true of other governments and other arms of other governments and everything they don't want everyone to be able to see everything all the time right they want what the chinese communist party is pioneering where only they can see everyone else but no one can see them and bitcoin and ethereum don't give that so there's actually a real deep contradiction which i still wonder at what stage if ever the us government arms sort of digest this and think it through which is you really do suppose you are responsible for counterterrorism national security against madmen with nukes uh or whatever lawn you're enforcing different laws or you have other mandates so consumer protection investor protection child protection health care information protection whatever your mandate is at some point you're going to realize it's totally not okay for the american citizens that i'm responsible for to broadcast their information to north korea or to russian hackers that's a bigger national security issue right so that's that's one of the two reasons why i really didn't like the way the crypto industry went over the last several years of emphasizing the the radical pervasive transparency of bitcoin and later ethereum as being a palliative or a a spoonful of sugar to take with your bitter pill or whatever because we said it in government because a it's a it's just wrong because none of us want our children to grow up in a dystopian and doomed society but b it's not compatible with the government's goals there are no government agencies there are laws the graham leach blighly law states that financial institutions in the united states are disallowed from sharing their customers financial information with anyone else absent a certain amount of informed consent and other regulatory safeguards well using bitcoin or ethereum does that it violates gram leach blindly and it violates the mandate of every other government regulator zuko is uh what you're building at zcash a solution for this it's not a solution for cccp style totalitarianism look elsewhere is a solution for ethereum and bitcoin and something internal to the crypto industry how can we leverage zero knowledge proofs to uh to solve this problem okay well i can go into tech details i love tech details like satoshi tried to figure out in 2010 and like other scientists not me later figured out you can use your knowledge proofs to put into end encryption together with blockchains so it's like we had an encryption starting with public key cryptography as we discussed in the 1970s and into end encryption was necessary for the internet to exist and to survive as it has and then satoshi discovered blockchains but we couldn't put the two together you had to pick one and then these other scientists discovered zero knowledge proofs and with that that's the glue or the third piece with which you can have indian decryption in blockchains at the same time and zcash was the first one to do that my engineering and science team pioneered it implemented it deployed it and that proved the reality of zero knowledge proofs which has led to this subsequent like mini industry of people finding out how to use zero knowledge proofs not only for privacy um but also for scalability and potentially for other things if we can figure it out does that answer your question at all also z uh it definitely does like okay so we have this cool new primitive uh zero knowledge proofs and they they've been used in the ethereum app layer for a little bit um but they're used in the z cash base layer right i'm wondering can you like paint a picture of the future that you would love to see for like the crypto industry as a whole like regardless of like is it ethereum is it bitcoin is it zcash like is is there a way to do all of our like defy things call it d5 where like i'm transacting with uniswap trading my tokens buying my nfts and i have all my privacy and how does a zero knowledge roll or how does a zk proof fit into this how do we have all the d5 that we know and love and have it be private that's a great question and i'm just toying with an inkling of a new answer in my own mind to this question so let me tell you what i started thinking about yesterday when i had a conversation uh with someone who's applying for a job at my company and um so this this could be half baked could be wrong but i'm kind of thinking you don't want pervasive privacy in d5 you want a lot of transparency in e5 again for social externality reasons right you want like if you think about what just happened with tara and celsius and all that that was because of the opacity of those centralized actors yeah it's true uh you want transparency for systemic stability and for this information to be available in order to make markets more efficient and make the economy work better so here's a thesis which is totally half baked i might have to eat my words how about we have transparent defy and shielded assets um and this is convenient because we already have a shielded asset which is zek which i'm totally focused on and committed to but my thesis my hypothesis here is you can take your shielded zac on the zcash blockchain and bridge it over into transparent world so now i want to trade it for tokens on define i want to buy and sell nfts and i want to lend it for interest and all that stuff and i still have privacy because there's no trace on the blockchain of where this thing came from it came out of private world entered transparent world and did the defy thing and under the control and only under the control and consent of its owner it can re-enter private world and go back to being a private asset but if the majority of our economic lives exist in d5 like say like 95 of our economic activities defy and then the remaining five percent is zcash aren't we still creating that same problem of externalities of data yeah that's a that's a great counter argument that's why that's why my idea is only half baked you might be right totally wrong so at a technical level there are a lot of technological efforts um sort of inspired by or standing on the shoulders of my team um to extend the zero knowledge technology to arbitrary smart contracts and arbitrary state machines and whatever all right they that takes a long time it takes five or ten years to make something that uh advanced that that far beyond the state of the art to bring it to maturity and get users and find out how users like it and all that stuff and they've been working on it for five years some of them so that stuff is about to come out um so at a technical level i'm glad it exists i'm proud of the fact that some of my team contributed to the early stages of the scientific discovery of those ideas and i'll be real interested to see how it hits the market and i'll be really eager to cooperate with those guys and get them to use the zek asset in their new platform or support the zac asset in their new platform however i'd also wonder even if that existed i don't 100 i don't maybe i don't have as enough experience in d5 as you do but like suppose we could wave our magic wands and there is shielded uni-swap all right and let's just assume it's got all the same things it works in the same metamask and wallet and whatever it's just as cheap it's just as fast it's just as well supported on all the websites there's two hurdles a liquidity nobody's going to move over to shielded unit swap because there's nobody in children you swap we're all going to stick with where we got liquidity right and in the part the party where everyone else is at nobody's going to the party where no one's at so that's a bootstrapping problem or a network effect problem but let's even say we may we have our magic wand and we somehow move everyone off of transparent unit stop into shielded uniswap is that good i'm not sure isn't there some advantages to unispot being transparent right i bet i bet there's a trade-off between uh privacy and stability of finance as you've alluded to this is why by the way tornado cash made so much sense is because it was kind of like you could just sort of mix some of your assets if if you wanted to and again i'm talking about from you know from a non-criminal user perspective of which david and i were formerly users pre-o fact sanction are not now current users uh because that is illegal for us to be current users but that was that was that was that was um uh very like that was the use case here and that like that's what made sense yeah i i do want to ask about zcash too because what's so cool about crypto is like so much of the the tech that we've seen in other ecosystems has been resting the zero knowledge tech has been resting on the shoulders of uh what what you guys have done what your team has done and it's amazing to see and now like there are other technologies that have emerged in other ecosystems that i'm curious as to whether the the zcash team and the zcash ecosystem might apply one of which is proof of stake of course which has matured quite a bit since since uh z cash has started and i'm curious your thoughts on temperature proof of stake the other is something really interesting that dave and i talk a lot about because we're excited about is roll-ups uh and this is using something like ethereum as sort of a subtle net settlement layer but you get to sort of retain your own sovereignty as a network or a lot of vestiges of your sovereignty but the benefit is you don't have to pay security fees essentially there's not issuance that's a minors you uh draw some of that security from from a network like ethereum so any thoughts on these two kind of technologies and the roadmap for zcash of course i know it's not up to you there's an entire community around this but like your take on proof of stake and your take on uh z cash becoming a roll up at some point in the future these possibilities okay let me take them one at a time proof of stake definitely um i thought of the idea of proof-of-stake before i heard anyone else mention it um back in the day you claiming first time no i think i later figured out i later like got out my calendar and i was like no there's a couple other people like sunny king um vlad zamfir maybe vitalik buterin um those those were probably before me but i hadn't yet heard from them so i thought of it independently which is common anyway i think it's a really good powerful idea from the perspective of information theory and like game theory i think it's it's way better uh in the long run and like you say it was so new back when we were launching zcash that's why we decided not to not to mess with it um we decided uh to innovate as little as possible and we had to innovate hard on zero knowledge proofs like you say that that process um did indeed like pave the way for a whole another frontier of human science and and entrepreneurship so i'm super proud of that thank you for noticing um but then we tried not to innovate on anything else if we could help it so that's why we stuck with the bitcoin a clone of the bitcoin consensus mechanism which was the like stupidest most battle tested thing around at the time the least innovative thing around on at that time which was that time being like 2015 2016. um and we've always said even before zcash launched in the fall of 2016 there was a faq an faq frequently asked questions wiki page someone put up that says is zcash proof of work and the answer says it's going to be launching as proof of work but maybe the zcash community would like to switch it to proof of stake or something else someday we don't know what they'll decide but we definitely support like ongoing evolution um so recently last year we at the electric coin company like you say we don't have unilateral control over the zcash protocol um just like bitcoin and ethereum it's too there's too many stakeholders who have their own independent control for us to push them around uh but we kind of took the temperature of the zcash community as a whole with some polls including an anonymous coin holders poll where uh people just anonymously voted using zero knowledge proofs with their zack on the network um but we took various kinds of like conversations polls surveys whatever and it was pretty clear that a substantial majority of the zcash community was totally into switching to proof of stake so based on that my company has prioritized figuring out how to do that um which since you guys are ethereum experts you're well aware that uh you know we met the ethereum folks before launch they hired us to do a security audit of ethereum before the first mainnet of ethereum and um pretty much ever since we've known them they've been talking about switching to proof of stake and it's always been like two years out it's been like seven years or so now i think it was supposed to come in 2017. what's that sometime in 2017 proof of stake was due that's what i recall oh right yeah theory sounds right um so it seems like a an awfully big challenge both technically and like socially and economically maybe even legally um to sweat to make the jump from four to proof of stake but that is the number one priority that my company has committed ourselves to mapping out for the zcash community based on the fact that it sounds like the zcash community would totally support it if we could find a path and of course seeing what happens to ethereum there's this nice little twitter exchange that i really like where i think it is 2017 when this happened when this exchange happened where um we're talk vitalik and i are talking on twitter and vitalik says switch z cash to proof of stake and i say i'm waiting for ethereum to go first and see what pulls up so that's still true and how about the second piece of this the idea of rollups oh that's a really interesting one i think there's a lot of power in it there's something that i don't i didn't understand just a mystery in my mind and maybe you can clear it up for me i like the thing that i've continually failed to understand even though some of my team were the original inventors of side chains and uh related things i still understand the difference between a side chain and a roll-up and a bridge and whatever else and i kind of suspect i'll give you a chance to answer but i kind of suspect there's a little bit of sort of just like uh social posturing like i want to be the alpha like i'm bigger and better than you are so i get to be the l1 and you have to be the l2 uh but i don't i'm not sure there's really a difference between an l1 and l2 but you said something that sounded like an answer but i didn't get it it was like one of them doesn't have to pay for security it gets it for free from the other one do you want to take a crack at this david yeah yeah so there's really no difference between a side chain as in like an avalanche there's a bridge between avalanche and ethereum right and so like avalanche is a side chain to ethereum vice versa if you go across like the the avalanche bros like no ethereum is a side chain it really just depends on your on your perspective but avalanche is not a layer too so we have arbitrary optimism and zk sync and and all these other layer twos that they like what ryan said they don't pay for security and so all they do is they're a blockchain that has this like cryptographic vow to ethereum this is cryptographic proof to ethereum and all they do is they bundle up their transactions and submit them down to the layer one like checkpoint uh and there's this like cryptographic uh bridge that's much much much stronger than a cross layer one bridge and so like it's one one is like kind of like a uh satellite state or a city state off of like the main that makes sense whereas like they don't have to pay getting to the like the the economic benefit is they don't have to pay for their own like nation state security if you will you know in the way that bitcoin has to pay miners to economically secure its transactions ethereum has to pay stakers if you're a roll-up ultimately you can settle either through pro fraud proofs or through zero knowledge cryptography you can kind of settle back to ethereum and so you don't have to issue your native currency in order to pay for security because you kind of get that out of the box right so yeah the only thing you have to pay for is the transaction fees on the layer one right uh and so like your proof-of-work costs or your proof-of-work stake rewards are zero yeah that doesn't sound good to me um because and this is another half-baked thing i hope your audience enjoys seeing i mean i say random stuff that turns out to be wrong um they're used to it we have david and i as the hosts here yeah yeah there's an idea in there it sounds like to me there's a belief or an assumption in there that i am skeptical of and that is that the consensus rules of bitcoin and ethereum combined with the market cap and the issuance and the economics of bitcoin and ethereum are necessary and sufficient to defend against attacks even big attacks like the government of china decides to shut you down globally or whatever i don't think i agree with that i don't think consensus rules and economics are either necessary or sufficient i think it's actually the social layer of the asset holders being willing and able to fork in order to defend against attacks and that leaves me with a question well then what's the point of mining rewards and what's the point of staking rewards i'm not 100 sure i don't think it's necessary or effective to actually give security the way everyone always talks about it i don't think higher hash power like if you have 10x as much hash power i don't think that makes you 10x is more secure if you have 1x as much hash power i think there's a mystery there um so i'm skeptical about that part and so that when you say yeah the l2s get this value for free this makes me immediately wonder about two things one is what are they actually getting because i really don't understand where the security comes from if right anywhere but also if they're getting it for free aren't they free writers and shouldn't everyone else like kick them off and stop giving them stuff for free i don't know it's confusing but the final thing which is kind of motivating for me as a thought leader within the zcash community is that's a platform play uh ethereum polka dot avalanche solana and probably a bunch more those are all the offer where build on our platform you become dependent right you cannot do anything without our platform but you get all these advantages now you get all the benefits of our platform for free and my instinct as just one member of the zcash community but i really like the alternative not to start a fight but i mean actually to start a fight if you guys want to argue the alternative of cosmos which is you retain full self-sovereignty there is nothing that you can't do for your like your community can elect to change any of the pieces and your thing still runs you're not dependent on anyone else yeah yeah these uh these are the what we call the crypto wars the l1 wars the other crypto worse i have talked to to the cosmos people and while the uh the like sovereign app chain like idea uh is like kind of where cosmos is now like ultimately the long-term conclusion of the cosmos vision and the ethereum vision ends up at the same spot but we will have to save that uh for our cosmos episode which we have with uh sunny and uh zaki coming up in a few weeks um yeah that you you've opened up a can of worms there zuko and uh i'd actually like it if you kind of stuck to the privacy thing focusing on privacy and there's too many people doing the layer one wars on crypto twitter yeah the only reason it came up was ryan's question about the future of z cash and that really is important to privacy no these are all the right questions yeah so can we uh as we kind of uh maybe draw this to a close zuko this has been a you know a fantastic episode and i i think um the big macro worry here is that like look what if we're building if we build without privacy what if we are like building the next surveillance panopticon right and like this is kind of a worry that um i think we have uh we're also worried that maybe nation states don't like privacy and this is on the back of um you know the recent ofac sanctions and such and and yet zcash is still legal which is which is nice i can go use z cash i can't use tornado cash uh as an american you can get your zek on coinbase and gemini and kraken in the united states exactly which is good that like that that's a plus and maybe this speaks to by the way that kind of the hydra like nature or the like multi-headed nature of of government agencies where one area of the government will say no you can't do this and another 60 areas of the government will say hey that's fine this is a basic you know uh american liberty um yeah like the office of foreign asset control is a very specific part of the us government right you should not anticipate that it's coordinated or representative of any other part of the us government right and i think that's the thing but like like i guess zooming out what we really want zuko is we want some level of privacy just like we have it on kind of the internet where we have encrypted uh the ability to encrypt our communications there's http and there's https there's ssl on the internet right and so you can have a transparent option or you can have a private option are you optimistic that we will get there with cryptocurrency having spent years in this space and if so what is the best best path towards getting there yeah i'm optimistic because i think this is the lesson from the previous crypto awards not the l1s not the public key cryptography civil disobedience in the 1970s but the attempt by the us government to ban effectively to ban the internet for being a secure thing and to institute their own u.s government backdoor alternative to the internet in the 1990s and my lesson i draw from it is they the the faction of the us government that was arguing for that which included al gore the vice president and the fbi but was secretly led by the nsa they gave up when the internet started being used to buy books on this new website called amazon.com and you know people's parents started emailing their kids and things like that like that made it clear that this is too important to the economy and to our lives uh to keep trying to delay it or prevent it or take it over and so i think it is possible to have a flourishing global billions and billions of users alternative to the the current high bound corrupt decaying economic system and you ask how to get there and the answer is make it usable and understandable and fun and easy for normal people that's the move there you go that is the move that is the road map uh it's utility bringing more value to the masses and i think absolutely that's what we've got to accomplish this decade in order to get out on the other side and uh have a private crypto and have a private digital currency for that matter zuko i think we can have a world that's safe for our children absolutely the end goal zuko thank you so much for for joining us we appreciate you thanks so much action items for you bankless nation david did this real quick right before the show is he tried out z cash and so he went out i think on gemini some exchange he purchased some zek he set up a uh wallet a zeck wallet and uh did a shielded transaction he's got that on his mobile phone you guys should experi it is uh zuko this is the first layer one crypto asset that i have ever purchased after buying ethereum for the first time in like 2017. i have not bought it but you have a single layer purchased bitcoin since 2017 david what no of course not oh my god i've i've purchased wbtc on aetherium but not but actually it was shorter okay wow david exposing his uh portfolio for us on the show but anyway go try that out try out
