[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david i know i say this at the front of every episode how to front run the opportunity it's literally what we say in the intro every single time i feel like this episode truly is front running the opportunity i know that because if you listen to episode number 28 with our guest vance spencer that was truly a time to front run the opportunity in d5 and eat if you listen to him even earlier it would have been even better and now here again is a fantastic episode and an opportunity for bankless listeners those who are about that life the crypto natives in this space to get ahead of the massive monumental shift that is happening in the global money system super exciting man i love this episode yeah we are bringing van spencer back onto the podcast more or less because he got things right um we had him on it nine months ago episode 28 the bowl case for defy it was one of bankless's really big first big episodes and the van spencer he held the number one spot for the most downloaded episode for i think the longest time in banquet's podcast history people really really liked that episode and basically because he predicted everything that he said more or less came true or is in the process of becoming true so we're bringing him on nine months later to get an update as to how his mental models have updated where he's shifted where his focus is now uh because you know if we talk to one person who got it right one time he's probably gonna get it right again uh and overall vance you can tell van spencer comes from a place of first principles and he he has a very thesis driven mentality about the space and that's why he can talk a little bit about everything right we talked about d5 we talked about dows we talked about l2s we talked about enterprise blockchain and rollups in and mev and he's got a take for everything and every single thing is interesting uh and so we wanted to bring advanced back on the podcast to give him another shot to get an episode back into the number one download episode of the vancouver's podcast that's a little bit has been overtaken by vitalik and justin drake and a few others uh and it is a little bit harder these days but uh i i think he can do it and guys if you like van spencer and you like talking about defy we are also bringing vance back on to a panel and ask me anything panel this coming wednesday so this podcast is coming out on monday maybe you're listening to it on monday or tuesday we have van spencer spencer noon in santiago santos on a defy eating the banks panel this wednesday at 1 pm at pst so mark that on your calendars we are going to put vance in with the other like big big brain defy thinkers and just talk about what it means to be a part of defy and do we really even need banks anymore these days and so you know make sure you watch that when it comes time that is on that's going to be on youtube so go to bankless youtube uh and and find that i think you could you should be able to set a reminder for that event we'll have it in the show notes and there'll be an event up yeah so i mean look the big monumental shift this time last time we had vance on it was all about like d5 tokenization and d5 summer i feel like this time it's all about layer two layer two is gonna be absolutely massive for crypto in this space and so we spent a lot of time unpacking what layer two actually means and and playing that out in real time what it means for other competing ethkiller layer ones what it means for users in the space what it unlocks as far as new applications so the focus is really on on layer two and trying to play that out is where you're gonna find the opportunities and vance said some things that are like kind of contrarian i mean when's the last time you heard someone talk about in d5 enterprise blockchain right or like the verticalization the fintech layer of d5 like these are some topics that seem controversial at the time and like don't seem to fit at the time but um i remember thinking the fact that they're coming out of left field means that vance is paying attention to them for some reason it's interesting because i remember thinking about that at the time when he was bullish in like 2017 2018 in particular 2018 on chain link right and um you know at a time when all tokens were kind of dead or dying and uh that turned into a really good call also synthetics you know so anyway listen to this podcast listen to this episode definitely a way to to front run the opportunity that is coming we want to thank the sponsors that made this bankless episode possible before we get into it here they are bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com okay bankless nation we are super excited to have vance spencer back on the program vance is the co-founder of framework ventures framework and vance have been really pioneers in establishing a crypto native venture fund that's why we had him on the first time back in august he's got these incredible methods of discovering alpha particularly in d5 and applying a really unique investment thesis i think the thesis is getting active in protocols actually using them investing in crypto native founders we did this monster episode with vance back in august of 2020. it's episode number 28. if you want to go back and listen to it i recently listened to it well worth it holds up guys it's one of the episodes it was our number one episode for a really long time it was our first gangbuster episode and i remember saying after this episode like just tweeting is like 90 minutes of listening but you got one million dollars worth of value at least depending on what you did with the knowledge uh so we've got to bring vance back for an update it's been nine months later vance welcome back to bankless how you doing sir doing great yeah it's been too long thanks for having me back what have you been up to man i know you haven't been busy at all just chilling what have i been up to um you know raised the second fund for framework kind of saw the thesis gradually play out in the first fund um have kind of doubled down on being super active you know just being kind of on chain in all shapes and forms um and uh and just being good stewards of the protocols that we support and just trying to push the space forward but you know through the pandemic defect really didn't take a break or stop at all and so it's been you know non-stop for you know almost since we last spoke are you feeling like things have accelerated even more since we last spoke because we were just coming off of uh d5 summer we're at like the tail end of it we didn't know at the time but august 2020 was sort of the tail end of what we now call d5 summer have things accelerated since then definitely i would say the progress and define crypto is not super linear we kind of like kind of progress to the point where we kind of bump up against the limitations of you know the base layers or kind of the infrastructure or the tooling or even kind of the level of developer talent in the space but um it feels like you know we've had kind of that expansion from d by summer we had like a little bit of a defy winter we kind of even led the way forward with you know more tbl things like derivatives things like um you know layer twos that are now kind of coming to fruition and it feels like we're now kind of about to realize that max step change um in terms of just usability and functionality and just usefulness um as these things launch like arbitrarium and optimism and you know zk saying so it's it feels like we're about to enter another exponential period of growth of the space okay van so we're going to ask you about that second exponential period of growth because at the end of the august 2020 episode we asked for your predictions uh and uh you're one of the few guests who's just like yep here are my predictions like no hedging like these are the numbers anyway i i want to just recap for folks who haven't listened to that um but basically at the time this was august 2020 at the time we asked hey vance during the next bull cycle which we think we're entering into the next 24 months what's the total locked value of d5 going to look like at the time it was 8 billion something like that total octavian you said it was going to hit 100 to five hundred billion total locked value and i think uh david and mai's head almost exploded when you said that but here we are less than a year later and we're at 88 billion total locked value so like creeping up to your bottom bound uh a hundred billion and you also said ethan bitcoin might get into the trillions trillions plural uh eth was at 40 billion when we recorded that it's now at four it's gotten as high as 480 billion so a nice little 10x there not quite the trillions uh bitcoin did hit trillion dollar bitcoin so we had like 1.1 trillion or so at the time bitcoin was 200 billion so we're getting close to your estimates vance uh which like seemed pretty heady i would say seemed pretty incredible uh nine months ago maybe not so incredible now and i say all this to like i guess maybe tee up your credibility that that that you're not afraid to make big bold predictions and uh to invest with conviction on those on those predictions but i also say this because i want you to be ready vance at the end of this episode we're gonna ask you those same questions we want more predictions give us more predictions so i want you to be ready for the predictions at the end don't give them now you know let's build the suspense let's talk about some deeper topics but be ready sir you gonna be ready i'm ready of course all right well let's talk first about this drawdown because uh recently there have been 11 days in maine in may where we saw 60 percent some odd drawdown 70 plus in some uh d5 assets um 66 i think maybe more uh down in eth bitcoin's been slumping some people are saying this is the end of the bull run so we might not hit those heady predictions uh that that that you're thinking of um earlier so like what's your take on that is this the end of the bull run is this a pause are we doing something else here um i i don't think it's the end of the bull run at all and and like i kind of have trouble defining what like a bull run is in crypto i think there's a bull run kind of at any given time in any place um you know bitcoin has probably a 10 or 20 year adoption cycle that it's going to live through but it's already you know a good way through that story um ethereum is just the beginning and there's going to be these periods of volatility and drawdowns but the story on a longer time frame is it's just that adoption is is increasing institutional financial uh you know places are able to actually use in custody this stuff and wall street and and you know basically all institutional allocators are now considering this a real asset class and so you know saying that the bull run over doesn't really take those things you know into kind of mind and the thing that we learned kind of going out and raising um for our second fun was that there's probably you know we're underestimating by one to two orders of magnitude the amount of capital that's on the sidelines that's waiting to come off and into some productive and interesting assets and it kind of just depends on um you know how far away are they from from being convinced of you know your given asset or whatever you prefer um you know to allocate to and and i think the reality is that bitcoin is amazing in times where things are really pessimistic and and uh you know when the world seems to be going to but you know not that many people own gold um you know that are institutional investors they're the people who have gotten rich over the past 20 years have gotten rich allocating to venture funds buying the dip on technology stocks you know looking at productive assets that have a high growth rate and a large tam and you know those things just look and feel like ethereum and they look and feel like defy and so you know when people say the bull runs over it's like i just kind of feel like they spend too much time on twitter and not talking to people and i'm fully aware that people don't have the privilege of talking to these large institutional allocators but you know those people are very bullish and it's just about kind of form-fitting the story of ethereum and the form-fitting of the story of defy to kind of what they want would you say that people have gotten rich on like wealthy on optimism rather than peptide pessimism historically and do you draw that distinction between sort of the bitcoin investment thesis and maybe the ethereum defy investment thesis one is optimistic the other is pessimistic i think it would have been very hard to analyze ethereum through a cynical lens same with d5 you just have to be optimistic when you look towards the future and i think that's you know one of the principles that we have a framework is just like you know being a perpetual optimist believing in what you're doing you know that is a force multiplier when you kind of you know extend that across multiple projects or investments or even things that you're doing generally and so we always kind of strive to take that forward-looking optimistic approach but uh i think the converse can be said about you know bitcoin in a lot of ways you know it's a hedge for you know the worst of times um you know it's largely a finished product that has no endogenous catalysts on the road map um really everything that's happening to bitcoin right now in my view and this is a little bit biased is you know people waiting for exogenous catalysts you know people coming off the sidelines and allocating to bitcoin and and for us it's just a little bit difficult uh to kind of you know see something as a road map and a future and catalyst uh and and pick bitcoin over that um and i think a lot of institutional allocators are realizing the same and you know if you look at the btc ratio it's it's almost tripled you know in the past i think six months um and it's it's easy to kind of be in the space and to think that you know because bitcoin is consensus within the space you know other people will realize that but not everyone else is coming in with the same set of shared values and context as those early kind of you know libertarian leaning people like a lot of people want to see something that looks and feels like traditional technology and i think that's very much where the world is heading see david it's okay that we're optimistic permeables it's fine bad sets it's fine yeah vance i want to actually dig in on this subject and this is actually something that not something that we had in the agenda but it's intrinsically interesting to me and and i think for the listeners as well because we've had a little bit we've had some back and forth with uh some bitcoiners lately about just you know about the whole you know eth btc debate right uh and uh i i couldn't can't remember who said this but they said something along the lines of like it's really in baked into your genetics what side you fall on do you fall on like the ethereum defy side or do you fall on the bitcoin side and some people just they find the resonance with one side or the other and that's where they call home uh and so how do you see with you and when how you invest framework and like the culture that you've created at framework uh how how does your personal disposition uh direct what you choose to focus on and what and and how you choose to invest and how do you think that becomes also true for other you know venture investments and speculators in this space as well yeah so you know framework has has never invested in in bitcoin and and you know i just don't think that's in our mandate um you know we're a venture fund that invests in founders at the earliest stages and and that's really kind of what we like to do at the end of the day is is invest in people and and you know there's a lot of meat on the bone when you look at d5 whether it's the kind of primitives or the aggregators or just the different kind of you know consumer applications that people are building on top of it um and it's inspiring to work with those people and and you know there is an ecosystem around bitcoin albeit a lot smaller you know it's concentrated around the lightning network it's concentrated around um you know basically different forms of hyper bitcoinization for developing countries and i think kind of what i've been seeing is that stable coins are really taking a lot of wind out of that sale you know it depending on how you think of the us dollar or the or you know bitcoins kind of feed store value properties um the evidence is relatively clear in these developing countries that people are choosing stable coins over bitcoin just because it's a little bit more functional um and things trend towards utility over time and and you know that's kind of where we kind of seek to play um you know and and i think any potential flipping will be bullish long-term for both bitcoin and ethereum i think you know bitcoin is is burdened by the expectations of having to carry the entire space which you know props to bitcoin it's it's fulfilled over time you know there there were times where we needed the the the coherent you know narrative of bitcoin to tie the space together through the bear market even though ethereum was building like you know it was kind of an open question as to what whether eth would be a real project you know a couple years down the road but bitcoin really did hold the space together and now it feels like you know just as this number one asset it has the burden of expectation of doing basically everything being technology being money being all these things to everyone um and you know if there is a flipping and eth proves to be just this massive technology layer bitcoin can settle into you know a bit of a more comfortable albeit smaller tam as as just being digital gold and i think that's a perfectly amazing outcome for all the bitcoiners out there because it's still a gigantic market and there's still probably 10 to 100x upside but it's not going to be the the end all be all and that that's totally fine um and getting past that event horizon i think getting past the fear will be really bullish for bitcoin itself i think the community will become a lot less um striking that would that be how i put it angry let's uh let's get back to the the conversation of market dynamics and i want to get your take on this as as well vance uh people have speculated that as we quote unquote go mainstream as an industry uh the way that these markets are structured and the way that these markets play out is also going to change no no longer will we have four year long boom and bust cycles where the peaks are really high and the troughs are really low there are so some speculate about the nature of a super cycle where we never actually get a deep prolonged bear market and instead we kind of just rebound over and over and over again and stair step our way up to the top there's other speculations that we just have the same boom and bust cycles but they're smaller and quicker uh where you know we we hit blow off top sooner uh we do it do a bounce quicker and then we just also keep on going and what how do you expect these market dynamics to change from what people are expecting or previously expecting which is these four year long mega cycles versus where do you think this is going now that we've kind of hit like this mainstream adoption how do you see these markets changing so i mean generally i'm i have the pleasure of of thinking on longer time skills just because you know we run 10-year funds so you know my perspective is basically like you know we're going to invest in these things and you know i'll call you in a decade i'll let you know how we did um and you know fortunately with a lot of asset class you can tell early um you know there is liquidity you can you can understand how the markets are working if the technology is valuable um but i think over the longest time horizon the math is just very clear and on our side you know there's a generational preference for digital versus physical um you know largely digital assets in and of themselves are a phenomenon that is you know in the under 30 cohort which will become the majority population cohort in the next five years um you know those types of statistics just mean that you know the financial gravity of these generations maturing is just on our side and and their preference will manifest and you know the prices of assets that they like going up um and you know it's both because they like them and it's also because you know on a lot of them they're fundamentally productive and so while i still do see the case for boom and bust cycles for things that are more store value-esque because they trend to trade tend to trade around these kind of credit cycles um things that are productive it just feels like there's really kind of no stopping the growth because the you know it's a lot of reflectivity there's more tbl there's more fees the things are more productive they're more useful there's more capital to bootstrap projects in the ecosystem like that will really never go away once that flywheel is spinning fast enough and i think we've now kind of reached that escape velocity um does that mean you know there won't be 60 or 70 drawdowns like i i don't really know i mean there was one you know two weeks ago uh but i i think the thing about drawdowns is like you know when when you lose money and things aren't going exactly how you planned you know you can kind of dig the whole as arbitrarily deep as you want it kind of emotionally or you know you're kind of choosing to respond to the situation but as long as you kind of have good assets and you understand the thesis and you're willing to wait long enough there really is no cause for concern and i think the amazing thing about this space specifically defy is that you're able to delay things like tax liabilities you're able to borrow against your assets like you know the actual functionality and utility is baked into this asset class which doesn't put a lot of the same pressure on things like you know traditional stocks or commodities or even bitcoin um so you know when in doubt zoom out is is kind of you know my my personal mantra and i think good advice it is so funny like once you cross the bridge from the legacy bank system to this new defy ecosystem you don't tend to cross it back the other way right so like even if you sell your crypto native assets what are you selling to staple coins right like what like am i gonna sell back to my wells fargo bucks and earn like point zero one percent in a savings account no of course not so it's it's to your point it's staying in the defy economy in the crypto economy for the utility of things but like so part of me is optimistic on everything you just said vance but like also part of me feels like my god though um it does feel like crypto investors maybe i'll just name retail haven't actually gotten smarter versus 2017 maybe it's a new crop because like we're still pumping doggy coins aren't we like what's up with that is that a counter argument to you are defy is going mainstream people are understanding this asset class argument or like what would you say i i i mean i'm very much a fan of of of people doing what they want with their money and and i don't think ethereums get to have it both ways or frankly anybody in crypto where you know they preach you know economic freedom but only in the subset of assets or things that they like and consider valuable um that doesn't mean that i don't think that dogecoin is you know basically financial napalm and that a lot of these guys will get torched but you know i came from you know a technology job where i was just speculating on these assets in my free time and if anybody had told me that i couldn't do that i kind of would have just laughed at them and i think you know that's kind of the same response that we get from a lot of people that want to trade things like dogecoin or sheba or really whatever the coin is is that they're just kind of expressing their own personal preference and they're using things like unit swap to do it and so anything that gets them on board and interested you know is a win in my book um do i think these things are really good long-term investments like you know i don't but everyone has a right to speculate and i think you know generally i am i am on board with things like accredited investor rules and and things like that but you know the history of the us at least is is is rife with we're really good at speculation that is one of the core tenets of what we do economically other than just kind of labor um and you know i like to see that that is back in the markets albeit it's a little bit frothy but you know it's a step in the right direction towards getting people another kind of economic leg to hold up their their stool um so i'm actually you know pretty bullish on the fact that that's happening and it just brings more attention to crypto as well so you know it's not all bad fans i want to hang on the 60 drawdown that we had recently uh because i think there's some some lessons that we could parse out from there defy kind of took it like a champ uh we had the cascading liquidations like left and right we had us arguably the spike all the way down from like below 2200 ether down to 1700 ether was really just liquidity just drying up as people uh had to get liquidated uh but then buyers did step in now stablecoin stayed relatively close to their peg you know what lessons can we draw from this 60 drawdown about like where defy is in its uh level of maturity yeah i would probably give i would give i would give different grades to different parts of d5 i think base layer d5 did really well um the you know gas prices uh you know increased as the volatility got worse and worse and that primarily acted as a decelerant to the moves um you know anyone with you know under x or y amount of ether capital really couldn't do anything and and we run a lot of kind of market making you know operations to just basically keep markets in line um both across spot and derivatives exchanges and deep and you know that allowed us to really kind of have some room to maneuver and stabilize the markets that we were in um so that was you know really positive the things that i didn't really like seeing were um you know people who had uh you know created a loan on layer one on maker ave withdrawn it to polygon and you know we're getting closer to their collateralization ratio uh you know being liquidated um and they couldn't get back over the polygon bridge you know that that was kind of like a just something that happened that that didn't really uh feel right um and so i think the the learning there is that you know things like the virtual dive bridge and things like you know the polygon bridge just need to be you know just less idiosyncratic they need to be more generalized people need to understand them better and they can't just go down for three hours and then collapse um so i think that was was a negative um you know at the same time finance features went down uh i think ftx was down for a little bit as well so i think those exchanges actually fared worse than d5 um but yeah i mean overall you know a 70 60 drawdown in you know a period of two days is about as bad as you will get like almost by any you know measure the amount of liquidations you know the total amount of capital that was uh you know we didn't d5 as well like you really don't get much worse than that and to see d5 you know actually thrive actually you know during the incident compared to last year where pretty much everyone just got worked um you know it was definitely positive to see the other concern that i have is like it's great that defy held up and everything continued to chug on as normal especially when we have the uh covid march crash that happened uh maybe a year and a couple months beforehand to really compare and contrast like what dfi was like then versus what d5 was like now uh and so that's a great learning lesson but at some point uh institutions or just people at large don't like assets that fall 60 in a day it doesn't really matter how fast it climbed falling 60 percent no one wants to see that uh did this did that event like spook people and scare people away are we is this something that we have to like come to terms with as an asset class that you know we are just going to have these just massive periods of volatility where the numbers next to our assets are could be any different number the next day like did we spook institutions away uh did this scare etfs away like what are your opinions about just like how the world is going to be able to stomach these massive drawdowns and if it's actually headwinds to this asset class i mean i think that institutions who started down this path you know call it six months ago with with the elon purchase or even the kind of later sailor purchases you know they've now um you know gone through investment committee they've gone to their board you know they've maybe you know edited their mandate to allow them to invest in crypto assets like because this is such a an esoteric asset class that has you know implications across custody across um you know is it taxed as property or is it taxes stock like there's so many different things people had to do like work uh to get into this asset class and so that work has just compounded over time and now those institutions are kind of finally on the finishing you know line and ready to allocate and things like this don't really dissuade them if anything it makes them more bullish like it's hard to buy an asset that's up 5x uh you know 6x like bitcoin was um at the very top because just the chance it goes down is pretty high and you know these are all just people working at these endowments and pension funds and institutions and like they don't want that um but buying it you know 50 60 off the highs like while you may not have that same euphoria and excitement about the asset class like odds are that's probably a better entry point and you know it's there's something that's strange about human nature where you know the more something goes up it's like the more confident you get the more you work you get you know and the more something goes down it's like the more you hate the asset you're trying to fight yourself to you know to not sell it and you just kind of have to realize that those are things that you know you should generally counter trade and and at the highest levels of professional investing those people are paid and trained to do that and so this does not dissuade them at all i think the more damaging thing is is potentially you know these esg concerns about bitcoin but you know every fortune 500 company has gone through this esg cycle where you know there's been a guy or there's too much pollution or they poison the environment somehow and you know they fire the guy they buy the carbon credits they you know they remake the program and generally they spend it as a polish catalyst um you know now with improved corporate governance and you know environmental costs has been dropped and like that is something that even as i got off the plane in miami two days ago i saw someone offering um you know carbon neutral bitcoins that i could buy and so like this thing is already happening uh people are already spinning up narratives um and you know it still hasn't really dissuaded anybody i think there's something to like making the case that volatility is a feature of free markets and not a bug and free markets as you said like when we're talking about doggy coins i mean we we can't um dictate what people decide to value and what they decide to buy right it's just sort of a free tr feature of free markets but i'm curious to dig more into your esg um like thoughts right so that is definitely a narrative that has taken hold recently and it's primarily in kind of like big bitcoiner circles right obviously and now i feel like ethereum can't really say too much because look it's still on proof of work and has been for the last five years uh but if the road map plays out how um the ethereum community anticipates in my nine months or so that could no longer be the tape it be the case right transition fully to proof of stake what do you think that does to the narrative because i've just when i've looked at mainstream headlines i just see the it's still a focus on bitcoin proof of work consumption there's really no recognition or knowledge that something like proof of state could be coming at least for ethereum 99.9 uh reduction in like energy costs um do you think that narrative will be a big one for institutions or do you think this is just like short-term noise and over the long run none of it will really matter i i think i think that'll stratify the space you know even more than we've seen historically when you know the two biggest assets are in kind of diametrically proposed sides of the spectrum in terms of proof of work for proof of stake and it also and this is you know a little bit of a reach i i think ethereum maps very clearly to um you know more liberal values uh you know esg solved by proof of stake you know maybe staking becomes some form of ubi where we can all stake our piece of ethereum and you know you're getting some sort of check the money you know every month or week or so um you know it's it's an open development platform that really espouses the values of of transparency and auditability and proposability that's open to anyone um and you know you look at bitcoin and you know the main values that it spouses to me looking at our strong property rights um and uh you know just you know basically a lot of historical um context by this proof-of-work mining scheme that has expanded a ton of energy which kind of again maps closer to you know the right side of the spectrum and so i do see that there will be kind of this ideological spread between these two assets and you know that will only continue over time as you know bitcoin is largely a finished product and ethereum continues to develop and can you know potentially be co-opted by um you know institutions by governments by things like that to use in in ways that they kind of may and so i i definitely think the proof of stake uh merge is gonna be you know a really big thing for the space um and uh it'll you know just being able to solve that esg catalyst with with something that's forward-looking and productive rather than buying carbon credits is it's just an entirely different kind of view of the space for a lot of allocators as well as our last podcast with you i think really what landed in my head and stuck with me was this line that d5 is just this sandbox for possibility right you got one d5 app plugs right into another d5 app and not only that but finally we have a place for developers to play around and tinker with in a world of finance not just a world of you know software right you know software finance and that's really the thing that devi has really unlocked for the world is it gives developers a chance to play in tinker and when when you give developers like this sandbox naturally innovation just explodes uh that that was your your your your insight and prediction back when we did our first podcast back in august of 2020. how have you seen that money lego system play out over the last or the the next nine months um what did the developers do what did you expect what was a surprise to you and how would you illustrate the and how would you characterize the nature of d5 money legos in its current state and form so um you know what did we do over the past year um i feel like the first thing we did was just a ton of creative destruction which is really bullish uh you know you're creating a lot of things they're all incentivized by tokens it's it's kind of like war of the worlds with with these different token communities and and i think we saw a lot of projects you know fail get hacked you know have bad outcomes we also saw a lot of projects kind of get battle tested you know grow as communities you know morph into different things and extend their use cases um we also saw you know the rise of daos again you know maker kind of pivoting away from its foundation model which i think is really smart and going more into a pure down and now i think we're at the point where most of the major heat by protocols you know there are no bank accounts there's no gusto website for them to set up their benefits if you work there you know you're getting paid through a multi-sig um in sample coins or or native tokens and that's kind of really a different form factor of work similar to kind of when you know people invented the joint stock corporation um i think that will be something that persists over time and people continue to iterate on um and you know there's a ton of growth in the d5 area in terms of just battle testing um the main things that that launched that you know we were really excited about were derivatives um and options and i think kind of what we learned in hindsight is that these things need layer two to really work like you just literally cannot have a fast enough oracle to prevent things like front running and back running um you can't you know build a custom amm to kind of trade options on without layer two um and so you know the things that we thought would really take off on layer one you know we're kind of just you know a little too expensive the gas was too high the oracles were too slow and so i think those are the things that didn't work as much as we would have wanted but um overall just the growth of the ecosystem has been you know absolutely insane you know i think ave has 21 billion dollars of tbl in it you know urine has seven um synthetics is creating a ton of volume and issuing a ton of debt um and so you know things have been really bullish i think collectively we're all waiting for layer two and what that is you know gonna hold um and i think it's it's just gonna be you know more than than we can expect one of the big themes of defy is capital efficiency and being able to tap into the value of your assets and that is definitely a theme that i have been particularly paying attention to right like unit swap three it advertises capital efficiency capital efficiency balancer v2 capital efficiency we have uh liquidity and their new lusd for zero percent interest with a hundred and ten percent collateralization ratio on your eth capital efficiency um and and naturally ave has you know kind of led the charge with being able to tap into the value of your assets where you deposit your assets and then you can tap into the capital efficiency of your assets uh where where is the logical conclusion of a defy you know ecosystem that is really competing at the highest degree to provide its users with capital efficiency like what what is this is this a new paradigm about like how people engage and interact with their assets like what does this mean over the long term yeah it's it's uh when when you swap went in in the v3 direction i think a lot of people were pretty surprised you know there is this idea that um you know there's going to be a curve instead of an order book and that means that everyone is going to get to participate um and i think you know that dream was probably a little bit oversold relative to reality um and you know now you have things like sushi that are they're still kind of on that that same curve but you know all the people that can't set up these bots to do v3 um are now kind of in the uh sushi you know curve and and that just means that there's less speed there's more people there's more mouths to feed and that's probably not the version of the feature that plays out and the version of the future that plays out at least to me is um where there is some sort of either intermediary protocol that is basically doing the lping for people on on things like v3 um or we get to a point where you know basically the people who have you know some technical ability are are the ones that are able to capture those fees and i strongly think it'll be the first one like there is just a market opportunity and people will come and fill that um but i think the really interesting thing about v3 and just this kind of capital efficiency in the context of you know a bunch of different layer twos and a bunch of you know different exciting ecosystems is that you know with a couple hundred million dollars of capital and four to five smart people you can go off and dominate any l2 you want with something that looks like v3 you don't need to port all of your liquidity there and so just like this idea that people can be in multiple places at multiple times is really interesting from a product standpoint because it kind of begs the question as to you know if capital efficiency is going to be the new thing that drives space forward you know where is unispot.org routing liquidity through like if there's multiple layer twos you know are they building more of an aggregator like does the focus become more on a consumer product and and less on these liquidity pools or like how does that work and so i think there's there's a lot of unanswered questions for me about you know the future of front ends in the space as it relates to kind of this theme of capital efficiency and the fragmentation of different market makers and pieces of capital across layer twos um but yeah it's it's uh i think it's going to be a trend that impacts you know basically every market you know derivatives markets will need to get more efficient so will lending markets um and and this idea that you know everyone's earning these fees and these amms you know may can't come under question at some point and or maybe you kind of route it through a second order primitive vance i think there's a whole discussion that we want to have um in in just a a a couple of minutes about layer two because that layer two does feel like a huge unlock for the industry i mean you just talked about you know like options being only really possible in sort of a layer two scenario and that's been a learning of yours uh over the last nine months and um so let's talk about layer two in a minute but before we do i wanna get to kind of a more wanna ask your more general thoughts on this so dave and i have often said on bank list that d5 is basically we're speed running the last 1 000 years of financial history right like we're just speed running it right now we're at the point in the 1800s where we have like this store of value and we have like these proto banks it's all code it's cl but then we have things like collateralized loans right that's cool these are some of the money legos that have been built what i want to ask more generally before we get to the layer 2 discussion is what's kind of next what do we need to build next okay we have uniswap we've got permissionless trading we've got that function that's our nasdaq that's our new york stock exchange cool we've got collateralized lending some building blocks there and borrowing that's cool we have some other early primitives too but what do you think defy really needs to build next and what will be next what other money legos should be we be looking at now so i'll speak to kind of um you know the first trend that i think is going to happen in the next couple years is basically verticalization um you know taking these liquidity pools that are on chain taking these you know borrow land or money markets front chain putting them in a front end that is you know either you know specific to an industry or a geography and just running that playbook as an entrepreneur you don't need to build the entire you know financial services stack that you would is a financial services startup um you can leverage a lot of the open source code and liquidity that exists on chain and just build a tailored user experience to whatever industry or geography you're in and so what did they ask a question of that is so is that sort of like what fintech has done with like the traditional banking system only this is like fintech on d5 primitives exactly right and and this is this is a playbook that fintech started you know deploying in kind of like 2013 2014 but it is it's still been pretty slow to roll out just because the legacy rails that are on are so slow and restrictive but um you know we are hyper focused on on funding these different kind of vertical ideas because you know if you have a white listing service that can you know basically uh wrap a piece of real estate vote it in as collateral on maker and then start to draw die against that you know that's a business and and you know the business is some function of uh the white listing of the wrapping of the real estate the governance votes that you need to pass as collateral maker and generally kind of the entire consumer experience of getting die back in your bank account but that's a financial service that you know probably worth a few billion dollars if someone builds into a full company um taking the d5 products like a high yield savings account like a barlen functionality and bringing it to a country like chile or argentina or brazil those people have you know pretty terrible finance services at this point they're you know inclined towards bitcoin um they already know crypto you know that's another kind of mass-market uh project that that we're looking at pretty heavily let's camp here for a second because that is super interesting to me dave and i have talked about this concept of like the d5 mullet which is like you know fintech in the front and define the backs or like traditional bank in the front um but i'm curious what you think do you think that it will be new startups and crypto natives who start using this defy infrastructure for their for their quote-unquote fintech or do you think some existing fintech players will jump in and start capturing these markets you know the the paypals and the squares of the world it's going to be it's going to be new teams the the incumbents have a very very slow motivation to really kind of innovate or build anything that does not exist on their payment rails and so that limits a lot of what they can do from from a t5 perspective and so the teams that we're looking at are you know a couple of engineers from mongodb and facebook that grew up in argentina spent you know four or five years in the bay area and are now you know playing around with ethereum for the first time and they're moving back to their home country because they're interested in living there but they want to take a lot of what they've learned and played around with on the internet back with them and so like you know those are the prototypical teams that we're looking for you know they have kind of some of the web 2 talent their engineering focus their product focus and they have the local context to be able to you know build and market a product and there are you know hundreds and hundreds of these stories both across industry and geography and and you're just going to see this play out over and over and over again i think the reality is like um we're naturally inclined to like look for like you know let's find all these new primitives and let's go fund them and like we're very much in that business but like we're really like an inch deep in terms of the actual amount of attractions we've gotten with the services that we have and just the ability to you know doesn't matter if it's christmas eve on at midnight you know if you have some form of crypto collateral you can go and get a loan from ave from maker from synthetics like it just is is a better financial experience and importing that is just basically instant margin for whatever startup does it that is awesome that verticalization idea um so that sounds like a big theme and i guess you know what what that means is they're going to be all these defy fintechs that pop up in these different verticals all like around the world but it also means maybe a swelling of tvl and usage and capital for existing d5 protocols is that how you see it yeah and if you look at the architecture of a lot of the major d5 protocols right now um you know ave is uh is you know in many ways a company you know it has uh you know a full full staff that has an office like you know they have people leading the day-to-day um they are not focused on building the protocol right now they're focused on you know mainstream adoption and they've chosen the vertical of institutions i don't know if you've seen their kind of institutional pools but like that's one example of this thesis playing out in real time and so often times if there still is that core group of people and there is a company around the protocol that's going to be the first people to do this thesis but you know it's just such an easy way to build a startup where you don't need to build the financial services rails and people are going to pick up on this it's just a matter of time vance explain really quickly ave's institutional pools for people who aren't familiar yeah so um institutional pools uh are effectively a side car pool where uh all participants in the pool are kyc they know each other and they're you know basically um have been vetted to not be on a nofact list which is the office for an asset control which kind of stipulates that there's certain countries and people that are not allowed to interact with kind of the traditional banking rails and so you know for for people like retail um it doesn't really matter that much having those insurances because you know you're trading you know some coin and you saw pool and you know you're pretty sure you're not doing anything to various but for institutions you know they need that higher level of insurance just because you know they have a higher level of expectation from their board their fiduciaries people like that so you know i very much see ave leading the way in kind of the institutionalization or at least that vertical with their finance services but you know there are hundreds of those industries that that would like access to these financial services but just have no idea how to do it and currently their best way of you know thinking through it is like you know should i buy ethon coinbase but like in reality there's just so much more depth you know when they actually start using it okay so verticals would you call this this new version of ave as like kyc ave or like permissioned ave just because of the nature of the clientele that needs to have those assurances is that is that how you would describe this i i would i would say it's probably like you know i wouldn't say it's like regulated of it because it's self-regulated like no regulators force them to do this they're doing this at their own behest um right i would say you know this is probably like kyc light ave um we've been looking a lot into the red tech space and different approaches um to you know at least some sort of kyc or some sort of you know regulation in this space because i think over the long term it's coming and it's a good thing um and it'll probably be you know less painful than we all think um but my thing with regtech is that the solution can't be worse than the problem like the solution to kyc can't be giving the government our money to custodial smart contracts like that's just not going to work um and so like the self-regulation liquidity pool layer while i understand the backlash from people on twitter that don't like it um the bottom line is that it's just a far better way of doing this uh than than putting our assets in a smart contract from the government yeah to me it's like less kyc ave and more like that the pool itself is kyc to kyc the light right the protocol in the code is still completely permissionless unsensible ethereum tech right and that's not the part that's being kyc'd um so okay so speedrunning again uh that was a whole segway on verticalization which is super cool great insight guys alpha alpha to bankless listeners i think look for these opportunities look maybe for d5 protocols that are speed running these verticalization opportunities that's maybe some other insight that that vans just dropped uh what else besides verticalization what are some other future trends as we build out this this d5 money stack that that you guys are thinking about um future trends uh yeah i mean i i think um it's gonna sound cringe to a lot of people but i think enterprise blockchain is gonna be back at some point and at this time it'll actually be you know fundamentally productive at some level um you know a lot of the investors in our fund are our software's and service companies that are looking for ways to to uh to integrate you know blockchain technology and i think we've gotten past this like goofy private blockchain proof of concept where like you know everyone's holding hands running a node and like you know like that's that's how the service runs and like i think we're now kind of more into the land of like you know like hey you know one of these sas companies like let's launch a let's launch a roll-up you know let's just use it as our native sandbox like let's have a token if other companies want to join you know we'll kind of incentivize them to just build things in the sandbox and i think that there's gonna you're gonna need a lot of kind of developer evangelization you know which is like a traditional silicon valley string um but at the end of the day you know there's just a lot of superpowers in crypto that you know even if it's you know earning two or three percent uh you know yield on your cash every year like startups have been built on far less than that and so like you will see like the slow kind of enterprise blockchain movement picking up again um and i think you know the things that make me really bullish on that are talking to people that work at you know the big four consultancies that sell these technology solutions as a service to these massive fortune 500 companies and they look at ethereum they see it as incredibly neutral kind of sediment layer and they also see it as a revenue opportunity because that's just something they can sell through to their consumers and i think a lot of the work that people like paul brody are doing is really interesting and important because um at some level you know those four consultancies are the ones that really determine you know what is the technology of the future so i think those are really bullish as well um so i think that will be a big one eventually as well is that specifically enabled because of roll-ups you you added roll-ups in your answer and uh i think people who aren't like paying detailed attention to roll-ups maybe are missing the power behind them and the ability for anyone to just you know quote unquote spin up your own blockchain like here's here's your blockchain except it's also you know super fast and can you secured by ethereum you don't have to worry about consensus because ethereum takes that takes care of that for you now everyone can have a roll up right like coinbase can manage it it's accounting on a roll up it could be public it could be private wells fargo could be on a rollup are the reason is the reason why you are now bullish on on enterprise blockchain stuff is because of specifically rollups so i think uh the reason why i'm bullish is because rollups give kind of like this modular way for people to interact with blockchains isn't just like you're on the base layer of ethereum it's public it's super expensive you know there's very little room and creative license to maneuver i think the roll-up gives them that creative license and it gives them just a little bit more flexibility in terms of you know deploying a solution that's form-fitted to their needs i think that's kind of the first thing i think the second thing is you know building these developer sandboxes whether it's you know like an in-person accelerator an online hackathon you know whatever you know having a native incentivization layer of a token like and being able to distribute this to people that are also kind of like-minded maybe in the same enterprise you know software cohort you know that's something else that's powerful with a roll-up where you can have that token incentivize usage and just testing of things and so um you know my good friend john he's an investor in the fund he runs a company called stream which is a data replication service where when you're moving your data from one sql database to another he will replicate it and put it in the cloud and you can access it whenever that's that's probably a billion dollar business they just raised from goldman sachs like it's really an incredible company but it's built on a very specific premise at some level these rollups will be used for either data replication just experimentation with kind of internal transfers or cash management or just kind of general ideas about how to kind of streamline workflows and so at some point you know enterprises will come to blockchain and use it for things that are productive but it's not going to be in the private blockchain concept that we're that we're kind of used to and you know that idea is still probably a few years away but i do think it's coming at some some level vance you mentioned paul brody and he's at eny and i i just uh saw some headlines that they just received another 100 million dollar investment in their kind of blockchain crypto business unit heavy into ethereum i think a lot of stuff is going unnoticed that might just become start to become visible with the advent of of cheaper block space on layer two one thing i do feel like though is you mentioned enterprises maybe marshalling and using tokens it does feel like we need to have some more regulatory clarity perhaps before the legal teams of large enterprises like get comfortable with this we had hester purse in the podcast you know a couple months ago and she's very much like i wish we could have sandboxes for defy and we were like hester we think that's great we do too uh can you can you convince the sec and gary gensler and those in the regulatory bodies to go do that um do you think maybe now it's not so much the scaling technology it's maybe the regulatory clarity that is um the i i guess like the the blocker right now i i think regular lack of regulatory clarity is is kind of both a feature and a bug um i think the perspective of regulators and this is you know me interpreting um public comments and you know private conversations is basically um they don't want to hamper innovation and they don't know what the space is going to become so they don't want to put any rules in place that will you know inherently block a lot of the innovation that's happening in the space at the same time they're very concerned with things like consumer protection which you know they're given their mandate is right at the top of the list but um i think they're they're really smart people working in these agencies um and so you know it's not like they hate our industry and they don't want to give us rules i think it's more of a forward-looking you know we don't really want to kneecap what's happening right now and so they're punting a lot of things um this does put enterprises in a weirder uh you know kind of area from a from a regulatory standpoint but um you know what's the difference between custody something like btc on your balance sheet or other tokens like what's the difference between selling a software subscription license versus you know having some sort of you know token denominated payment mechanism like uh you know like any of the crypto native startups that have today and like i think these questions are are less further afield than you might think um and you know well do i see these enterprises like turning their business models inside out in the next few years and adopting tokens in mass like i probably don't see that but i do see there's there's going to be this slow edging towards using these blockchains for things um that are fundamentally productive like like a good example of a use case that i was talking to someone at deloitte about is just a volume rebate where you know based on the amount of orders that are coming through you know a smart contract can automatically tell adjust the pricing and then continue on with that customer at a different rate you know based on their volume you know into the future and those are the things that you know as long as there's a couple counterparties that are interacting in public on a blockchain that have you know that logic programmed in that interaction perfect for a blockchain um and i think you know part of that is going to be you know enticing the other side onto something like a roll up with some sort of token incentive um but a lot of these companies you know are you know they're not that far away from doing things like that i think you know like things happen quicker than you expect like the institutions were coming for for so long and it didn't seem like they were in crypto and then all of a sudden one day they showed up ethereum scaled like you know almost overnight some like polygon um these things are non-linear and they come in months so i think there are a lot of the um there's a lot of people in the software as a service industry looking at blockchain as a revenue stream and they're working towards a future where they can build applications on top of it and it's just a matter of kind of incentivizing things and that's why i think things like roll ups are going to be powerful and drawing those cohorts in let's turn the l2 conversation towards i think what the average listener might be more familiar and excited with which is how l2s are going to impact them uh and and i've been articulating this this thesis of the l2 d5 summer round 2 that could in theory be right around the corner and so vance i want to get your your gut check on take on this possible version of the future that uh may be coming uh and you know we just had arbitrage launch uh last friday uh optimism seems to be around the corner polygon is already doing absolutely fantastically and all this new real estate is becoming made available right like ethereum as the central hub is getting all these different spokes unlocking and developers are rushing out to like all this new real estate to build all these new apps because they know that once they build all these new apps they're going to attract all the all the um you know all the tourists right everyone's going to come and and move and and spend money at their you know defy app attraction uh and so all of a sudden there's this there's this massive amount of new real estate that's really really valuable for defy apps to claim and so defy apps want to you know sushi swap wants to beat unit swap to adoption on arbitrom and uniswap wants to beat sushi swap as adoption on optimism and in my in my mind how are we going to get this done well to me the answer is liquidity binding just because like what what do we know and love in this space and we know that it works and it works because you know there's this massive incentive and and we've already done this before we already had you know the og version of defy summer which was all done on on the ethereum main chain but now it's not just incentivizing user participation and just usage of these apps on the main chain it's getting people out into the l2s out into arbitrary out into optimism and not only do these defy apps need to incentivize people but the actual l2s also need to incentivize people to use their l2 and so we'll have in in possible version of the future we will have all these defy apps incentivizing their usage via traditional liquidity mining like we know and love but they will also be boosted by the native tokens of arbitrarium which is complete speculation if they have a token i have no idea same thing with optimism no idea if they're having a token but it would fall in line with the nature of this industry if you know people like tokens and people like issuing tokens uh and so not only are the liquidity mining incentives going to be juiced by you know sushi releasing out uh sushi rewards and you to swap releasing unit swap rewards but optimism arbitrage and we're already seeing this with polygon issuing tokens for their own native asset in order to distribute those hands in the hands of the users so we have this dual liquidity mining uh possibility ahead of us where both the apps and the l2s are incentivizing usage of the l2s and we can finally have defy summer round two layer two edition uh except this time it's actually even more awesome because there won't be any fees or at least there will be significantly less fees because it's on l2s that's that's my perceived theory of what could happen over the next like three to six to nine months how does that land with you lan i think you're probably right um if you look at something like matic which has seven i think seven or eight billion in cvl it's it's basically the size of finance marching um you know a lot of that is ismatic itself uh matic is now the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world which is just absolutely wild to me um you know not because i don't think it should be it's just it has been a meteoric rise um i think you'll see you know three or four of these same style of tokens you know by probably mid to late summer um and you'll see a lot of kind of the same things where you know a lot of the tbl in matic is reflexive where it's either incentivizing tokens or trading matic for rap bitcoin or ether you know other tokens that are on that chain um you'll also see a ton of kind of these uh you know uh roll up native projects you know come into play where things like quick swap is like the the dax of uh polygon you know something like slingshot is the aggregator of polygon you'll probably see kind of like these different tribes kind of form and align around these different layer two ecosystems um but i think you know generally no no problems with that thesis i think that will generally play out people there will be a ton of tokens it'll be very euphoric people be on these roll-ups will be awesome but i think the main thing that's going to happen is is the people who've been waiting to try stuff that's too expensive on the base layer will now go for it on layer two and and there is just so much pressure of those projects um you know things like fractal things like future swap that you know base layers are just too slow and too expensive um you know hundreds of dollars per trade um you know forty to fifty thousand dollars to deploy contracts like that just doesn't work um and so you know getting to this lower cost environment will just be really rich soil for experimentation and that's probably the thing that i'm most excited about um i think the the con of of a lot of that and what i've heard frequently is like you know these things aren't interoperable and you know how are we gonna get liquidity from one chain to the other i think there's reasonable solutions like hop network or connects that will be able to route liquidity from roll up to roll up or back to the base layer market makers will serve some sort of bridge kind of functionality from the base layer which develops as well um but i also think that it's you know somewhat bullish for these things not to be able to interact like you know diversity is the device of life like having these ecosystems that are forced to grow their own identities and their own first principles is something that um you know is really bullish at least for for me like you know if if you kind of zoom out and you look at you know bitcoin and ethereum and all the early cryptos you know you could kind of make the same argument like oh these things are too heterogeneous there shouldn't just be one crypto that does it all but like really kind of that variety built that maximalism which built you know interesting cultures over time and i think we're going to see the same thing play out with these layer twos um and i have no idea who will win in the short term uh i think there's definitely you know talking to developers there's a real difference between asking users to pay dollars for a transaction versus a fraction of a penny which is you know kind of what polygon is but you know i think people will generally realize the security trade-offs of polygon versus roll-up are very real over time and and my guess as to who wins you know the role of wars in you know two or three years is basically the person who you know captures and utilizes mev uh to the best extent for their own ecosystem right now mev is something that is basically a societal cost of doing business on on the base chain you know people taking one or two or three percent of your transaction back running front running sandwich bots um and right now the problem with mev is basically who gets it and who gets it are the miners and and those are kind of a fundamentally you know misaligned participant set um because you know i don't know uh how much you know people running heavy electricity miners have to do with what i'm doing on a daily basis like i feel like if we had a conversation we probably wouldn't be speaking the same language um but in a roll-up what happens is that meb is is basically the business model of that roll-up and you capture it and you basically either distribute it back to everyone who's using the roll-up or you can you know allocate it to a token and that token now has a lot of value because it's occurring as cash flows and so you know there is some business model dependency that comes from mev but i think the chain that wins long term will be the one that productionalizes and utilizes that the most to bootstrap their ecosystem and i think like drilling down into like what cultural alignment with ethereum means it probably means like some sort of high level line with you know who gets muv and why and that would be probably the determining factor of who wins this this uh you know this roll-up war that's so fascinating on the mev we just had arbitrary mod and they we had a discussion about mev and they talked about um their their plan to try to create some sort of like fair protocol distribution mechanism for the mev optimism has a different approach where there may be auctioning it do you have any insights into like what the best design would be are you just of like let's try all the experiments and and we'll see but certainly the winning one will have some way to marshal mev into something valuable and productive like any other i guess deep takes on mev and the experiments that that you're seeing that are about to go live in the real world yeah i think um [Music] we just need to experiment with it like right now it's just going to the wrong participant set i think that's the biggest problem with mev like not only are you losing money it's like it's going to someone who you don't really like that much um but like as long as we can capture that and make it part of a roll-up i think all of these things have a reasonably strong chance of being successful over the long term um but i i do like the optimism role where they're they're auctioning off the sequencer or the role of the sequencer so it's kind of like a proof-of-stake blockchain where you know say you have you know x amount of the optimize or x percent of the optimism token you have an x percent of winning that sequence role at any given time and that sequence role has you know y amount of mbb in it for kind of you know z amount of time that you have the role and so like that is is interesting to me um it's just like a primitive to kind of bootstrap and use this mev i still kind of really biased towards the fact that the mbv should go to the native token of the roll-up because if that native token is occurring cash flows and everyone is is kind of earning those tokens in some way shape or form from being on the roll-up it's not really like you're losing any money from any potential mev exploit it's more of kind of like you're redistributing this wealth towards you know a more common and equitable set of participants that's on the roll-up and you just assume that that has you know positive externalities down the road um and so that's kind of how i would like to see it productionalized um but you know those are pretty loose thoughts fascinating takes and guys if you're not familiar with the term mev go back and listen to the bankless podcast we just did a couple weeks ago with phil diane and company we had a whole mev panel mev stands for maximum extractable value of course and also listened to the arbitrary episode we just did vance you talked about like uh layer two is opening up new things and there's certainly like we we have a um somebody writes for for bankless from time to time uh kid in college he's like i couldn't afford transactions on ethereum so all of these d5 protocols you guys were talking about on bank lists like i just couldn't use them because they cost like 20 30 bucks and like i'm playing with 100 here right like i'm in college um but he's like polygon just opened this thing wide open for me and now i actually get to test and experiment and so like what you're saying about a new set of defy users being able to be onboarded who are less kind of like og d5 whales ethereum whales and are like a newer set of people totally resonates with what we're seeing i'm i'm curious though with what some of the apps so like the mental model here is uh it's like if you've ever played a game like civilization something like that right like there's a tech tree and like the civilization unlocks you know writing and then math and that leads to like physics and eventually you get like the nuclear bomb and your the whole goal of the civilization is to like go through this tech tree and unlock these various things we said before on bank list that crypto and d5 is almost like a tech tree now we have this big unlock which is layer two so we just unlocked something new that's gonna lead to all of these other technologies and applications what are some of those do you think you mentioned options maybe being one something we couldn't do on ethereum main chain but in layer two we can is that one what are the others i i think you know options uh derivatives perpetuals those are all the kind of obvious candidates that will launch and you know pretty much immediately do well once these player twos are cheap and fast enough to use um you know there's no kind of existential question as to like you know are those going to be valuable businesses it's just kind of a question of when the things that you know i'm i'm you know kind of that are further a feel that i'm you know even more excited about are things like games where like in the gaming industry you have this kind of moment where um you don't have open source development developer platforms like unity and unreal you have pressure on the free to play business model which is you know 80 or 90 of the revenue in that industry um kind of coming into questions it just gets more competitive and then you have blockchain developers or gaming developers looking over it at washington developers and they see them selling 20 30 40 million virtual land and it's just kind of a moment where they look over the fence and like how do you do that yeah and you know it's it's a new business model for games um you know major studios really have no uh you know incentive structure to go and experiment with something like this and so you have kind of like this all these indie studios that are in the gaming world that are now looking for this alternative you know or new form of just you know business and so those are the people that we've spent a lot of time talking to both in terms of like here's what a blockchain is here's how you would do this and also developing a playbook as to like here's how you can build a game that has all these mechanics it is more of an economy than than just kind of a free-to-play game and so i think a lot of those people are going to come over and they're going to come over quick uh because you know people have been funding these startups for the past two years and they're finally ready to release things and so i'm really bullish on games it's kind of a uscape that will emerge on lair too really in the context of either immutable x or polygon itself um anything else in that is a little bit too expensive um so that's that's definitely another area that we're excited about since there are still some l2 skeptics or l2 holdouts out there and i was wanting to get your take on what do you think is the most viable um bear case or pessimistic case for l2s and uh what what's is there any like fud out there that you want i hate the word fud not everyone likes the word fud but is there any sort of like are there any issues that you'd like to clear up that you have in your head yeah i think the main one that i've heard is is basically like you know if you have a 50 million monthly active or 50 million registered user application like you need a hundred thousand transactions per second to port that over to a blockchain you know that's just not how how these companies think and i don't think we need to get to that level of transaction throughput to make a lot of these real-life use cases you know real on a blockchain um so you know an example of that is visa you know their their max throughput on their network is 22 000 transactions per second they use about 1400 you know at their peak and so like that's a worldwide payment network you know that people are transacting on it's not that far afield from from where our term is or optimism is which is kind of in the realm of three to five thousand transactions per second at the peak and it's also not really in the scope of how people develop products because you know like what does putting 50 million users on chain actually mean like if it's in if it's a social media app it's like every time you scroll on the app like something you're putting on chain like like how does that work and the and the answer is basically no you know only the highest value use cases will really interact with these blockchains um just like netflix wouldn't use their payment processor to store their content you know people aren't going to use um you know a blockchain to store things that you know either belong in file storage or just don't need to be on chain and so i think you know the hybrid world of using these blockchains is really where we're trying to get to with these layer twos we're not trying to build a thing that has billions of people transacting billions of times per second that's just not really in the context of reality of blockchain applications um i think that's kind of the main piece of bud that i've heard that just seems like totally out of line with like if you've ever worked a technology company that's just not how you build a product um the other part that i think is is a risk is you know one of these things going down i think the cool thing about rollups is that you kind of have this escape patch back to your main net where things really go sideways um things like polygon get me a little bit nervous especially when i see things like bad blocks or like an almost work that happened i think last week um instilling confidence in people uh you know is a force multiplier and if one of these things were to go down that would probably be a very negative setback for the space that would you know be sad in terms of you know money and users lost but it would also highlight kind of the longer term ramifications of why you would do something like roll up versus the side chain so you know it's very hard to see a barricade for layer twos right now um you know i think you know the other the other one i've heard is like you know all of these little zones won't work but i i've kind of gone over that and i think it's it's just a good thing that these things will be inherently separated at some level although loosely interoperable and i think we'll also realize that you know there's diminishing marginal returns to more and more composability like not everything needs to be on the same chain at the same time using the same applications again that's just not how these applications are worked or are built and you know most of the value of composability is historical composibility it's you know things that have built before you using a die using a set of smart contracts it's not kind of like every second every block interacting with them um so i think that's something we'll also kind of realize coming down the stretch so if this thesis plays out and like the advancement of later to you continues to play out what does this mean for other layer ones i read an article recently by kyle simani it was called social scalability versus technological scalability talked a little bit about the lack of composability with ethereum laser layer 2 strategy which i think you just talked about and addressed i think the other thing it talked about was um basically transaction throughput like like being transaction throughput layer one um like maximalist what's your take on all the other layer ones if your thesis is bullish um layer two ethereum what does this mean for them yeah i think um i was probably more worried about solana a couple months ago that i am today um and i think part of that is just kind of like coming to the event verizon where you realize that you know this chain you know won't be dying or going anywhere anytime soon and and it's just kind of going to look a lot like the people who are involved in it you know in the next two or three years and what do i mean by that i think it's going to be a lot of people like jump trading and a lot of people that trade on ftx um that are doing things like real-time trading uh on salona and and i think that'll be a perfectly fine use case in market for them um but i think you know ethereum will also shift like ethereum won't always be about retail defy um you know that will move to layer two then we'll move to sidechains we'll move to rollups the base layer of ethereum will be used by things like cbdcs you know government projects enterprises that really need something on chain it's really secure you know high shifts of scores of value that'll also be what it's used for and so you know like as solana tries to catch ethereum ethereum will be changing um and it'll look a lot different in the next you know a couple years um and solano will probably be where ethereum is today in two years focusing on these like really low common denominator retail use cases of speculative defy um i think and i you know i really hope that ethereum developed into something that's bigger than that um that's certainly on the roadmap with most of the large kind of enterprises that are building on it um but what does it mean for layer two's interoperate with other layer ones um you know there probably will be you know solano's coming in with wormhole they're coming out with uh you know evm compatibility for smart contracts um written in c plus plus and so i think there will be a good amount of kind of you know cross pollination i do think composability is largely off the table with that ecosystem but that's probably a benefit for ethereum to be honest um you know kind of constricting that activity focusing on ethereum um i think that's what we kind of want in the near term so chris breninski asked this question on twitter recently i'm going to ask it to you vance which is like kind of related to what we're talking about um it's kind of a question of multi is there going to be a multi-chain defy or is there going to be more an eth with layer 2 d5 right and you ask this will ethy in quotes get replaced by multi-chain d5 competitors or will ev5 become multi-chain defy as ethereum becomes the most interconnected network almost like a settlement network idea what's your take on how this all evolves i think i i think that's probably right like i i feel like it'll be like multi-chain youth first it'll be polycon orbit from optimism it's like those ecosystems are vibrant enough where something like polygon can be the size of bsc and so like i really do think the data is pointing towards a multi-chain ethereum feature whether it be uses a settlement network or you know for other layer ones or for other layer twos um so i do think that is probably the most likely case um especially especially given where we are with throughput on ethereum right now and i think that you know i would say you know guessing with an order of magnitude we'll get a 100x increase in throughput on the on the base layer at some point the next year or two um and that'll probably be good enough uh with sharding with roll ups to to get to you know the 50 to 100 000 transactions per second that you know like we need uh to kind of compete with um something like salon so um multi-chain will be real but you know the advantages of of this high transaction throughput um those are those have kind of diminishing margin returns um and i think ethereum gets there faster than people expect what does what would all this mean for eth as an asset or the ethereum network um some people ask the question of well if if ethereum layer 2 is successful then blocks based demand will just migrate off of ethereum and go directly to layer 2 and then layer 2s might increase in competition with with ethereum layer one and they're just not sure how that pans out what's your take on how that all pans out for where eath as an asset for ethereum yeah i think you know we want um we want a smaller share of a bigger pie like i think that's where ethereum goes you know philosophically over time um you know extracting maximum amount of fees on the base layer is just not a sustainable business model and so i think we want this proliferation of different security trade-offs and different layer twos and different side chains um to push the business forward knowing that eth is used as the transaction medium of exchange or it's used as some sort of economic substrate for the entire ecosystem and so you know i think that's you know fundamentally bullish and where we're headed um yeah and you know i think the most scary part of this will be um you know kind of uh things go to layer two people are wondering if heath has enough fees like just kind of like that that lag in terms of like demand for block space um and then maybe the fees on on the base layer dip but over time you know just the demand for block space is super high anecdotally like seeing things like big cloud where you know the person who built it literally had to build their own blockchain to do it um that just tells me that there's a ton of these people that are waiting to try these things that are just not able to do them right now and so i'm very very confident in the demand for block space and just a theorem being able to capture a smaller share of that over time but these markets will grow you know so so quickly if you if you look at um you know goldman's report on on uh software as a service cloud sales this year there were you know 80 billion dollars of cloud services sold worldwide this year you know ethereum has eight or nine billion dollars of transaction fees forecasted for for this year and so it's like these things are growing extremely quickly and i wouldn't be as concerned with the margins given that we're already so sizable it's just about the tam exploding which means that we have to really fully embrace these layer twos in all ways shapes and forms we can't be selective about you know what scaling solutions we like or don't like we just have to try things advance on a recent podcast you were on with frank from the block you said this line that uh you think that being ethereum first is in short supplies these days what did you mean by that yeah i mean uh we you know we're very public when we started our fund we didn't invest in ethereum killers we didn't invest in bitcoin um and to a lot of people that seemed like we were tying one hand behind our back as we you know tried to jump a motorcycle over like 12 school buses that were on fire but like you know basically what that meant to us is is basically putting a flag on the ground and saying like these are the values that we're interested in it's it's about open permissionless innovation it's about a culture of mentorship and bringing people into the space um and that was kind of what we identified with first and foremost because you know that was really what got michael and i into this space and and you know putting those values first um was harder when ethereum was down when you know competitors were hotter when other people were investing in base layers before pumping but you know it really has given us some credence with the ethereum developers who like what we're doing and you know just being able to play those long-term games is i think a hallmark of what we do at framework um and what that has meant is just being ethereum first and embracing those values um and so you know it's it's paid off for us uh pretty well and uh yeah i mean we have no plans to uh to embrace and have any other chains in the future um we're not maximum it's by any statements but um i do think you know people will say this is a biased view but you know bias becomes conviction in many different ways and i think this is just our path to getting there france i want to get your take on the ultrasound money meme is it a meme for the insular ethereum community for the d5 power users or is it a meme for the world i i think right now it's probably a meme for for the youth guys and you know like ultrasound money he's like do i think that is the best framing of the narrative i think it's a pretty good one but i i think the the probably the better one or or maybe a different one is it's just like you know ethereum is amazon web services for for the next web um like people want that clean technology comp and i don't think they're latching on like the thing that people don't identify with really in crypto is like this idea of like private currencies like that's just something that people haven't really interfaced with before you know putting this is something that's technology first and framing in that kind of lens for allocators in retail i think is you know the direction that i tend to go naturally but you know once you use the financial services and you understand that like oh i can stake this i can also borrow against it like this is something that can be immediately exchanged like it's deflationary like that is when that meme kind of like really the rubber meets the road for me so i think you want a little bit of the hook and then you want a little bit of like you know go down the rabbit hole meme and right now the youth is money is a little bit of the rabbit hole for me that's uh how would you say institutions are at with this rabbit hole with regards to eth uh we're we there's been a ton of excitement over the last like you know four six weeks about institutional allocation into ether the asset are we where are we in that phase of cycle are we still at the beginning of overall institutional allocation so maybe towards the mid w where are institutions in the ethereum rabbit hole would you say i would say we're at the very beginning you know the ebtc ratio change felt like you know probably myself and a couple other people being loud about this thesis you know you guys included about why ethereum is relatively more interesting and all the things that are happening all the catalysts that are going on i think that initial you know reprice of that ratio is basically all funds in space coming to that same conclusion but you know things like the ethe trust in canada things like you know institutions really starting to allocate off their balance sheet those are just starting to happen and it's a lot easier of a conversation than telling them about bitcoin telling them about bitcoin you have to you have to kind of set the pretense we're going into hyperinflation you know the us dollar is failing like you need like it's kind of like this like ever increasing crazy set of assumptions that you need to get people to buy into ethereum is much more of a relaxed conversation talking about technology talking about the future talking about reasons to be optimistic um you don't need to get to that same head space that you do to pitch bitcoin which makes the institutional conversation a lot easier when you have that and you can couple it with some sort of valuation methodology that is not based on stock to flow that is not based on you know the size of a comparable asset it's just really easy like it it does make our job a lot a lot easier you don't even have to have the like what really is money anyway conversation that makes you look at the weirdos they're not ready for the like the pill uh like taking all of that at once and this is also what matt hogan from bitwise says he's been on and they're doing more with defy tokens do you think this also carries over with defy tokens i mean his his commentary is basically this look uh institutional investors capital allocators in the space they've seen massive transformation through software so they've seen software eating the world because they saw the media they saw the e-commerce like they're seeing it eat music every single industry right and okay now it's coming for banks like okay we understand defy in a nutshell and what are d5 tokens well these are capital assets what are stocks oh similar to capital assets oh we can actually value these things we don't have to have it like this weird what is money conversation about valuation are are you seeing the same kind of things play out with um with defy tokens it's like this is actually an easier discussion with institutional investors once they wrap their head around the narrative than having the like what is sound money conversation the d5 the the tokens themselves are still really esoteric to allocators but like we're starting to build the kind of you know the myth making process of like let's talk about traditional fintechs let's comp them to d5 startups like let's look at the actual financials like once they see those things it becomes a lot easier um i think the things that they really have question marks about are like you know what is the organizational slash governance construct that's happening on this like what is a dow i've never heard of this before like generally the revenue the expenses all that stuff makes sense but like the organizational concepts are a little bit esoteric and so educating them on those is a little bit more difficult but you know the fundamentals once people realize the fundamentals of eath which i still think has not really happened um you haven't really seen like you know ryan alex put one together ryan berkman's put one together but like a good discounted cash flow that models out ethereum while the fees are actually accruing like post-1559 i think that will be the first time that people realize the fundamentals of ethereum and then that will just lead them to realize the fundamentals of other things um and so it'll be a process but you know i think by the fall people will be in a in a in a head space where uh you know they can actually buy and allocate towards these tokens off an institutional balance sheet i think the the big question that people will probably still have is like how persistent is this revenue and this kind of comes back to the idea of a super cycle like you know is maker only printing cash when we're in super cycle um but you know if this whole like super cycle meme is kind of like predicated on like these four-year bitcoin boom and bust cycles if each flips you know bitcoin like that materially de-risks this super cycle meme because like if we're just like building things and winning and users are onboarding like we don't need to have the super cycle team it just you know we can just have like you know there was no super cycle in mobile technology there was no super cycle in social media it's like we can just kind of redefine this asset class and that flipping would de-risk that you know question of you know are these persistent revenues you know quite significantly this is the thing of vance i'm still stunned that um investors still haven't fully uh like understood um defy tokens and so matt once again he wrote this in our newsletter recently imagine for a moment that uniswap was not a decentralized crypto product protocol but let's just say it was a well-funded silicon valley startup investors would literally be falling over themselves to sing its praises like look at this business it was nothing two years ago now it's generating 250 million in revenues per month that's like an incredible story and uh i mean we just saw last week hayden adams making the wall street journal like for the first time but like i can't believe this story is still underground wi-fi it's price earnings ratio for may 12. like with this kind of growth it's just insane so you still think there's a ways to go and it's mostly because investors don't understand still what defy tokens are and they can't grok the organizational structures of these things is is that sort of why yeah and i i think like we're at the very top of the informational totem pole and like we realized all these things we can tell the difference between dogecoin and maker and bitcoin like they kind of lump all this stuff into one and they assume that you know it's only because bitcoin is up is that everything that's interesting that is true to some extent um i think you know if we see a flipping if we see some other asset carry the day with more productive you know narrative like we can just assume that these capitals will go on forever because this is just new things like there is no super cycle um and so as much as i am a believer in the super cycle i think like almost the abandonment of that meme like after we have some sort of flipping we'll be really healthy for this space because we're not relying on like the habiting to generate these cash flows like these aren't tied to some weird esoteric you know bitcoin um you know narrative like if these are just endogenous it becomes a lot easier to tell that story fans the to me the story of 2020 was all about on chain daos with yearn year endow sushi dao all these these organizations that have smart contracts baked into the ethereum protocol that is generating fees and all of a sudden there's a group of people uh focusing around building out that structure on chain dials lately we've seen a bunch of off chain dows come about uh meta factory comes to mind get coin dao bankless dao all of a sudden we have these uh things that are daos because they have a token but there's nothing on chain about them uh how where do you see this trend going over the next you know you know one year and then also one decade um and and you just mean kind of dowsed generally yeah yeah yeah dallas generally that not aren't necessarily protocols but are just more digital organizations yeah i think um you know so we we made an investment in a company called satellite which uh which basically is a non-custodial discord you know none of your your information is stored on discord servers it's all managed on ipfs and textile um it runs on ethereum and solana like it it just kind of is like a better version of discord in a lot of ways and one of their first primitives is going to be just like the ability to tokenize and down your community very effectively and i just think these things are just like a new organizational construct just like the joint stock company enable a lot of innovation like you're going to see dows just proliferate and be some sort of function of you know like either a noses multisig or like a or a general dow framework um and you know those are just going to kind of explode the design space for how you interact with communities how you manage you know a certain set of initiatives and how you incentivize people and i think it's just going to be inherently bullish for just human coordination the more you can kind of get people in a room get them in a good mood get them incentivized like good things tend to happen um i think that's kind of been a lot of the uh the headline through line for a lot of things in crypto um and you know i think that'll just continue to proliferate uh whether it's off chain or on chain you know i don't really have a perspective on on which one is best it seems like off chain comes with a lot of risks in terms of just you know how do you set it up legally how do you kind of manage things um but you know very bullish on on both versions of the future in terms of house van so far we've seen um crypto native daos really take off do you think there will be other non-crypto native communities that start to come on board or non-traditionally crypto native like i'm thinking of what you just said of one of the like next bold cases for layer two is really the gaming community you think we'll have like gaming guilds formed owls or where do you think the next generation of dallas might come from outside of crypto uh i mean you know the three main areas are are defy their games and then they're kind of these like social constructs um in social constructs or kind of like things like big cloud or just kind of further afield web 3 ideas i i generally do think that you know in 10 years we will probably see north of 10 of world gdp come from dao's like i do think it's that big of a transformational shift um and i think a lot of the products that were built um you know over the past two or three years were just ahead of their time like things like aragon like you know if if they would have built that with a little bit different branding a little bit you know more streamlined a little bit more enterprise use case like i think they really could have pulled that off and built a big business um and i think there will be second comings of those that are more enterprise oriented and probably more a bit more streamlined with the tooling that we have today um but you know these things are going to get adopted in mass just because it is you know you can layer in identity permissions you know all the things that you would traditionally expect from an enterprise um and just have it much more streamlined and effective on shade advancing our first podcast we talked about a bunch of these uh defy native founders donnie kane uh and we were comparing and contrasting what does it mean to uh be a startup founder of a traditional traditional startup you know tech startup c-corp startup versus what it's like to be a d5 founder and uh you you said that when you are talking to these founders who have visions of issuing a token and then handing over governance to the community you say that you ask them are you really about that life uh and i thought that was a great line uh but i also want to expand uh that same sort of um vibe to a broader set of of people rather than just d5 founders maybe just defy users how would you illustrate or classify what it means to be about that life just as a defy user these days what does it mean to to be about the defy life being your own bank is terrifying you know straight up like i don't think we need to sugarcoat it for for anybody that's on crypto but you know the access to financial services that you get is is one to two orders of magnitude better than what you would receive in a traditional banking environment um and so for me it's just it's about accepting those trade-offs and and realizing that you can get to this you know alternative financial services stack where you know you have nfts if if you want something visual you have defies your financial services trails you can buy bitcoin if you're not that into the us dollar and like together this kind of like comprises it's very complete very interesting you know alternative financial services stack but only if you're willing to go there um and you know the risk is you send your money the wrong address the risk is uh your computer gets hacked the risk is um you know your mom gets on your computer it hits a few keys and deletes you know your theory like like there are non-zero risks to using e5 that don't exist in traditional finance and so for me it's it's just kind of like about you know being about that life in in in the retail deep context is like mostly about your path of getting there like you usually heard about it from someone that you know or trust or you know there was some asset that got you hooked and you and you kind of you know went into the breach to go explore it and you know you were up late on your laptop trying to figure it out or troubleshoot issues with metamasks and and that's really kind of what that means to me you know alongside accepting that yeah it's a lot scarier and it'll get easier but like you know you're kind of on the other side of this divide and the grass is just much greener over here why are you about that life vance you know i was i think uh you know i just have a very particular kind of set of skills and temperament that really kind of made this space just a natural fit for me i was always looking for something in technology that had a lot of you know both optimism and a lot of edge and this is something that really kind of satisfied you know both of those aspects of my personality um just by being involved in and crypto's always been just so welcoming to people like me um that you know really kind of that's what it's meant for me at least it's just like the inclusive nature of open informationless innovation and you know if you think that you you are made of the right stuff like you can go out and try like there's no one that's going to stop you and you know that kind of gets to my point about dogecoin like i'm never going to tell anybody to not speculate on that stuff i think it's awesome in a lot of ways um but it's just about kind of being able to choose your own destiny and then that's certainly um compared to being you know stuck in a web 2 company where your box is this big and you know you can only um you know do the things that are in your role like this is pretty much infinitely interesting and inclusive which is just very welcome a pioneer a particular set of skills liam neeson's style that's what vance is saying balancer is d5's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in the d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an

bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right let's use those set of skills vance cause we promised the listener this toward the end of this podcast we would do some predictions at the end let's start where we left off so total locked value in d5 i think your original estimate in the next 12 months let's say was between 100 to 500 million um let's start there would you revise that was nine months ago that was not billion sorry i said million but billion nine months ago would you revise that estimate or what do you think like where do you think we'll we will be in the next one to three years time for total locked value in d5 yeah so i think um when i guess the things i try to guess within orders of magnitude i find if i get within you know an order of magnitude i usually correct what i'm investing in it um you know just point being like if i assume that deep i will get between 100 billion and 1 trillion like you know and i invest in d5 like i'm just going to be right on the financial side so that's why i try to kind of employ that methodology um and so still have three months left i think we'll get over 100 billion um so i think i'll probably rewrite on that one but yeah i think you will you know i think um [Music] you know we're just going to see this accelerate from like 100 to 500 to a trillion like the trillion mark will be when we are kind of uh just you know too big for regulators not to no longer ignore us like things will change we will have some sort of kyc um you know there will be some sort of you know regulatory jurisprudence over the space um but that will be really bullish because we'll be able to interact with the legacy and institutions and that will just in turn accelerate the fly with a lot more tvl and i think we could be there uh you know probably in the next two years um that i mean guys like you know everyone expects you to go up a lot same with bitcoin you know most of collateral is in those two native assets okay we're going to have more stablemind flows you know there are probably there's 3.2 trillion dollars of cash sitting on the sidelines right now um in institutional allocators that are trying to allocate to you know everything from real estate to startups to crypto like some fraction of that will come in maybe not fully a third like a full trillion but you know i'd be willing to bet something like you know a fifth or a six comes into crypto so i think there's there's good um you know rationale for that that to be the case um i think the even bigger one is just like things like monthly active users daily active users yeah where are we now monthly active users i mean metamask is saying like like five million i don't know if that's a way to measure it i've also seen estimates of like you know there's maybe two million or so active addresses on ethereum so it's within an order of magnitude we're in the single digit millions probably some might argue a little lower in the hundreds of thousands still like that's where we are now maybe with monthly active users where do you think we'll be in the next you know one to three years so i think i think uniform is probably close to having their first you know million monthly active user month um you know things like zapper are not far behind um and so i think we're going to get to you know the first dap with with 10 million monthly active users probably in the next year um i just like the main thing and what we talked about earlier was like i mean what needed to stop on ethereum was not being able to onboard people you know me having to send someone twenty thousand dollars of ethereum just to get them like trading and interested like with polygon not only is it things become cheaper we can just onboard millions and millions and millions of new people um and so i think we're going to see like our first 10 million monthly active user dap at some point in the next year and it may be something that has like this really interesting hybrid front end which is an app you know in a protocol on the back end maybe something like dharma but like we'll get there pretty pretty handily what about total locked value on layer two any predictions for that i'm not actually sure where we are right now i think you mentioned some stats around polygon which is like in the in the billions already maybe close to double digit billions so where are we now and where do you think we will be on layer two for total locked value yeah we're basically at 10 billion i'm just gonna round up you know seven or eight to ten and i think we're gonna get to probably you know 100 in the next year um and you know just that the nature of ethereum will change a lot um i think most tbl will still be concentrated on the base layer but there's a large cohort of people that will never interact with base layer ethereum so i think a lot of the retail deposits end up living on layer two on a roll-up um and you know exchanges are just able to do withdrawals and deposits automatically there's no need to bridge or withdraw to a layer one um so i think that will probably be you know 100 billion would probably be my guess as to where we are by the end of the year in terms of tbl just on on layer 2's probably probably a little bit more hundreds of billions on layer twos in a year or so uh getting total locked value in d5 into the trillions in a three-year time horizon sounds like both eth and bitcoin are headed to trillions and maintaining that in three years is what vance is saying um cool man good predictions look we are front running the opportunity here on bank list and every time we've had you on we've we've managed to um like front run some pretty significant opportunities you've dropped a lot of insights for us here uh vance i'm curious what is framework up to these days because you guys seem to be doing a lot like growing in addition to having these institutional conversations you're also like growing headcount and i know you've got a labs and a venture side tell us what you guys are doing in this space i see you very much as a crypto native fund vc firm so what does a crypto native vc firm look like and do at this junction in time yeah you know a lot of ventures is where i spend uh most of my time but you know as as things like you know you see someone like sam bank and freed and savannah um you know you kind of you start to reason through like what do i need to compete with someone like that and and what we need to compete with someone like that is it's just an entity like labs that you know can trade you know hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars per day on these markets keep them in line keep them healthy and so a lot of our focus and our efforts have been towards building out you know a lot of kind of the active participation stuff that we do on chain and just being kind of one of the arbiter stewards of just keeping the space you know safe when things are really volatile um even if it's not the highest and best use of of our own capital at the moment like you know we're willing to take kind of take one for the team in terms of helping you know protocols stabilize the pegs of their their staple coins stabilize their derivatives markets um that's definitely something that we've really kind of leaned into recently um so that's been a big effort of ours um and then also just building out you know just the venture firm that we wish we had as founders and defy um you know all these services that you would need you know recruiting um smart contract auditing you know those are things which really are you know the first audit you can get right now for openstack one is in september um so like you know helping solve that bottleneck is a big part of what we're trying to think through right now and we have the talent to do it but you know really i think of framework less as a venture fund and more as just of a company um you know venture is one of many things that we do to kind of push the space forward but we're hyper focused on just adding as much value to kind of both the on-chain ecosystem and the founders that are building the products you know off-chain as we can well bankless nation i think you can tell why we brought vance spencer back on to the podcast to hear his takes and if you are listening to this on monday the 7th when this podcast gets released we are having vance on a defy panel on wednesday at 1 p.m pst with spencer noon and santiago santos from parify capital uh and so that is going to be live streamed on the bankless youtube and so we are going to put vance in a couple of the other in my opinion just absolute leaders of it defy thought on a panel together and see what happens when we put all their brains into one spot so put that on your calendars it's coming wednesday at 1pm and i'm really looking forward to it thank you guys so much it's been it's been amazing always a pleasure to be on pinkles and thanks for all that you do really appreciate it awesome vance thanks again man it's great great to keep up with you doing a lot of awesome things in the space bankless listeners
