from the permissionless conference in palm beach in florida shout out to the bankless fam and to block works they have put on an amazing conference here so uh i have a lot of confidence this conference will go on again next year i highly recommend you come check it out palm beach is beautiful albeit highly overpriced but it's okay i'm over it i'm having a good time and it's just wonderful to see see people in in person if you've never gone if you've never done the conference thing in the nft world i really recommend it it's it's it's beautiful vibes here but let's get right into what's going on in the market this week all right the bear market it persists but it seems to be stabilizing i don't know it seems like there's less blood in the streets this week than there was previously uh things have stayed fairly steady i've been i will say honestly impressed with the nft market i thought there was maybe more of a downturn to come but i think thing prices have held fairly steady especially if you're in blue chips i mean you have things like uh board apes i think the ape ecosystem dropped to new lows they dropped below 100 eath for the first time in a long time not new lows i mean certainly it's been lower than that but you know things are wobbly and you know from all-time highs things are down but the market hasn't entirely collapsed which i think is is bullish some bullishness in this bear market but i think there's a question of it's just a is this a temporary respite are we gonna are we gonna face more hardship ahead or are we bouncing along the bottom here and really this is where things are gonna bottom out and at some point again we'll we'll see that we'll see the rise i think there's there's two schools of thought here that i'm really following around where we are i think one school of thought that's maybe more optimistic comes from raul pal raul pal yeah he's a macro investor i've mentioned him before on this podcast he goes on bank list quite a bit super sharp guy uh if you haven't listened to him on any of the bankless episodes i recommend it i think he's he's a great storyteller so he makes he makes macro trends feel like you're hearing a story about what's going on in the world and raul's fundamental argument is that cpi which is the consumer purchase index consumer price index basically tracks the cost of consumer goods is a lagging indicator so while it still appears like we have really bad inflation that's probably not the case and that prices are actually on their way down and that it just hasn't really been reflected in the cpi and in some of these other indicators uh fully okay maybe um and the argument there for raul and the reason he would be bullish is that means that the federal reserve's job is done they don't have to hike interest rates anymore uh the inflation is on its way down and uh and if anything he thinks that uh we're in a recession we'll you know that'll be formalized at the end of this quarter and that the fed we may actually have more stimulus coming in the future along with no interest rate hikes and then that'll be how we'll pull ourselves out of recession kind of a wild bet to me that we're just going to start printing money again and and uh sort of this is a cycle that will never end seems to be his prognosis but an interesting idea basically consumers are already starting to feel it you do see this in china retail sales are down big time in china so again this this fundamental argument that consumers are spending less it hasn't showed up in some of the indicators yet but it will and so actually inflation is on its way down already okay that's one school of thought the other school of thought not necessarily diametrically opposed to this but coming from jason friedman he's on the all-in podcast for folks who love all in uh smart vc guy big in the science and and technology biotech worlds he his argument is that actually we consumers right now are keeping afloat on credit you know you had this dynamic where we printed a ton of money during the pandemic we we gave out a ton of stimulus checks people got used to an inflated lifestyle they got a bunch of money that you know wasn't really theirs you could argue whatever they then lost a bunch of money in the in the market crash and the crypto crash but they got used to a certain lifestyle and to keep those lifestyles afloat people are now spending on credit and as a result of that there's a credit bubble that is forming and there's a credit bubble that will burst if that happens i think you know there's a lot more pain to come a credit bubble bursting if folks really are right now propping themselves up on credit we could be seeing that in the crypto market you could have people buying on credit in the crypto markets and and in the nft space i think in particular even probably more likely that you've people uh keeping themselves afloat on credit who are into nfts than even into just crypto at large or into d5 um and i think that could spell more trouble ahead i have to say i'm a bit of a cynic i tend to be a little bit with jason friedman on this it feels to me like there's probably more pain to come uh in terms of we haven't actually seen the full hit to consumers yet in this recession you know the interest rate hikes recently went into effect i don't think the money has fully you know bled out of the system yet so there's still some cash around i think there might be more pain to come more pain to hit the nft market make of that what you will i'm continuing my strategy of just like holding on for dear life i'm not selling i'm not particularly buying anything other than ethereum right now though i'm sure there's i know there's there's bargain deals to be gotten there's some good nfts to be buying i don't happen to be buying them right now i'm still sort of white knuckling it through because i think there could be more pain to come but really who the heck knows none of us know macro is impossible to predict but those are some some uh thinking that i've been tracking and make of it what you will i also will say this i think there's a debate right now around what's causing inflation and there's this simple narrative that's like what are you talking about we printed all of this money throughout the pandemic obviously that's causing inflation if you print a bunch of money that causes inflation i find that argument a little weird because we've printed lots of money in the past quantitative easing was something we started after 2008 and we didn't see crazy see like inflation and consumer goods when we after quantitative easing the first time around so printing a bunch of money now the difference here is they'd say okay but quantitative easing we didn't give it directly to people we didn't have the same stimulus checked effect to me the inflation thing it makes more sense to me that it's actually about supply chain issues and that the supply chain has taken a hit and that that's actually the bigger cause of inflation than the stimulus checks i think the stimulus checks a lot of that went into the market and was propping up these growthy tech stocks your meme stocks propping up crypto to an extent popping up nfts to an extent but the inflation we're seeing in like consumer goods feels like it's more of a supply chain problem and so uh the cp so so i'm i'm skeptical that it's uh it's it can be solved simply through these interest rate hikes i don't know we'll see what happens um raul paul actually made that point i thought it was an interesting one he said we conflate inflation and debasement of currency a lot and that when the fed prints a lot of money uh it's the basement of currency and that's not exactly the same as inflation and prices going up so again highly recommend you check out raul pal and his interview on bankless he's great i learn a lot from him take him with a grain of salt nobody can know exactly what's going on but uh i think he's he's an interesting thought leader in the space okay that's macro i want to talk about instagram nfts so we've been teased this for a while zuckerberg talked about how instagram is going to be adding nfts i believe it's south by southwest earlier this year and we knew it was coming uh and now it's here it's it's still in somewhat of a beta rollout it's not available everywhere but you have select creators where they have this nft tab on their profile and they can show off their nfts directly in the app i think in the immediate term this isn't a big deal in the immediate term especially we're in a bear market but even if we weren't i don't think this is suddenly the move that makes the crypto market or the nft market take off and suddenly we've onboarded a trillion new people to nfts but what i think this is i think this is incredibly meaningful in the long term and adam most siri who is the head of instagram seems to get it i will turn you to he did a ted talk very recently we'll link to it where he says hey look we are going through this essentially paradigm shift where we are moving from power lying with platforms like instagram to powers lying to the power line with creators and his his posture seems to be like great as somebody who runs instagram that actually doesn't bother me that doesn't scare me i think it's a great thing we as instagram just need to learn how to adapt and play in this new ecosystem and he paints a picture of essentially creators getting to own their audiences it's a picture you'd hear painted by any sort of web 3 maxi which is very cool to hear coming from the head of instagram where he's like creators should own their audiences essentially through nfts if i like a creator i can buy or maybe i get gifted whatever the case may be a creator's nft and now that makes my audience portable across different social platforms where if you own a carly nft and you're on instagram i can maybe be giving private content special instagram content to my nft holders because instagram will allow you to plug this nft into their ecosystem they'll validate that this nft is legitimate and authentic and then you can take that same nft login to twitter twitter will verify you've got an authentic nft and i can also give you special content as carly the creator to you my fan on twitter the platform and that suddenly you have a certain amount of portability from one social platform to another that we've never had before i think this is fascinating and you know i do it a decent amount of thinking about will web3 ultimately spell the demise for these centralized social platforms and i don't think we have enough information to know the answer yet these these social media platforms have a ton of advantages they have a ton of money they have all of the network effects and it's going to be hard for web3 platforms to come in and take them down on the web3 side the the advantages in theory that we have if you're trying to make a decentralized social network for example is potentially much a much better monetization proposition both for creators and then for the audiences themselves and audiences getting to monetize their fandom their engagement in ways they can't on web 2 platforms and if we can get that model right and we can actually bring that to life then yeah i think there's a very compelling pitch for web3 platforms to ultimately dethrone these web 2 platforms but when you have web 2 platforms you've got adam siri at instagram who seems to understand the shift that's going on in the world they're gonna fight like hell to to keep their audiences and seemingly by doing the right things which is by giving uh giving creators more interoperability in terms of being able to bring their audiences from one platform to another so very interesting things again in the short term i think it's um it's not going to suddenly be the be the catch-all solution for getting the mainstream into nfts but in the long term i think it's a big deal and of course you play this out and you can envision a world where people are are buying nfts directly through instagram they're going to an artist instagram profile liking a piece of artwork liking an nft you know the artist has already minted it now you just go in you can buy it now it's on your instagram to show off i also think uh something i think quite a bit about is owning moments in movies owning moments of books there are so many pieces of media that have been influential in my life whether that's movies or books or tv shows and even within those movies books or tv shows moments within those movies books or tv shows that are like speak to you and it's never occurred to me before to post a clip from legally blonde for example for which there are some uh seminal moments that i think have impacted my life it never occurred to me to post those clips on my instagram for example because that's just not really how i've used instagram how my peers have used instagram but there's a psychological shift that i think potentially happens with nfts where suddenly it feels natural to share those things to buy an nft of a movie moment and to share it as part of your brand as part of your persona and it's not that that's not something you could do today i could clip a moment from legally blonde and post it but i don't and i think nfts might be the catalyst for a psychological shift where i do because now hey maybe i spent 50 bucks on my favorite legally blonde moment and it makes more sense now to make that a part of my brand so seeing more of that come into play on instagram where it's not just about artists and creators it's also about new ways we're sharing things about ourselves and we're signaling to the world who we are by sharing book moments movie moments that are really coming in the form of nfts so very excited to see where the instagram nft thing plays out impressed frankly by the extent to which adam osiris seems to to get what's going on check out his ted talk but at the end of the day i'm always going to be rooting for our decentralized platforms and i think that's i think that's where we want the world to move of course okay next thing i want to talk about is doodles ah doodles the project that seems to be impervious to the bull market or to the bear market they they have fallen a bit but that seemed more a result of uh the their duplicator claim has already gone live so i think people claimed their their duplicators and then seoul and then put listed their their their doodle okay so if you have not been tracking doodles announced that all doodle holders would be able to claim something called a duplicator on the doodle's website uh they have not said much about what the duplicator is but i have some theories i have no idea if my theory my theories are like hot takes or if everybody's already talking about this to be honest i i was trying to find some news articles to see if they were hypothesizing what the duplicator were and and duplicators are what they do and nobody has as of yet i'm sure the community has has picked up on this but i'll tell you what i think the duplicator is but first so we'll we'll just run through this um what what the team has said publicly is that the duplicators are devices that will be usable in their next product release haven't said what that product release will be of course and that more information will be revealed and seemingly their new product will be unveiled at nft nyc so about a month from now in late june we'll know more with that said the team has been leaving us pretty obvious breadcrumbs about where they're going for a while now i had jordan castro also known as poopy on the podcast probably a couple months ago at this point and i think he started to tease what this ultimately would be and uh so i'll talk about what he said on the pod um he clearly indicated they were playing around with an idea where for example you could lease your doodle back to the doodle team the doodle team could then create multiple different versions offshoots of your your original doodle to sell to other people with the goal of getting more people into the doodles ecosystem but because they're leasing or licensing the doodle from you they can then pay royalties pay a percentage to the original holder so that the original holder of the doodle is rewarded while they're simultaneously bringing more people into the ecosystem i will say i think this is where doodles is so a step ahead of so many nft projects in terms of the way they've thought about how to grow the doodle's brand without diluting existing doodle holders i think the classic way we've seen this done in the nft space is of course with airdrops and you're a board a polder you get a dog dropped to you you get your mutant serum and i think this this doodles model again i'm hypothesizing as to what they're going to do based on things that that jordan has said is just different and what i so appreciate is they they move the say forward with everything they do and i know that's a really clear goal of theirs and everything they do feels like it has intention i want to say something on air drops in just a minute here i'm going to pause we'll get there but so i don't know that the duplicator will will be exactly that model i don't know that you're exactly leasing it back to the doodle team and then they're you know creating multiple copies but but clearly and this is again probably not that hot of a take given the name is duplicator i think clearly the goal here is to expand the ecosystem of holders so that more people can buy into the project while making sure that the the value is accruing back to their original holders jordan and evan to the founders of the project also recently went on uh i think it was nft now it was an nft now podcast and um and and jordan said something about wanting to create like an infinite supply for the base doodles but this but but scarcity comes from traits and i think this is also something that doodles is really at the forefront of which is understanding that these nfts are fundamentally about identity and it's about digital identity so we saw this with wrapped doodles when they did the space doodles which was a wrapped doodle what they were essentially allowing is for you to take your initial avatar your initial nft or pfp or initial doodle and turn it into an astronaut effectively right turn it into a space doodle turn it into something else and when jordan and i talked on the podcast he mentioned like you want to do you want to be able to do this in a lot of different ways hey are you do you want to represent yourself as a chef in the in the metaverse great you can now wrap your doodle and put on a chef's hat or you want to put on a different t-shirt because you want to put on the t-shirt of your favorite band and you want your your doodle to wear your favorite bands t-shirt great you can wrap your doodle and now they wear that band t-shirt and so pushing on this idea of allowing for a lot of different traits to represent identity is something that they have been thinking about and playing with a lot i i really think this team stands apart in terms of how thoughtful they are in the space and i want to say i don't know that that necessarily means it will always correlate to floor price like we have not yet as a space figured out how to value nft projects because it's so new we don't know we don't know yet so there's there's a world in which i don't know doodles the doodles floor place price collapses for any number of reasons but that doesn't in any way detract to me from the the fundamental thoughtfulness of this team and the way that they push things forward okay um i i want to say something else that i want to say about air drops so in the interview with the nft now team jordan said he gets asked a lot poopy said that he gets asked a lot why hasn't doodles done an airdrop and on the surface this is a really natural question understandable that they're getting asked that because most of the major projects have done airdrops and again i love that doodles has not done an airdrop so here's a note on airdrops a team should only do an airdrop if they're very clear as to why they're doing an airdrop and only if they think it is value accretive to their initial set of holders i want to make a comparison here to stock buybacks in the traditional web 2 world i've mentioned warren buffett several times in this podcast i've been talking about him more recently my first job out of college was at a hedge fund that was a value investing fund that wanted to follow warren buffett to the grave like loved warren buffett so i i got a lot of my early financial learnings from from warren which is funny that i'm not in the nft space because warren would not touch this space with a 10-foot freaking pole but i remember him talking about stock buybacks and he was like companies should only engage in stock buybacks if they believe that their stock is fundamentally super undervalued and unfortunately that's not the only time you see companies do stock buybacks companies will do stock buybacks because they want to boost their share price of their stock in the most cynical examples i think you see you have executives at times whose compensation is tied to share price and they want the share price to get a boost for the sake of their own compensation so they go in and buy up shares even even though the stock itself is not undervalued and it's not necessarily the the price is not necessarily uh overly attractive now on the surface this feels like it benefits shareholders in the short term or in fact it does benefit shareholders in the short term right because they buy back buy back a bunch of shares it boosts the share price if you're a shareholder great you just watch the share price get boosted and isn't that lovely but in the long term it actually hurts shareholders and in the long term it hurts the company because it wasn't a good use of capital buying properly valued or call it overly valued stock is is not a good long-term strategy for the company and i feel that way about airdrops right if you're doing an airdrop because you don't know what else to do as a project and you think it'll give you a short-term boost and your community will be excited in the short term you're probably right it will give you a short-term boost but in the long term you've actually just created more holders you've created more expectation you've got more people you're beholden to and you haven't actually served a higher strategy so i think air drops they're used to just prolong a ponzi scheme i mean that's the truth right if something has value and you're just doing an air drop so you can have more things that have value to prop up the price of the original thing like you know that's an unsustainable uh system and dynamic so i think projects need to be really really thoughtful before they do an air drop and i there are obviously projects that have done it well everyone knows i'm a fan of of dead fellas a lot of these blue chip projects that have been airdrops i get it again you want to be able to expand the amount of holders expand the reach of your collection fine but i am very wary of airdrops that feel like they're for an airdrop's sake so again just commend jordan commend the doodles team for not bowing to pressure and thinking from a first principal's perspective of like okay what is the point of the airdrop in theory it's to get more holders into into your community are there better are there more interesting ways to achieve that same end uh and we'll see how what comes with the duplicator what comes moving forward but i love it i love that they are doing things the way they're doing them if you're starting on your nft journey you

fellas i just mentioned them did i call them deadheads i may have just called them deadheads if i mentioned them earlier if i did i apologize i meant dead fellas they did the dead friends drop they've done airdrops fan of their project of course i've talked about them many times interviewed betty as my first guest okay the news coming out of dead fellas we have they signed with uta which i think we've mentioned before on this podcast uta being one of the big three agencies along with cia and wme no real news about what they're planning with uta just that they're excited for the partnership it seems to suggest that there'll be something in terms of entertainment whether that movie that's movies tv but these these managers you know uta these these talent agencies deal in everything so who knows what they have cooking with uta but exciting news and then they announced that they have hired a woman named steph chapman to be their director of project management and marketing staff has a background from netflix so also from the entertainment industry again i think that's striking and um so bullish dead fellas is one of those projects that is in it for the long haul i bought them shortly before the market like really crashed so i'm down on them a little bit right now but very happy to be a holder i think they are just going to continue to build and um the bear market isn't slowing them down at all so always excited to see what will be coming out of dead fellas also betty i believe i don't know if she's doxing herself for the first time like fully but she's going to be in person at vcon so i think that we are all going to learn like who betty is which i'm about to talk a little bit about and on teams and on projects i've said it's nuanced before because i love betty and i believe in betty and i believe in the dead fellas team they are on and on team but i do in general tend to have a strong strong preference towards doxxed team teams so anyways i'm excited to meet betty i'm excited to to see her in person and um if you're going to vcon hit me up okay the last project i want to talk about in this perhaps slightly shorter episode than usual in part because i'm at the permissionless conference right now and a little distracted is okay bears and not okay bears if you've been avoiding looking at the market recently because of everything that's going on i understand here's the the tl dr ok bears is a solana based project that launched a few weeks ago and did very well in fact it recently surpassed it it did more volume than any ethereum based project which is the first time that's happened the first time a solana-based nft project has surpassed all based projects in terms of one day volume so it did 18 million i believe usd in sales recently so um big deal and i want to talk about okay bears as a project but the it it hit new levels this week because we saw a project called not okay bears which was a direct rip-off of okay bears launch and also do a lot i did like three and a half thousand uh eath volume on open c before open c shut it down it got dmc aid right it was it was for being a copycat and there's some theories as to why it took that long for openc to to dmca them one cynical conspiracy is that open seat there was so much trading volume happening on on the the not okay bears page and coinbase one or openc wanted their two and a half percent royalties on that so they waited a little while before they shut it down who knows uh but that has made i think the okay bears project just surface that much more to the four because any time there's these controversies with dmca's and things it seems to boost a project's profile so let's talk about okay bears first and and i'll say a couple more things about the not okay bears project and my thoughts on this okay okay bears it started on magic eden which is the solana native marketplace but we now know openc is offering solana projects on openc so you can also trade ok bears on openc it is getting called the next board ape yacht club this to me is a sell sign i have said it before i think it is a red freaking flag when somebody when people start saying this is an xp you know board api club especially very early in a project's founding it usually means that it's super super hyped and it's due for a bit of a downturn that's my personal opinion we'll see what happens right now last i checked it it was sitting at a little over the equivalent of five eth a little over 11 thousand dollars which is about i think it was like 230 sold sold price is about 51 right now so that's what it's saying here's what okay bears seem to do to distinguish themselves and to get this big pop my understanding and i'm not deep into the solana ecosystem i have to admit but is that there hadn't been a really super well-branded project to come out on solana that a lot of solana projects were focused on more short-term utility short-term road map plays i've heard arguments that that's because trading on solana is cheap right that's the whole point it doesn't have the gas views of ethereum and so there's a lot of quick trading flipping and there's there's a lot of focus on short-term utility short-term plays in the solana ecosystem and so what okay bears seem to do to distinguish themselves is come out with a a real branding play something on the order of an azuki in terms of creating a feel and and an ip that might have lasting potential that's that's what the bulls would say at least and i think if you go to the okay bears website you feel some of this it's it's a solid website they have created a feel with them their their whole premise is it's okay to be okay yeah we're gonna make it it's a very positive beautiful vibey thing around just being okay and of course they have some puns on the fact that they're called okay bear so they have the bear market as in a market place but it's the bear market hahaha and you know you have to see it to really understand it right you go to the website you can you can see that they have they have a brand and they have a feeling they have a vibe and they've done a good job with it and that seems to be something distinct from other projects that have come out of solana so that seems to be what's fueled their their initial success they also have these emotive cartoony bears that again are getting compared to the er emotive cartoony-nish uh cartooniness cartooniness of board apes which okay how many freaking cartoony animals have we seen like dear god that should just no longer be noteworthy in my opinion but all right here's my qualm with ok bears acknowledging that they have done a decent job branding themselves it's once again just an opacity around the team and their full backgrounds like god dang it man like how many times do we have to go through an azuki scenario to learn that we should expect more transparency from founders and i uh it's i get it it's tough the anon thing is tough i just talked about deadheads i'm obviously a fan of betty she's been a non i there's always nuance to things there are there are a non-teams that i'm willing to bet on but i i just need to see more than i see from so many of these and on teams in order to be willing to make the bet so let's let's break this down in the context of okay bears first of all they don't have a team link on their website they have a tab called the park on the website which how are you supposed to know what that means but if you go to the park you see if you and you scroll down then you'll find the team the the the seemingly leader of the project is a guy named kaise i believe is how you pronounce it k-a-i-s he gives a little bit of a background but again there's no linkedin there's no way to actually track who this person is irl he seems to be fairly anonymous i listened to a twitter space or part of a twitter space with the team and i like i wanted to shake the interviewer it was a it was a magic eat-in again the solana marketplace it was the magic eden team it was somebody from the magic eden team who was interviewing these founders and his first question was like hey you know people want to know your backgrounds and experiences can you talk about that and subi who's the engineer i suppose or kaise anyways one of the the people who was on the call was like talked about how they'd met doing bit birds like another nft project that was open source or whatever and talked about bit birds and the way they kept that art simple and minimalistic and learned from it and whatever without actually talking saying anything about his own personal background or experience or you know professional experience like i just i can't do it i i won't do it like i i'm not i i interviewed betty i felt like i got a really good sense of her she's anonymous but i felt like you strike me as an adult who has had a tremendous amount of professional experience who i trust to build a global brand i don't know who you are but that's the vibe i'm getting and i'm gonna i'm gonna go with that vibe i just don't get it from these other teams when you're you're learning about them on a twitter space and the tech is breaking down and so okay there's my thought on okay bears i'm not saying the project won't do well i have no idea i'm just saying i'm not investing in it i'm not doing it i'm not buying a project that where i really can't get a sense of fundamentally who the people behind the project are and i respect people to write right to privacy i don't believe in doxxing people but personally i'm gonna vote with my money and i'm not putting my money towards a team that i don't really fully understand with all that said azuki of course is sitting at like a 13th floor it like promptly you know spun back up from the 70s where it was but i've said i i think the azuki team is actually very talented i've now heard zagabond on spaces i've read zagaban's writing you know some moral qualms there but i think an incredibly smart talented person it it might be a team i think it's a team that can execute okay also i'm like guys we're in a bear market there are there are lots of good opportunities like we don't need to throw money at any old project these days which okay bears has a decent branding play i'm not trying to say they're any old project but like we can we can up our standards it's a bear market now they have to compete for our money projects have to compete for our money uh you know not the other way around okay and then not okay bears look this is this is crazy i can't even believe we're still having these kinds of conversations not okay bears total ripoff project launched on ethereum people made a bunch of money on it crazy volume the wildest thing is so so not okay bears launches on ethereum does crazy volume gets dmca it gets taken off the open c platform promptly a new not okay bears twitter account starts up that rapidly gets more followers than the original not okay bears twitter account they're now trying to launch a project i mean it's this space is just ridiculous and how quickly these projects get spun up and then i mean it's just gambling at that point and i think the people who participate in these ecosystems understand they're just gambling but again i'm like we're in a bear market there are good deals to be had why are you spending your money on these obviously projects like not okay bears i guess people just like the high all right i'll never understand it it'll never be me but if you made some money on that i guess good for you here's my big takeaway though it is more about the solana ecosystem broadly i do think we should all be watching solana right now and the solana ecosystem a lot of layer ones all layer ones took a big hit i mean when you know obviously with the terra ecosystem take a really big hit but you've had all of these all l1 fare worse than ethereum has during this bear market which is what you would expect because they're newer and what you see over time is as an ecosystem matures the lows don't get quite so dramatic right the you don't drop 90 percent in a bear market you maybe drop 70 and then you drop 50 and then you know then you're dropping 30 whatever it is right as each successive bear market the more mature you are as an ecosystem the the uh less you fall as a percentage of the overall ecosystem so lana these a lot of these alt-l ones this is their first bear market really and so this is this is these are gonna be the biggest drops the ones that can survive this bear market will come out stronger and could see really big pops in their ecosystem eth i think hit like an 80 low during the last bear market and then of course came back raging and looks like it's it's gonna bottom out here at seventeen hundred dollars maybe it drops a little bit lower than that at some point but i i actually doubt it i think the seventeen hundred dollars we've seen eath go to is is probably more or less where the bottom ends up being and maybe it was back down to seventeen hundred but i you know i i it's not going to drop into three figures so for that reason i think it's important that we watch these alt-l ones see who's coming out stronger and and if you're in the nft space as we are a chain like solana that is building itself to be an nft chain if it can survive there's a lot of potential potential there's a lot of potential for nfts in solana if the chain survives this bear market and thrives in the aftermath so i do think tracking what's happening with okay bears and doing tracking what's happening with some other nft projects is a worthwhile endeavor if if you're really into flipping and nft trading and understanding the ecosystem i'm gonna make it a point to learn a little bit more about it it's it's definitely a weak spot in in terms of my understanding and i don't know where to land right i don't know where this this plays out but um it's a new chain so of course it's taken a big hit during this market time but that could mean some of the greatest gains could be get could could be gotten in the solana ecosystem when we come out of this bear market eventually so that's it that's our show i'm sure i missed some things this week i apologize you can tweet at me tell me what i didn't talk about that you want to hear me talk about again it's been a little chaotic here getting to permission unless i had a travel nightmare that i won't bore you all with and then um have a number of panels that have been moderating here permissionless and i fly out to vcon tonight this is thursday as i'm recording this i'll be at vcon starting tomorrow hosting a number of panels moderating a bunch of panels at vcon so if you are there come say hello i
