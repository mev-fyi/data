hey everyone my name is kyla welcome to my channel where i talk about the stock market and the economy amongst other things welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys hot episode today everything is weird right now and we don't know why that's the theme of today's episode we're gonna get outside our crypto bubble and talk about all the weirdness going on in the real world stuff like is inflation going to destroy our economy why younger generations particularly labor are so unhappy war with russia is that about to happen can supply chains be fixed is globalization reversing and how younger generations navigate and eventually clean up this mess david we've got the perfect guest to talk about this uh kyla scanlon is here with us talk about this episode a little bit what can folks expect yeah there's been just uh first off i've been following kyle's youtube channel and it's just been a great way to uh she's extremely well researched extremely well knowledgeable and you can definitely tell that she has a passion for this uh and so while i'm in crypto twitter sphere reading crypto stuff watching crypto youtube uh sometimes i forget about the rest of the world but kylo's youtube channel is how i stay synced with the rest of the world and there's so much going on there's so much going on outside of crypto it's actually weird to say that uh you listed some of the some of the subjects and i think it's just worth it because crypto is growing up it is maturing it is finding itself embedded in more and more parts of the real world and the real world is starting to impact crypto more and more and more and so all these topics that you just listed out are things that are peripheral to crypto that impact us regardless if we are in like high in the sky crypto utopia like turns out no we we are the the potential war with uh russia and ukraine that actually does impact crypto markets like turns out we are at that point in history uh and so uh with uh kyla's in in crazy awesome ability to just distill well like very complicated uh topics into well-researched uh just commentary we're going to just burn through all the topics that are relevant right now that are really going to be i think really big topics also moving forward for the rest of the decade yeah absolutely everything is so interconnected and now crypto is is playing a role but uh we've got to get back to the physical in this episode out of the metaverse poke our head out of the metaverse and just check on things so we're going to do a drive-by of all of those items kind of a what you need to know in 2022 including i think kyla's got some fantastic advice for the would-be investor that would be journeyer who skews on the on the younger side and is trying to stay educated and up to speed on all of these things so we're going to get to that of course as always make sure you like and subscribe to this episode wherever you're listening to it leave us a

monetary policy energy markets you might also know her from the official bankless tick tock she's our official tick tock correspondent uh she writes a sub stack has youtube videos just insane amount of information we're going to talk about how weird the 2020s have been so far and how this year is shaping up to be a very strange odd weird year kyla welcome to bankless it's great to have you yeah thanks so much for having me happy to be here well let's get into that uh that weird vibe and maybe in order to do that we need to get into kind of a kyla vibe uh way of thinking so you get this fantastic intro on all of the content that you produce on all of your youtube videos could you give us that intro yeah hey everyone my name is kyla welcome to my channel where i talk about the stock market and the economy amongst other things that's what we're gonna do we're gonna talk about the stock market and the economy amongst other things hopefully hitting some topics that uh are top of mind right now in the weirdness category so inflation labor markets supply chain oh my god are we gonna get in a war with russia is that about to happen european energy crisis that might be some of the fallout we've got political instability in the u.s the fed keeps printing money what does all of this mean for crypto how do things shape up we're going to talk about all of these things in the next hour or so but let's set the context here kyla so it feels like things are weird right now how weird are they like scale of 1 to 10 from a weirdness perspective can they get any weirder and how uh like how are we looking historically well yeah i mean i guess weirdness is relative right so i would say that there's been a lot of times in history that things have been weird but right now there's just a lot of different weird things going on across a lot of different channels so like the geopolitical tensions inflation um sort of some of the innovative stuff that's happening in crypto like all these different things or all these different forces are putting a lot of pressure on everything creating a lot of weirdness so i would say it's like maybe a seven out of ten a seven so we could if things could get weirder yeah they could definitely get a lot weirder yeah oh my god and i think part of the question is like will they get weirder maybe we'll uh we'll talk about that towards the end um let's let's start with the the topic that's on everyone's mind recently so seven percent inflation in december in the us i'm not sure what it was in in january if we have those numbers yet but uh seven percent is a lot i've never seen that uh in in my lifetime can we talk about inflation for a minute is inflation going to destroy the us economy uh no i don't think so so it'll depend on how sticky the inflation is so if it is actually transitory the federal reserve has started to respond to the inflation they sort of realize that it's gotten a little bit high so they're going to put the brakes on the economy slow things down but i think inflation is just really a function of coming out of the other side of the pandemic so you have supply chains that are just fundamentally broken then you have labor wage problems like so a little bit of wage inflation going on um and then you just have also a monetary stimulus fiscal stimulus and that provided a little bit of floor to the consumer and then all of a sudden the stock market et cetera all those became speculative goods and so there's just a lot of upwards movement in prices everywhere creating a lot of pressure yeah and inflationary pressure as well one of the the weird things about inflation i think is that we can't really come to consensus about where it's coming from like obviously the the stemi checks are a big source of inflation but also we have all this pent up demand because everyone was stuck at home for so long and then in the combination of like well kobod actually isn't over yet and we still have a lot of missing labor out of the economy mixed with all this like pent up demand and a lot of people who are very price insensitive as in a lot of their assets swit up up during covid uh and so they don't really care about what the prices are about things so they buy them anyways and that creates a lot of just inflation the do is there any so do you have any opinions about what is the biggest or the bigger sources of inflation and why this conversation is so big right now yeah i mean i i personally think it's the supply chains i think those are just really hard to fix and it ties into everything sort of that you just mentioned so if consumers are demanding a lot of goods and supply chains can't supply those goods you're going to have prices increase like producers are like whatever you know they're going to price pass those prices right off to the consumer um and then with the labor wage issues so like if you don't have enough people either driving trucks working at ports et cetera like making the supply chains function working at factories like that's not good either so i think that's that's part of the problem is is supply chains are a big issue and then also i think pent-up consumer demand is a big issue we sort of seen that begin to to wean back a little bit so consumers are just a little bit nervous we saw a huge print in gdp growth this last quarter but we're probably going to see a little bit of compression um this upcoming quarter just because omnicron but i think that the economy is trying to figure out if it's actually good or not and supply chains are putting putting pressure on that and you know ultimately inflation also so use the term transitory inflation earlier kyla is that your belief do you think inflation is transitory i guess if it's supply chain caused that might mean that it is transitory but this is a great debate that's going on right now is it transitory or is this uh much more pernicious yeah i mean that's that's the question right so the fed sort of backed out of saying transitory so jerome powell the federal reserve they were like inflation's going to be transitory it's going to go away it's really the supply chains like the everything is going to be fine eventually and everything's good uh but it turns out that inflation was not as transitory as they thought there was even more price pressure than they thought there would be so i think um it'll just depend on how supply chains recover it'll really depend on the labor market and it will depend on this element of globalization like have we sort of made this just in time inventory amazonia and expectations stuff a little bit too fragile like have we kind of backed ourselves into a situation where inflation is inevitable just because of the functioning that we have i want to unpack that line because i we're probably going to re circuit uh recircle to it later too uh just in time supply chain can you define that for the listeners yeah so basically everything comes just in time as the name suggests so like if you're building a truck like wheels would come and everything has to come at the exact time so like you don't have any any like movement so you don't have any way that things can come slower or faster you would have to have it just at that exact moment if it comes later then the whole entire supply chain gets messed up so if you're building a car and a wheels come a couple days later all of a sudden your whole production time is you know five six weeks longer just because those wheels didn't come on the exact day that they were meant to so everything is very very dependent on this exact time that it needs to show up or else the whole dominoes begin to begin to tip yeah and and this has been the paradigm that our supply chains have operated under pre-kovid and i think the the tl dr is that it was a very well oiled very efficient very sleek machine um but it was also really fragile and you throw one one small little pandemic in it and then all of a sudden all the all the supply chains kind of break down so it is there's like a link here between this just-in-time supply chain paradigm and inflation right because the this is the way that our supply chains have been set up it was almost like a catalyst for uh the expression of pent-up demand to uh translate into increased prices would you say that's all true yeah i mean i think that globalization is great right because you can have comparative advantage and the other countries that are maybe better at producing some things can produce those things it ends up being a little bit cheaper for everybody at the end but it also you know creates a lot of friction or it can and creates a lot of bad things that can happen as we saw with the pandemic so i think we'll have more to talk about on the supply chain side but let's stay on the topic of inflation for for a little bit more so uh 40-year high seven percent right now um how confident are you that the fed's response which is you know maybe stopping quantitative easing and maybe getting into a quantitative tightening type of phase where they're discharging their their balance sheet and also raising interest rates how confident are you that they're pursuing the right strategy and this will like curtail inflation yeah i mean that's that's a really interesting question just because this is something that comes up a lot it's like well does raising rates actually fix supply chains if that is issue of inflation like you can't raise rates and be like all right everybody like supply chains are fixed like trucks are running again people are happy that's just not how it works um so i think that's the big issue and really the main goal with sort of this contractionary monetary policy would be so it makes money less liquid so you're not as incentivized to like speculate and so money that would go towards more speculative assets would go more towards people going back to work maybe because they don't have the freedom to kind of sit at home or whatever uh so that's really the big goal with contractionary monetary policy is to funnel resources in a different way and to make it so there's less slack in the economy as well um so i think the big question will be like how quickly does the fed do this obviously the stock market crypto was was not super happy when the fed announced that there was going to be potentially like raising rates and and now the question is will they raise rates by 50 basis points in march and that would be quite fast like that would be an element of shock to the economy i think um and then when do they start rolling assets off the balance sheet or when did they start actually like selling assets off the balance sheet um because the taper will end in march so there's just a lot that will come to a pin if there is a monetary policy and we'll see how effective it is and if it actually sort of fixes the problems that we're seeing yeah so kyla how do you think this all plays out i mean like there are a lot of different possibilities i suppose um one is that the fed doesn't take the intervention or in other words that they do take the intervention um inflation goes down inflation like could go could go up um the fed could do something that um you know and just take credit for inflation going down uh there could be political implications resulting from from all of this so how do you think 2022 plays out for us oh yeah i mean inflation is already a political hot potato we have midterms coming up um and that has been a topic of discussion pull the fed raise and have all these senators potentially bad that the you know the stock market's going down or the economy is not doing well because the fed's raising interest rates but also the fed has to do something because all these politicians are getting mad that inflation is hurting their constituents so i think that the fed is it's really a tough job and i know that's like maybe not the best thing to say because it is their job but sort of predicting how the market is going to respond how people are going to respond it's very much game theory and it's really difficult because they have their toolkit but one of the issues with their toolkit is that rates are already like basically near zero and they've been near zero for a really long time the last time that the fed did a tightening cycle was back in 2016 to 2018 and they eventually had to end that tight think cycle in 2018 or in 2019 because of something that happened with the repo market and because the market was like we just don't want this from you right now fed and so i think the fed can do everything that they want but if the market begins to get spooked sort of how we saw back in september of 2019 like all that could go away so the fed has to pay attention to inflation but it's kind of like the elephant in the room that they have to pay attention to how the market and the bond market specifically responds as well yeah one thing i think the fed is juggling is there's also just a changing um taste for labor in the world and like the fed has one responsibility which is to keep prices stable that is not happening in this present moment this is what inflation is but also like there's just a lot of um just changing desire to have speci to do specific types of labor to do specific types of jobs uh how does the consumer interest in labor how has that impacted the feds like calculus or is it at all yeah i mean so labor markets are broadly recovered so we've seen unemployment go down quite a bit we've seen labor force participation rate go up a little bit people are mostly moving in between jobs so we have seen a little bit of contraction in the number of educators we've obviously seen shorter shortages of truckers um other very important parts of the supply chain jobs uh sort of going away or moving to a different sub-segment of the economy because it's kind of like well why would you do a job that is relatively under-appreciated so i think that the fed has to take that into consideration where you're right like the labor market is sort of taking on a different composition and so the metrics might be good like unemployment might be low but that doesn't mean that the labor market itself is strong in terms of how it's composed so i think that that's something that they pay attention to but once again they're sort of handcuffed with their toolkit like they can't you know raise rates every you know raise rates everybody go drive a truck like that's just not how it works uh so i think that they're once again it's a limit that they have and this can't this can't be the fed's like problem to solve right like exactly what you said like the fed can't incur like incentives for people to go become truckers and fix the supply chains so how do we solve that problem do you have an opinion on that yeah i mean so part of the problem with supply chains right now is policy so at long beach port you can only stack i think this uh maybe this change but it was you could only stack like two containers and then all the other containers had to stay out on the ships so there's a lot of broken policy around the supply chains and there's a lot of weird policy around labor markets like whether that be you know who can work how they can work when they can work like that sort of stuff so i think a lot of it just just boils down into broken policy and that's not really the fed's job to manage obvious politicians and that's like a whole different kind of forms but i i think just improved policy and making things more efficient and less archaic is super important yeah so even even though some of the metrics are showing like recovery in labor markets it also feels like and this might be um this might be more sentiment driven but like as i'm reading the sentiment it feels like labor is just very unhappy right now like people are pissed off i don't know if you track you know uh subreddits the subreddit community like uh r slash anti-work but this has like 1.6 million individuals and i g you know there's a lot of i think pro labor populist sentiment around we're not getting paid enough like we work too hard we're in these shitty dead-end jobs and have no prospects of promoting like promotion or upward mobility um this is like i think a little foreign to you those who are in crypto because uh you know sometimes people in crypto like david myself um i think uh we can we can seem like we're you know too bullish too excited about crypto and that's because we look at crypto and we see limitless opportunities but i think people outside of crypto have to look at the rest of the market and be like well things are pretty stagnant so how does that factor in this this increasing discontent in labor markets like wages wages aren't rising uh capital assets are but wages aren't and everyone's upset with the jobs that they have yeah no it's it's really unfortunate and i i think about this quite a bit because it goes back into that labor force composition where people are sort of forced into these nine to five jobs like there's just this massive discontent as you're saying or around around jobs in the jobs that you're working and feeling like it shouldn't have to be this way and why is it this way and i think this is actually interesting because this is where like anti-work and sort of like that freedom of you know fire movement etc they sort of have an overlap with crypto that i don't think gets talked about enough like there's this desire for freedom and freedom is ultimately like a function of choice and a function of money which is sort of like crypto is about like you get to choose you you get to like choose how your money is controlled or you get to control it yourself um so i think that there's a lot of overlap there but i just think that a lot of people feel upset with the like the capital s system for just being so inefficient and for not taking care of them like we did see a little bit of uptick in wage growth but not nearly enough to combat inflation like people you know you're getting your savings eaten coming out of the other side of a pandemic it just feels like you're not taken care of and i think there's a lot of frustration around that and because of social media like you were saying with reddit people are able to actually aggregate and talk about this stuff and really um try and figure it out but i don't know if there's a good answer you know well so labor feels increasingly left behind they can't afford like rent and groceries in the prospect of inflation their wages aren't increasing like who got a seven percent uh raise over the last year and you know that's what the the real cost of everything you know has increased and i guess my question is kyle how do you think this gets resolved is this sort of a is there some political uh answer to this is the market going to create an answer for this like hey now we have to compete for our you know employees and for labor and so wages go up and or are unions an answer to this uh how does this all get resolved yeah i mean you have seen increases in wages so a lot of companies are offering a lot more they're offering signing bonuses they're offering like you know 20 25 an hour for jobs that were probably previously minimum wage you know 12 15 an hour so you do see companies becoming a little bit more competitive but like with regards to how it gets solved i just think there has to be a different value prop for labor like we probably need to figure out health care we probably need to figure out retirement stuff like we just need to sort of treat people a little bit better and not treat them like robots and maybe automation i i think automation is honestly an answer to some of this where we can have more efficiencies if we just automate things um and maybe like rely less on humans but that's a whole different host of requirements but yeah i think the biggest thing is we just have to sort of take care of people better you know but that's expensive so yeah yeah crazy crazy thought wow that costs too much money taking care of people that's not too much money yeah so there's a something i'm concerned about is like we saw the supply chain really break down the cost of like used cars for example used cars are through the roof that's actually now recently bled into new cars new cars are going above their sticker price also housing prices are like on like going up 15 to 20 on a yearly basis over the last year or so and like just a lot of just really important stuff is being priced out of labor uh meanwhile exactly what ryan was saying there's like this growing discontent with labor in of itself like people just have this error this attitude of disenfranchisement which is like not really all of the same pieces that you want to put all into the same spot at the same time like that's kind of like the ground the foundations of like a revolution are you concerned about this trajectory over like the long term over the rest of the decade um in terms of revolution or in terms of just like yeah social unrest i think we've seen we've had this social unrest conversation all throughout basically since 2008 and it just seems to continue um and it kind of seems to start to impact politics and impact just how we organize around our issues um do you how do you see social unrest playing into the rest of the decade yeah i mean i think that there's just a lot of frustration probably isn't even an appropriate word to describe i think how people feel um i see it with a lot of my friends like i feel an element of it right so like the idea of ever having a house feels very foreign and just feels very far away and a lot of wealth is trapped in older populations and it's like will that ever trickle down or will it go away so i think with regards to this idea of a revolution it does feel like things are sort of at a tipping point we've had little peace for a really long time to a certain extent like we we haven't had a you know the government dissolve or anything like that and that's a big statement but the the government's been in place since 1776 and you know we're still this we're still following the constitution which was written back then and i think that there is just a lot of room for rethinking policy and rethinking how we we shape law and rethinking how even like everything right that we do right now so like going back to this nine to five 40 hours a week that's a byproduct of the industrial revolution right even kids like how they go to school and getting you know in between classes with the bell that's the industrial revolution so we still have very archaic systems but our technology is so advanced so i think there's a lot of cognitive dissonance where it's like well i can do everything on my computer and access like amazing things from my computer but i still have to do like i still have to count inventory and do all this stuff so i think that there's just a lot of room for policy to catch up to technology i don't know if that'll take place in the form of revolution maybe but yeah that's what i would say i guess it's important to note that like revolutions don't have to be violent um sometimes there there can be non-violent uh revolutions sometimes there can be a technology revolutions that that change the shape of things um sometimes there can be sort of slow uh revolutions that said uh i'm reading um do you ever read any ray dalio kyla yeah sometimes yeah yeah so like he's like okay so he uh is scary sometimes like when i read dalio i'm reading his newest new world order uh a book principles for a new world order book and he's basically like you know this is not dahlia's language but the dldr is hey we've had a good run and every 50 to 100 years there's some sort of you know in any empire of which america is an empire using his verbiage uh there's a civil war or there's a um you know nation state war just a large external uh facing war and just because that hasn't happened in our lifetime doesn't mean anything because it happens every 50 to 100 years and uh he he likens this decade that we're in to the to the 1930s right and he's like rise of populism you know wealth wealth inequality uh weird things going on with with fed monetary policy uh and then he sees like the rise of china and other you know factors at play where it's a rising rising nation state versus an existing legacy empire is what he might say the us is um so in that backdrop it's kind of like terrifying it's kind of scary like i don't want to live through the late 1930s and 1940s um do you ever think about that or uh you know i don't want to bring the podcast down to that level but it's been on my mind recently uh yeah i mean what's going on in with russia and ukraine has made me a little bit nervous i don't know if that's going to be if war is not going to be fought like it was back in the 1930s 1940s like it's just not um but i do think there's a lot of just geopolitical tension and i don't know if that you know what dahlia is sort of highlighting is essentially cycles so that will sort of cycle in a war will cycle and unrest will cycle into peace that's kind of how humans have existed pretty much forever but i don't know if it works in you know 50 to 100 years if that's incrementally how it is but i i do think there's to highlight that i do think there's pressure out there that is concerning yeah well you brought up exactly where we want to go next which is unpacking this whole russia ukraine thing uh we got out of afghanistan just a few months ago so it's about time that we get into another war uh that's kind of what we do uh are we about to go to war with russia like what's going on over there can you give us the the tl dr and then we'll unpack it a little bit more yeah i mean so so essentially russia well putin really putin has it in his head that he's saint vladimir 2.0 he wrote this paper called on the history of russia and ukraine that essentially he was like ukrainians russia's and we want it back now and we're going to go take it back ukraine belongs to russia and so that's kind of how putin is thinking about things and then also putin does not like nato so the north american treaty organization putin does not like that and he feels like nato is sort of encircling russia which it it isn't but his main goal is to prevent nato from spreading more and he does not want ukraine to join nato at all because that would not be good that would mean it's you know western assimilation it's all this different all these different things that he just simply doesn't want to have happen so that's really the big two forces is this idea that ukraine and russia are sort of historical brethren i guess and then also that nato is encircling russia and putin's eyes yeah well what does ukraine want is there a consensus as the people of ukraine and the government of ukraine as to whether have they picked a side so what's been going on there is quite interesting um so the leader of ukraine you know for the past couple weeks he was like you know this isn't happening like russia doesn't want to invade ukraine like it's it's totally fine everything's good over here don't worry they're just like piling tanks on the border but no big deal at all and uh but recently he's came out and he's like okay the united's like we're going to have help from the united states from nato um if russia does choose to invade they also called russia humpty dumpty which means that like you know they're gonna fall off the wall like eggs breaking kind of deal like disturbing the peace um so i think that the sentiment has to and this was very recently um so the sentiment has shifted a little bit in terms of how they're feeling um but like what's really unfortunate is ukrainians have kind of lived with russia uh poking the bear to say the least quite a bit the ukrainian twitter account tweets out memes describing the situation which is like this is the national uh twitter account for ukraine yeah yeah so are in such a this is yeah i i tweeted at them i was like oh man the people writing history books about this era like i can't even imagine um but yeah they'll tweet like like one of them was the redhead meme or the red the guy who has a red face and he's in deep pain uh like that meme distress stress kid meme i think so with a bulging temple no it's a different one but i'm not describing it correctly it's like we'll get it we'll we'll put it on screen yeah yeah um but it's that one and then they're like stress levels living next to russia and his whole face is red um so that's kind of how they're dealing with stuff is through mummification which makes sense considering you know everything is a meme these days including the stock market so funny we'll put a pin in that one because we definitely want to talk about that um what can you what is putin actually doing you said he's lining up tanks along the border uh what is the actual like actions that putin has been taking yeah i mean they're just sort of aggressive like they they put blood blood fields near them so like blood supplies just in case things got violent near ukraine um they've been doing sort of like night ops stuff just moving it it's mostly unmanned vehicles near ukraine which is good like once you start putting people in vehicles that's when you essentially be in business so it's really just been a lot of posturing a lot of kind of sneaking around i guess but it hasn't been that sneaky uh there's been a couple of things with flights so the airspace has been either restricted over the united kingdom a couple of times over sweden because sweden kind of got ripped into it as well all the countries over there everyone's ripped into it of course because geopolitical relations right but yeah so there's just been a lot of um movement that is unusual so kyla if there is uh conflict right this this won't be the sort of conflict that we saw in um you know previous eras right things are totally different even like ukraine is its communication is now you know 21st century internet native communication which is like we're trying to win hearts and minds through meme warfare uh and and that's different but like how could a conflict uh play out i mean there's lots of possibilities of course but are we talking like um you know if things ramped up things escalated there was some sort of russian invasion of ukraine what happens next is this like cyber warfare uh territory do we have some sort of um you know war war of attrition as we've seen in in previous eras uh how do you think a 21st century conflict like this plays out yeah i think that's the big question because we've i don't know like it'll be not as it won't be people entrances like it was in world war one um but i think a lot of it like uh earlier i think it was earlier in january russia did implement a big cyber attack on ukraine so i think that sort of stuff is is definitely in the cards i think potentially different types of missiles not necessarily nukes like nukes nuclear weapons would be sort of like last resort for russia that would be game over um but i do think you'll see like tactical things sort of like that um i don't exactly know what it would look like i i know that there's a lot of um pressure that russia is feeling from the united states and from nato the united states is like hey if you do this like economic sanctions because russia annexed crimea back in 2014 which wasn't not cool right like don't annex other countries uh and that really hurt their economy and so the big question it's almost an element of game theory so with regards to like how it's being fought i'm not sure but the outcomes of it are going to be interesting because uh the united states could put swift sanctions on russia which would essentially shut down their banking system and make it very hard for russia to transact with other countries and that would be very very bad for russia's economy and we would see 2014 russia economy but worse so i think there's going to be costs to whatever element of warfare does end up playing out but i'm not sure exactly how it would play out yeah one angle that i think this is going to be new if they're if it does come to conflict is that how much damage can russia do without triggering economic sanctions and that's kind of like a line that they are probably looking to tow and that comes on the heels of them doing a fantastic job managing the narrative around the united states election in 2016 and also 2020 and just really being able to use internet like psyops uh just like kind of figuring out like a part of the warfare part of the warfare game is no longer guns and tanks but it's internet-based narratives internet-based memes in combination with actual cyber attacks uh i can't remember if this actually happened if this was just discussed about a potential happening but like uh i think at one point in time russia uh was able to get into the energy grid of a certain spot of ukraine and turn it off uh and it took a while for them to turn it back on and like during the the russian winter the ukrainian winter that actually is a big deal because like you need the heat and so like there's these routes of conflict that are unlocked because of just the internet and digital age that we live in where russia can attack ukraine from afar and then also use narrative obfuscation campaigns she's like oh no we didn't do that like that wasn't us at all and now it's like this whole narrative like can you attack a country while hiding it from the rest of the internet yeah well that's actually super important so one of the things that russia is kind of i think waiting on or their speculation around that they're waiting on is for you to have to defend themselves against ukraine so ukraine would throw the first stone and if they're able to do that that's a way that they don't trigger sanctions because it's defensive right it's not offensive um so i think there's all these different to your point about mind games like all these different mind games that they are playing and trying to to figure out which one works the best and which one will hurt russia the least and also get russia to where it wants to be but right now negotiations are going really poorly with the united states and nato um so i'm not sure what we'll end up adopting speaking of the game theory of all of this um has china yet weighed in on this because it seems like that is uh definitely a uh you know an important part of the puzzle here is it russia versus sort of the world or does russia have some some soft allies in the mix over its action in ukraine yeah so china actually spoke out a little bit they were basically like we don't agree with moscow and sort of the allegations that they're making against ukraine which was pretty much unheard of after china is sort of taking that stance um but putin is going to the opening day ceremony of the olympics so i'm not sure i think that if russia does get swifted in terms of sanctions russia and china are going to be able to develop they have sort of an internal not internal banking system between them but russia has sort of a backup banking system that china could go with so it'll just depend on how china what they see best but right now they're really worried about the olympics they don't want to mess anything up with the olympics yeah so you used that term the term swifted does that mean like economic uh sanctions is that another because the swift uh of course like is sort of a traditional banking money transmissions is that what people call it when somebody gets sanctioned and locked out of the national banking system they get swifted that's what i say i'm not sure that's wrong it's probably not technically correct but yeah i mean that's what happens right as you get slipped what's interesting here is like when a country gets swifted um like i i wonder what this means for you know crypto crypto adoption and like it's it's interesting that um some of this would adopt adoption could happen i guess from from the west perspective with uh rogue nation states if you know a country gets locked out of the traditional banking system maybe that spurs some sort of crypto adoption is is that a thing that's likely to happen or do you think crypto is still too early for for that sort of thing and you know rogue nation states kind of prefer to control the banking system the alternate banking system that they use yeah i think their alternative payment system would step up before that but um potentially putin came out recently and against the will of the russian central bank and was like hey crypto mining can happen here in russia so anything's possible but i think for them it's really about controlling the narrative and bitcoin and ethereum etc like that's sort of the opposite of what you're meant to do with it so i i don't think that would be something that they would want to use so while on the topic of getting swifted another big uh variable that we need to pay attention to is the energy markets in europe and its relationship with russia because europe depends pretty heavily on russia for energy and if russia gets cut off from the rest of the economy does that mess things up with like the the state of the european energy markets can you kind of download us on what's going on in europe with relation to the energy markets and how russia and all these sanctions fit in yeah it's super bad it's really messy over there um well so europe was kind of like we're gonna do renewable energy and that's all we don't need to have any exposure to fossil fuels because renewable energy will get us through and that was not the case at all like you have to have some sort of energy security in the form of fossil fuels just because renewables aren't ready to take on in you know europe yet it's just not there and they under-invested to a certain extent as well um so russia is about one-third of europe's gas supply um which is which is a lot and what ended up happening is that they just didn't funnel as much gas to europe this past go-around um because they were like well you know it's not really part of the contract like there's we just aren't going to do that for you right now and so gas prices in europe have been super high sort of because of that contraction but also because of um just not having the energy security because they were so reliant on renewables and this idea of renewables so they've had to rely on natural gas they've had to rely on coal like sweden reopened a coal producing plant or an oil producing plant and they've had to revert back to fossil fuels and there's a lot of reliance on russia because if it gets really cold in europe which luckily the weather has been very mild but if it gets really cold in europe and all of a sudden russia is like hey no gas for you that's going to be blackouts that's going to be a lot of really unhappy people and really really high energy prices and so that's kind of the situation is that and i think one of the reasons that this whole russia ukraine situation is so interesting is because of what's going on in europe and the united states has stepped up and they're like oh don't worry like we'll help you get natural gas like don't worry about it but the issue is uh there's just not enough natural gas to go around so like russia has this this this production that does go to europe but there isn't like um qatar's going to potentially step in to help europe just in case something does happen with russia but qatar is going to have to divert resources away from asia who also needs natural gas like people need energy it's a common denominator and everything uh to europe and qatar is like hey don't worry we're going to start producing more one day that's why you need to take out long-term contracts with us europe uh but europe's like no we really want renewables only and so it's this whole like green energy policy green energy investment problem and it has ended up with over-reliance on russia and just a sheer lack of energy security which is not it's just not good if you don't have energy security like you just you don't have anything so so is this um part of this of this conversation is this just like an unfortunate byproduct of the russian ukraine uh conflict potential conflict or is this actually like a front front and center stage like russia is really leaning into the fact that europe depends on on them and they're really leveraging that with their ability to get into ukraine without some sort of like pushback because they have their their grips around uh europe's energy markets like is this is this like a side conversation or is this like a front front and center stage conversation so it's a little bit of both so what's really interesting is russia has been very dependent like europe has been able to rely on them through the soviet union through the fall of the soviet union like stuff that was really intense like europe russia was always like here's your gas like no worries at all but now all of a sudden it's not that case and so germany was in so germany wanted to open a pipeline between russia and germany called north stream too and that ended up getting shut down because of the whole russia ukraine situation which russia was not happy about because that would have been money for them and yeah so i think that there's an element of this narrative that russia is aware of how reliant europe is on them for energy but russia is also reliant on them in terms of revenue right uh and it creates kind of a weird dynamic where if russia all of a sudden can't export energy to europe it's not like they can just go past that natural gas off to everybody like there's infrastructure in place and you can't just go up in the infrastructure and begin to divert it to other places um unless you have infrastructure in place um so i think that it's sort of like something that people talk about a little bit especially with nordstrom too but i think it's also very front and center um like it's been a big big deal with the white house and in the biden administration to make sure that europe will have stable energy supplies so i think people are aware of um the dynamic yeah so we've said you you've said that with that the united states has said to europe like yo europe like if russia does any shenanigans we got you do we even have the ability to do that like we're on different sides of an entire ocean like we can't just teleport over oil to to europe like do we have the means to be able to to help europe if if it came down to it uh to a certain extent yeah uh natural gas is a little bit hard to transport because of the infrastructure that nissan placed and one of the things that europe didn't want because of the renewable energy focus was import terminals from the united states for natural gas so there is a little bit of a plan around that but the issue goes back to this idea of under production where if it gets really cold in the united states which it might eat over the next coming months it you know there isn't an excess of natural supply here like we're already going back to coal because of the blizzard that happened in the northeast we're reverting back to coal um on the on on that grid so i think it is just a lot of energy insecurity everywhere because going back to something that we talked about even earlier this idea of globalization like okay everything's going to be fine like it's okay that we get energy sources from all over um but it's not so i think the united states ultimately probably will be able to help but i it'll be um not not as easy as maybe they think it is or something yeah so there's two themes that i want to touch on one is that europe is now realizing that it's uh it's pretty damn reliant on russia on something that's very very critical and this at the same time um the united states has realized that it's super dependent on asia for semiconductors and so it's kind of a very similar conversation where there's this very critically important commodity that these nation very powerful nations are dependent on somebody else uh in order to so have that supply and really like semiconductors in my opinion are as critical as oil right like it's almost it's almost comparable in how important they are to everything that goes on and so part of this conversation is going on and that is that you know we were we were super super globalized and then us and maybe it was the pandemic maybe it was more than that like maybe it's just russia also doing things but there seems to be a theme in 2020 of these great powers realizing that they are really captured in some element by other powers um how do you see this playing that dynamic is there other like things that are also like that dynamic going on and how do you see that playing out over the decade how are we responding to this yeah i mean semiconductors are definitely number one because that's in literally everything for no apparent reason like toothbrushes um coffee machine like just like stuff that doesn't need a semiconductor has a semiconductor because of the internet of things the coffee mug has a semiconductor in it yeah exactly that's ridiculous david yeah i shouldn't be allowed to exist there yeah but that's part of the reason that there's pressures coffee mugs have semiconductors uh so yeah i mean i think that that's a big worry is that we've relied on um just like whether it be tsmc and there's like one dutch company called asmo that makes this one machine for semiconductors and they're the only company in the world that makes this machine and they were hit by a fire their factory was hit by a fire and luckily like production was okay but imagine if if it hadn't been okay like what would have happened to semiconductors and they're very expensive machines to make and so i think intel is going to develop a factory here in the united states to begin to build out semiconductors but all this stuff takes time to build and that's one of the issues with the energy markets as well is like you know you can want and i and i to sort of clarify i'm a huge green energy advocate i think it's terrible i don't really like coal or oil but we're reliant on it to a certain extent like you have to be reasonable about this stuff and so i think that the united states with semiconductors it was like oh everything will always be perfect and we won't have to worry about this but then you do have to worry about it same thing with energy it's you know everything will be perfect until it's not like things are working until they don't as kind of deal so i think energy semiconductors i'm a little bit worried about um water access i'm a little bit worried about um what about water access just in like how it's going to play out like i think we have enough of it but california uh they're you know making it more expensive to get water funneled into your home yet again so i think it's just going to be like i don't think we discuss or i don't think a lot of people discuss enough just how reliant we are on raw materials like with semiconductors and sort of like even the shift to electric vehicles like you'd need raw materials you need lithium etc and all this stuff is extracted from the earth and that also takes labor and that takes people willing to do that and we just have a very uh globalized society that is i think pretty reliant on everything working and i think the pandemic showed the fragility of that so that's yeah but not to be like a fear-monger like i think we're going to have water but i just think that there's increasing concern about access and about capacity and about being able to actually utilize the resources yeah what's interesting about this trend and maybe we could talk more more broadly about it is like it feels like the last 50 years a lot of the economic prosperity and gdp growth from around the world has been as a result of globalization like kind of this this just-in-time system that we've created where all of the economies are integrated and there's this kind of specialization uh that's how we've driven so much prosperity at least maybe some of that a lot of that hasn't trickled down to labor but um definitely from a you know capital asset appreciation and i guess the the question is i you know do we see maybe the trend starting to reverse we're realizing that some of these systems are a bit more fragile than we thought we're realizing that they'll become increasingly fragile if the uh if there's some geopolitical chaos and there's some some turmoil between the countries is there going to be a pullback on globalization do you think kyla and if there is what are the economic repercussions of that yeah i mean i think you're already starting to see protectionist policy happen in the united states so shifting manufacturing back here a lot of calls to sort of make america you know do semiconductors uh be a little bit more responsible about their own energy resources like the fact that we're able to that we were able to frack uh for oil and stuff it was super important in terms of like having energy independence so i think that there's going to potentially be countries sort of becoming a little bit less globalized just because of the worries around that but then that creates a certain element of price pressures because all of a sudden you know you're not getting things produced super cheap and shipped super cheap um so i i do think there will be a pullback on a global economy i i think it has a time and i think it's still going to be very important but i do think that there's going to be potentially rotation away from it yeah does that cause uh increase in inflation as well or is that like a deflation deflationary pressure in some way does that cause some sort of like um stalling of economic gdp growth if we're reversing this incredible economic force which is globalization does it sort of revert i guess and and cause us to grow less fast or even stagnate yeah i mean it would it just like in terms of numbers if we rotate manufacturing back to the united states um it would probably be a little bit more expensive at first just because of the wage situation over here versus other countries and i think that that could be more expensive i think it takes time to build out those different factories to build out different things and that's good from an investment perspective for gdp but i do think that there is the potential for things that are made domestically to sometimes be more expensive i'm not saying that's all the time but um it's just not it's just not the same dynamic so will that lead to inflation maybe uh will it sort of even out over time maybe i i do think it will create an element of pressure at first so yeah which isn't a bad thing but i i wonder if um this globalization idea or like you know advocates of globalization might say this inter interconnected economy between all of the nation states is actually like um a cause to hope for peace i remember like uh years ago reading about this idea called like the golden arches theory which is the the idea that no two countries with a mcdonald's in them have ever gone to war um i i don't know if that has held up over time but the idea is like economically in uh interdependent um you know countries that have some sort of you know shared culture and they have a middle class that has developed the level of acquiring a taste for for mcdonald's um they don't have the desire to go to us to war as much and i don't know if this is just sort of like a happy utopia preached by um you know advocates of globalization or if that carries but i'm wondering if you think globalization the fact that europe needs uh russia's energy resources and russia needs europe's consumer buying pressure for those energy resources if that keeps us a little bit from the brink of war do you think that's healthy this interdependence in some ways as well yeah i mean i think that's been a huge reason that you know europe used to go to war all the time with themselves so that they don't do that anymore so i think it helps the interdependence but i also think there's uh the political aspect of it too where some people just want to make a point you know political leaders so it'll just depend on human psychology to a certain extent so i think it helps because everything is so intertwined but at the end of the day humans are still humans the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over

with how russia needs to control the narrative in order to get what it's wants but you you've also done some fantastic content on things like dogecoin versus real life uh and crypto narratives versus like actual real things that that move the needle and especially as the um federal reserve is playing this game theory game of how does it control inflation it does it with narratives can you just unpack for our listeners the way that you see narratives really shaping the this decade that that we're living in right now oh yeah i mean i think narratives are pretty much everything like that's essentially what monetary policy is there's a shift in the narrative so raising rates it works to the extent that it's raising rates like it does create a little bit of pressure but it's also like hey we think that the economy is too hot right now and so should you um and we're gonna make it less hot and get ready for that and i think that that's what the goal of the federal reserve is and i think crypto also has you know their own narrative around innovation um and sort of like building a better future but then there's also this interpretation of different narratives so uh how people interpret the federal reserve is super important so people are like well we don't really care that you're raising rates whatever uh we're going to keep on speculating however it be maybe that tool isn't as effective as it used to be and then with crypto like if people interpret the narrative as um you know i think has become a little bit louder recently with a recent youtube video called plan goes up uh how people interpret that narrative and tie it into their own interpretation of crypto it could potentially impact how crypto is perceived moving forward so it's really all about perception and understanding um and narrative is a huge part of that and just how you develop a narrative around different things yeah you pay attention to so many different things and you also pay attention you deeply understand crypto in ways that have helped me understand crypto better and then i also you know i i watch your youtube videos and you're paying attention to much more things other than crypto which as a crypto person i take offense to because how can you pay how can you understand crypto and not be full-time crypto so my question to you is why are you not full-time crypto why has crypto not brought you all the way in like it brought in me and ryan oh i so like okay um i'm not sure i i'm really fascinated by macro like i think macroeconomics is is so important and what the fed does like we've seen it over the past month like what they say is for better or worse super important and i'm really fascinated by like all these different threads that are they're so interwoven but we like don't talk about them so everybody thinks that everything is happening and one silo over here one silo over there the stock market is doing this but crypto's doing that but actually they're interconnected because crypto kind of trades like tech stock because of all the institutional dollars bc dollars that have flowed in there um because of the you know the risk aversion that's kind of been adopted in there because of institutional dollars and then the risk aversion in the stock market because of what the fed is going to do and then the fed is doing what they're going to do because of supply chains and supply chains or geopolitics and so there's really all these big big narratives around there i i try to understand kryptos as much as i can because i think it's super important and i think sort of like i think a theme of this conversation today has been around how do we make the world a better place and i don't think there's anything out there um like crypto that has an answer like i think crypto is like one of the only things that's like hey we're gonna not just complain about this stuff and not not saying that people complain but we're not just going to just talk about it we're actually going to take action um so i think that's just important to moving the needle forward but everything else is also very interesting to me so that's why yeah is there a part of you kyla that's like um like skeptical about crypto so like david and i are you know bankless we're we're permabulls crypto right and it's like sometimes the the error of that is um we we get so caught up in the metaverse that we uh forget that the physical also matters like all of the stuff we just talked about you know energy crisis and like you know inflation and labor markets and all of these things like the physical reality of the world uh it def definitely plays in and sometimes you know people in crypto and their bubble get stuck in this in this uh utopia um but what's your take on on crypto high level do you think that um you know what aspects of it are are kind of over hyped and a bit more utopia and like i guess maybe i'm asking you to ground us a little bit kyla like where do you think this stuff could go wrong where do you think that new crypto permeables are a little bit off on the asset class um so i think that there are so there's a couple different pockets in crypto right like there are really good pockets that are focused on innovation but then there's also the ponzi schemes ponzi games i suppose uh scams that sort of stuff and this so the way that i see it i kind of hinted at this a little bit earlier i've been working on a thesis around this recently but there's there's people who hate crypto like they hate crypto um on twitter they get very angry at nft people and it's really it's it's not good but the nft people get angry back at them and i think that there's a venn diagram of people who want freedom so like whether it be anti-work people or the fire people or socialists um and then crypto and there's an overlap where they want freedom and they want money and they want control but both groups are kind of talking past each other and i think there's really good aspects of crypto like creating ownership um being able to control your own narrative uh you know having a community but when you when you zoom out and somebody who is from the out group is looking at the end group of crypto they see things like hyper financialization um they see things like in group versus out group like not feeling potentially welcome into the community they see the scams and potencies versus um you know creating your own ownership narrative or creating financial freedom and i think that's sort of the issue is that you have a lot of people who who maybe want um this element of freedom but the way that crypto is perceived going back to that concept of narratives uh it it doesn't quite click for them in the way that i think crypto would want it to click for them and this is all like me just uh observing like lurking in every corner of the internet but i to the extent am i skeptical on crypto i i think that there's like what it has done is so important because it's really opened up the conversation around like what can what is possible and i think there's a lot of uh improvement in what it's done over the past couple years but i think there's also a lot of big questions that are answered like you know ethereum transactions probably can't be as expensive as they are forever and i know that gets scaling layer two stuff is going to help with that but how do you actually get people onboarded and that's also a big problem with financial markets just in general is like people don't understand the stock market and one of the things about human nature is if you don't understand something you're probably going to throw rocks at it because you're like well why would i ever understand this because i don't get it so why would i ever want to um and so i think that's the big the big problem with crypto is um how it's perceived sorry that was really good oh good i've been working on like an essay around this i even have like pictures and stuff where i've just been like drawing this out because the the line goes up the line go up um youtube video like the the reception to that like 3.8 million people saw it and the comments were all like yeah man like you're so right this is awesome even though some things that he said were just factually inaccurate i think and then also if you read if you listen to the rebuttals of it um people were like yeah you had some good points and i think there just needs to be more open dialogue around hey like we're improving these things and we realize that every time that you turn around and somebody's getting rug pulled or you know a felon is leading a big crypto project like maybe that's not awesome um so i think there's just a lot of room for that yeah can we talk about that just really quick because uh you've referenced line go up a couple of times and uh you know my context so i haven't watched the full line goes up video but this is sort of an nft skeptic's take on uh nfts and it's a very critical some would say hypercritical some would say uh misleading or focusing on all of the bad and not relaying any of the good take on crypto but some of it is maybe criticism that you folks in the crypto industry should um should start to consider but it was i guess emblematic of a massive crypto backlash right it's like i don't know if people are tired of getting you know um others flashing these expensive nfts uh you know tired of some you know the scams thinking that this is just yet another capitalist game so like when when david and i talk to the people in the venn diagrams or the people who want more freedom which is sort of our tribe and we use crypto terms sometimes that just falls on deaf ears completely because they already have a preconceived notion of what crypto is but can you talk a little bit about that line goes up video did i miss anything there why is this conversation so interesting to you at this point in time oh i mean i think it's just because it's right now it's the zeitgeist like 3.8 million people saw that's huge just a lot of people um sort of talking about crypto watching things about crypto um and i and i was most surprised by their response to it where it was like yeah dude this is like what i've been feeling and this is what i've been seeing and crypto has really put a lot of pressure on different industries like distributed research system industries um so i think with lion goes up it just pointed out some things that a lot of people were maybe thinking about crypto where it was like and i think the biggest thing into your point around like why are crypto terms so um abrasive to people sometimes it can seem really tough because we like earlier we were talking about the labor dynamic like hey i'm not super happy and i'm sad in my nine to five 40-hour week job and i don't see a hopeful future and then if you turn around and you see this is just how it is if you turn around and you see somebody buying a picture of a monkey for you know half a million dollars a million dollars it feels bad like it just feels bad um and so i think that's in that goes back to this idea of perception and he pointed a lot of that out where you know it is hyper financialization and people are this is a problem with web 2 where people are just sick of being the product you know if you're not paying you're the product and crypto i think to a certain extent has accidentally maybe encapsulated some of that because everything is hyper financialized how do you tokenize your friendships um how do you tokenize a lot of and then it's good right because so you get you get to benefit from financial upside but people see that and they're like man everybody's just trying to scrape every last dollar from my soul and i already sold my soul to facebook.com um so i think that's the big issue and mine goes up um like i said a lot of factual inaccuracies but it did a good job at underlining i think how a lot of people are perceiving the space at the moment yeah what do you think crypto people can do to respond to that i think it's just um and i've seen actually quite a bit of it on twitter which has been really good just like hey um you know we kind of get it that a lot of speculation isn't maybe super healthy and speculation is ultimately a function of market calibration like you have to have it to a certain extent the stock market has it housing market definitely has it uh but i think there just needs to be more conversation around you know we and this it's not saying you know that crypto is not doing this right now but i don't know how it takes place but we we do see some of the problems and we are working to improve it and we understand that some of the stuff might be confusing and it's kind of like well what does this actually do for me and i think this is a problem that a couple of like education dollars are maybe working on solving is how do you onboard people into the space but it's really about i think application and this is what a lot of people miss is like you can explain blockchain to people forever like uh but if you don't tell them how blockchain can help them understand maybe like a real estate transactions or help them organize like their own payments or however it happens for them that doesn't help and so i think a lot of people feel excluded from the narrative so a lot of the work would have to be on not telling people in gmi right like that's pretty abrasive um but rather like hey like this you know it's okay like we'll figure it out and i i do think people do that just to sort of yeah everything exists in the extremes of distribution when you talk about it but it's ultimately the middle of the distribution where things happen you know i think it's just only natural to see all these nft ape-buying people go from you know wherever they were prior to crypto to being multi-millionaires inside of a single year and have that not create some sort of pushback like for with every every action has an equal and opposite reaction and definitely some sort of uh i didn't benefit from that therefore i don't like it energy is definitely going around and it's really up to the crypto people to uh take that in stride and continue to build more and more things that actually do help people more in more and more ways uh and it's just a matter of um everyone has their own nft that they like maybe it's not apes maybe it's not crypto punks maybe it's not whatever's but one day it'll be something for them and it's just a matter of like lowering the barriers to entry and allowing for more and more use cases that impact more and more people where they actually needed to be felt um so maybe it's just a waiting game uh kyla there's a when i you watch your youtube video there's the game i play is like all right how long am i going to be watching this video before she starts talking about green energy investment and so i kind of want to give you the floor and just let you rant about your very frequent rant about the relationship between uh green energy infrastructure and green energy investment in stark contrast to nfts where nfcs are only digital pixels we also we're now on the other side of the spectrum which is actual real innovation boots on the ground infrastructure why do we need green energy investment uh why yeah okay take the floor please yeah this i've actually gotten dm support where it's like hey you didn't mention this in your previous video are you okay um yeah so like this goes back to the whole conversation around europe and sort of like this idea that you can sort of just transfer over to renewable energy only and everything's going to be totally cool and okay and you're not going to be reliant on a political superpower that wants to go to war with a neighboring country so i think and you see this in the united states too and it's just it's it's so frustrating um to me and i try to remove bias from my work but it is like personally frustrating to me because we're starting to increase coal production again which i'm just like what the heck like why are we back at this point we shouldn't be here anymore and it's primarily because we were like oh we don't need to really invest in in green energy it's gonna be okay we'll just transition and figure it out as as we go because energy is not that important right and so i think that's the biggest problem is that people feel like they can develop these green energy policies uh and if you don't invest in green energy it ends up becoming a loop where you're trying to transition to green energy but you can't transition to green energy because you don't have anything to really transition to so you're still reliant on fossil fuels but you've under-invested in fossil fuels and you've under-produced fossil fuels so everything is more expensive now because of that energy drove a lot of the inflation that we saw over the past couple years two years i guess uh now where it's really expensive and so you're trying to shift away from something that you can't shift away from yet and so you really just have to have a more um i guess like systematic approach to it and to sort of um caveat my own points and to play devil's advocate there has been green energy investment to a certain extent but the policy that's developing around this and the esg of vacation of everything is is not great so esg is this mandate and finance environmental social governance where you have to invest in companies that are doing good for the environment whatever that looks like and oftentimes it's like buying carbon credits or something like that um and you end up like and it's not good or bad but uh oil companies kind of end up usually getting hurt by that narrative unless they can like say that they're gonna do green energy stuff too and we're still really reliant on oil so i guess like i'm sort of talking in circles but the biggest thing is that um we're trying to transition to this idea of green energy and we're developing policy around it but because of under production and under investment and because of esg of vacation greenwashing of everything uh we can't really make the transition properly because you still have to have energy security which still comes in the form of fossil fuels so you can't make a full transition because number one there hasn't been the proper investment uh number two there hasn't been the proper security so we just end up kind of in this really terrible loop yeah it is is the problem that people just like in general maybe this is a generalized problem that i feel like i see is just no one's thinking about long-term problems anymore it's just like all short-term it's like two-year election cycles it's like how do we you know get out of the this this short term dilemma and like no one is thinking cross-generational this this is why i think a lot of millennials and you know gen z feel so left behind it's because we feel like older generations who have the political power who have the capital just don't care about the future generations they don't care about long-term decisions is is this part of the reason we're not investing in green energy do you think oh yeah oh yeah um i think to a certain extent and then it gets into like the politics of lobbying too and who's paying what and how they're paying whatever but i think it's expensive right and it's timely it's it's it's a time investment in order to transition to green energy and politicians to your point around these to your investment cycles they don't have time to sort of promise these things they need to have immediate results and that comes from making policy right but not necessarily uh doing the steps that they need around infrastructure for that policy um so i think there's just a lot of frustration around uh you know the current uh maybe the current administration the current generation the boomers leaders uh they're just making things a little bit tough it's going to be a tough world to inherit because of the energy problems and i do think that net net it will probably be okay but the fact that we're reverting back to coal like coal really uh it's just like like depressing yeah and everybody's just like oh dang whoops how is this happening and it's like ah and so i think yeah i think a lot of people feel even and i've i've been a little bit i think emotional about it but i think a lot of people feel even more emotional than i do where it's like you look around you and the world is just way different like you can't own a home like the way that your parents or your grandparents were able to um you know having a family is super expensive having any sort of stability uh is just more difficult because of the the way that the system is designed so so david and i are uh you know millennials i'm more on the kind of the elder millennial side of things and you know david's uh one of the younger millennials and kyla you are you're a gen z and i i've got to ask the question like um is gen z screwed like i thought millennials were screwed but like given the backdrop of this entire episode is gen z screwed and what is your advice for somebody listening who you know skews a little bit younger like in their 20s how do they prepare themselves what do they what do they do with this information other than feel helpless which i feel like a lot of us feel when we look at the the scope of problems that uh that you know are hitting us right now all of the the weirdness that's going on what do we do about this yeah i mean i i don't think there's there's food but i've excuse me i'm pretty impressed with how jinzy sort of conducts themselves i think that there's a lot of um desire for change and they're willing to sort of go out there and make that change happen so i think it'll just be having your voice heard and that's a whole different situation um but in terms of preparing i think the biggest thing is just learning like figuring out what's going on around you like you can't run away from this stuff and you don't need to know like the in-depth situation on the russia ukraine energy problem but i think it's just good to be aware of this stuff because then like the way that things happen is through politics right like it's just how it is it's a conduit of things and it's just how society moves um so you have to understand what's going on around you in order to make the right decisions around different policy makers or even to advocate for different policy decisions so i think just you know educating yourself around the world and understanding like why things happen understanding the basics of supply and demand like it's it's really surprising how um many people don't understand like why prices go up and i think that's not good and i think it's a flaw of the system that we don't teach people hey this is why things are more expensive rather than just having people sort of freak out around oh my gosh like now my bread is five dollars a loaf like that's really expensive um so i think it's it just and this is a bias that i have but i think it boils down to education i think it boils down to advocacy and then um sort of having these conversations online or in person with people who think similarly to you because you know you're going to be so much stronger in a group to make these things done yeah so that that's what i would say read how do you think uh the zoomers of the world uh will be impacted by what's gone on in in the last few years because the millennials really have 2008 as kind of the thing that really uh stamped and impressed upon them how the world works uh and what i've noticed when i've talked to other younger young millennials younger even younger than me and zoomers in the crypto space uh they don't have the same like oh 2008 really impacted me uh vibe that me and ryan do uh and it's just they they were just too young for 2008 and so zoomers seem to be coming into this investing world watching dogecoin pump to a dollar tick talkers try and pump dogecoin to a dollar inflation happen as a result of a pandemic uh the gme debacle uh and the housing prices go through the roof like this this is going to be in my mind the 2008 equivalent for for zoomers how do you see zoomers uh just like coping with this and managing this with this and responding to this very odd paradigm that we exist inside of yeah i mean so i was young during 2008 but i just remember the impact it had on my family but a lot of people are either too young to remember that or maybe weren't impacted the same way but i think and i'm an older zoomer i guess but um a lot of people do still have that in the back of their minds but this time around it's not it's it's a little bit different like it's not these it's still an element of bad decisions by the banks but this is just a speculative bubble and i really worry around this sort of like lottery mindset this this gambling mindset that that i see permeating people where it's like oh all i have to do is just go into deutsche coin and make my money and then i can retire and i'm good to go so i think that there's this idea that if you just find the right investment if you just find the right thing to speculate on that all of a sudden your financial future will be set and that in that the common denominator there is that people have a desire for you know a stable financial future but i worry that um the risk-taking is really high and the risk appetite is really high like the number of people that i know that went all in on dogecoin is too high in my opinion um so that's what i worry about is this idea of like market never go down a lot of people were pretty beat up during this last january cycle and that was nothing you know compared to a true bear market so i think that's the biggest thing is is people expect something from the markets that the market doesn't need to deliver to them this is definitely a critique that that david and i have and you know we we sort of see it manifest in in this uh almost this nihilism this like meme stock meme crypto nihilism which is basically like money doesn't matter stocks don't matter number go up nothing matters therefore i might as well buy doge like there's no such thing as fundamentals for nasa and by the way if we all buy doge together or like insert whatever your favorite crypto mean here uh if we all do it together then we win and we can beat back the uh evil banks and the adversaries and and that's how we rebuild and and like to me and even they won't even go as far as that's how we re rebuild i don't think they're naive enough to to think that the world is going to like be rebuilt on on dogecoin but it's it's basically that's how we're gonna get wealthy and uh take back control and get that freedom that i think they are like wouldn't it be funny if it was though what if we did rebuild with those points like how funny would that be okay so like um how do you think that ends because like um that's why with bankless we're we're somewhat focused like obsessed i would say with um getting past the nihilism talking about fundamentals talking about longer term structures that crypto is building how do we get our generations because it's not just gen z it's millennials as well that's younger we're all looking for this freedom how do we get them past this nihilistic phase and into i think a brighter future where it's like oh hey our generations are now responsible for the institutions of tomorrow because the old ones aren't working so we better build the new ones pretty damn well no one else will how do we get to that point so i think this actually zooms out to like a whole different issue where we have a crisis of like passion people don't know what they care about um so they find religion and things like gme amc deutsche coin because there's community there there's belief there uh people you know seem to care about them there in the community forums um and i think that you have to help people discover what they care about which is like such a big ask right and i don't know exactly what that looks like but i think in order to make people truly care you have to help them realize that there's things that they need to kind of care about and whether that be like art or realizing that art is something that you can pursue like you don't have to have straight a's and you know do mathletes even though mathletes is great i think that there's just a big disconnect between what people feel like they can pursue and do and what they actually like do if that makes sense um so i think with gme and amc a lot of that was boiling down into sort of an anti-establishment like the system sucks so we're gonna buy this stock and that'll show them um but that was also for people finding a meaning right um so i think they just have to find meaning whether that be like building a new crypto protocol or something like that like i think there's a lot of room for that sort of stuff um so how do you unlock the next level of the economy and help people with access opportunity et cetera but it's just helping them realize that there's more out there than just betting uh kyla i do think meaning is uh wrapped up in all of these conversations you know so so much maybe so much more than than we're like to uh you know people like to admit um but let's talk about this so you've talked a few times about uh being an educator being a content creator right and uh you are a content creator on tick tock that's a medium that david and i haven't really gotten into but can you talk a little bit about your experience like creating content helping people you clearly have a passion for this helping people understand these financial systems and the structures uh that govern them the structure the structure of money because sometimes i look at things like like tick tock and i'm like oh my god tick tock is just making us all more dumb and then i see your content i'm like well there's a way to do it without us all getting dumber because your content actually makes people smarter um but how do you do it and do you think like even our social media systems are structured against us the algorithms don't reward like intelligent in-depth content they just reward whatever you know flavor of the moment uh like whatever the flavor of the moment is cookies and typewriters yeah are they all making us dumber kyle and like how do you leverage these systems i guess as an educator yeah um so like i kind of made content accidentally like i never thought that this would be i'm very grateful it's my life but never thought it'd be my life but the reason i started making content was i i started around the time of gme amc last year i've been writing a blog around options trading forever but this was like i was like time to get on tick-tock because there was a lot of questionable information um and i think the biggest thing with social media is it's a tool right and so like you can throw the hammer backwards at the wall and be like man this hammer doesn't work but you can also throw it at a nail and be like okay it's actually going to nail something in the wall like the tool does work it just depends on the content that you um choose to make and unfortunately to your point around algorithms like algorithms definitely favor more like you see it on twitter all the time like just stuff that gets people on flame duff and up in arms um but for me like the way i sort of think about my content is that there's a big need for sorry i've been talking so much but there's a big need for education uh in in the stock market and in crypto and around the macro economy so going back to what i was talking about earlier like a lot of people just want to know what's going on and they want to know about it not from a really in-depth like very technical research paper around what the stock market is but they just want to know the highlights and the more that you can give people the highlights the more exposure they have just different things the more it'll start to click um so if you like just listen to stock market reels or crypto reels um not real as in instagram reels but just like crypto news clips every day like you're going to start to pick up on different things and i think that's the biggest thing with social media is this element of exposure so if you're able to get people to tune in every day for a news update or tune in to a youtube video about geopol politics that's going to be super valuable for them so that's how i think about it is it's exposure it's helping people process what's going on around them right now and and tying in an element of education to that uh so yeah that's that's sort of um how i how i design my socials yeah kyla to close things off i think everyone is kind of gearing up for a very chaotic 2020s the whole entire decade and really the stage has been set with a lot of the stuff that we've talked about in this episode so far um but one of my favorite lines from game of thrones is that chaos is a ladder implying that chaos provides opportunity to people that learn how to best navigate that chaos do you have any advice or recommendations for individuals but then also as society how can we win as both individuals and as a society in 2020 in the 2020 decade yeah i don't so there's a lot of polarization uh right now like a lot of people just getting angry at things just to get angry and i get it uh there's a lot of dissatisfaction but i think the more that we can try to understand each other and see where the other person is coming from the other group is coming from um the more valuable that will be so that's what i would say to society is just trying to understand each other better which is so easy right um and in terms of individuals i think like really education and this is once again a bias that i have but education is literally the most powerful tool that there is like the more that you know about the world the more prepared you're going to be for certain things the more that you're going to understand what's going on around you and that really helps to to combat i think maybe nervousness or anxiety around the future because like there's an element of this stuff that you just can't control right like i i can't stop russia from invading ukraine and it makes me kind of sad that i can't but i can make content around it and other people can make content around it and consume information around it and i think the more that you're able to learn the more powerful that that is going to be for your own decision making process and the more that more educated people are i think the better society is and that goes into the first point around understanding people more the more educated that you are around different topics the more you can unders understand people more um so that's what i would say yeah kyla that is a perfect place to end because i think people who are tuned into the bankless podcast uh are making the effort to get educated and so we're definitely glad they're with us and we're glad you're with us on this episode thank you for unpacking all of these issues with us we hope you come back sometime soon yeah thanks
