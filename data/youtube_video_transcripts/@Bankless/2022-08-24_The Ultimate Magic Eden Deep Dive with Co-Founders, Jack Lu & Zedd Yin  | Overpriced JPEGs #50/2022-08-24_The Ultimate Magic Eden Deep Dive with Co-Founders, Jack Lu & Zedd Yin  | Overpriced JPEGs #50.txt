[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs it is a very special episode today i am joined by two of the co-founders of magic eden i have jack lew ceo and zed yin ceo of magic eden here on the podcast with me today thank you both so much for joining thanks for having us having us magic eden of course making headlines these days for integrating ethereum nfts onto the platform they have typically been so long or they have historically only been a solana marketplace so that's big news we'll of course get into that i want to get into marketplace economics broadly and really how that business model exists now how you see it playing out how you're really thinking about all of that we'll get into some of the fun uh twitter i don't know not beefs maybe that's overstating it but some of the fun twitter moments that have happened with magic eden recently some back and forth with openc that went down uh talk about security and any other number of things that inevitably will come up as we get into this conversation but first we do need to hear a word from our lovely sponsors there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who need to manage their treasury operations every crypto org

coinshift.xyz bankless okay so i have been very upfront i think with the world in that i am definitely less versed on solana and the ecosystem at large than frankly i would like to be generally so i'm excited to have the two of you on i'm sorry you're you're my first sort of like big solana team to come on the pod so inevitably you're gonna bear some of the questions just around solana generally but i would love for y'all to to sort of talk through why you decided to launch on solana initially and how you ended up there as opposed to any of the other number of ecosystems where you could have landed yeah absolutely i i i can kick off with a little bit of a story in uh you know tuition uh please jump in any time well first of all yeah carly thanks to time for having us you know i think uh we've always been fans of the podcast i listen to many episodes so yeah really grateful for the opportunity um i think for solana there's yeah there's um you know like product and technical reasons why we chose solana and it was a pretty intentional choice for us but then there were also like some personal uh choices as well so um first and foremost um i think when uh i i before starting my eden i was working at ftx uh and of course they were massive solano supporters and when i was there i you know at that time the salon ecosystem wasn't as mature as what it was uh now but because through that kind of experience i came to contact with many solana builders who are still building under the hood still kind of in the incubation phase or the conception phase but i saw a lot of just uh talent um uh and um just kind of amazing product ideas from that time at ftx and i was really very very bullish and very optimistic so before that was definitely a much more like a eth maxi or a bitcoin a bag holder but you know that exposure through ftx with these solana builders may be quite bullish on the ecosystem i mean we really feel like wow there is a lot of talent and people with vision who's come into this ecosystem and then secondly like on a more like a product and technical uh perspective uh both our founding team for magi eden we've got four founders two of us came from kind of deep product consumer product background so i came from doing pm at google and georgian came from uh the product background at coinbase and now two other uh technical co-founders uh sid and rex they were like founding engineers of ubereats so like very large consumer marketplaces so all of us come from this very deep like consumer product background and we were very attracted to the the solana valley proposition of like you know really low uh uh really low transaction costs fast finality it just seems like a chain where the cost of experimentation and the cost of trying out new things seem to be much cheaper much more accessible we thought you know like given this nft thing is so nascent that it seems so much more consumer-centric than you know previous crypto use cases like d5 did solana as an ecosystem system at that time seemed like a good bet to to try something new but yeah joshua did you want to yeah add anything else yeah i think the i would echo the point around um following where the builders are going because what a and i spent sort of three years building on ethereum as well i was one of the early employees at dydx but one of the things i noticed around that time as well was that a lot of the friends that i had who were very early in the ethereum d5 days were going across to build things in solana so a good example here is uh the founders of phantom who were previously at xerox right good good friends of ours and they had moved over to the solana ecosystem very early so we we just felt that there was just a very uh nice and organic momentum brewing at the time and that thesis around sort of new use cases and experimentation i think proved out to be very true because we saw the entity ecosystem grow extremely quickly and we were lucky enough to catch that at the right time but also build i think what was you know ultimately like the best product in the ecosystem so um that was sort of the rationale behind the early decision but um um you know we're kind of just excited now because it it this this this platform that we've built now allows us to expand into many many other types of verticals when it comes to nfts and also tap into many other users and creators so that's sort of the focus for us going forward was that the plan at the gate was the plan always to expand into ethereum and potentially uh other trains as well yeah yeah so it was no way oh sorry yeah i think so yeah in our original kind of like strategy deck uh we definitely wanted to be um sort of like different ecosystems in different communities and ethereum was definitely uh pretty high on the list did you feel like there was an opportunity to make a name for yourself in maybe a less competitive market at the time so lana that you could then leverage into other chains did that did that factor in um no i think like at the time when we were first starting the business i think after i think first um you know we absolutely feel privileged to be in this position like some were surprised as well right like we've only been around for 10 months and we've managed to trade like 2 billion in cumulative volume so we we at the start when you know on day zero i don't think any of us the four founders expected this kind of growth as well but at that time um the competitive intensity of different ecosystems wasn't uh like a super high consideration it was primarily more around i mean even on solana we were i think the number six or number seven marketplace to launch and at that time there were pretty dominant incumbents with you know 70 80 percent market share at that time so they were like they already had some pretty deep network effects but i think it was more primarily around um you know we had four founders with pretty deep like product dna and we didn't want to uh we wanted primarily to work on an ecosystem where it's more about thinking about like the product experience without really uh and and trying out new use cases without thinking about like you know gas fees like chain level optimizations and so on and so forth yeah the experimentation piece i i mean that makes sense and and you say there were other marketplaces and there clearly were but i remember there was some disaster nobody had staked out a claim i feel like on a really strong marketplace in solana 10 months ago and in fact it was a little bit of like hopefully nobody comes at me for this but kind of a laughingstock like there were some like really clear disasters so there definitely was space for somebody to come in and really disrupt it um we'll get into the move to ethereum and the timing on all this next because that's obviously a natural offshoot here but um i'd love for you to describe for me what you think is really the cultural difference between solana and ethereum maybe broadly and then specifically within these nft communities yeah i can i can i can kick off so i think one of the first observations is that demographically it's very different uh it's actually um a lot of people assume that it's kind of probably the same users will just come across and use solana but we've one of the things that we do a lot at magic eating and we've done this from the early days is we do a lot of community building so we spend a lot of time talking to users talking to creators uh we have a whole kind of community team that this is this is kind of their bread and butter but the the demographic is different but i'd say the the users on solana definitely are younger um and that means that what they're looking for is also different right um the the types of nfts that we've seen uh generally are much more experimental in terms of utility uh and also they're cheaper in terms of cost right which is actually in my opinion a good thing because it sort of lowers the user the user hurdle or the user barrier to kind of get started um so that's the first difference that i'll point out i think the the second observation that i'll make is that um the diversity of entity projects is pretty interesting on solana um one of the reasons that i guess yeah we wanted to come here was because the thesis was when it's cheaper you just see a lot more different things happen right people always more willing to try it and we see a large number of gaming projects choose to launch on solana even if the team is very very familiar with the evm ecosystem they feel like you know the single state you know high throughput sort of system or nature of the solana chain and ecosystem allows them to you know build a game for the long term and you know we end up seeing that nft volume then just happen on magic as a result of that and that's something that i i definitely did not see uh there was obviously a couple of games on heath but you know not not by and large a trend i would say uh is much more the high value blue chip sort of nft projects um and you know that's i think those are two of the major difference that we've noticed over over the at least the first sort of six seven months of our existence when we first got started yeah i think eth is definitely the the gaming bets they're making are the layer twos and really on that side of things how much do you time do you guys spend thinking about like the macro picture of all this from a chain perspective and the scalability of an ethereum versus the scalability roadmap of like a solana or is that not really factor into your day-to-day at this point because your goal is to be multi-chain yeah i would say it's more the latter um i think we definitely spend a bit of time talking to advisors and talking to you know folks who have a lot more like expertise and also around like consensus and scalability around like the different um uh chains out there and like how those trade-offs map um but primarily our main focus is following where the users are so we think about hey which where are the main use cases whether it's from like the main creators of and main use cases and the creators of those use cases like where are they kind of poorly and converging so we definitely see some pools and convergences around like you know ethel ii solutions for gaming uh you know uh and solana as well and then we think about like where are the primary like collector like class are also pooling as well and we think about okay where are the main users which you know where are there like enough pools of uh value for us to maybe go serve them and maybe uh some segments will be like specifically more underserved than others and that's primarily how we make our choices around where to go so that segways as well into the decision now to add ethereum nfts to the the offerings on solana or sorry to the offerings on magic eden uh talk to me about how this came to be why now was it just that the tech was finally ready was there some other strategic calculation that went into this decision yeah oh yeah jack yeah i'm sure um yeah i think like timing for us is more around the readiness of from like a team and our own like prioritization perspective i think uh in some sense at a like the highest level the ethel one ecosystem is something that we've long admired right like this is an ecosystem with collections with so much like longevity legacy and they've been like pioneers of this space especially around like this collectibles use case and they have like deep kind of cultural roots so this is always something where we wanted to enter have a play on and serve those communities in terms of the timing specifically it's primarily for us to like really consolidate our position on seoul finish this major fundraise so that we would have enough capital uh and and resources to fund like more expansion plans that was some of the primary getting items before we decided to you know to launch onto ease i think it was also around like you know there was some specific value propositions that we wanted to deliver to users in the ethereum and so on the ecosystem and we have to think about like some really good solutions for those before we um really feel comfortable enough to like to enter those communities for example um one of the uh like these value propositions is really around like cross ecosystem audience so letting for example letting um sole users uh buy and trade ethereum nfts with soil and let and vice versa letting ethereum users buy and trade and mint uh sold nfts with ethereum we didn't really conceptualize a good solution to that for a while until we you know landed on the current one and and that was always some something that we really wanted to provide to those communities as something very unique and long sought after so once we had the right idea to like on how to deliver that that's when we also felt like hey it's and now is a good time for us to pull the trigger and so yeah yeah that's super cool i i would love to get a little technical here and and understand a little bit better how you're facilitating that and you know specifically in case folks just missed it like you can use eth and buy a soul a solana nfd and i can use soul and buy and eat nft now on magic eden and that's a um a cool win for like multi-chain maxi folks i guess i don't know how i'd put it walk me through it yeah absolutely so we actually um we we explored a variety of uh different solutions uh originally so we looked at like cross chain bridges we looked at some like really frontier tech like you know lay zero and stuff and then uh you know the ultimately we ended up with partnering with uh another company called crosmet to deliver the solution they're like folks that we've worked on uh the folks who we've worked with um uh historically are many other like partnerships before and we really admire their team so the their solution it's actually kind of better described by them in some ways uh but uh like at a high level what happens is you know they provide somewhat of a a centralized bridging solution in the middle where a sole user let's say a sole user wants to buy ethereum nft the sole user would first trans uh transact with crossman in like a back to back to back uh kind of uh transaction flow where the sole user would transact with uh crossman to swap salt with eth and then they would the crossman would then use ease to buy the ethereum nft and then there will be some basically like wallet creation and wallet address creation steps in the middle where then uh craftsman would then deliver the ethereum nft into an ethereum and address which then can be redeemed by the by the solana user so all of this then basically to a solana user in this flow like they never have to go and download metamask create a seed phrase but they do have a very easy redemption flow in the middle and they don't have to like go through a centralized exchange process or anything like that yeah we actually piloted this a bunch of times with uh we first did it on the minting side where we wanted large creators who maybe had audiences that were not so crypto native to allow their users and audiences to mince nfts really easily with a credit card that was sort of the first origin of all of this and then we realized that oh this tech can actually just be used for you know using different currencies to mint and trade that's how we kind of got started um so yeah it's been pretty cool to see that there's interest in in a product like this do you worry about security i just i hear like i just hear like central point of failure you know and i'm sure others do too when we think about bridges or or these kinds of solutions uh what do you guys think about on that side yeah so i think um number one like we have some pretty strong like i think number one definitely security is the hot topic of the day right now just given you know hacks going uh exactly exactly and that's um i think that was one of the primary reasons why we didn't choose like these decentralized bridging solutions as well because for us when we did our exploration a lot of it seemed pretty uh like like we could understand all the ins and outs of it for us to feel fully comfortable that this is fine but in this solution at least we will have one like some legal frameworks to a portion to make sure there is like liability like users will be taken care of in the in the um event of like something nefarious happening but also uh in this situation like there is um very little like honey pot or centralized honey pot risk on magic eaten itself right because we were never taking full custody of these nfts or these funds at all um so that was what kind of ultimately made us pretty comfortable and finally for this rollout everything is done in a really phased fashion so originally we had to first row test this with like a primary minting solution and then now we've rolled them out uh only for eight collections on uh and then we're gonna like monitor the progress before we roll it out like full speed were you saying in there and i hear you seem to suggest there's almost like an insurance policy in place where there's like a recourse for folks if there were to be a hack you know through this system of some sort and folks can feel safe because of that yeah i i have to like probably come back with some details on that i don't have that like off the top of my head but that would be handled by the crossman side yeah we'll we'll move into sort of some other specifics of the of the marketplace here uh after this but uh i bring this up i think like every podcast episode now at this point which i feel like for for many months or since the inception of me starting to get into all this stuff i sort of had this position of like of course we'll live in this like multi-chain world and that's just the inevitability and i've increasingly started shifting i think because these bridge hacks and as i've learned more about the ethereum ecosystem i'm like i really see the path to scale for something like ethereum so you talk about solana's you know got a bit of a gaming focus i know magic eden has a bit of a gaming focus and that's because there's higher throughput all these reasons that it's really the scale uh you know and low fees piece that makes solana really good for gaming for example but i feel like ethereum's gonna be able to get there and layer twos and i see the path to that and i worry about these bridges and um i'm curious like if you guys have strong thoughts or feelings on this like cross chain world versus there being a couple players that just end up dominating because they have the network effects and the security yeah i'll share a couple of thoughts um short answer is i also don't fully know but uh i think the thesis is we're at least gonna stuff is gonna exist on many chains at least in the short to medium term and i say that because very clearly uh the the scaling solutions on eth well i think it's clear like how it's generally going to play out at least in terms of like what the solution is the the feasibility of it and the speed with which those things will get adopted is still a little bit tbd yeah yeah and in the interim that's why you see things like solana taking off and i think why people you know the vc flavor of the month right now is aptos right and sui people are just really getting into that right now and that that's another um from a technical standpoint i'd say more analogous to a solana in that it's like a single state sort of you know scaling solution um it's a layer one and there's an opportunity for something like that to get mass adoption in the interim you know intervening periods before uh l2 like roll ups and you know zk tech really starts to gain traction um so that's one i think the second thing is that um with all these different layers that potentially might live on ethereum it's sort of hard i think to reason about sort of how composability is going to work across the various layers and i think that's like a little bit um that's one of the benefits i think that you get from the ether l1 ecosystem today so i think for those reasons we we expect there to be at least a short to medium period where some of these other chains will get a bunch of traction and as a result creators will be experimenting to all in all these different places and ultimately the creators of nfts don't really they don't really care they don't really think about it like super super deeply i think the crypto native ones obviously have an opinion in that they experience nfts for the first time in one of these ecosystems and therefore have some loyalty there but you reach out to the you know the next 99 of creators and they probably won't have a strong opinion in which case like us as the application layer we just care about like what's the best way for us to enable the most seamless experience to create you know buy sell entities regardless of of where it is yeah i think creators right will probably care if there's glaring security concerns you know these things like these bridge hacks like that that puts people off and then liquidity right if you're a creator you want your project or nft to be as sort of saleable and accessible to people as possible like how does this uh soul eth you can purchase either with either like plan impact liquidity like do you think it's a significant boost in terms of what we'll see there from like uh just higher trading volume because now i'm a primary soul holder who can buy these ethereum nfts and vice versa um [Music] i don't know if it like uh it has um yeah i think it's a little tbd like the impact on actual trading volume and and so on but um at the same time that's not our primary rationale for building a feature like this i think like liquidity is something that magic eating cares about it's a very like platform like magic eden's specific lens right but we primarily build our features from a user-first lens so what the we we're building this for our creators to enable them to open up and reach different audiences that's the value proposition of something like this and when we talk to creators about like hey would you like audience expansion would you like to reach different types of users that you couldn't reach before and build new communities in places that you couldn't build it for without having to relearn a new set of technology and hire a new set of developers that is extremely attractive to them and that's the primary thesis for why we kind of build a feature like this and our belief like you know one of the you know i think like foundational things for us to build and build to a state of like where magic unit even is today is yeah let us first provide the value to our users first and then value or ultimately recruit back to magic unit so that's kind of the primary uh lens uh for us to be able to i think that's a that's a liquidity answer though in the sense of like users and creators also care about liquidity in the sense of like if i bought this nft and i knew i could never sell it again you know like that's unappealing but if now somebody from the soul or ecosystem can buy it right like that increases the the i would say right liquidity of that asset and just makes it all the more appealing so i understand that's like the the lens you're coming at it from so i'd love to get your kind of macro thesis on on marketplaces and how you're approaching it i mentioned earlier i think you're you're primarily focused on gaming but you can kind of maybe reflect the nuance in that and do you think uh like marketplaces will need to be really specialized in order to succeed because aggregators are ultimately going to become the like catch-all place if you're just trying to you know trade a pfp for example yeah so i think a couple of thoughts one is um first of all like we should recognize that marketplaces are intensely competitive markets right like just across the board whether that's in crypto or not crypto um and i think in general we've always seen there's always room for very large uh generalized marketplaces that's always been true from like a market structure standpoint there's always a couple right and then as a as as marketplaces and markets get more mature there's always room for specialization that occurs across the different verticals that exist in where we are today with nfts i'd say the uh the there's there's generalization of marketplaces today where you can you know places like magic eden today and openc you can kind of trade anything right it's all available to the user um and i would say that because the market is so young the the way that that works is that it's all kind of centered or catered towards this like pfp experience and uh the way we think about it is that that actually is just one vertical because that's the first thing that got popular right um so that's point number one and i think um you know all the marketplaces today that cater to that experience i think uh is catering for you know what what just got product market fit in the in the early days um can i interject with a question there and then i don't want you to lose this thought but i want to double down i think i heard you said in a conversation um i i guess like defend the pfp boom i i forget who you're speaking with but it was you were kind of you were talking about like pfps as like like a really valid utility and like like major use case for nfts moving forward and i'd love to to maybe have you express that viewpoint if if you recognize what i'm saying here and like i think i tend to be in the opposite camp which is like i think pfps are for like a small market of people but the the mainstream aren't gonna necessarily be changing their twitter profile pictures to like animations and people actually like having themselves be seen on social media et cetera et cetera um do you disagree with me on that or did i misinterpret this earlier statement i've heard you make uh i i would say that um vips clearly have been affected like everything else in the macro environment the last like couple months right uh do i think as a category pfps will continue to exist as a category of mts like absolutely the reason i say that is because it's still fundamentally the easiest way to experiment with nfts in my opinion um and then secondly it's from a creator standpoint it's sort of the only thing that so far has gotten enough traction for you know an audience that's large enough to actually participate and you know we've seen communities large enough that have grown around pfps and i don't think that this is the end of it like i think that for pfps to continue to exist there has to be more innovation either around the pfps itself or you know through other categories of entities which is which is one of the reasons we actually feel really strongly about gaming as a vertical because like we want to be in the categories that um that end up creating the most amount of entity innovation right and we really think that gaming will be one of them uh it also means that we we are serving pfps and that's what we've served you know for the last 10 months but it won't be the only thing that we serve so to go back to the the second part of your earlier question um i do think there's some degree of verticalization that that is really important right even today we we the way we've built magic eaton and even though we're very early in the sort of entry into gaming you'll see that there's already a different experience that's forming around how people consume gaming entities for us that means you know you you come to magic even you discover games um independent of the on-chain items and you decide for yourself if this is a game that you actually are excited about interested in want to play and then there's ways to discover the items that may exist within those gaming ecosystems right and then that experience is really different to how you discover a pfp um so i do think that is quite important that as ticketing or music or whatever you name it vertical exists there will be different ways to consume those things on a marketplace i feel like you're getting there to part of your competitive advantage which is to be a more like full spectrum provider right like like walk be with somebody through like a fuller life cycle of their nft experience not just like at the point of purchase i i'd love maybe jack if you want to take this kind of talking to me a little bit more about that competitive advantage and and maybe fleshing out what dad was saying there around like discovering games through magic eden and not just like buying an asset on it yeah um yeah absolutely and i think like zooming out a little bit like why you know i some sometimes it's like kind of crazy stepping back and thinking about like you know even two years ago three years ago you think nfts will become the hardest like use case in crypto right and then collectibles becoming the hottest use case in nfts uh like two years ago that would be unfathomable as a thing and then uh when we think like fundamentally about like why did this phenomenon even occur um part of the reason is yeah this this uh collectibles or nft experience is so much more like social and fun than a lot of the crypto use cases previously right it was previously if you wanted to talk to the average user about you know staking or trading on defy it's a pretty abstract kind of concept that most people um like that every person on the street it's hard for them to grog those kind of things but for nfts there is this like meme this irreverence this like social aspect this like community aspect this like talking aspect right and all of those things are kind of part of a user's experience as they come and experience this use case but unfortunately for most marketplaces we only serve the final most utilitarian step in that user journey which is hey i've made all the decisions i've done all the research i've had all of my aha moments i've trolled others and i've received trolling and now i just click the button to come to a marketplace and i think we we believe building great product is letting the user experience the fun and experience those kind of emotional like uh highlights in the product itself and then to your point carly absolutely we want to expand horizontally across the user journey in all of the verticals that we have so the user can really experience those kind of things so for gaming yes there should be discovery where they can come and play the game on magic eden and then like they don't have to buy anything at that at that point but the user has received some value that's adjacent to nfts right and then if they're like oh yeah i actually really like this game this is pretty dope then they can decide to buy something right and they can like take it home and enjoy it themselves so we really like that immersive like that like giving user value first kind of uh driven aspect of uh nfts as well it's the same like even on the collectibles use case um um we also experimented with having chat on our uh on magic eden so you know users can start like basically chatting to each other commenting on like a specific collection and so on and again it's part of the same philosophy of saying hey you don't have to just come to measure either to click buy or click sell but you can actually experience some much more adjacent things right get value in some different ways so you have like a game tabs a games tab on the magic eden website and i can go and i can play like browser based games how are you sourcing the games that are on there how is that coming to be those are your partners who offer game assets in the in the app you say hey like link create a link for people to play it through the the site or how did that develop yeah we we talked to a lot of game developers just like we talked to creators of all kinds uh this is sort of how we we came to came to want to tackle this category as well is that we noticed that there were a lot of creators that were looking to build games in web3 whether that's traditional um game developers coming from you know indie studios previously or coming from large gaming companies who now view web 3 as a new business model um it's a really interesting sort of evolution in the gaming uh the gaming space so the way it usually works is that um there's actually a lot of ways that game developers can work with us um number one is obviously you know featuring in this like discovery portal that we've been talking about which is which is kind of cool because it allows it's almost like a one-stop shop for the players to come and just check out what's what's new what's the most exciting game that's happening in uh in today's solana but obviously as we expand there'll be um games on other chains and then the second second way for game developers to work with us is um we give them a platform to launch the nfts that are that are going to be used within their uh their gaming ecosystem and that's the product called launchpad that we that we have right which which is actually available to anyone um not just game developers but uh we we've increasingly seen it's um very very useful for game developers as they build their community and try and go to market um because the build cycles are typically really long for for someone who's building a game and then the third layer is actually powering a bunch of the back end right because like game developers what they're really good at is building building games or at least they should be spending their time building the games right they shouldn't be spending their time building things that may not be you know the the stuff that they're really good at and that's the piece that we really want to help with it's maybe there's a bunch of on-chain minting and trading functionality that they may not want to build themselves and you know we are obviously the experts in that kind of stuff so offering that some of these solutions as a back end is um exactly the kind of things that that we think will be really useful for them so there's a number of different ways that we typically work with uh developers and um you know that's sort of one of the a few of the ways we work with game games who do you see as your biggest competitors because the obvious answer is like open c but it strikes me that you know you're in theory probably competing with discord and you're you know you're you're thinking bigger where you're actually competing with all these places where folks are spending their time in web 3 communicating or hanging out or playing games etc yeah i can take that one i think uh look you know of course like uh many folks compare us to openc and then uh you know uh uh asked us about like the competitive dynamics there like in all reality i think um number one we have a lot of admiration for the openc team right so they were very much the pioneers of the space and they like bet uh on this whole use case and this category of nfts before we would you know we even came along so we have a lot of admiration for them and secondly um i think our view is this space is everyone's kind of like in this game on the bet that this is going to be 500x or 1000x bigger than what it is today right and if we see take too much of a zero-sum kind of pov on just what the use cases that exist today i think that probably will give us some level of tunnel vision that like so that we don't see the forest for the trees so we're absolutely kind of subscribed to that uh philosophy i think the last point to make here is like for us um our what we are primarily focused on is we want to focus on these specific verticals or specific use cases like gaming and collectibles where we believe there is a ton of opportunity and we want to go deep like there are many many users here there are creators which is actually a very underserved user group in the nft marketplace kind of game and there are different types of collectors there's collectors speculators you know api people like mev traders and so on and we want to go very very deep and for us it's much more about like figuring out what those people want and what they are really motivated for and that we would just build what they want and in some cases when we're in the gaming sphere it looks like we are competing with x y z like it could look like we're competing with epic or something like completely somewhere to organization and in collectibles which is very crypto native it looks like we are competing with open c but for us our primary lenses how do we go deep here how do we understand our uses really well and how do we build things that are really like uh is really serving them oh joshua i don't know if you want to comment yeah no no i think i agree it's uh i think it's very it's very common question we get that is almost um the the implication is almost like this all the stuff is zero sum right which is like yeah and it's in fact the opposite because to the point you made we're like we're all expecting the space to grow and it's sort of like having all the jewelry shops in one street it's like just like bringing more people into the ecosystem to trade in a number of different places you know and um so you know you have to ask in some ways because i think there's some interesting answers that can come out of it but but i agree i think you know in web 3 right now that's why it's like kind of a friendly space too like sure there's like twitter spats and this and that but like by and large like we're in a growing pie so the the um psychology of people who are operating in a space that's growing is just like a much happier psychology than when you're like competing for a shrinking pie immutable x is the layer two platform for crypto gaming immutable

creators are being underserved like i'd love to hear you elaborate a little bit more on where you think that opportunity is yeah i'll i'll i'll i'll take a crack and you know tuition please jump in um uh yeah i think like you know historically like um nfc marketplaces were really uh like an end user to end user or a collector to collect a uh focused product right and you know if you look at some of our um like peers who came before us that was primarily the users that they were serving it's all about like buyer and seller right and that's the the main the main uh the main use the main user like but we magic eden we were one of the first marketplaces to create like a launchpad product which is a specifically effectively a creative focus product to help them launch and distribute their nfts and when we think about that um that creator the creator has like so many like emotional anxiety points to deal with nfts like first of all like for them to even understand like if you're a let's say you're a digital artist for you to even be bought into the idea of nfts probably takes you like six weeks of research on crypto twitter and reading a lot of blogs for you even to want to take the leap of faith right to dive into this ecosystem and then and we just find like so many creators are just looking for a guide like a beacon someone to show them the way teach them all the you know pitfalls so they don't have to take a s ban and then secondly like then if you think about the launch moment of the nft it's a highly anxiety inducing moment because there are so many so many examples of ways where you can screw things up but then if you do a ride it's actually a life-changing moment right for the creator in 10 minutes it could change the trajectory of your career your family your financial situation so of course for them they have so much vested interest and again they are looking for someone to help help them like ease them through this process and then afterwards like there is you know they launch the nft there is a whole bunch of you know problems that they face with okay how do i keep my community happy how do i even understand like who is holding my nfts how do i build even more use cases along so for all of those things that like there is a lot of i would say like emotional baggage and pain points that come associated with that but you very rarely see like a marketplace one of the strongest kind of players in this ecosystem taking a stand to serve them so that's why we came along and we said hey like let us start with the launchpad product which seems to be the the tip of the spear if you will for this creator like that's something they have to get right and then you know there are many other things for them that they want to serve and it's the same with um that would be like you know a lot of those things i mentioned would apply uh to uh uh crypto artists like collectibles creators but actually they also equally apply to gaming developers which is just another type of creator right those guys are like worrying about creating content they're worried about am i going to run out of runway in a bear market and like how do i even deal with this blockchain thing because i've been you know making games my whole life they also have many many like anxiety points which we can go and serve as a marketplace as well yeah josh i don't know if you want to jump in because he's done so much so much work with creators i was just going to ask on some specific levels and then i want to talk about the launch pad but like you know i've talked to brendan mulligan who runs pre-mint and i know one of the features that he is pushing on i don't think they've launched it yet but it's just like greater analytics for creators when you launch like we have all this data about what nft wallets mint or are likely to mint after they joined a a pre-lit like a you know a pre-mint list essentially whatever it's called uh i can't believe i'm playing allow list and um and he was like so we can give you data and like analytics to show like the odds that your project is going to sell out based on the nft wallets that have signed up for your allow list is some of that like some of like is there an analytic piece to this that you can give creators that that give them hope or like hey congratulations you just meant it out and you have this amount of soul here's how we recommend like spacing out your spend for the next year because here's what we've seen historically when it comes to like what you can expect on secondary is it that kind of arming them with historical data and information that they can make more informed decisions yeah i mean to today that piece is we have a lot of data just from the number of launches that we've done right we've done at this point over 300 on on magic eden and a lot of information i think can be surfaced to creators and product eyes in in a really really useful way both like pre you're talking about there like a before the mint give the creator a bunch of signals so that they know you know if they need to like do a bunch of things before the mint goes live if they need to like find additional people to join the allow list yeah do i need to be worried am yeah yeah do i need to drop the price don't need to change the supply there's just all these different things but there's actually quite a lot even after the mint in terms of understanding who is in my holder base right like what are they really excited about what are some ways to uh you know tap into other communities or do some cross-collaboration with other communities is is my holder base you know also the same holder base as i don't know moon birds or whatever right so that it becomes really interesting when you start to think about that and these are all things that i think we generally on our side think about it as creative facing tools or creative facing product uh of which as jack said launchpad is sort of the tip of the spear um but but i would taking a step back i would say the way we think about this creator side is is is similar to how we think about it on the end user side too in that the the user has to come and use maybe like four or five really disparate sets of products right on the on the creator side it's like yeah pre-min it's like i don't know some analytics tools maybe there's some launch products or there's some companies that give you like custom smart contracts and the zoli is very disparate on the end user side it's like yeah again research analytics aggregators marketplaces lots of different places and i think we sort of see ourselves as the the unifying end-to-end journey right so that creators and users can come just one place and uh magic even just has has all of that um it's all in one one one-stop shop you know y'all have have raised a bunch of money there's a number of other marketplaces that have raised a bunch of money and and as you pointed out there are a lot of marketplaces there's a lot of uh folks trying to compete in this space at this point do you think it's are vcs betting on teams and then they're saying like hey who do we think can be nimble and basically react to the market as it plays out because we're just too early to know really how any of this is going to come together yeah i think i'll share a couple of thoughts um one is that definitely vcs are investing in the the best kind of builders right in the space and i think that's generally how people thought about magic eating in that number one um we're clearly a team that can execute and execute really fast uh two we're here for a long time i think even though that we have experienced some growth that we still sometimes think is insane over the last sort of 10 months or so um that's that's not how the the market doesn't move linearly like that right and we we know that because we've been in the space for a long time and we know that it takes years uh uh sometimes longer to build massive massive businesses and we're here to make a huge impact uh in crypto and beyond um i think the third thing is to answer the question around like why are vc's investing in sort of all these marketplaces because i think um similar to how people thought about investing in crypto maybe like five or six years ago as an institutional investor you wanted to invest in the exchanges right the centralized exchanges because they were basically an index on the the fundable token market if you believe that you know bitcoin eth and then you know the whole slew of other erc20s and and so on and so forth would become a really big market then then centralized exchanges would also be really big businesses and i think the same is true with nfts like i think magic eden is a really excellent index on the nft market because if we all believe that nfts as a technology can get really big and it will serve a lot of use cases um those assets will need to live somewhere right and i think they will need to live on a place like a like a marketplace like magic eden and whoever can serve the next you know set of use cases for nfts will be in the best position to do that and i think that's the bet i think most vcs are are making and i think we're super lucky to have you know to partner with some really excellent investors and who back us as a team to kind of chase down that future i i've had somebody privately compare your your founding team and not necessarily anybody specifically but like to some like very big successful quite famous founders i won't say anything specific so i might give away who said this like in in a positive way of like you guys are are kind of sharks but also like you're like kind of a sharks when it all costs team that makes it sound maybe too negative but i want to get your reaction to that if you guys like think you're a particularly intense uh gonna win this space kind of a team um yeah i don't know if i describe us as intense but like absolutely i think we're taking this pretty seriously like in the sense of i think even for us to get to where we are today on seoul it took a lot of hard work like uh you know i i remember getting invited to google um to have a talk like uh um a couple a couple of months back and someone asked like you know like what are the tips like what was the secret sauce to you guys getting really big and uh you know my answer was yeah to be really honest there was no secret sauce it was just like working all the time i think that's what he was getting yeah because i think like even on seoul like we because we were like yeah i think number six or something like that to launch we had to overcome a lot of network effect to get to where we are today and we there was just a period we're just throwing a lot of dots at the door uh uh at the wall and and and just in general just start working really hard i think because we saw success from that was the actually the only way to succeed right to to do that we definitely um have that like kind of i would say like burnished in us as a lesson of like hey this is the kind of attitude that that it takes but at the same time i think we all also like that's why i wouldn't say we're really intense i think we have a lot of humility at the opportunity that we have right now like it's a real privilege for us to be where we are today and i think um you know in that sense we're actually like just amazingly thankful that we have this like opportunity and this platform to at least showcase our vision and our way of building product and our way of like serving users uh in this sense so yeah y'all are lovely it's i i i was almost surprised now kind of chatting with you guys because it was different than than sort of what i was expecting but i guess really what this person meant was just like the work ethic is kind of insane they must have been talking about our other co-founders must be terrible um i do want to talk about some of the learnings as you've thrown a lot of darts at the board and and bring up i know there was some controversies at one point with launch pad a couple projects that got through that really did end up being rug pulls and one in particular balloonsville which seemed to be a rug pull and then kind of bragged about the fact that they were a rug pole and they said you know they were able to get through without getting you know id'd i think you all had come out and said you know teams have to privately dox to us if they want to be on launch pad and balloonsville said oh well they didn't actually enforce that and we were able to get through i you know anyway maybe talk a little bit about your your learnings there in that situation and and how you've tried to course correct yeah that's like a an incident or a moment in the company that's sort of branded in us forevermore kind of thing uh i think we often think about that as a really pivotal moment because all of the work that we had put in up to that point um could have just all been taken away at that moment and i think we always we reflect on that very very seriously um but just to share the context for those that that might not be familiar um we had a very high profile you know very hyped project uh rug immediately after launching on magic eden's launch pad this is back in february and i think the the lesson for us was that uh in hindsight there were actually many many um warning signs leading up to that moment that uh us as founders we we didn't recognize uh because i think we were we were so far in the mindset of um let's move fast and let's make sure we continue to to grow and we sort of move fast and break things and then it broke it broke it broke um but we were so so i think um singularly focused on that that we did not think about the other things and the other things in this context is yeah there's actually a lot of user safety trust and safety that needs to be considered um so i think one of the big lessons for us is that you know you cannot have singularly focused goals i think sometimes there has to be a balance right and whenever you go too far in one direction it's going to come back and bite you at some point maybe not immediately but at some point it will um i think the second lesson that that we learned from this was that us as a as a marketplace or as a company we're very much building in public right and we've always actually acknowledged this and known this and this is part of the reason why we we try and get in front of the community as much as we can and try and be super transparent about things that means when things go well that also means when things do not go well and one of the things actually we're really proud of after that moment was that we actually just got in front of the community about it and we owned up to the errors and we said hey we're going to actually pause launchpad for three weeks while we fix up a bunch of the stuff that's wrong and we just owned up to that fact you know we're here and we did that we you know we paused all of the launches that were coming up we even referred them to competitors just because they wanted if they wanted to continue with their launches on their own timelines they should be able to do that like this is our this is our mistake um but all of these are good lessons for when you are building in public how do you actually handle that right and you know what we're obviously learning as we go but i think we handled that part of it actually pretty well and something that continues to be a strong theme for how we want to conduct ourselves in the future and then we came back with a much stronger set of trust and safety measures and uh that continues to be really really big focus for us um going forward so to confirm do folks have to be doxxed now to launch on launch pad at least to you all privately or do they do they have to be publicly doxxed they have to go through a a third-party uh service so we actually use a proper like kyc and what are you looking for there right because you know you not have like a criminal background but you know be somebody who maybe is shady or unserious like what are you looking for when you do these these checks yeah i think um like there's definitely some like background stuff there but i think like more importantly there needs to be like a chain of accountability like sometimes i think anonymity is just a figly it's a it's a fig leaf right that people hide behind to shirk like some level of accountability and then uh absolutely like there is also um like private boxing is not not the only thing we do we actually do a whole series of things right they also have to have like kyc uh uh like accounts that show that um those identity those identities have actually been used in real life like to establish to to other like institutions as well so we we have like other signals of trust um but also like i think um the process necessarily adds like quite a bit of friction so that like if you're like a scammer or something like that it's also adding quite a little a lot of like upfront deterrents as well yeah i would actually uh you know just echo like um you know what uh what joshua was saying before i think like the balloons balloonsville incident is something that's kind of like burnished now in magic eating culture there's something very funny about it being the balloonsville incident just like you know it's a serious thing and i see how it like impacted the dna of the company and things but it's hilarious because it's called balloonsville and that's just such a like silly light yeah it's like yeah he's so it's uh deceptively innocent right i think like it's a name but yeah i mean like for for every new joiner that joins magic eden we have like um onboarding sessions and we actually talk about our cultural tenants as a company so one of our cultural tenants is user obsession and this is the story that we tell to every new new uh to every new joiner where like hey there was a moment in time where we didn't get that balance right right and user obsession like in a marketplace business there is always two to two or three sides to the claim and launchpad as a product is a creative facing product but actually if you veer too much in favor of the creator make it too easy for them you actually you you forget your responsibilities to the end user themselves right to provide them trust and safety so we like distill some of these really really painful lessons to both illuminate this lesson around like balance but also illuminate this like cultural tenet of hey always have to think about the user and always have to be 360 degrees in the way that we think about the users i'm curious like the the end to this story i know i think jackiewood sent out a tweet you had identified the the real ids for the people in the balloonsville incident and were potentially pursuing them for like fraud because they they clearly signaled that they had intended to basically to fraud people is there any end to that story that's uh maybe gratifying for folks uh not that we can comment on publicly like there's definitely some processes um underway but yeah not in a position to comment right now fair enough um i know we're like a little over time here so i'm wondering if there are there anything in particular that you feel like we haven't covered that you want to make sure we cover i have a couple like user questions that would maybe be a fun place to to end on and this sort of like open c funny little twitter thing that i i want to end on but anything that like big picture like points you want to get get across to more of the ethereum audience that maybe is less um you know less familiar with magic eating up to this point look i think um you know where uh you know we we're super excited to to uh to enter the um ethereum ecosystem and serve the users there i think we have our own distinctive like uh approach and our own distinctive brand so a couple things that we're super proud to have done is you know we we really believe in like you know this like fidget or i don't know if that's uh to to uh catch uh a term but you know like making people feel some something real about the nfts that they bought right so we're really into like combining real life events with you know the nf digital nfc experience they had so you know we had a really successful like uh event with yuzu our launchpad uh our like inaugural launchpad uh partner in new york where we invited a lot of folks from the community to come and experience this like magical combo that could be uh you know one of the most um storied uh uh collections on youth and now this magic eating combination we also went to la to do this supper club where we met a lot of like really big ethereum holders to both to tell them our magic eden story but also actually come with a position of humility and learn about the ethereum ecosystem you know which were pretty new as well so yeah we basically raised a ton of money where did it specifically to you know enter new ecosystems and help you know bring our brand and bring our experience to them and we're yeah we're very excited to have the chance to do that not the first to try and take on openc and so it'll be very interesting to see how this uh how it plays out over the long term um i i want to talk about speaking of openc the the twitter back and forth that i have to say like i i loved it was so funny uh i think y'all had put out a piece of content with somebody who erroneously said that uh top shot nfts were similar like topped out with some of the most famous like ethereum nfts openc called you out in a in a twitter moment saying like you know mocking the fact that somebody had called top shot ethereum nfts and then you all responded um i think with a clap back about like the frozen asset position which is maybe worth getting into um any comments on that who runs your social media people or were when i said i was interviewing you guys they were like how do they uh how do they handle their their social media to to be so good at this we have the uh the infamous magic eaten intern uh who who's a real employee yeah yeah but gets caught we call him the intern as well even internally um but no he he uh i i look i think i'll tell you guys a story actually from from uh from the early days where we were actually a little bit um not confused but we were sort of trying to think through internally what is the magic even brand right and we were having a hard time i think internally sort of coming to coming to terms with what we wanted that to be and um it was actually a conversation myself uh tiff who's our head of marketing and she runs our social team as well uh and one of our investors are the chain smokers we got on a call together and we were like yo like alex like like how do we like grow the brand how do we do it in like this authentic way should we like go partner with coachella or something you know like make us a little bit more i don't know um hip like more visible more hip yeah uh and then he was like no don't don't be stupid like don't don't waste money on that kind of stuff just you guys already have a brand and a voice like clearly your your social presence is is is fun and playful um you guys should lean in and and do more of that right because um and he drew the analogy of you know be more like elon and less like jeff uh right and that he said that in in a way that he didn't mention any you know specific people in the industry but he was just like be more like elon uh and when it comes to entity marketplaces people will start to realize that uh and that's sort of around the time like we we got on board with the idea of like getting an intern to come in and actually start start being a bit more playful with this and not only posting more content but also replying to a lot of the community uh and also replying to you know basically interacting with with everyone that was out there and uh no i think the the specific stuff with openc is it's all in it's all in good fun honestly like the way we see it um and yeah i think they they i think i think they do as well yeah yeah no i think it was clear i mean i i interpreted it as like you know i think very much all in good fun so so tiff cmo will give her credit for the for probably running that but also maybe some blame for uh messing up the uh for for somebody under her messing up the uh yes the top shot ethereum nft uh blunder there which uh yeah yeah yeah rightfully take the l on that one we'll take the l on that one yeah so then let me close with um with this this frozen asset policy you know this has been getting a lot of attention for openc i i actually would say you guys coming out and taking a stand saying hey we don't freeze assets uh i actually think pushed openc to to provide a little bit more clarity around their stance on it my understanding is like historically openc has always said like there were legal reasons that they froze assets you know i think that they become liable if they're you know you know a part of a crime you know kind of privy to or helping to further somebody who stole assets um why have you taken the no frozen asset stance that you have do you worry that it puts you at legal risk if something is frozen and then sold you're like aiding and betting it by selling it on your marketplace um yeah i think this one is a pretty tricky and nuanced issue and i think you know in some sense maybe like you know um like we work with some like world leading lawyers we're comfortable with the the legal framework that we have right now but of course like law in in the crypto world is an amorphous and ambiguous thing so i'm sure like that's something that we have to like continue to keep our eye on as well i think for us um the lens that we want to take here is like hey like do we actually have a solution to this problem and in a solution in a way that is like user first doesn't disproportionately impact other folks and that's kind of the main lens that we want to we want to take on not that like we don't maybe recognize the problem but more that i wonder if we can have uh you know other takes on on how to approach this problem right now we don't have anything to share you don't have anything to share in terms of other approaches to to try and attack the problem that's what we're saying well thank you both so much for joining me i really appreciate it i uh as i it has been a consistent goal of mine to kind of understand the the solana ecosystem better so i'll have you back on once i do and can maybe have even smarter questions around some of that though now you know you'll be deeper in ethereum in a couple of months and so we can have you back on just to to dive deeper into what you're rolling out on the ethereum side um but i really appreciate it and i i missed your new york party and i'm sorry i don't know if you guys were here for that but next one invite me again i don't think it was you guys but somebody on your team did and i couldn't make it but we'd love to come next time absolutely thanks so much for having us on this is really fun it's awesome thank you colleen [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode
