it feels like almost no one in dc is fighting for crypto right now but you are why why are you sticking your neck out for us well because i know this is the future welcome to list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode for you today we're talking about crypto in washington dc how we win over washington dc for crypto and we're talking with a sitting congress representative today we're gonna go through five things number one why congress doesn't actually hate crypto number two what's at stake if america gets crypto policy wrong number three the answer to all of the shadowy super regulators we see turns out it's legislation number four why the digital currency path china is taking is totally wrong for the us number five how we win over dc as a crypto community david fantastic discussion with representative emmer today what were some of your thoughts representative emmer is definitely one of those representatives who has no problem updating how he thinks about the world as new technology comes into it and there's a a line that i've seen pro crypto versus anti-crypto representatives uh to a straddle in the the or not straddle but the pro crypto representatives tend to be really like first principles deep philosophical thinkers and really ground their positions in some sort of you know um idea about the world that goes down to seemingly the roots uh in contrast to the anti-crypto uh regulators out there that kind of just don't really seem to have a coherent uh stream it's very surprising very yeah just like kind of taking every issue issue by issue without having some sort of core fundamental principles that guides them through that and tom emmer's definitely somebody that thinks in the big picture and is able to zoom all the way out and place crypto in its moment in history and how the united states as a as a nation can engage with this uh new technology uh in its in its holistic fashion rather than just like what it is currently which is you know perhaps not the version of crypto that we want to see in the distant future so i definitely appreciate tom emmer for that he is uh just a well respected in congress uh for uh just advocating for crypto uh and also has a pretty optimistic outlook for how crypto will come to be a part of the uh government uh governance conversations for the united states uh he thinks that crypto is more better received than i think um i initially thought yeah and so um this was a fantastic conversation the fact that we're getting sitting members of congress on crypto podcasts like bankless you know that couldn't have happened three to four years ago and that is happening now so that shows you kind of the growing influence representative emmer also talked about the actions that the bankless community took the crypto community took in august that actually had a massive impact we didn't see the impact uh that it had but representative emmer talks about that if you're based in the u.s this is a muslim episode if you're not based in the u.s this is also a must listen episode because this same conversation is happening in all of your governance bodies in all of your respective countries so this is sort of a microcosm of the conversations that are going on all over the world right now fantastic episode as usual david and i will give our thoughts on the

represents minnesota serves on the house fi the house financial services committee believes that free financial access is a core human right and advocates for crypto in congress as a result of that i think we've got some shared interests some shared values to talk about representative emmer welcome to bank list how are you doing today hey good morning ryan david great to be with you uh and love the introduction i'm looking forward to the conversation well we love what you're doing in uh congress right now for for crypto and i want to start with this question just to dive right into it it feels like almost no one in dc is fighting for crypto right now but you are why why are you sticking your neck out for us well because i know this is the future and uh you know what i i seem to believe in this uh uh concept that our founders had that government uh exists to serve its people the people don't exist to serve their government and crypto to me i first off uh to put in context because we were joking about the fact that my uh pop culture references are probably dated before maybe even you guys were alive right well you are coming in black and white too representative emma so it's fits it's it's all part of the uh all part of the the conspiracy but the uh when it comes down to to me i've got seven kids which uh you know the oldest is uh 31 youngest is uh 20 uh about to be 21. i these guys have kept me very well grounded despite the fact that uh i really like my childhood i like my uh formative years uh but what i learned from those uh and i should also tell you i while i spent some time out east i actually graduated from the harvard of the northwest the university of alaska in fairbanks alaska which gave me an opportunity for a period of time to literally live in the woods in a cabin with no running water and you know outdoor plumbing and wood heat and why is that important because i guess i learned that i'm responsible for me and i don't want the government making my decisions i i i'm capable of making really good decisions i'm capable of making really bad decisions right and i've done both but i don't need my government telling me when i got into crypto uh probably seven years ago now uh and i've told this story way too many times but we had a staffer here who's now over on the senate banking committee aussie guy uh landon zinda uh we now have lizzy that you guys have probably dealt with uh she worked directly with landon but he gave me this book uh about seven years ago called the age of cryptocurrency and i i don't know how many of my colleagues when uh a member of their staff gives them a book they literally take it and read it and bring it back but that's what i do and i loved it it's like look this is an opportunity i i see this is where it's going you know i had done this radio show with a guy who claimed he was a libertarian in fact he's an anarchist right uh all we ever heard during the show is shut her down she's pumping mud you know we don't need this we don't need that uh at the end of the day he caused me to look at it at our society and government in more of a holistic nature uh while we have come through uh our world's history from the stone age to the agrarian age to the industrial age and now we're in the the age of technology right uh which is uh advancing in warp speeds think about this for a second uh the stone age you were scattered the uh the agrarian age and i'm short-circuiting it obviously for the uh for the students that are out there it's more detailed than this but for a very crude explanation you've got the agrarian age where suddenly we have cities dense populations forming on essentially waterways because you bring the produce in from the field and you deliver it by water uh that's how our city started then you have the industrial age now you've got all the labor moving into these big cities everything is centralized guess what you guys are doing we are in the era of not only technology but decentralization there is coming a day when uh you know the family that's lived on the family farm the land grant farm whatever you want to call it they have certificates from presidents like abraham lincoln uh they will stay on the home place as they call it because everything will have smart technology they will have a 3d printer so if they need a healthcare treatment for instance and this may be bizarre to people outside of this podcast but i'm going to believe that people that listen to bankless ryan they know this is coming uh let's say i need a new hip well guess what with the technology that we're going to have uh as long as government doesn't get in the way and allow uh different actors to uh fence out competition and protect their bottom line if government will allow this to grow you're going to be able to have that hip transplant right at home because they'll print up the parts for lack of a better description the replacement parts on a 3d printer you'll have robotics and you can have a surgeon who is remotely conducting uh this uh hip replacement from uh somewhere else uh that's the future and when you look at crypto taking it full circle now to your question why crypto this is facilitating all of that i mean uh you you've got web 2 which requires intermediaries everything throughout history has required an intermediary uh at least uh when we talk about our traditional banking system there there was a day when you know you'd work on my barn and i'd give you a cow right and that we just dealt direct but now we have intermediaries and we're in this uh technology phase where uh you want to get your social content out there you got to go through facebook you got to go through uh youtube you got to go through twitter there's coming a day when you don't need intermediaries it will be uh decentralized and i'm gonna tell both of you with that long explanation that's what excites me is that takes the authority away from the middle man and it puts the power where it should have been put well where our founders put it in the first place in you and me that's why it excites me and crypto again is the is facilitating that uh that development that evolution if you will representative emma i see a uh difference in a lot of pro crypto and anti-crypto politicians where the pro crypto politicians tend to be like uh bigger big picture thinkers uh and more uh grounded in first principles thinking where the anti-crypto politicians uh i don't really share that same type of let's like mental thinking of just zooming all the way out and trying to put this industry in perspective so i certainly appreciate your ability to see this thing from uh the the lens that it needs to be seen which is a super super wide view so i want to get into the the schism that we see growing in in dc uh because there does seem to be t people like kind of picking sides are you pro crypto or are you anti-crypto uh and there's definitely seems to be a lot of anti-crypto people showing up in dc and so i want to just pick your brain as to why do you think that is like why does why does it feel like washington hates crypto you know i i it's i i guess i don't have the same feeling uh david uh i understand where that comes from uh but to me here inside of this uh swamp uh i think that it's a nonpartisan issue for people who literally understand it it doesn't matter if you're a democrat or republican what i just talked about i think you have people on both sides of the aisle uh in different i used this term yesterday i said we have members all across the spectrum and i said oh that might be a freudian slip i don't think i want to use the spectrum term but we have uh we have members who uh have different uh uh understandings of crypto and it's growing so if you feel and i again this is not limited to you because i've heard it from others uh if you feel that there's an anti-crypto uh sentiment uh and that people are picking teams let's i i don't want to go there yet because i don't think that's uh baked in i think what you really see if you put in perspective that long uh answer that i gave you earlier it really is the pro-government anti-government split i mean if you were going to talk about republican and democrat in its most pure form and by the way this has changed through time uh each party has been on different sides of this and i think we're in the process of another evolution of uh how the republicans are going to be in terms of policy versus the dems but as i got involved a democrat would typically believe that government should provide the best solutions to our problems a republican in the truest sense of the word again in my world would say that no the individual provides the best solutions uh available i the truth is the answer lies somewhere in between right uh at least in our history it's people working with government and i think what you've got here you've got that what you would refer to as the pro crypto people myself uh looking at this thing and saying i'm pro people i'm pro people self-determinate uh you know this this debate about the size and scope of our government versus the right of an individual to self-determine as you can tell i always default to the individual i and you left something out earlier at least that i would add which is uh fear there are people that are afraid of things that could happen uh and i think that drives them with their policy making too if they don't understand crypto so i'm pro crypto because i see this is where the financial system is going it's completely disruptive people are going to be able to do business directly with one another for full value without having uh our government skim off the top and those type and others by the way then there are those that and again republicans democrats that are coming our direction they just don't understand it yet david i mean i'm going to tell you a lot of these people their first real uh involvement came last august when the senate had this so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill that the treasury secretary i'm told lobbied uh senator portman from ohio to include a tax provision that would apply to minors right crypto miners bitcoin miners etc uh well the the thing was drafted poorly it cast a net so wide that uh you don't know how it can be applied by the way the number that they came up with some genius in the the government accounting office uh it came up with a number that oh we're gonna get x amount of revenue from all these people uh that should scare everybody but this is what drove it and i i tell you that background because what happened next is uh those interested and involved in the crypto committee rained down on washington dc like they never have in the seven years that i've been here there there were reports of uh one senate office getting 30 000 calls in one day and what that did is one you've got uh government uh policy makers uh again i don't want to get into the partisan fight but it really is this hungry government looking for revenue so they can spend more and more money and suddenly they've seen there's money in crypto we want some of that money you know the man wants a little bit off the top to fund everything the the man wants to fund that was the first thing the second thing was oh my goodness all these people are involved i had no idea i better learn this thing i better understand it we got years of uh education in a matter of two or three months and i i think those people haven't made up their mind yet which side of this are they on and then to conclude david yes you do have a small group uh i'm not gonna name names uh people watch them they look incredibly foolish and ignorant when they talk during hearings about things that make absolutely no sense in the crypto space uh and someday you know those will be the ones that uh people say hey remember when you said the world was flat and that columbus actually went off on this journey that uh it was gonna end badly well welcome to the 21st century it's uh people saying that the internet will never work will never amount to anything is a is another another equivalency in you know uh sticking to their fax machines but what's really cool representative emmer is because i think what you're referring to was um it happened with the infrastructure bill and kind of the push and the outcry from the crypto community and i've actually never heard it described that way from someone inside of dc okay so here we are at bankless and we've got like an entire crypto community who is passionate some of these people are single issue voters right and we you know we told them many in the crypto community told them call your call your representatives make your voices heard it sounds like that shook washington a bit like we don't know if some of these messages are going out into the void and like disappearing or they're actually having an effect it sounds like they're having an effect in this case which is amazing the other thing i just learned is from your perspective it's not that there are a lot of you know crypto haters in washington there are some but there is a vast majority of representatives in congress who are undecided and it's this middle area that we can really target but i want you to maybe um i guess make the case for us a little bit more uh the national case america's case so i want to talk about two things first of all what's at stake if america gets this wrong if we screw up crypto let's talk about the cost first and then we'll switch and we'll talk about the benefits but what's at stake here well a lot of people i mean this you know some of your listings by the way you did make a difference i so just know that the messages you guys were sending out on your podcast your peers you made a huge difference because uh lobbying which has a terrible name here in washington dc can be done through paid representatives who are very good at it i know congress is not bought off by them they are a resource teaching members what they may not understand and trying to educate them from a certain point of view so we can make a thoughtful decision but then there's also the citizen lobbyist and what you guys did is you activated those citizen lobbyists uh like i haven't seen in seven years since i've been here so you should uh pat yourselves on the back uh everybody in the community should recognize that they made a huge difference but their work has just begun uh what is at stake well this is the part that i don't want to be partisan for me it's uh it's u.s supremacy is the leader around the world uh on a lot of different things but if you want to strip that away if you're one of those people that has grown up uh in a different era than i did right i had coaches who yelled at me i had coaches who shamed me i you know today you you wouldn't have a coach behind a bench anywhere if they did that to a young person the way uh the way we had so maybe you grew up saying hey it's not about us being the supreme whatever it's about the united states doing the right thing and being able to compete the world over making sure that the members of our society people who are lucky enough to be americans or to come to this country and experience uh this great experiment and freedom that they be afforded the opportunity to create and grow anew i mean right now the big fight is do we really want to be like the communist party of china right do we really want to allow government officials in this country whether they're at the treasury whether they're at the fed whether it's a combination of those those uh agencies uh and uh in the defense community right the defense community who they're so scared of everything that's out there that we have to give up our liberty so they can protect us i i said it yesterday to somebody and i've said it for years you can become a prisoner of your own security uh we need to take control of this uh ryan what's at stake uh your opportunity to uh and people are going to think this is overly dramatic but it's not if you let the fed and the treasury do what i suspect they are off they have set off to do regardless of what their words are saying because this thing is already in motion if they create a central bank digital currency that is nothing more than a surveillance tool for americans much like the digital authoritarianism that's being practiced in china i we are going to lose not only uh potentially the dollar is the world's reserve currency but more importantly we're going to lose what really makes this country special which is a place where you know you and me i'm i used to tell people where a dumb schlub like me can come up with this great idea uh this business plan and go see my local community banker in the tiny little town that i live in and go i got this great idea for a thing that i want to call amazon i got a great idea for something i want to call harley davidson or i want to call uh walt disney by the way all those companies started in someone's garage that brian is what i think we're risking uh the loss of because if you think if people struggle with the concept that special interests right pay uh uh public relations people aka lobbyists to influence congress how are you gonna feel when we don't need those anymore because the government knows exactly who you are what you're doing every day because they can monitor your transactions they can monitor where you're traveling and by the way if you have some new disruptive change well it's one thing to be fighting with uh bill gates for market share right uh he's got all the money but you still have uh the citizen lobbyists that can fight back uh what happens when it's the government that is all-powerful and they're the ones that are protecting their own market share that's that's that's what's at stake to me represent november i want to take a devil's advocate stance here and put myself in the shoes of somebody like elizabeth warren for example uh because you listed off you know some companies that perhaps started in their garage and started building really really cool things but uh in the the difference is is those companies like apple or google that started off in their garage has much left less of a capacity to do harm in the way that we've seen inside of the crypto industry uh for example like you know we just had a 30 320 million dollar exploit that somebody stole you know 320 million dollars of funds from this one thing uh in in the crypto space uh we also recently have seen an ex-felon be a treasury uh manager in in the d5 space who is completely anonymous uh and then there's also tether which is you know dubiously uh unknown to be backed and there's also usdc which has just much less regulations than a typical bank so like uh to i wanted to ask the double devil's advocate question about like all right like what about all of the scams like what about all of the craziness that's going on uh how do you square that with representing that side of the industry well david i would say first off i the wild wild west that people uh want to uh uh claim crypto uh is i this isn't uh this isn't crypto from 15 years ago this is crypto from 10 years ago it's not crypto from five years ago uh you've mentioned some bad actors and by the way i don't care if it's the crypto space or it's your your local church or fraternal organization you know what there's creeps and crooks everywhere i in does that mean that everyone you should assume is up to no good no no but that is the place for government right that's uh if there is a place it's but here we can over think this right uh like i had a colleague in our leadership meetings a couple weeks ago uh suggests that the colonial pipeline uh uh hostage situation where they uh they paid the ransom in crypto right uh the uh he suggested that we only got some of that back no we got all of it back i mean we have the ability uh and we should empower law enforcement to do what they need to do to enforce laws where one individual or one entity is literally scamming or taking advantage of another or others right we should also have what i would argue is light touch regulation uh in the crypto space i i think these sandboxes are the way to go with safe harbors right uh until you know what you're dealing with don't start uh regulating before you know what you're trying to regulate or the problem that you're trying to you know uh resolve uh you might need to learn a little bit more on the goal and then create guard rails as you see them and then to the elizabeth warren thing you know the place where uh and i amazed that i'd say this i i don't know that we'd agree uh the uh by the way i loved uh our friend from tesla his uh back and forth with uh with the good senator uh that was really entertaining i i won't repeat it here but it was fun to watch on twitter we'll include a link in the show notes elon musk is uh he's got a sense of humor man uh and it's a good one but uh where we might agree the senator from massachusetts and myself is we have anti-trust laws for a reason uh and really i i just don't know we've got a uh a department of justice that just seems to be so uh out of touch with main street usa instead of uh behaving like a political entity that does the republicans bidding when they're in office and does the uh the democrats bidding uh when they're in office you know their agendas once you start doing stuff for the american people you know when you've got companies that have gotten so large that they literally are killing competition in the marketplace that's what we had anti-trust for right that's that's the idea is that you got to let everybody participate and i think the the senator from massachusetts and i might agree on that i last think david i i think you got to have a complete rewrite of the banking laws in this country this is not the 1930s we do not have the same challenges and you bring up a company like tether which unfortunately you know there are issues but you can solve an issue with tether by requiring reserves and and specifying what is a uh a valuable and reliable reserve and what do you have to put up behind whatever it is you're offering so that a person that is uh trusting you actually knows that uh there's something backing up that uh that investment so uh there are things we can do but here's when you play devil's advocate i love it because in our committee you know we've got these guys aren't as detailed as you you know they want to talk about climate change they want to talk about uh you know everybody's dirty this is silk road i mean they're they're reading off a playbook from like 2012 2014 i just come on uh by the way you want to talk to uh drug dealers and uh and those doing illicit uh activities in this country i'm gonna guarantee you they're gonna tell you cash is still kick crypto is is not the uh i would argue is not the preferred venue or uh medium of exchange yeah absolutely and it's this middle area that that really needs to be educated you know you were talking about the colonial pipeline uh incident in the ransomware um people look at that and they say oh isn't crypto bad but it's like that also happened on another set of protocols called the internet should we turn off the internet because there's a ransomware attack on the internet no of course not it provides so much more utility than just these things and i think that will become more obvious in time as crypto builds and continues to provide utility for its citizens but let's flip this and talk about the the good side okay so we talked about the what's at stake if america gets this wrong but there's also an opportunity for crypto here this is what we see at bankless and i think representative emmer what you see you see tremendous opportunity for america to lead what are the benefits if america gets policy right on crypto well just ask yourself using your example and i love it the internet yeah you know someday the internet might amount to something right uh it's that old argument and you're right it's causing all kinds of problems we better turn it off uh you're never gonna turn it off it's gonna continue to grow so i when you look at uh when i answer this question you should ask yourself what would have happened if we didn't allow the internet to develop here in the united states what if we said oh we're scared of this this is uh this is where all the bad actors are this is going to corrupt our children this is this is going to be awful i mean think about all the bullying that can take place on social media sites and just terrible things uh well what if china would have been the leader how different would it look today and what would that mean to uh economic growth safety and security our future here in this country i would say the same thing here i mean do you really want to say uh it's because i used to say this long before there was crypto money will always go to the place where it can thrive so if you're going to put a roadblock in front of it guess what like water it's going to find its way somewhere else to where it can actually move uh okay so you think the bahamas should be the uh the ground zero for crypto development and evolution and growth or the united states of america do you think europe should be or the united states of america more importantly you think china should be i think china's made a serious mistake gentlemen i mean by uh shutting down mining which i love when lizzie and i talked about this a few weeks ago she was helping me with some talking points and she said yeah they've lost 60 percent of their money and texas is uh has gotten all sixty percent a hundred percent of the sixty that china has driven away and i i said that lizzy yeah but they shut it down so it's a hundred percent you're just telling me sixty and she smiled and said you can't shut it all down i mean you can't this thing is going to continue and it's going to continue somewhere so why not here in this country because think about what it will mean to our safety and security i know the traditional defense hawks you know it's like they have to have all the control you know what happens with decentralization i can protect myself you decentralize you put me back in charge of my health records you put me back in charge of my bank accounts you put me back in charge of uh you know who i'm dealing with as opposed to a middleman right now when i do business with a bank and all of a sudden i'm getting all kinds of solicitations from somebody that the bank has sold its list to or is doing business with because i unwittingly somehow without knowing gave them consent to share my information all over the place which by the way has value and i'm not the one that's getting the value somebody else is getting it and i know i'm rambling off but it's uh i just tell you this is so much bigger than crypto but crypto is the it is the basic building block for making this whole evolution happen which is why i'm going to continue to advocate for it and support it i'm going to continue to push back on these ideas the most recent one is well how do we do economic sanctions well figure it out right i mean what i got to stay uh riding in a train when i could be taking a plane or for you guys because you're much younger than me at rocket ship right you guys are going to space i was just trying to get them here to talk but you get what i'm saying i i think it has to be in this country and we're falling behind right now i mean i my linkedin was talking about how a canadian firm has just uh put on their balance sheet uh different crypto offerings and it's like come on man that should be happening right here in this country absolutely i could completely agree uh we're falling behind there's an exodus of crypto builders leaving the us lots more we could talk about but the opportunity to misses of the size and magnitude may be larger than the internet but let's talk about the the solution here a little bit so i want to talk about um legislative solution and the three branches of government an executive we'll ignore judicial right so um but legislative and executive branch so on the legislative side we've had a number of regulators on or i'd say crypto friendly regulators you know uh brian quintenz from the uh cftc hester purse from the sec and they kind of tell us the same thing representative emmer which is um you know regulations could be improved there could be better posturing on the regulatory front more friendliness towards crypto but part of the root problem is we have old laws orange groves from like the 1940s uh for our you know sccr securities laws so do you agree with that do you do you think that they point to to legislation they they point to um changes in the legal system as the answer uh do you believe that the change has to come from the legislative side that congress ultimately has to act that's the the real solution here the gemini

complicated that by the way there were great champions as you point out in the last uh the last administration but i would argue they were up against many of the same things that i suspect the champions that i have yet to know in the biden administration are up against right the traditionalists that uh oh you can't do that here right uh you you mentioned uh hester uh you had brian brooks i i think you might have mentioned giancarlo i i think some of those same people are in the current administration but they're getting overwhelmed by the uh those uh traditionalists that are really invested into uh how the our financial system has grown and developed uh and this as you guys would admit is the most disruptive uh a change that could take place right where i don't necessarily need an intermediary a bank to do business with you right uh financial business with you now that scares them i and what i keep saying out loud before i get to your question is we need to talk about how we well it's going to answer your question so we got people like gary gensler out there who uh my mother used to say uh you you're too smart to be so stupid i would say that to gary gessler you're too smart to be so stupid uh he is literally impacting the marketplace uh through his public comments misguided public comments uh in in it through enforcement actions that's why the answer your question is yes we're going to need to legislate congress the legislative branch of government is actually going to have to do something in this area to rein in these regulators all right because if we don't and i would argue that congress has done very little that it's supposed to do since 1998. that's why everybody's so frustrated i mean we haven't done a budget uh 12 uh appropriations bills through the house through the senate and across the president's desk honored before september 30th of each year midnight september 30th since 1998. what does that do well that tells all of these uh these bureaucrats that nobody's going to be supervising okay so they come before a committee and they they think their job today unlike it was in the 80s the 70s they think their job today is to be as vague and evasive as possible because they're they're the king or queen of their little fifedom and they're going to run it just how they want so yes we are going to have to take back the authority and that means we're going to have to do something uh what do we need to do just very simple things to start i mean let's talk about money transmitter licenses right why don't we have a federal law for money transmissions transmission and money transmitters so you only if if you're in that business right and by the way we need to further define it because some never possess any uh actual uh uh uh currency if you will so how do they fall within that definition we need better definitions but i better back up before i say the money transmission you got to better define what is a currency what is a commodity and what is the security so we can get away from this idea that the crypto space should be a full employment opportunity for lawyers in this country okay because why is the howie test that you referenced from the orange grove in florida why is that important because the court has said that test which was created before anybody even knew what crypto was that test is what we we use now to determine whether something uh is a security or not and if it is uh then it's subject to all of the uh sec regulations etc i that's we're going to have to uh we're going to have to change that because uh you're losing opportunities there's a guy who started a 1.4 billion dollar project outside of this country more than a year ago who looked right at me and said i'd love to do this in the united states but there's too much uncertainty if i start it i don't know if it's if i'm going to have the smorgasbord of regulators that are all going to want a piece of it i don't i'm going to be spending way too much money trying to get things clarified so he did it elsewhere you got to clean that up and congress is going to have to do it i light touch stuff you uh you could die where we should preempt state law so we have a one-stop shop we should do it i use the example of money transmitter licenses we should create safe harbor right where people that haven't done something before that's brand new have the ability to do it and as it evolves and we understand what it is then we can define what the set of regulations apply uh same thing with the irs we should have uh a situation where there's no look back you get to start your opportunity and once we realize uh it should be taxed as currency it should be taxed as a an asset a commodity or something else uh under the securities provision uh then we would tax it going forward but that's a very broad stroke right the answer your question is congress is literally going to have to do its job and i i'm hopeful that uh in the 117th congress that there's going to be a an appetite to get that started and representative emmer you actually have a proposal out i believe called the securities clarity act that can help kind of progress this conversation forward can you just elaborate for our listeners what is inside the securities clarities act and what it's attempting to fix well this is kind of what i was referring to uh you know with innovators uh leaving this country right uh the bill would amend the existing securities law david to distinguish a token from the securities contract that it might have or might not have been part of at one point right at the beginning uh it does this by creating a new definition in the law it's very simple i the language is an investment contract asset uh tokens are investment contract assets so i we did this because i as i referenced the sec has been regulating by enforcement action uh and because you never know if you're going to be subject to the next enforcement action a lot of entrepreneurs are taking those uh those opportunities those projects outside of the country and look if we do this this simple change i i believe entrepreneurs would have clarity in the securities security space which will help them expand uh things like capital formation opportunities employment uh and other all kinds of new uh projects and i i know ryan will be happy to know that the bill actually fits into the already existing howie test framework uh but it simply provides more clarity so you don't you don't have the same problems that we're seeing right now and uh just to illustrate this for for the listeners if something like this got passed by congress this would start to force uh the sec and gary gensler to adhere by these rules and so a lot of the basically everyone in the industry is very frustrated with the sec and the actions of gary gensler and if we want to express that frustration we can start to vote in laws and or elect representatives who will vote in laws for us that make gary gensler have to heal to those laws and so if we think that gary gensler is overreaching a solution for that is to is to write new laws that gary gensler has to follow is that is that right um representative that's exactly right and i mean david i think uh what's interesting over the last couple of years uh with all the vitriol i was talking about this to another member on the floor yesterday that uh you know you can very quickly become part of the swamp where the only thing you're hearing are the echoes of this chamber right you need to stay grounded on main street in the communities that you come from main street across this country and i do that i mean i'm proud of it i think that's one of the things that people uh say to me when they meet me is you're not who i thought you were going to be because you're not you it's like you don't really fit here well okay i take that as a compliment because i never want to fit here right i always want to be where i'm from but i'm a republican and i think this is what i was telling uh this member yesterday i think more and more people out there really don't care anymore about whether you're a republican or a democrat they're actually starting to pay attention to what is he or she talking about what do they stand for uh so it's funny in this space too you guys might get a kick out of this i feel like i've run into more uh democrats i if if you were going to put a uh they'd hate it by the way so i will not name names because they're great people but their background compared to mine is a more it would be my grandfather's uh uh idea you know that the government is uh good it's supposed to do good things etc uh they're they have a more democrat uh historical democrat outlook but they uh we work really well together because it's not about being a democrat it's not about being a republican it's actually about looking at opportunities that we all want and i just happen to see it going beyond you know changing fundamentally changing how we handle our financial business i just think it's so much bigger than that so i yeah pay attention to who's running for once look at it don't get frustrated like i told this member yesterday you know you hear a lot of people right now that go i have had it so much with this  i don't want to hear another word about it republicans democrats all you morons ever do is argue with each other i'm sick of it but guess what they do want to make a difference as i was telling this member they're telling you when they say that to you i don't want to talk to you anymore because you're part of the problem but that doesn't mean they're disengaging i think just the opposite is happening i think more people are engaging because they understand you know listening to guys like you and your whole community when you tell them in august look guys these well we'll call them mr dumas these uh mr and mrs dumas at the uh at the congress they don't know what they're doing you need to call them you need to email them you need to weigh in you need to let them know this is important and look you make a significant difference but again i said this earlier to uh ryan david uh the community has just gotten started just gotten started you were on the verge there's gonna there'll be an election that takes place next fall and people can say yeah i'm done with this but understand the people that hold these election certificates they literally do affect your lives and in this space it can make such a difference if you start talking to candidates and incumbents and finding out where they stand on this issue because the more people that you put in here to your point david that have an understanding of crypto that are favorable to change to evolution to new opportunities on the horizon uh you can literally start to rewrite the laws and get rid of some of these ridiculous regulations that ryan pointed out were created at a different time for different reasons rep emmer uh we've got just two more things to cover because we want to the last thing we want to do is close this out with some action items things that the bankless community can do to get involved and do exactly what you're saying but before we do got to touch on this briefly so uh china's been making moves on central bank digital currency for a while and it's been no secret right 2014 they started down this path and then they got to beta and now they're releasing at the olympics i know you've you've tweeted this out a statement that i uh agree with i've never seen a representative tweeted out this way but you're talking about the costs and benefits of central bank digital currency at the fed and you said any cdbc implemented by the fed if that's even a good option must be open permissionless and private of course china's is not like that and they are deploying it right now at the the winter olympics i tweeted this out recently and i was just frustrated representative emmer at congress's and the us government's lack of action on this i said if you're mad about china china's digital want at the olympics why don't you support the free and open crypto industry in your country in the us at least china's building something all you do is talk that is an expression not at you because i know you are acting in congress but at the u.s government as a whole i'm not sure that the us understands how high the stakes are if we don't adopt a free and open and private and permissionless uh digital currency of some form whether that's crypto or america's central bank digital currency guess what the world will adopt something from a more authoritarian regime and they're way ahead so what do we do about this and can you talk about that briefly you gotta you you just can't uh blindly trust anyone not that you shouldn't uh i don't want people walking around with the idea that everyone is bad until they're proven to be good i i think human beings generally are good they're well intentioned but you can't trust necessarily blindly everything someone tells you and especially your government uh you've always got to be looking at what your government is putting out with a critical eye and i think even more so today uh and this is a nonpartisan statement because i'm not going to play any favors this is on both ends of the political spectrum uh and everything in between i i think we we got to be a little bit more critical in our thinking critical in our research uh and on this issue i mean ryan this is the issue uh china's been practicing digital authoritarianism ever since this began i and i you know i'm really disappointed that uh you know with all of their human rights abuses all the things that they're doing to their own population that we actually are supporting them in this uh this beijing uh olympic thing but you know hats off to uh our young people that are competing i would never want to deny them the opportunity to represent their country so i'm not i'm not being critical of them but this this idea that the fed and they're going to try to do it right so i will tell you right now i don't see them actually creating a central bank digital currency that is literally open permissionless and private they might hit one of those it's open and i i think maybe we should change if our government's going to do this i think we should change it from a central bank digital currency to a central bank digital control system because they are going to their idea is they want to keep all of the information well the whole point of blockchain is decentralization uh if if you allow them to centralize all this stuff you have just made them the all-powerful and i this will date me but i'm just going to uh tell you and your audience if you've never read uh the book road to serfdom that was written by an austrian economist during world war ii while he was uh i guess you could call exiled or living uh in uh in great britain he was writing it to all of his intellectual elite buddies because they all thought that a central government a powerful central government that allocates scarce resources just think about it housing food clothing opportunity if you will uh that that is the uh the best form of society because everyone has the same opportunity i and if i just uh boiled the whole book down to a couple of lines what hayek basically told his intellectual buddies is okay i mean that's actually great if you have a central authority that decides how to divvy up uh scarce resources as opposed to allowing human beings through their own talent and initiative to do with the invisible hand if you will that adam smith wrote about uh okay he said that's great as long as you're the one that's making a decision on how to allocate those resources if you're not in the group that makes the decisions well then you might not like the decisions and by the way if you object to the decisions that your central authority is making the first thing that will happen is they will start to restrict your liberties the second thing that could happen is a lot worse and uh is his conclusion was it sounds great but it never ends well and literally china has gone into the technological age of uh authoritarianism and our central bank our fed uh which i think needs complete reform uh our central bank should never never hold all of our information and right now unless it can do that open permissionless and private the same qualities that cash offers you and me hard cash uh they should never be in this business because it's kind of like the patriot act guys they created the patriot act so that they could get a special court to give them permission to spy on foreigners bad enough right to spy on foreigners that they suspect of terrorism and they said this will never be used against american citizens oh until it was right so don't trust your government when they tell you we can do this better i mean for god's sake said the the thing that makes america special is guys like you people in the community that you're a part of that you're communicating with you're the ones that make the difference government quite frankly does provide some benefits if it stays very limited in its focus and gets out of your way representative emmer i hope that all the listeners feel inspired and ready to take some action uh but we want to also tell them or inform them about the possible actions that they can take to actually move the needle in the right direction so what advice do you have for us for how how do we win in dc could you kind of give us the high level game plan we have the 2022 midterms coming up uh but there's gonna be elections every two years uh how do you see the road map to victory for the crypto industry what advice you uh for us do you have two uh high level things uh because we could start to split hairs and get into much detail but the two things i would tell you is if you are inclined if you're inclined i don't care if your republican democrat or other could just really could give a damn less but if you're inclined uh if this is important to you find out who your representative is in congress where you live all right by the way don't stop with congress find out who your state representative is find out who your state senator is uh what you should be doing is again if you're so inclined get involved in a campaign this summer you know get to know them it's really funny how it works uh with members of congress they'll be walking in parades again this summer you know if you're in the crypto community and you want to get close to a member of congress you do it first by just showing up at a parade and volunteering i mean it may sound really stupid but again this is if you are so inclined uh because they get to know you you get to know them pretty soon you've got this connection i i've got some great kids that started with me well 15 years ago when i was uh doing the state level that they've grown into this uh this area and they know so much more about it than me but i know them and so now i trust them right the other thing that you can do which i think is an even bigger one david which you started back in august is make your presence known show up in washington dc you know it's not just the member that you want to get to know uh you want to get to know the staff for that member you want to get to know the staff on the senate side and by the way i i hope lizzie and landon and all these guys will forgive me but they're your peers these guys who are working for people like me and i should say working with people like me uh they're your peers so the more that you can socialize the more that you can open up the uh the lines of communication on a friendly basis doesn't matter again whether it's a democrat representative or a republican one uh it's going to help you in the long run because like i said i this political thing goes back and forth i think we're going to see a change next fall for reasons unrelated to crypto i think it's uh well it is actually related to crypto and that the monetary policy in this country has been so screwed for so long probably since the early 70s that's the whole reason there is crypto so i guess crypto is uh indirectly or directly involved in the upcoming election because of the ridiculous inflation that's uh that we didn't need to see uh and we created but when the change happens we're in the 116th congress the 117th there i you guys may not know everyone yet but uh we've been working on this for seven years and there is a growing number of members that i believe are going to be poised and ready to do things in the next congress that if we can get this uh president uh to hopefully want some victories before his uh his presidency is over i i hope that he uh says this is a legacy that i want to be part of i want to i want to help this uh grow and uh keep america at the forefront of uh you know economic evolution and opportunity so those two things one find a candidate or candidates uh get involved with them if that's what you're inclined to do too just start start infiltrating i know it sounds uh like a dirty word but that's what you're doing is get in embed yourselves in these different uh government halls whether it's here at the federal level or at your state level and start grabbing people who look like me even though we'll be fewer and fewer as we go forward and go hey man do you have a virtual wallet what do you have in your wallet you know how many of them are gonna look at you and go huh you gotta help you gotta help excellent advice representative emmer we appreciate the work that you are doing in congress fighting for crypto which is uh not not really a fight for an industry it's it's fighting for the american people it's what david and i firmly believe we appreciate all your efforts and thank you for spending the time talking to the bankless community today yeah you guys are awesome keep it up you uh you inspire people like me that's why we're here and i don't know how long i'll do this but as long as you guys have this kind of energy for an issue like this i i want to give it everything that i've got so thank you for what you do well please stay we definitely need you uh action items bankless listeners we need you as well infiltrate that was the word representative emmer used find out who your representatives are now i love it make your presence known get to know the staffers you can also check out this website pac.xyz from one of our friends to see how your representatives score on how crypto friendly they are or how crypto toxic they are also remain politically active in 2022 vote voice capital you hear that a lot on bank list we're giving it to you today got to do that this year finally we got a cool book recommendation from representative emmer today we'll include a link to that in the show notes
