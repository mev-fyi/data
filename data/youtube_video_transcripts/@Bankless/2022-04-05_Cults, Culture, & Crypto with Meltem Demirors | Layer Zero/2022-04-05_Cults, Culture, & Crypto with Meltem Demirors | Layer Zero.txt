very important i think especially in a community like crypto that's so driven by memes and and trends and these phenomena some of which can be very ephemeral in nature and some of which have permanence i think it's again very important to develop a perspective that is uniquely yours and to behave in a way that is consistent with your perspective welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with malcolm demirs the vibes sorceress the queen of crypto has been in the crypto space for over eight years now and has just so many lessons to share as to what goes on in part of every single corner of the crypto industry uh melton is a relentless grinder she's a super hard worker and she's also as i alluded to the queen of vibes i'd like to say she's a big curator of experiences and vibes in the real world which is where the crypto world is trending towards in my opinion and i actually didn't know that we were going to get into this subject but we end up talking a lot about the concept of cults of communities of organizations with shared values and how we are going from a world of few of these things uh starting with like empires back you know a thousand years ago going into religion going into nation states going into corporations using the cult model to understand what a corporation is to where we are now with where there's every there's one community per token and we have daos and nft projects and each one of these things uh represents um in a way some sort of cult and how this is you know well there's a lot of people that think the world word cult is negative uh we don't do that we actually kind of consider it as uh for what it is which is you know alignment of people around shared values shared sets of interests and each now now that there's so many tokens and so many dows and so many nft projects there's many many different reasons to all find one's resonance with some sort of organization we also talk about the moving from the you know computer era of computer-only era of crypto to where crypto is really starting to take over in terms of social culture uh we have our own language in crypto and now that's starting to bleed out into the rest of the world uh and so what does that mean for cryptoculture moving forward uh so i really hope you enjoy this conversation with malcolm demir she's insanely intelligent she's one of my favorite people in this industry and she has a lot of very unique insights about how the world works and how it relates to crypto so i think you'll learn a ton in this podcast let's go ahead and get right into it right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible maker dow is the og d5 protocol the maker dial produces dye the industry's most

nothing much uh this is the earliest i've ever done a layer zero and you are in uh london how long have you been in london um so i'm here for three weeks so i was in london then uh paris because coin shares acquired a company in paris so we now have a paris office which is really fun got to hang out with our french team which very focused on on d5 we're gonna be rolling out some really cool stuff in the next few months um and now back in london so good times i think uh your trajectory throughout crypto i think is interesting and it's i think the thing that i kind of want to focus on over time but i want to start at the very very beginning can you just give us the the basic picture of how you got into her huh i'm sorry hold on what do you mean the trajectory is interesting you have to like you have to expand on that a bit like unpack okay for me sure yeah i want to know what i'm getting into uh i i think the the how i view your trajectory in crypto is uh grinding super super hard for two three years uh and of which you still are uh but then the bull market came and now you are vibing and uh and so that's kind of the mental model i have for for melton is just like i remember when you came on bank list and you just like you the you had the line i've brought the receipts and this is in regards to like the money printing uh the the inevitable uh you know uh debt issues that the united states is going to go through uh and and then also just been like working your ass off at coin chairs for years and years uh and then and then the bull market came and then all of a sudden um uh the the social life of crypto has taken off uh and i i i've in my in my brain giving you the nickname um uh vibes queen queen of vibes yeah five sorceress five sorceress yeah i love my vibes um you know krypto needs a high priestess of sorts so um you know if we're going to create any energy i want it to be good energy but we can definitely delve into that um i will also say by the way david the way this whole thing came about so i came on bank list i think over a year ago um we had a fun conversation and um i think we were in whistler we were a few glasses of wine deep and you were like hey a vibe sorceress can i recruit you for my new podcast um so this whole situation materialized during a high vibes moment absolutely absolutely and uh and it's it takes a special person with a lot of vibes that have interesting perspectives on crypto uh and so um you know crypto is only so many years old and it's so much of that history is really baked into like the last five or six years uh and i think you've had a um a pretty privileged like bird's eye view of the industry just as somebody who is already financially minded investment minded prior to starting in crypto uh which uh is i think crypto's um for a lot of people it's their first escapade into the concept of money economies finance uh but i think you were already pretty well savvy in that before getting into crypto uh and so gaining that perspective from your first entrance into the into into the industry watching it um evolve as an industry uh having that prior knowledge i think is really interesting and then also uh like i alluded to watching the social world of the industry blossom especially in new york uh i think i think is is definitely interesting as well so i want to get into into all of these things yeah well let's let's rewind maybe um i think at this point i've been in the industry for close to eight years which is a crazy number if you think about it um and when i started it was really bitcoin so personally i got into bitcoin in the end of 2012. so at this point it's been almost 10 years that i've personally been really into bitcoin i'm still really into bitcoin which perhaps you know bitcoin's been interesting um to some people i'm a bitcoin maximalist to others i'm not a pure enough bitcoiner so it's it's interesting like there's this purity test we now have to pass apparently some days i pass i don't i've given up trying to figure out where i am what camp i'm in um but i started my formal current crypto um in in 2015 at digital currency group um and i think what's so funny to me is when i talk to people now who are new to the crypto ecosystem who maybe came in in 2017 2018 and sort of the first um like big wave of of growth with icos and tokens or people who came in and in this way with nfts when i talked to them about 2015 2016 2017 bitcoin the block size wars they have no idea what i'm talking about they have no idea who i'm talking about even going back and talking about the dow hack and and what happened there like most people encrypted today when i say slock it right like they can tell me who that is we talk about like the parody hack a parody bug right they they don't know what that is so i think it's just really funny in a way i feel like cryptogramma because there's all this really rich really relevant historical context that i think so many people newer to the industry just don't really have um and i think having that context is is so important in understanding like why we're here how we got here because really the ideas that we see implemented today the ideas we've been talking about since 2013 2015 right like these ideas are not necessarily new in and of themselves what's really exciting for me is that we're finally at a point right especially as an investor who's invested in these ideas and watch them fail perhaps or not really achieve their end goal it's really cool now to see those ideas we've been talking about for so long actually being implemented and being feasible to implement because all the tooling and infrastructure the sort of requisite building blocks around these ideas now exist and also the market for these ideas exists so yeah so it has been a long time um it's also i feel sometimes i feel tired i'm not gonna lie the last six months have been challenging for me personally um you know there's so much happening in the space a lot of it's really exciting but you also see the same patterns repeating particularly with like influencers and influencer culture continuing to be a part of crypto and it brings out sort of this really gross side of the industry um we see a lot of this with nfts right um and we can delve into that i'm not judging it but it's just it's a little bit exhausting and sometimes i look in the mirror and i'm like is this really what i'm here to do with my time and my energy i'm not i'm not really always sure like i like to believe that what we're doing is making the world a better place but when 40 50 of all crypto in circulation is held by centralized custodians that are effectively banks that are subject to all of the same controls um that traditional financial institutions are i just feel like we've missed the plot maybe a little bit so so that's where i'm at personally that's why i'm trying to lean into the vibe i'm like sort of feeling my way through um because i do think some of the aspirations we had particularly as someone who identifies as a libertarian and a bit of like a cypher punk um i'm not really sure we're living up to those ideals in some ways we are in other ways we're not certain sure and i definitely want to go into that but but first there's been there there's many phases of crypto that you've been through right the there's like the uh proof of work fair launch phase the ico phase uh and one thing i think might might be frustrating is that like how recyclable are those experiences and skills that you developed while navigating like the bitcoin proof of workfare launch phase right or like being good at like investing in icos how how useful is that that those experiences now that crypto is completely different and has nothing to do with icos and like crypto goes through these waves of bull markets and bear markets and each one has its own flavor and has its own um you know characterization and you talked about like you can see the patterns right like the influencers always arrive every single bull market but but you know you when you say tell me you've been in this industry for eight years i look at this industry and i really only see the last like two to three years as being real like that's the only that's the only in the last two or three years so the use cases actually like have stickiness when it comes to actual utility for mainstream other than like the the true nature of bitcoin in the 21 million units that you know that'll be forever of course i would actually fundamentally disagree with that look i think the premise for me has always been like money is free money is speech right like money is a core pillar of democracy money is a core pillar of what makes a free society possible right and so i think the premise of bitcoin has remained unchanged the value proposition of bitcoin has remained unchanged you know i see right now there's a lot of like pearl clutching around proof of work first proof of stake first of all they're not substitutes they're not even remotely close to substitutes they accomplish two very different things both of which are valuable and should exist but conflating one to be equivalent to the other is like insanity i think the whole esg movement is complete insanity like do i agree that we need to be concerned about sustainability absolutely it's something i'm very concerned about and invest in but do you think the way in which we're doing it makes sense like no abs absolutely not um and so i just think there are a lot of these uh sort of narrative violations in in crypto that come up every single cycle and there are certain things that it just have remained consistently true like crypto by and large the majority volume is still coming from market makers large institutions it's just that inside of the institutions being traded by like we thought they would be crypto institutions have become so large and command so much capital that they're actually the largest players in this market and i think we'll be the largest players actually in all markets going forward kind of a scary thought but um look i think the the last eight years um have been really informative and what i've learned does translate from cycle to cycle um and the same characters pop up time and time again they may have different names they may have different faces but every cycle we have you know the the same sort of characters with the same personalities the same uh waves which again is not necessarily a bad thing but i think it's um it's interesting to observe because there is a sort of cyclical trend that occurs every two to three years in crypto and then on top of that there's this broader secular trend so cyclical being short-term secular being you know longer term if you look at the 10-year trend line on bitcoin raise up and to the right if we zoom out and look 10 years ahead for ethereum and web 3 and other protocols and ecosystems i think you'll see the same secular trend i think the question is how do you navigate those cycles both as an investor but also as a person right who has emotions and an ego um and so a lot of what i've been doing with the vibing as you call it it's just trying to manage my mental state through this extreme volatility because after eight years it does become mentally taxing and i do see so many people in the crypto space attach their identity and their sense of self to a company or an investment they've made that that's done really well like a protocol they got involved in ecosystem they got involved in early on that has you know changed their their life um and i think that's really dangerous anytime you start to attach your identity to things outside of yourself i think that's setting yourself up for just disappointment inevitably and so um you know it's always interesting to see in these cycles i think right now people are going through like these waves of emotion but um so much around what we're do what we're doing in crypto is around sort of memetic transmission right returning memes and into money but then we're also creating these cults um of belonging these cults of personality these cults of belief and i think that's just um it's a challenging space to operate in because just as quickly as those cults can create positive momentum and like lift people up and propel an ecosystem forward they can turn negative equally quickly and and we've seen that time and time again so i i do worry about people in the space about their mental health you know we again we see this every cycle and so i do spend a lot of time managing my own mental state keeping my own ego and checking like remembering you know ninety percent of our success is being in the right place the right time and then luck is really you know when preparation meets right place right time so we have to keep doing the work i think the challenge is i think in these cycles a lot of people stop doing the work and when i say doing the work i mean what we do has to have intellectual rigor and an analytical sort of empirical evidence-driven basis right um at the end of the day like the world is filled with observable phenomena and it's our role to observe those phenomena right and to attempt to understand relationships between different factors and use that to inform our thinking or investing or approach to what we do it influences our ability to be successful whatever our aim is whether that's developing and shipping a successful l1 or running an investment fund or creating a successful nft ecosystem like there is in a certain amount of work that has to be done and where i start to get concerned is when i have conversations with people and they're not doing the work there isn't actually any intellectual grounding or understanding and that doesn't mean it has to be a formal education it doesn't mean you need like pieces of paper degrees as we call them that's not what i mean but there has to be sort of a a analytical intellectually driven approach to what you're doing and what i worry about is i talk to a lot of people who have zero grounding in any sort of objective reality and have zero basis or sort of zero intellectual basis on which to articulate their view of the world to articulate their thesis to articulate the value proposition of what they're trying to build um and i think that's that's that's challenging it's challenging for that to be sustained i think if you've been in crypto for eight years this means that means you're on your eighth or third cycle i believe uh your third third bull market bear market cycle and uh you talked about how um separating your identity from like a blockchain or separating your identity from the company that you work for is is probably helps you navigate that and uh and you know removing yourselves from perhaps from the ebbs and flows of a bowl and bear market allows you to maintain some sort of sanity but also at the same time i think that's the uh less frequent case for people in the industry like most people come in with some particular route they came in through bitcoin they came in through ethereum they came in through nfts and then that's their brand that's their thing would you say that like having that like removal of the your ego from particular like uh blockchains or companies or projects is what has enabled you to maintain uh your presence in the industry for three cycles because every single cycle bucks people off like usually people get bucked off by their first cycle and then they usually get bucked off by their second cycle and very few people have made it to three cycles so would you credit like that sort of just like removal from uh some sort of just like material attachment to some aspect of the industry is why you've been able to survive for so long yeah i think that's one important component of it and to be very fair i did make that mistake myself i attached my identity like very much to what we built at dcg and um you know at the end of the day that wasn't my company that became very clear to me um and that was challenging and an important learning sort of moment for for me i think the second piece is it's really important to be willing to admit that you were wrong and to be willing to change your mind i think one of the things i know for sure is that the arc of time right a it's very long and over the arc of time like there are periods over which you will be proven right and periods over which you'll be proven wrong and i think it's important to have a perspective and to be willing to articulate that perspective and put yourself out there i think it's a really important test for yourself to develop conviction whether that's around a specific investment thesis or a vision for the ecosystem will look like in the in the future and there are very few people today who i think are willing just in the world in general right who are willing to like have a perspective have a view and to articulate it in the public sphere most people try to walk this line of like not being about anything and i'm like what's the what's the [ __ ] point like what are we doing here i think it's important to have a perspective but it's also important to be able to admit when you're wrong and to change your mind and to change your perspective so i'll be very honest i was wrong about ethereum i have no issue saying that i have no issue admitting that and i look at that and i'm like okay why did i miss this why was i wrong about this i've identified like things i need to shift in my mental model and i think a big one is just being intellectually flexible and as you're presented with evidence and data right change your worldview like no one's going to be 100 right about everything if you were um you know that would be a very sad world to live in but um i think you know develop perspective don't be afraid to articulate that perspective putting that perspective out there is like a magnet it attracts like-minded people to and also people who are going to challenge your view right and i love it when people challenge my view because it forces me to examine my thinking sometimes the data they bring or the the evidence they bring is relevant and changes in my mind sometimes it doesn't but even being able to have the conversation without getting emotionally heated about it is like an important sign that you've been able to detach your identity from your your perspectives and then allowing yourself the grace of being like okay you were wrong about this and it's so it's okay to be wrong i've been wrong about many things i've also been right about many things and so being able to adapt and i think to change your perspective and then not being afraid to articulate that in public sphere i think is a huge part of why some people i think continue to grow and evolve with the industry and others maybe don't because they get very locked into a very specific vision it becomes a core part of their identity and then they have challenges evolving beyond that because their whole personalities is tied up in this very specific worldview right and i think in some ways bitcoin has has become that way like there's a whole cohort of people out there who believe that bitcoin exists in isolation and exists in this echo chamber and i'm like that's you're just looking at the evidence out there i think that world view is no longer one that is necessarily like supported by the evidence that around you and i think for a lot of people we saw this recently actually the bsv community right people don't even know probably people who listen to this probably don't even know what vsp is so we don't talk about bsb a lot so maybe i'll just take a moment and articulate like what's happened here because i think it's a helpful illustrative point so um bitcoin block size wars bitcoin basically split into two and i kind of think of it like the schism that happened in the church right where you had the catholic church um henry viii wanted to divorce his wife so he uh like branched off and uh the protestant church came and things they had this schism right like between catholics and protestants and i'm not a history buff so i'm probably overly simplifying but effectively there was a schism in christianity and there are now two dominant branches who had similar beliefs but the implementation of those beliefs was different right so bitcoin same thing two cohorts of people fundamental agreement on sort of white paper differences in envision so there is bitcoin um bitcoin cash and then this thing emerged called bsc or bitcoin satoshi's vision which was all about making bitcoin i'm i'm not sure like i wish i was joking was highly relevant at the time um and bsv or bitcoin station's vision was all about bitcoin for payments and like really big block size and lots of blocks they could do a lot of payments there was a whole community of people who sort of went off in this direction where like this is satoshi's original vision we need to build bsv put all their castled all their bitcoin sold all the other forks of bitcoin went hard into bsc and bsv basically fell off a cliff and um i think for those people um one of them like last month came out he was like you know i was so hard like emotionally psychologically financially into bsv it's ruined my life it's ruined my family's life like i don't know how i'm going to recover from this and it was really sad in a in a way but people get i think trapped in these mental models or these views of themselves that are very narrowly defined by a specific ideology they had a specific point in time like the world is not a static place the world is very dynamic ever evolving place change is the only constant so um you know i feel bad for people who feel trapped in in whatever identity they create around themselves it'll be interesting to see honestly what happens with like a lot of the nft influencers we see whose domain expertise and whose relevance is like limited to pumping specific nft collections they're paid to pump again not a criticism that's that's a business model for sure that'd be interesting to see like what they pivot to next and are they able to move beyond nfts or do they sort of stay in this narrowly defined thing that's become their their identity but you know i certainly don't think you know 10 000 pfp collections are the path forward for for nfts you said um yeah you were wrong about ethereum and and there was a moment in time in the crypto industry where you know ethereum was like uh from what i've gathered i wasn't here at this point in time from but what from what i gathered ethereum was like the contrarian bet and so i i i'm wondering like when you say you were wrong about ethereum were you wrong about ethereum because you had your own independent internal beliefs about it that were wrong or was it like the climate and the environment of the whole entire industry at the time that you were a part of that uh that really like guided what you believed about ethereum because you know if during the the phase of 2014 to 2016 part of part of crypto when ethereum was really getting off the ground it was basically bitcoiners and you know bitcoiners generally don't really like ethereum so how can you like parse apart how much was like your belief and how much was like the the general uh entire belief of the industry are those like separate no i think those are one and the same and again i think at that point in time um i was still so the firm i was at dcg was very anti-ethereum a very pro-ethereum classic which is like looking back was a preposterous perspective um like yeah um so part of it was the firm i was uh part of it was the industry itself community people and honestly i think the other piece was i was still so focused on bitcoin because there was so much happening with bitcoin at the time that i didn't really dedicate a ton of time to ethereum i will say in 2017 i started spending more time on ethereum i started investing in ethereum luckily so you know the worked out okay um but i don't think i think the the the group of bitcoiners that like are bitcoin only and no ethereum i actually think that's a very vocal minority like extremely vocal but i do think that is a growing minority and honestly i do worry at this point um about bitcoin's culture i think there are elements of bitcoin's culture that are extremely unappealing and are extremely concerning to me as a long-time bitcoiner and someone who really does believe in like bitcoin's very unique value proposition as not just store value but a medium of exchange and a layer for public blockchain innovation um it's really concerning to me i think it really turns people off i think we start to see that now in ethereum as well right like they're now ethereum maximalists which i think is never did i think i would say those words that they're definitely ethereum maximalist um you know again i think there is and this is where i think one of the areas i've been really interested in lately is um religion divinity and sort of what cults or belief systems in a more technocratic society look like um you know i jokingly like to say that i'm i'm gonna start a cult and then i realize i'm already in like several cults but there is this really interesting movement and we talked about this a bit when you and i hung out last time in person like the largest spiritual movement in the world isn't an organized religion it's the spiritual but not religious movement around 40 percent of americans belong to this they identify spiritual but not religious but this affiliation it doesn't have any formal identity it's it's not organized um i think for a lot of people who are spiritual but not religious for a lot of people who don't have a uh a specific sort of spiritual uh practice they prescribed to crypto actually has become a form of spirituality which sounds a little bit crazy but i do think for many people uh crypto and in particular like whatever specific blockchain or ecosystem they have an affinity with um does become in many ways a belief system their components of mysticism and esotericism in in crypto like if you look at satoshi if you look at the cult of personality around vitalik in in ethereum and the way people look at what he writes as though it's scripture um the way you know people look at decrees from charles hoskinson and the cardinal ecosystem the same way like we looked at people bull probably in the 1100s you know when the world still was by and large um in in the grips of catholicism so it is interesting to observe uh these elements the sort of organized belief systems that are emergent in crypto and really all meaning right if we sort of take a step back and you know i like to get us esoteric but if we look at um baudrillard wright who wrote a great book called um uh simulacra and simulation it's basically around like how we as humans make meaning and construct our reality all meaning sort of all reality all identity is based on symbols icons and and memes effectively right this is how we sort of transmit who we are and we teach this to our friends it's it's omnipresent in the way we conduct ourselves it's what present in the way we communicate and the way we dress the way we present ourselves now the boy we behave online right i think nft is like the pfp you choose says a lot about you it's become your identity i always love that pudgy penguin i don't know if it was a parody of like that twitter spaces where someone's talking about their pudgy penguin they're crying and they're like i am my penguin is me i was like this is exactly what we're doing this is exactly what we're doing here but i do think it's really interesting to start to see with daos and these nft communities we have three communities how people are starting to imbue these groups of people who believe in things with organization with financial capital with like community governance tools and infrastructure it's still very nascent and that whole stack is extremely underdeveloped it's like very piecemeal approach very challenging to navigate still but i think it is really interesting to see like as i start building these tools and as you start seeing this infrastructure the fact that these communities are day one imbued with an enormous amount of financial capital but then also have a tremendous amount of social capital in the form of like online personalities who have a reach that's much larger than any traditional media outlet right and then you think about the human capital because you can work anywhere anyone around the world can contribute to these communities that starts to become a really powerful force that can radically reshape society and how we think about power and influence in our in our world today well i'm so glad you you brought this up because if you didn't i was definitely going to right after you were you brought up about uh the the block size wars and how it felt like a schism between like the church and like i i think that as the world becomes more trends towards more and more atheists that we've seen this trend for the last like 20 years my general gist is that as the world gets more and more atheist it actually creates more and more demand for some sort of alternative like not some not some ancient religion but some new source of like you said spirituality some new source of affinity and not only is the world trending towards more and more atheism but it's also trending towards more and more um loneliness especially with covid where people are like stuck inside they're learning how to be on their computers for 16 hours a day and all of a sudden we have these like new like techno religions around some sort of like shared set of values and vibes and you talked about like the the the guy that fell in love with bsv and he put not only his identity but his financial capital and like the capital of people around him uh into bsv and it's very very cult-like like you can hear the same story with other cults like normal cults that you would see on some sort of like netflix like movie or something sure and now we and now we have like now we have all of the cults right like a dao is a new cult like an nft profile picture isn't is a new cult like blockchains themselves are new cults uh and like rending rendering yourself immune from the in a pull of one of these things is really really hard and like i find myself in it as well like you know i kind of really align with the particular values of ethereum and i can't really figure out how to get my headspace out of that just because none of the other cults i found out there resonate with me all that much and so i find myself very very comfy in this particular flavor of spiritualism which is the the values that i see embodied by by ethereum and i'm wondering what you think what you see is like the long-term trajectory of this thing is this like part of just like the bootstrapping of this industry or is this kind of the new status quo moving forward into the into the into the digital age okay so so what i think is really interesting right when we talk about uh occults in this in this sense i'm not just talking about um crypto right if we look at the top 10 companies in the world by market capitalization right the largest companies and i do think companies um are incredibly powerful i think brands are incredibly powerful and we've sort of if if i may again i'm going to take a little detour like a historical detour love it if we look at what defined power right and where influence came from it used to be that influence came from empire right and these were monastic um legacy driven empires right typically they were patriarchies right so we had the age of empires uh then emerged organized religion we saw the age of a new empire the age of religion right where the church was the most powerful entity and then that started to splinter and fracture and then we entered the age of the nation-state right and nation-states became the dominant forces and that was probably around like the start of the industrial age uh then in the mid 90s after world war ii right we saw the splintering of of nation states um we started to see the emergence of corporation states right and this new more more savage form of worship which was capitalism and if we look at um where we are today we still live in the world of the corporation state but something new is is emerging we can see it and we can we can feel it and i think a lot of it's being driven by what's happening in our you know little sliver of reality in the little you know segment that that we live in but it's present in a lot of different places as well and this new age like we're sort of in the age of the influencer but we've moved beyond that into the age of these increasingly small and specific communities that congregate both online and in real life but like the these little pockets of society that used to be difficult to find are now becoming the norm and becoming very mainstream and i think q anon was a part of that right like that whole thing was insane from the outside but to people who are in it like for them it was very real and it grew very quickly and it was very powerful um and so this new age um there's sort of a new power struggle there's nation states there's corporation and i think nation states are on the decline their influence is on the decline their relevance is really on the decline and what we're seeing is like these grasps for power from an institution that realizes that it is no longer really relevant at all corporation state's so highly relevant and i did this interesting analysis where i looked at the top 10 companies by market capitalization so i'm just going to run through them apple does apple have cult status yes or no certainly yeah 100 does right so apple is a cult i'm surrounded by apple products right now yeah i'm in the cult of apple as well but even going to their stores right it feels like you're going to to church like there's a religious element it's like sparse it's clean it's a very specific aesthetic apple cult um second largest company saudi aramco cult status company itself low oil high right our world runs on oil micro it's a company that is tapping into the power of the cult which is the resource exactly yes uh microsoft third largest called status weaker than apple kind of a shitty cult but it's still a cult but for worker bees and knowledge workers right for people who work in corporate america right life they live their life inside of microsoft office and inside of windows still the largest os in in the world crazy but true cult of microsoft is strong alphabet slash google called amazon cult tesla definitely a cult berkshire hathaway 100 absolutely occult people go on a pilgrimage to the middle of nowhere to omaha nebraska to pay homage to their lord and savior warren buffett like berkshire hathaway is the craziest cult i've probably ever seen it's a finance cult like wild um nvidia not a cult yet but powers cults because all cults all metaverses need gpus for rendering and that's the game videos in i would say that amd which is the nvidia's uh competitor definitely a cult there's a there's cult following behind amd's yeah we stand for lisa she's a baddie yes yes yes um sadly mg's not in the top 10 yet uh meta definitely cult but i think meta is one of those companies it's a really crappy cult right like it's a cult in the sense that people love to hate facebook right which is really fascinating yet we still use facebook products every day also a platform for other cults fanta absolutely true correct um and then last is is tsmc um again semiconductors it's the input that you need to have a successful online cult um okay so all of these top companies in the world right have an element of cult status or affiliated with things that have cult status and then lastly if we look at what we're doing in crypto like we are effectively developing communities that act like like cults and i think the way you described it before it's not necessarily atheism i actually think it's it's slightly different um it's what is it called not you're not atheist you're agnostic sorry it means that you haven't chosen a specific belief system but you believe in spirituality i think atheists like atheists is someone like my dad who's a scientist and he's like i only believe things if they're like mathematically verifiable and maybe in a way bitcoin nurse are the atheists of the crypto space they're like your weird atheist uncle isn't that a cult of a different form though absolutely it's a cult of science yes it's a cult of irrationality which in and of itself like has been perverted right the cult of science the cult of knowledge has been perverted into something completely dysfunctional as we see with like modern academia um but we're creating these like really interesting communities and they're becoming increasingly esoteric right bitcoin large community ethereum large community like top 50 coins by market cap large communities but there are some long tail coins out there that have like really there's a whole dash community out there i don't know if people remember dash there's a whole i'm showing my crypto age cryptogram over here talking about bsv dash you can talk about dash masternodes like there is a whole community of dash loyalists out there it's crazy so there are these really interesting behaviors that are emerging and again i think what's going to be really powerful is as we move out of this age of nation states out of this age of corporation states and unbridled capitalism into this age of capital imbued with purpose and community what will that look like is the question i'm really interested in really excited about so i'm going to be giving a series of i'm doing research right now so if anyone has anything they want to share i'm reading a lot of marshall luhan obviously but all recommendations welcome if anyone wants to riff on the topic drop me a dm on twitter happy to do that i'm going to be giving a series of talks over the next few months starting in june on the topic and then hosting a workshop um in the summer and in the fall on it and then hopefully be doing some some more writing about it but i'm excited about the future of occult um tooling infrastructure that we can utilize to help people in a build cults and communities in an open source manner and make them interoperable but imagine if we could have these small pockets of people that congregate in physical space that pool and share resources right that use all this open source tooling and infrastructure to manage their local communities both physically and digitally and that these small sects or cells are then interoperable and communicate and transact with one another because they're on the same underlying infrastructure public blockchain like all of a sudden what you start to see is the emergence of this really powerful sort of organic organism that's almost mycelial in nature where you have these individual hubs or or cells that have their own unique belief system or their own unique values but there's the universal sort of compatibility in this this broader network i think that is incredibly powerful socially i think that's incredibly powerful economically and i think that is what we're starting to see it's not unique to just crypto crypto's not the only tool in our toolkit but i think it's an important component of what the future might look like as people start to dissociate their identity from where they were born what passport they hold the religion they belong to or their parents belong to what they do for an occupation what products they consume right we no longer identify ourselves that way at all like when's the last time you went to a crypto event and you knew anyone's nationality or anyone's religion just don't talk about it so that's what's really exciting to me there's like this really big shift that's underway we're not talking about it and so what if we were to give an identity what if we were to sort of put more structure around it what would that enable people to do i don't know but we're going to find out so yeah this is super wild and i i think we can even get even more wild even more wild here you talked about the trajectory of like cult organizations over time starting with like the empire turning into the church turning into the nation state turning into the corporation to kind of where we are now with with crypto and i think the trajectory is um many many more and more cults over time like how many empires can the worlds really support three four and then religions it kind of gets even smaller there's only like three major religions and then nation or excuse me it gets it gets larger with more and more denominations uh and then and then uh you know countries and court and and nation states there's a lot of those there's like 150 180 nation states but then there's corporations and there's more than i can count number of corporations and now with crypto there's like one cult per token right there's one community per token and we also see this outside of crypto right where like every single subreddit is kind of its own community his own cult and i think we might be conflating the word community and cult but we'll come back to that later um and so like i'm using cult here people have a negative connotation of cult sorry just to like to identify the term when i say call communities probably a good word but i think community is not strong enough right the community is like something you belong to a cult is something where you have to go through right of initiation where you prove your loyalty to the group in a very public way i think in crypto we do that right if you're like part of an nft community you make that nft your pfp sure right or if you're part of ethereum you put like the dot eth or if you're a bitcoiner you put the lightning network like uh emoji on your twitter handle like a hashtag bitcoin yeah or you get like a bitcoin tattoo um so i think there there is this very cult like component where there's like a very public display of your affinity to that group and they're escalating levels of commitment right yes yeah like a concentric circle of like more and more like extremism yeah exactly right it's important and uh with something that chris berniske put implanted into my brain is that he thinks that crypto uh offers like the foundation for economic viability of culture as in if a culture is economically viable crypto can enable it to be so and so we're like we're going from like empires of like three to four major global empires to like you know 50 religions to 200 countries to 20 000 corporations to 200 000 like tokens and like the my optimistic take on this is that for every single new community cult that's out there the reason why they exist at all is because they allow for a higher fidelity representation of the desires of the humans that compose them and so like human human interests can span so many different domains uh whether it's i don't know like you know rock climbing comes to mind or finance or like pick pick your domain of interest and now that we have like many many more cults and more and more niche cults and cults that are answering to the long tail of human interests we are actually producing like online organizations that represent human interests with higher fidelity just because we can have more granular cults because of the technology that we enable it yeah and so like uh did you have any thoughts on that mainly yeah i like that concept um i think the only thing i struggle with and again is probably a syntax thing is what does culture mean like to me culture is kind of challenging to define or disambiguate from [Music] religion in a way and again here i think the challenge is like language is so tricky because we're trying to use language that we haven't yet created to describe something that we all feel and sense but like putting the words to that feeling is is difficult this is why the crypto industry has its own language like people come in from the outside and they're like you guys speak differently like yeah we know but i think again if we think about how humans construct meaning right it's through language and if we think about language right i've always i don't know it's like when i get weird this is what i think about right um we use words to try to simplify and communicate things universally but like the what's the word for this it's water right but there are so many different ways i can experience water like when i take a sip of water and then you're really thirsty it's like refreshing it like makes you feel alive it's like an incredible feeling swimming in water is totally different like the word water does not capture all of the different ways in which we as humans can experience water right i also think english i did not grow up speaking english i grew up speaking dutch and turkish but growing up speaking other languages where language is very like linguistically turkish is very different i would say dutch is very similar to english it's actually very different very expressive language um language is really limiting right because we have these very seemingly simple words that describe radically different feelings and emotions right that's why i like languages where there are like multiple words for the same thing but describe the different ways you can experience that thing i'm like this is what we need um and also i think in the crypto space we're really good at co-opting language we'll take words that mean one thing and we'll like twist them to mean another thing but i think again the way we construct meaning it's through um symbols right through visuals it's through actions um it's through words and and language but it's really limited still um and now we've added a sort of new aspect to it which is like your entrain activity what you do on shane is also part of of who you are now i just want to know are you familiar with the uh the i think he's a philosopher but also an author ernest becker in his book the denial of death no i haven't read it yeah so the gist is that um humans have this incentive to contribute to symbols uh because we're all subconsciously we've we've we all know that we are all going to die but we don't really want to wake up and think about that fact so we repress that and put it back into the back of our minds but this uh this incentive to not die comes out in our commitment towards working towards something that's bigger than ourselves and so we're going back to the conversation of like people that are members of a religion or people that participate in government or people that build a corporation or people that help promote their preferred l1 or their preferred community and we all know so we're all we're all know we're mortal but we work towards these symbols that we believe are going to outlast us in an attempt to achieve immortality right like ethereum the blockchain is going to continue to append blocks long beyond my my life here and so i can achieve some semblance of immortality by like helping it do that uh and and there's always this like incentive to be a part of the winning team whether that winning team is like a religion or a winning team it's literally a sports team like sports team is another like thing that is greater than oneself that people it's another cult yes and so like there's but what you're alluding to here is very important which is why i think religion is like the best cult of all um and also sports there has to be intergenerational product market fit right which i think speaks to this like defying death ideas ceaseless legacy idea is there has to be belief that by contributing to this like you are extending your legacy beyond your your lifespan right and like you're you're again going back to that that poor bsv guy that put all of his resources into a symbol that died like this is the the consequences of picking a losing team right and uh and as all of these like cults of the world spin up in many many different ways some of them die off and some some of them win but we all can also see this like in global politics where you know china didn't side with russia because they saw that as like uh aligning with a losing team right like they need to preserve the the symbol of china by aligning with the winning team uh and this can also work its way into like nationalism right like one of the large reason a large reason as to why like nazism actually took place in germany is because a lot of people saw them as really powerful and didn't want to be on the losing side uh and so they just picked this this weird cult that you know had power for for a meaning of time and and i think this is why this partly answers the question as to why so many in the crypto industry always find some tribe to be a part of because we like camaraderie but we also want to be a part of a winning team but let's loop that back again to sort of where we started this conversation which is it's very important i think especially in a community like crypto that's so driven by memes and and trends and these phenomena some of which can be very ephemeral in nature and some of which have permanence i think it's again very important to develop a perspective that is uniquely yours and to behave in a way that is consistent with with your perspective and i think the challenge is when people are unclear what they are about or why they're here what they're interested in or what they're trying to to do with like the limited time we have here then it becomes very challenging to identify which group to align with then you end up chasing the trend right and you become part of a larger herd i think again having a unique perspective and having a perspective that is leverages your experiences your strengths your insights in a unique way and then being consistent with it articulating it consistently defending that viewpoint consistently becomes a very important part of like maintaining an identity that is independent of and not attached to any one single cult and i think the great thing is cults of belief and like cults of belonging are highly scalable because most of them don't demand complete loyalty right empire demanded complete loyalty religion demanded complete loyalty i can't be christian and jewish right uh nationality used to depend depend on complete loyalty now you know i have three passports so that's no longer the case um and the great thing is in in web 3 you can belong to so many different groups right i just think of the number of dows i'm a part of it like makes my head hurt some of them i have a very low level of commitment some of them i have a higher level of commitment but the fact that we can now scale and go from belonging to just a handful of groups to belonging to thousands of groups and those groups can evolve and change and merge and split over time i think it allows people so much more expressivity around like how they think about their belonging to these these different groups and maybe the next age is the age of cults and everything becomes an occult um then in the cult of the apple i'm in the cult of bitcoin i'm definitely in the the cult of oil and the cult of second hunters i mean i'm in a lot of different communities cults whatever you want to call them and again some of them require very high levels of commitment and others much much less so um but at their core i think for communities cults whatever you want to call them these organizations these entities these organisms to be viable you have to have a core group of people that's deeply committed right yes you need the center of the concentric circle you need the hardliners to to always like embody the cult right um elsa i think you would be a fantastic cult leader if you are not going to particularly identify with one particular cult maybe you should start one yourself because i would join that cult you know the cult i'm in right now and what i feel really passionate about i think one thing we tend to forget is that we have direct control over the reality that we live in and i think um nowhere is better example than than bitcoin right when i started working in bitcoin bitcoin was this fringe esoteric ideas i would talk to people about it and they'd be like what's wrong with you like why are you like this trust me no like you wouldn't believe it sounds so silly now but in 2015 i was in grad school i was at mit i was graduating my background like i had a quote-unquote successful career like i was a good little corporate person i'd done very well i'd done well in grad school i had all these job offers to go to great companies um and i was like nah i would go do the bitcoin thing and everyone's like what what the [ __ ] is wrong with you they're like why are you like this you're defecting from one cult for another oh 100 um is the best decision i've ever made but um you know people forget how much has changed in the world like crypto and bitcoin in particular is a very non-consensus thing even as little as five years ago it has now become a more consensus thing it's become very socially acceptable it's become cool like we're cool now this was not this was never cool but i thought it was not cool like i would go to events i remember i went to my one-year grad school reunion and everyone was like do not talk to her she works in bitcoin she's weird going to talk to you about bitcoin so one of us people forget how much has changed which i think is interesting but we do very much influence and create the reality we live in so the reality i lived in seven years ago bitcoin was not a part of that reality the reality i live in now what we've done with the hundreds of thousands of people who've worked on bitcoin worked in bitcoin and been out there like putting their names their faces their reputations on the line and going out there and advocating for bitcoin educating about bitcoin talking about bitcoin bitcoin is now a globally recognized asset it is held by some of the world's largest financial institutions who now trade in it like it has crossed the chasm in my view from a cultural financial sort of technology perspective is cross the chasm we made that reality it didn't happen magically there was a group of people who dedicated a lot of their time and energy into making that reality and we just push the boulder up the hill exactly we're doing the same thing now with other elements of what's happening crypto and what three but we are directly responsible for the experience that we have of reality and there are people who accept reality as it is and there are people who envision different reality and then work to make it happen um and there's a great book speaking of books since he recommended a great one for me um it's called finite and infinite games by james cars and it's basically about this this philosophy right we're in a finite game there's a specific objective and your mission is to reach the objective at any cost and then the game ends in an infinite game there's no objective other than to keep playing the game and so as you play the game evolves your role in the game evolves right and the idea is there's sort of these like levels of awareness in the game that you move through and to me the one thing i keep thinking about is like the objective for me is to get as close as i can to creating the reality that i want to live in and that i want other people to live in and what i love about crypto is that as an industry i do think that we are inherently optimistic we're inherently optimistic about human nature as we see from like the very flawed designs that we implement we're inherently optimistic about human nature we're inherently optimistic about what people can achieve if they work together we're inherently optimistic about our ability to impact reality in the trajectory of the world right and we we have to be and so i'm actually really excited about getting people to believe in their own power and their own ability to change the trajectory of the future but also to change their own experience of reality and so when we talk about vibes right and like i like throwing these these fun interesting events that bring a weird mix of people together it's like we need to remind people that magic is is real when i say magic i don't mean like woo magic i mean these transcendental like moments where you feel just an amazing connection to a room full of total strangers and you can feel this on twitter spaces you can feel this at a conference you feel this at a rave you can feel this at a show there are a lot of different ways that we as humans like create these experiences but i think in crypto sometimes what's lacking we get so like in the weeds and like the technical details we get so obsessed with our own little tribe that we forget as a whole like our objective is to convince other people like the core selling point of bitcoin was never like hey buy bitcoin because it's going to make you rich the core premise of bitcoin was like get involved in bitcoin because we can change the trajectory of the future to not be so grim and [ __ ] up and so i think we just sometimes have to remind ourselves that there's like a bigger sort of unified objective no matter what little tribe or sect of crypto you belong to like we all are sort of aligned in this idea that we can change the trajectory of the future we can bend the arc of reality we may not necessarily all agree on what that should look like but just the belief that we can do that is incredibly powerful and i think we need to remind ourselves of that sounds crazy no i mean maybe to the listener but not to me i'm i'm i'm definitely on board this train the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users

crypto industry uh you've been here for for eight years i've been here for like four four or five but when i when i first got started in crypto uh i wasn't like going out to conferences i wasn't like meeting people in real life i was still kind of just like in my my head's down face and so this is kind of what i want to pick your brain about next is uh how cr the social life of crypto has adapted and evolved what i've been saying to people and i want to i want to check with you if this is true is that like really the the social culture the in real life social culture of crypto wasn't at all defined up until post covered up until 2021 and and just because like yeah we had the bull market of 2017 to early 2018 but that was like defined by icos and i'm not really sure how much like in real life crypto socialization there was and so my gut take about like crypto social life is that it really just came about starting in manhattan starting in new york in like the end of 2020 and early 2021 would you agree with that no absolutely not oh oh okay where did it begin um it began i would say in like 2013 with the bitcoin conferences and back then the group was small there were maybe like three 400 people you'd see these things um the scaling bitcoin conferences were like 500 to 750 people but the energy there was like absolutely electric all the people you wanted to see were there um then it became like the bitcoin meetups so the socratic meetup in new york was was huge uh that's you know shout out to jonathan mohan um who ran the new york bitcoin meetup like those were huge those were really formative part of my early years in in bitcoin was the weekly meetups um also we were all really poor and they would have pizza and sometimes beer and so i was like yay like this is my dinner on wednesday night because i'm broke that's great well i just finished grad school um and i'm i work in bitcoin and i'm i'm poor um great no it's great but there was such a strong sense of community and um these people became my friends like it's really funny i don't think i have that many non-crypto friends anymore and i think it's really different when you go through these life experiences with people when you are in the trenches with a group of people and i've had like the the privilege of working with hundreds if not over a thousand different founders over the last eight years that i've been in this industry going through those crazy highs and crazy lows with people not just in their startups but also in the industry overall um it's a really special bond that you have um so there was a really vibrant crypto culture before the pandemic i think post pandemic it accelerated because we have a lot more money and people actually started spending that money so i think that's what changed is like we have more money we have better taste like back in the day we had bad taste now we can afford good party planners and we've developed some taste and some sense of aesthetic there's also more people in this space who aren't just like purely devs or business people or finance people like with the the introduction of nfts and the art world and the music world and the fashion world like more of the creative domains into crypto has also i think radically changed the nature of of events and the look and feel of events it's much higher production value so i would say postcoded like the influx of capital people's willingness to spend that capital um as well as more people who come from the broader sort of world of culture coming into crypto has elevated the experience but i would say that irl sort of connection has always been such a strong part of crypto even from the earliest days of bitcoin and those events like those meetups they were really i mean it was like the who's who i met the chain link founders seven years ago at a big devs meetup they were running a company called smart contract solutions and and seven years later it's it's changing it's like a lot of those relationships um you know still still persist and when i talk about like in real life crypto events i always speak with it with such like high regard uh and i'm trying to get like out of my bias with it just because you know i i had decently fun college days high school days not so fun but i've never had as much fun as i've had with crypto people and maybe that's just because i'm a crypto person and i like crypto and so of course i want to talk to crypto people about crypto stuff but also there's some some properties about the nature of crypto people as you said like inherent optimism inherent curiosity uh big brain or big big ideas than people that like to think and i think that is really what is so infectious about in real life crypto culture that when eve if the you know the normies of the world end up at a crypto party they also feel it is my uh is my assumption even though i don't know if that's completely true uh and now i think there's army friends around crypto people and they're like that's the most epic experience i've ever had all of these people are insane and beautiful but i'm also very selective about the vibe i curate i definitely think there's like crypto people that i don't want to hang out with and most of the time so i said i just spent a week in jackson hole and i invited like uh 15 crypto people out and it was so funny everyone's from really different walks of life everyone knew maybe one or two people there but no one other than me knew everyone there and we were joking at the end of the trip we were like there were literally no bad seats like everyone's amazing everyone's super interesting and we didn't even talk about crypto at all at all we talked about a life we talked about philosophy we talked about existentialism like one night we talked about music we talked about a lot of different stuff that's sort of tangentially related to crypto but it wasn't like oh let's nerd out right um but i think it's very important to curate like a good group of people around you and to expose yourself also to different ideas i like hanging out with people who challenge me i like hanging out with people who have different worldview than me right because it forces me to expand my my thinking i like it when i can disagree with someone i think that's important but i think um you do find these amazing pockets of crypto there's also really cringe pockets of crypto so i just there are probably people listening to this for like i have never had that experience to describe my experience of cryptos like especially as a woman going to an event i'm like one of three women in a room full of like sweaty weird dudes so yeah but i will say the one thing that has never changed even in the early days of bitcoin i remember in like early 2015 i had a question about um was it about lightning at the time lightning network and i dm'ed someone and they immediately responded to me we got on phone call we had a great conversation krypto is still the the same like for people who are willing to do the work and who want to engage i love the openness of krypton like how willing people are regardless of what level they're at right whether they're you know well-known crypto person that's been around for a long time for snoopy like it doesn't matter when you got into the industry who you are what your quote-unquote social status is i do think there's like really incredible willingness of people to engage with each other which i just absolutely love and i think is really unique to the space i see it disappearing a bit with like these mega funds and the corporatization of of crypto which makes me sad um but i do love that aspect of cryptoculture and i hope that continues to persist yeah yeah certainly that's definitely something that i felt and i think i think is missed along uh missed by a lot of the newcomers that come into this industry something that i really value in in this crypto industry is when you come into crypto and you start learning about it as soon as you start to get your bearings and as soon as your questions turn from bad questions to good questions like the difference between like the like the entrance level of crypto and like the top of crypto if we envision this thing as a hierarchy it's actually not that much of a hierarchy like the distance between the bottom and the top is actually really collapsed at least in comparison to like the traditional world the traditional tradify world where like climbing the social structures of like hollywood or new york or whatever social structures of the world is a grind and sometimes you can spend your whole life and not really get anywhere but in crypto like it's really easy to tell are you here for the right reasons are you a good person like crypto's very like like strips away the clothes from the emperor right like it makes everyone kind of come in just like lose their ego and it makes everything really transparent and so like if you are a person of the appropriate vibe and it becomes really easy to identify that amongst other people uh and so like like climbing up like the social ladder of crypto there's only like four or five rungs you have to climb before you're at the top because crypto's like so so still so in its early days would you agree with all that yeah i mean and i think just we're all just trying to catch a vibe at the end of the day yeah this is why i like curating that curating a vibe is really important like but again creating a vibe requires figuring out what you're about right and it requires you having the confidence and like the ability to detach from your ego and i do interact with a lot of people in this industry who are like easily triggered and they're easily upset and they're very delicate and you sort of have to tiptoe around them and their ego and like i just i can't with that i'm like just let it go so one thing i'm i'm looking forward to in the in which i think is coming is like crypto people are inherently innovators right like we all like to think and tinker and it's like hey does it have to be this way it could be this way instead and now that crypto has become insanely social with like nfts and and and you know nfts have really unlocked a part of the like the social culture around crypto that we've never had before and what i'm starting to see is crypto people kind of getting tired with the classic hire a dj find a club put the dj in the club invite all the crypto people and have an instance party i think i i think people are starting to think about like how can we innovate on parties like how can we innovate at the social layer how can we innovate in to have like more vibes like let's let's not just throw a like-minded people into the same room together let's actually like curate an experience yeah here's the thing here's what i can't send about nft events you go to nft events and i'm guilty of doing this i've done this myself you go to an nft event and it's like a bunch of screens with people's pfps on them and then like bad lighting bad music bad drinks i'm like let's do anything else yeah i think some crypto events do a really good job um i've actually not been going to as many conferences lately just because i find the conference is really tiring and like i don't understand people who want to have meetings at a conference like i'm exhausted i'm overwhelmed i don't want to sit for 30 minutes and talk about business because i'm not going to be able to focus like this is not a productive place to have a meeting if you want to actually productive meeting like let's just do a call or like have a meeting in the city that we both live in but like don't don't conference time yeah yeah but like i don't know if people are like oh yeah let's go to this conference and like have hours of meetings with people i'm like what that makes no sense to me that like defeats the purpose of going to a conference which the whole point of going to an irl event is to increase serenity right like or to increase the probability of serendipitous meetings it's like why are you sitting in a meeting room for hours on end with people that you already know and already have a relationship with when you could be out like meeting a high volume of people very rapidly in a very compressed window of time so if you ever try to have a meeting with me at a conference respectfully no thank you because it's not productive like why did i go to the conference to sit in a meeting room and talk to people i already know right doesn't mean i can achieve these goals elsewhere it's just not productive um but i've actually stopped going to so many conferences what i've started doing is going to smaller events so i love these like weekend long couple of days week-long events i've hosted a couple of them where i just bring a bunch of people i really like i'm really interested in together and we all shove ourselves into a container and we just vibe and see what comes out the other and you and i went on a trip like this right we just like we've act for a couple days it was super fun it was great and some fantastic things came out out of that weekend including this podcast exactly but also we would have never had that level of intimacy that level of discussion um and that level of friendship like at a party or at a conference so i do think we need to invest in relationships and we also need to be very specific about like who you want to have relationships with right because you can't have a relationship with everyone so it's like who do you want to spend time with in what container what do you want to get out of that time for me i don't necessarily need to have a specific objective but having sort of a theme right should i want to do these workshops around the future of religion and what divinity looks like in a technology driven society um and that'll be sort of the overarching theme um but you create a container you get people together in it and then you see what what unfolds you add a little bit of structure to it but not a lot and i think that's to me far more interesting far more exciting melting as a veteran of the industry as as crypto grandma what advice do you have for the for for the youngsters in this base who are coming in for their first or second year like what what what's really useful for you yeah look it doesn't matter my firm belief is like it doesn't matter whether you're an hour into crypto or 10 years into crypto like everyone is equally deserving of being here being a part of this so it doesn't really matter there are a lot of people who've been in crypto a very long time who have no goddamn sense [Laughter] and there are a lot of people who are like very new to crypto have a lot to offer so i think your tenure in the space is not indicative at all of like any anything um you're equally capable i think of making contributions and playing a meaningful role um regardless of when you got into the space so that should never deter people sometimes people are like oh my god i'm so new like i don't know anything i'm like first of all you know more than like most people because you're here and number two it doesn't matter like whatever um my advice honestly the biggest thing is like be about figure out what you're about be about something don't do this thing that so many crypto people do where you're about absolutely [ __ ] nothing be about something like figure out what it is be about something and then talk about it like so many people are observers do something buying a coin is not doing something like do something literally do anything do something do something that other people aren't doing is that is that the no it doesn't matter if other people are doing it do something like put some skin in the game make some commitment and then the second piece is like be willing to be wrong i think a lot of people are afraid to be about something and to publicly articulate it because they're afraid of being wrong you are going to be wrong about many things you're going to be right about many things it doesn't matter the only thing that matters is that you're still playing the game if you never get in the game you can't play the game so like do something be about something and then talk about it talk about it with your friends talk about it with people on the internet um you know lurking is one way to do it but i don't get involved there's a lot to be done and who knows what might happen if you like take that first step and what that might turn into but i see so many people who are like just passive passive passengers on this ride and that's just not going to cut it malcolm what about the current state of the world including crypto or not including crypto makes you optimistic um honestly it's tough some days um what makes me optimistic first of all they can't put us all in jail there's not enough jails they can try to build more but somebody has to do stuff so they can't put us all in jail they might try but they didn't they just can't so that that's optimistic um uh look the world is run by incompetent buffoons i think we are seeing like how incompetent our institutions are which is accelerating this like tremendous power shift that we're living through and again what makes me optimistic is like we have seen single-handedly how powerful individuals and um communities on the internet can be so that makes me really optimistic like if we could meme bitcoin into existence imagine what else we can do that's exciting melson thank you for coming on and sharing your thoughts on layer zero thanks david thanks for having me i'm excited that you're doing this show
