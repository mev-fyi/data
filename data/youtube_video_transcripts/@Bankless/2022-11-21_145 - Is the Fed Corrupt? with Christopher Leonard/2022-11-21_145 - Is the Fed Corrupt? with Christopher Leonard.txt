foreign [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys how is money created why is it created who actually does the job of money creation and how come everyone always talking about the Fed this episode is going to unpack everything you need to know about this odd little institution that governs our lives a few takeaways for you number one we talk about the origins of the FED starting this little place called Jekyll Island did we even need it in the first place number two has the FED strayed from its original purpose has become correct corrupted we talk about the massive massive damage that the FED has done number three what do we do with this institution if it is corrupt if there's no path forward what do we do with it do we reform something has to change what is the path forward David this is a really fun episode uh like I learned a lot about the FED but why are we talking about the FED I mean is this just kind of a a wonkish detour or how is it core to the crypto journey and why do we need to unpack it on banks certainly well the FED is at the very bottom of in the Global Financial system so why are we talking about the fed well it supports everything uh and so it's important to understand how it works and it's actually crazy that so few people understand how the Fed works and this was just a really good Learning lesson for me it's like to go and unpack the the construction of the Fed so they don't know no not at all and I think it's also like emblematic that the FED is a Federal Reserve or a central bank you're not supposed to think about it if it's working it's invisible if something is breaking that it's and it is a symptom of that is that we talk about the FED uh and so the FED is supposed to be in the background so the fact that it is on top of investors Minds that is something that is already off to a bad start and so there are some things I think that listeners should consider while they listen to Chris here uh the FED it's it's not a monolith it's got a number of different people uh 12 different board members uh and if it's got different board members some board members come and go over time so how does the composition of the FED change how has it changed since it was created in 1913 uh how was the FED originally formulated and how did time and external influence change what the FED is and also perhaps consider what parts of the Federal Reserve story The the or the character development of the FED are emblematic of what our goals and aspirations are in the crypto industry what part of this story really shows us why we are here in crypto I think those are questions to consider while we listen to Chris in this episode yeah definitely and if you're a premium subscriber stick around after the

into the minds of the Fed he's an American investigative journalist he's an author Christopher's newest book is called the Lords of easy money and that's an investigation into this institution we call the Federal Reserve the subtitle of that book is how the Federal Reserve broke the American economy man it sure feels broke right now and of course this is a crypto podcast primarily but the FED impacts everything Chris welcome to bankless thanks for having me so we want to get into the story of uh of the FED um I guess you know a high-level question though is um is what the FED is doing right now is is that a new thing like should we be worried yeah we should totally be worried I mean that's the undertone all right cool yeah yeah um I'm I'm I'm pretty worried about a lot of stuff and and what the FED is doing right now is not normal in any respect and you know I don't want to just launch into a soliloquy about it but I think to answer your question the core point that people need to know is that between 2010 and 2020 the FED just broke into an entirely new graph like they they started doing these experiments with easy money that changed their role in the economy that changed the financial system in really really deep ways and and again it just broke the graph of what they've been doing so they really broke the charts starting in 2010 they've changed the entire landscape of monetary policy and that's the backdrop for everything they're trying to do right now so you know here we're we're sitting here in late 2022 and the FED is trying to so-called Titan you know they're trying to hike interest rates and do all this stuff we'll talk about like quantitative tightening to fight inflation and that sounds pretty normal that sounds like the job of what the Central Bank does at hikes rates to fight inflation but the backdrop is is that they're doing it in this wildly distorted environment that they themselves have created which means that they don't really know what's going to happen they really are like a person feeling their way through a dark room right now and there's a tremendous amount of volatility and risk sort of underpinning what they're doing so my headline is things are the opposite and normal right now and if there's one party that really has no clue how this is all going to play out it is the Federal Reserve itself this is uh something that I think a lot of people in the crypto industry are are learning we are all kind of learning for the first time especially because the crypto industry can excuse you younger the role and importance of the FED while also what the FED is actually doing is also becoming very significant and new and like as I kind of zoom out and like come to terms with what the FED is Chris it kind of just seems absolutely insane like and like and I think what I mostly mean by that is they're making very big choices that there's no one else checking on them and like there's no other entities like hey fed that is that's lunatic that's crazy and everyone is asked oh the FED is uh zero percent interest rates for this long and now jacking them up this fast this for in this way and like sometimes I just zoom out it's like this is insane uh is that your reaction too yeah um and the insanity exists on two levels that you just kind of nodded toward okay you know first of all I think a lot of young people don't know about the FED because it seems really boring it seems like it's way over on the margins like it's not very involved in our daily lives the FED is really practiced at talking about everything they do in an extremely boring way and presenting themselves is just sort of like bureaucrats that just are solving math equations but again the insanity is happening in two key ways the first is the is the one you kind of mentioned which is that this institution is undemocratic like it was built to be insulated from voters because it has a really hard job to do to manage the currency and that means it has to do the hard thing sometimes of of hiking interest rates pushing the economy into a recession but for that reason the Fed was created to be run by this Committee of 12 voting members in in Washington DC and these people meet every six weeks they make these hugely consequential decisions uh like whether or not they're going to plunge the economy into a recession and like you're saying there's not all there these these this committee never faces voters they're never up for election there's no sort of outside entity that can kind of veto what they're doing it is entirely up to them so that's kind of insane to think about a committee of 12 people making these decisions but then the second level is that what they've done over the last decade has been so experimental and unprecedented that it's raising the stakes of everything so let me just quickly if I can like lay the groundwork for what I'm talking about when I keep talking about oh my God they've like changed the graph of History um the Federal Reserve is the only institution in the world that can create new US dollars out of thin air that's the fed's superpower they make money they could literally create new dollars out of thin air okay so when the cree when the FED creates new dollars it's like putting water into a swimming pool and that swimming pool is called the monetary base it's like how many original new dollars the FED has created so when the FED creates more dollars that monetary base grows and when the FED basically sucks dollars out of circulation the monetary base shrinks okay for the first 95 years of its existence the FED kind of gradually and steadily created more dollars it expanded the monetary base to be about 900 billion dollars that was like the core Foundation of U.S money 900 billion and then between 08 and 14 okay and about five and a half years the FED created three and a half trillion new dollars so okay that's 300 3x yeah yeah more than 3x the way I put it is more than three centuries of money printing in about four and a half years and so is it fair to say for the first 95 years of the fed's existence they were largely responsible and effective in their controlled metering of adding money to the pool and then they just blew it out of proportion is a fair description that is a fair description and and you know we could sit here for a long time and kind of debate you know did the FED mess up in the 1960s for example by keeping rates too low for too long and stoking inflation but the way I would put it is that from the the day it was created in 1913 until about 2008 the FED stayed inside these Lanes okay the FED said we have a lot of power but we're going to use it to do a couple important things the first is to just manage U.S currency we're gonna make sure we don't have massive inflation or massive deflation we're going to keep the Goldilocks pot bubbling on the US dollar and then the second key job was that the Fed was going to be there as the lender of Last Resort if there was a banking Panic the FED would bail out otherwise healthy Banks and stop Bank panics so for decades the FED really stayed in this Lane and and what happened after 08 is that you had this very activist kind of uh heroic aspirationally heroic uh fed chairman named Ben Bernanke who is just like you know what we are gonna be like the jobs program for America we we're going to be the engine of economic growth in America after 2010 we're going to do everything we can to stoke economic growth and that's when they print 300 years worth of money in four and a half years uh another way to talk about this you hear this really boring term of the fed's balance sheet we'll just call that the size of the fed's footprint when when they print more money it increases their balance sheet the balance sheet exploded from 900 billion in 08 to four and a half trillion in 2014 and and today it's 9 trillion so you're seeing the footprint just expand dramatically and it's broken outside the bounds of of the job it was created to do so there's 10x more money than there was in 2008 right now foreign core money original Money created by the fed and and like we don't need to get into this but there's this sort of second layer of of you know Banks actually create money when they lend on reserves and stuff but yeah 10x monetary base 10x fed balance sheet totally Uncharted Territory and and you're telling us that this was all done through an undemocratic unelected group of 12 Bankers in suits sitting in rooms somewhere yes most of them were economists you know they weren't even actual bankers um can we talk about this Chris so give us a history lesson here all right so we are um the listeners to bank lists are um they definitely dabble in investing very excited to be in in crypto kind of on the journey um they've heard a lot of the the memes I think you know the money printer memes that that circulate nowadays of course um but I think very few are familiar with the actual history of and I think some some people you know with within in in our circles think of the FED as this evil sort of octopus type of of of creature and that's become kind of a meme but I don't think it started out that way certainly and uh can you give us a history lesson of the Fed so how old is it uh how did it originate and we could talk maybe a little bit more about governance but tell us about this institution how did it come to be what's the full history here yeah you bet so first of all in in American history our government created a central bank which is a government-run bank we did this twice and then backed off you know we charted a central bank and then revoked the charter two times because you know America as a country is built on the idea of like fractured power and checks and balances and competing powers and there's this idea that if the government uh created its own bank it would have too much power but without a central bank the U.S kept encountering this problem of trying to have a stable currency so you know we'll just start quickly like after the Civil War in the 1860s the United States is becoming kind of an industrial power we've got these you know the the railroad spans the nation we've got these huge corporations starting to be born but our currency system was extremely chaotic in the late 1800s into the early 1900s we we kept having these periodic Bank runs we had long periods of deflation and you know this might be interesting to your listeners when you look back at this time late 1800s early 1900s there were actually thousands of currencies in the United States each Bank could basically issue its own currency and and this is a true thing that you know if I was a business guy in in 1883 I could have currency from a bank in Illinois and then if I went on a business trip to Oregon you know I'm at the hotel front desk I would have to kind of convince the hotel clerk that my currency from Illinois is sound I mean that's how many currencies there were kind of floating around the United States and currencies would keep value or collapse depending on their the bank behind them so to solve this problem problem the U.S did a few things they started doing these national chartered Banks and what's interesting about the Fed is that a lot of the impetus to do it and a lot of the momentum actually started from the populist level from farmers in the midwest who who wanted to create a currency system that broke the power of of the Eastern banking Elite and so these populists were pushing for these government-run banking systems and they had all these wild ideas like to have a dispersed group of national treasuries that would be like basically like use grain as a commodity of these dispersed treasury systems okay fast forward you all have heard of Jekyll Island I'm sure okay maybe not there's this meeting in around 1912 I forget the exact year but now we're getting to the creation of this Central Bank and these senators and bankers realize the currency chaos is unsustainable there's going to be a central bank and we either you know ride the train or drive the train and so these senators and bankers uh go have a meeting at this resort island called Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia and they're like okay this is what the central bank is going to look like we're gonna create a government Bank but it'll be sort of decentralized it'll be like a federal system we'll have actually like 12 Regional Banks and then a governing body in DC which is that unelected uh committee I just mentioned although that committee gets kind of like more sharply shaped in the 30s but suffice it to say they create this banking system but they make sure that the banking system is not going to displace the Wall Street banking system and and that happened in really interesting ways we can talk about but in 1913 the feds created and it was the job was to create a stable National currency that's called the U.S dollar which is actually a Federal Reserve Note and it was a way to so there wasn't a US dollar before this this they this is when the U.S dollar as we know today was created is that correct yes 1913. 100 and it's created because of the Fed so so Chris this period before I I think it's really hard for for people to imagine this period before uh Jekyll Island by the way what an ominous name Jekyll Island it just like just sounds evil but um but pre this it wasn't great the US banking monetary system wasn't very great because it'd be like living in a world where you had like Wells Fargo dollars and Bank of America dollars and they were all trading at different uh rates because they were all kind of independent uh currencies and of course you'd have to pick your bank to trust pick your bank to trust and of course this is before um the era of a fiat currency as as well in that like all of the you know the currencies U.S currencies had to be backed by a commodity at some level and I know there were also debates about like silver or gold kind of being a a backing for some of this but it was not we call it today very it was very poor user experience if you were trying to like do any Commerce in the US right you just like I don't know if these Bank notes are good or not like what well what's your bank I don't know trust me and by the way this is coming on the back of as we're recording this uh coming on the back of a uh a major we call them shorthand crypto Banks right because they somewhat resemble Banks although you know it's it's lowercase B it's not the capital B but a major exchange that just went Belly Up For example it'd be as if this exchange was uh saying it had a stable coin let's say that was backed by real assets and it wasn't it just evaporated and we we are actually just witnessed a bank run and all of these things we know how terrible the user experience was so this meeting at Jekyll Island I'm sure it is on the back of like probably years of this terrible user experience and the bankers and senators all come together and like well we better solve this or uh somebody else will and it'll be an uglier system that kind of cuts us Cuts us out of the process so let's come up with a solution is this capturing some of what was going on at the time that is exactly what was going on at the time and and and as you talk I'm picturing like if you wrote a book the chapter like bad user experience would cat would talk about the the bank panics the deflation the the the ruiness of financial crises that happened that put Farmers out of business and you know the 1890s early 1900s like people were were Furious it uh it was chaos and I I've had a lot of pushback on this but I really I'm of the mind that if we could have done capitalism without a central bank I feel like we would have you know the U.S has been resistant to creating a central bank but the alternative was rotten I mean the financial system really didn't work in the late 1800s and early 1900s right we've talked about on Bank list a few times the importance of we call it settlement assurances with the creation of business right like businesses need to feel secure in the long term property rights is is perhaps a better way to say it strong property rights but also that necessitates like a strong unit of account that you can assume will exist in 5 10 15 years and so like if there's just like a variety uh over abundance of unit of accounts that are all fluctuating and colliding with each other and not allowing for people to think in long-term thinking it makes sense that an entity needs to come in and apply a bunch of order in where there is a bunch of chaos so it sounds like in this moment of History uh Federal Reserve good like yes like it did its job as advertised and created a bunch of order and stability and allowed probably just a flourishing of economic activity as a result of that would you would you agree with that kind of of characterization of the first bit of the FED I I totally would there are a lot of people who felt the FED uh did a bad job during the Depression they kept the month the monetary Supply too tight for too long um they're people that argue that they did the opposite mistake in the 60s and kept money too cheap for too long and created inflation but I mean those aside yes the system was stable the U.S currency was stable for decades so so Chris was this um I was the fed the entity so at Jekyll Island you said there was kind of this meeting right the Senators and the Beggars decide what to do and then was there some sort of legislation that was passed on on the back of this to Grant this new institution a uh a new set of powers so this was actually if so this was actually you passed through our nation state governance processes it was passed the legislation was passed democratically is that what happened exactly so the Senators involved in that had the job of codifying this thing of making it through law and so in 1913 the Fed was born through an act of Congress signed by the president the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and that's what by the way creates this institution there's there's no clause in the Constitution for a central bank there's no basis in that way it is entirely an act of Congress so the act in 1913 creates the fed and then in 1935 during the New Deal there's kind of a a re-hash an update of the Federal Reserve Act that did a lot of things and sharpened like I said centralized power in that committee but yeah Congress created and and governs the Fed by the way is this uh something that all countries have like sort of you know modern um maybe democracies uh features like I I can't imagine a modern country existing without a central bank is this just sort of becomes table Stakes was it at the time or was was the FED sort of you know late on the scene the US getting its own Central Bank apparatus great question the U.S was a little bit late to the scene the bank of England Central Bank was around before the Fed and I'm I'm frankly not good on the history of other nations like Advanced European nations or Russia in terms of when they sort of founded their own central banks but I will say that as we sit here today every nation that has an advanced economy has a central bank and and they all look different of course but you know there's the European Union has a central bank England has a central bank Russia has a central bank China has a central bank it's a it's a pretty core part of running an advanced economy well it would be it's hard for me to imagine that a advanced economy or a nation competing internationally without a some sort of currency right so at the time of course uh I'm not sure what the the reigning you know 19 1913 the reigning Reserve currency was probably the pound uh or something like this it certainly was not the dollar but in order to kind of gain legitimacy and compete for against other currencies of nation states for even Reserve currency status right you know the unit of account for trade for example or unit of account for for for storing uh you know like Bonds on your balance sheet and a country really needs a Central Bank in order to participate in an international economy of course now the the dollar has grown to be I don't know what is it like 70 or something of um you know of trade I mean like it is the unit of account not only for the United States but for the world but they probably weren't thinking with those types of aspirations in 1913 were they it was just a matter of let's make the U.S banking system the user experience for the economy uh a little bit better and if we don't we things will fall apart they weren't yet playing the uh World Reserve currency game that is absolutely correct they created the FED to manage our own domestic affairs it was cleaning house internally and again um you know we were an agricultural economy at this time I mean something like 70 of Americans earned a living through agriculture or some just gigantic number uh during this time and and finance lending and currency was critical to that business and we recognized that to have order and and I hate to with the word liquidity because it's so overused but to have a flexible money supply that was managed in a way to you know kind of uphold the economy that that was just critical to making an advanced economy work so it was entirely to just manage domestic affairs essentially we created the Fed and this whole Reserve currency thing did not happen until after World War II when the U.S kind of walked out of the ashes as the dominant economic and military force and and we literally wrote A Deal called the Bretton Woods compact or I don't know if it's a compact or a treaty but that's what laid the foundation for us being a reserve currency so that that came much later I don't want to say it was an accidental World War II but it was a result of how we emerged from World War II all right so we've got some Milestones here so 1913 creation of the FED uh there are some you know what critics would say mismanagement of you know uh Central Banking policy uh during the 1920s maybe led to the depression that sort of thing right the central bank was was all caught up in that in 1935 some of the tools uh some of the the tools were sharpened as you said through some additional legislation then get through the depression there's a World War the US comes out of that with Bretton Woods with Reserve currency status Insight so the dollar being now kind of the dominant currency for the world that brings us to kind of the 1940s 1950s but there was another event that at least sticks out in my mind I'm curious what the fed's involvement if any is and this is um Nixon getting off the gold standard so you know 1971 sort of you know someone say this is the birth of of of Fiat money no longer backed purely by gold did the FED have anything to do with it or or if so what and would you say that's another significant milestone significant Milestone and the FED relationship to it I've got to be totally honest I have not gone super deep on that so I don't want to my my impression is that really was driven by the Nixon White House and international um economic conditions at the time um if the gold standard really worked well I feel like we would still be on it it is an inflexible system that was creating a lot of problems by 1971 and there's no question okay here here's how I see it and I think it's here's what's relevant to the idea of crypto which is that as you say the dollar was backed by gold from 1913 to 1971 and that imposed a kind of external discipline on the money supply it had to be tied to gold at a certain level and everybody recognized that that was really important because you know as you can imagine the real primary temptation of managing currency is that when you run into a problem you just print currency to to get yourself out of it uh you you print more money to drive economic growth uh but It ultimately leads to inflation and devalues the currency when when a currency is pegged to Gold it imposes discipline there's a great book about this I think it's called three days in September about Nixon's decision to go off the gold standard and it's it's because they're facing this pinch and this tension uh in terms of the international currency values but here's the point when they flip off the gold standard that takes away the external discipline of gold and in its place it says okay this committee that runs the FED is going to now be the disciplining force on the currency okay these 12 voting members who run this committee called the Federal Open markets committee or fomc these people are going to be like gold they're they're going to decide how much the monetary base should be expanded how much it should be shrunk so we're gonna have the wisdom of a committee basically replace the disciplinary uh effect of tying it to gold and so that's the path that we start down in 1971 and obviously there's like an entire literary genre of people saying that that was like the original wrong turn that the the the moment we switched to fiat currency is when buying power started to uh diminish and dissolve that in fact the committee didn't have discipline I I you know and and that's for listeners to kind of decide I do think putting the power in the committee of the FED does help give them the monetary supply of flexibility it really needs uh but again the problem is you have this like seductive uh impulse to try to print use money to print your way out of problems uh the bank list listeners will we all often talk about on Bank lists like one of the cool things about crypto is that is regulation through code uh and and we take power out of the hands of people and we put it into code because I mean we've we've seen what just happened recently with FTX when we gave too much trust and power into one person and let them do whatever they want with that with that power and trust and I think I really appreciate the Resonance of uh the idea of just like gold did the same thing it wasn't with code it was with physics though uh it was with uh just like you know you can't print print can't print gold uh and so that was the code that you were not able to break and now we are kind of doing the same thing with with crypto uh with our own bits of code well it kind of strikes me that like um you know in a in a system in a country built on the foundation of checks and balances right um the the major check on the fed's power let's say or this discipline was actually some element of the gold standard wasn't it because without that how is the Fed really were they governed and you know this this rotating uh group of of 12 individual fomc members um they change they're also susceptible to kind of the the whims of the time uh it seems to me that um the FED even still it's like purported to be kind of an independent organization but isn't it very clearly a tool of the state you picture kind of the a country like what are what what does it have in each of its hands one hand it's the sword with the military the other hand it's it's the coin right sword and coin treasury military uh and so of course it's a it's a tool of of the state and it's a it's a tool of politics and it's not an independent institution anymore so you can start to see the I guess when you remove the when you remove the the governor when you're remove the check and balance on the thing how it can just slowly get to the the stage where we're in now can you talk a little bit more about like how it's governed is there because there is still this pretension that um or pretense that the FED is somehow independent of politics tell us about that is that true in any way shape or form yeah and and God I'm just my mind is racing as you're talking I I really agree with everything you just said and I think it's a great way to look at it but you know not to be glib but one of my responses is no this isn't just a tool if the government it's also a tool of the biggest banks on Wall Street like don't don't leave them out of the equation they have a vote over this thing um and and we can talk about why that is but but truly the FED is an odd entity in the sense it's an it's a hybrid creation it is a private bank owned by other Banks uh but it's governed by a government committee that's appointed by the president the members of this committee like the Board of Governors oh it's I'm sorry it's kind of you've got two stripes of leaders some of them are appointed by the president approved by Senate others are approved by these local uh Bankers um so it's a it's a hybrid of of a private public partnership but there's no doubt it is like it it is the tool of of State Authority so let's back up a little bit and just talk about the governing structure um like I said when they created it they they modeled it on on the Federalist system where you had state power and federal power so the FED is an act it's a network of 12 Regional Banks which are like States and each Regional Bank has its own president which are kind of like State Governors and and those Regional Bank presidents are the ones I just mentioned who are who are appointed at the local level it weirdly by like a board of directors at the local level that's made up of local Bankers so a bunch of local Bankers in San Francisco will help appoint the president of that fed okay so you've got 12 Regional Bank presidents then you've got this board of directors in Washington DC that is seven I'm sorry the Board of Governors okay and these are the people appointed by the president and approved by the Senate and together the Board of Governors and the Regional Bank president run this thing okay and and the the fomc that committee I just mentioned uh it's it's interesting because it always has 12 voting members seven of them are the governors five are Bank presidents that come through on a rotating basis and Craig okay so which banks do they choose a lot of banks I mean there's fewer now than but they just pick the biggest banks for their favorite Banks or what by the way it's like kind of telling how like confusing this gets so quickly uh and I'm sorry about that like the governance structure is very complicated the top committee the fomc seven of the members are from the Board of Governors the other five are drawn from the regional Banks the fed's own Regional Banks I'm sorry if I kind of wasn't complete it's not like a Commercial Bank not like uh that's exactly right like St Louis fed for example is a regional CAD bank I don't even think about these things all that often I can't I name I know the St Louis one I know that's actually it I don't even know that no there's one Richmond for Virginia I know this yeah I've thought about this probably more than a person should because I've gone back and read through when this committee meets they actually transcribe their debates and then release the transcription like five years later and so it's really fascinating to watch these people debate these issues five years later so it's completely closed doors the public doesn't get totally closed doors but they do release it eventually after a five-year what are the debates like fascinating uh totally fascinating um and let me if I could like the debates I really looked at were the debates that started in 2010 right which were like should we do these hugely experimental programs like quantitative easing and zero percent interest rates uh or not and so you saw this heated debate inside this committee the the the contents of the debate like you said they were not released for five years and so going it's just shocking to look at this Committee in 2010 where you've got four out of 12 members saying you know what we're doing is incredibly risky we don't know what the long-term effect of this is going to be the short-term gains we're going to get are tiny we're barely going to reduce unemployment and then you've got the chairman of the FED Ben Bernanke saying let's do it anyway basically you know there's risks in not acting but uh yeah so I I I want to solidify the point though before we move on that the the governance structure is these 12 people five of them are from the regional Banks seven of them are the DC appointed Governors they meet in secret they debate for two days and then they make these decisions that we hear about like you know the FED raised interest rates today or cut interest rates and you know a month or two later they'll release a really General overview of the debates in the in the minutes uh but then the transcripts come out five years later and they uh that's insane that's an insane they meet monthly how what's the Frequency every six weeks they meet every six weeks okay and then okay so what kind of pressures are these individuals under like what what is kind of guiding what are the yeah you know you know for a politician we have a I think listeners have a mental model for a politician what is a politician care about votes who's gonna vote for me and fundraising so it's kind of votes and money right these are the pressures that bend a politician to you know say one particular thing or do anything maybe there's a moral character there hopefully but um but these are the main external pressures what are the pressures facing the average fomc uh appointee and then by the way how does how does it is it majority rule or how does it work like when they vote on something is it um you know has to have some kind of quorum okay so these are great questions um when the fomc meets and makes these decisions it is it's a majority rule okay so uh with 12 members it it has to be seven to five to pass something I don't think there's ever been a seven to five vote in the history of the fomc I don't think ever maybe once or twice the votes are always 12 to 0 11 to 1 10 to two what right yeah it's odd what does that tell us I mean there's is there some group thing going on or is there is there just some dominant personalities that sway the rest or do they are they just generally agreeable people so this is this is like what's at the core of the book talking about what they did since 2010 and now I feel like the subtitle of the book should have been that's odd so much of this falls into that so okay so you got this committee and right now today they're deciding you know do we hike interest rates really really high really fast do we risk tanking the economy do we not do it um interestingly this really matters that out of the 12 seven of them are these so-called Board of Governors in DC so you notice seven out of 12 they have a veto one however they decide to vote is what will happen and I interviewed a lot of these Governors but you know one of the most telling statements was from a former Governor named Betsy Duke who really just described in detail what's been substantiated elsewhere which is that the governors before the vote even happens they know how they're all going to vote right okay so if you tell me that a lot of these votes are as unanimous as they are it makes me think that well one person's really calling the shots and everyone else is just given the thumbs up because what group of people meets every six weeks and votes eleven One Eleven one twelve zero ten two no human I mean it's that's not a real debate yeah and this gets into the the politics and the history of the institution a really changed under Alan Greenspan but there's this really intense pressure toward consensus because as you know like fiat currency is based entirely on faith and also the world needs to have faith that the the committee that runs the FED knows what they're doing and will be consistent in what they do so if you saw these votes of like seven to five Wall Street would be like yeah are they going to flip at the next meeting like that that might not make a chaotic right especially when the Fed was supposed to come in to produce stability I guess as a user of dollars I would be concerned if I saw the manager of the US dollar having a bunch of contentious debates I guess that makes sense I think that checks out for sure yeah and again I can't overstate that the other part is that they want to look like they know what they're doing that you know these are technocrat PhD economists who are basically just solving math equations and so therefore you always come out to a correct answer 12 to 0 or 11 to 1 as opposed to really the reality which is that this is a bunch of human beings making policy choices every six weeks that's the reality and I guess I would like to go back to that year 2010 because it's at the core of what I wrote about and so that's when the FED went down this experimental path and and you know I talked about them increasing the size of their balance sheet but really between 2010 and 2020 they did two extraordinary things they printed all that money you know the 3.5 trillion dollars I talked about they did that through this program you'll hear about called quantitative easing which is basically just a maneuver to inject newly created dollars into the Wall Street banking system that's what QE is but then secondly very very importantly you mentioned this the FED kept interest rates pegged at zero for seven years between 2008 and the very end of 2015. that's extraordinary I mean rates had floated between three and four percent for decades they had brushed up against zero really briefly in the late 60s but had never really gotten there the FED decided to keep rates at zero for seven years that like reorganizes the Global Financial system around a zero percent rate it was a remarkable and experimental thing to do and in 2010 the Fed was having these debates as to whether they should do it or not and there was tremendous dissension I mean that's the word within this committee you had multiple people again saying we can't do quantitative easing you know that's going to pile up risks in the financial system we're not going to get that much gain for it in the short term critically once you start doing this it's going to be impossible to stop basically without creating a crash but the chairman Ben Bernanke who is kind of the author of these ideas pushed that committee to do this in a political way he talks about this very candidly in his autobiography that he was lobbying members he had one-on-one meetings with members who were disagreeing with him and he got them to break it down to an 11 against one vote to do quantitative easing and actually you know the main character of my book is the guy who voted no he was that one no vote and it's a really fascinating story as to how he stood up against this culture of groupthink and Conformity to do it but I I guess the point is you know here's Here's To Me the headline this committee is making policy decisions when you read through the debates you see that they're wrestling with this stuff and they don't have certainty at all and frankly they're making big mistakes in terms of their forecasts and all the rest of it they're human and and yet the vote that the public sees consistently again and again is is a sort of misleading consensus it's interesting that um you're you're it seemed like the people that were arguing against Ben bernank uh at least Ben Bernanke the way that you described it seems like man they were really prescient like they saw it all coming because that seems to be what happened maybe maybe like you have the benefit of being able to see what happened after 2008 so maybe that's the words that you've decided to choose but if you're telling me that people that were arguing with Ben Bernanke were worried about risk buildup in the system unable to go backwards after inducing a zero percent rate of all these people saw this coming in 2008 to 2010 that's like wow and we did it anyways uh that's kind of crazy why did Ben Naki have so much motivation to go forward with his path what was his inputs into this decision well I do want to clarify that the the dissenters on this thing did have different points of view okay the guy I profiled I I mean I I was drawn to his story his name is Tom honig and he's the Regional Bank president in Kansas City and he did end up being I think totally correct on his warnings at the time that it was going to stoke asset bubbles to do this that it was gonna be a quagmire that we weren't going to really be able to pull out you mentioned wealth inequality wealth inequality was a huge part of it he's like basically this program is going to stoke stock and bond prices which is going to benefit the richest one percent of Americans that own all these assets but it's not going to do much for the middle you know paycheck earning class of America and on that front he was at without question totally correct by the FED Zone metrics but your question why did we do this anyway and then you know Ryan that kind of goes back to your earlier question which I think is a fantastic one what are the incentives here like what is driving these people they're they're not trying to you know raise money for the next election I and listen I don't have a pat answer for that it's complicated there are a lot of uh institutional pressures on this Central Bank that led to what they did that led to the zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing the first big pressure is that it got it so interesting like I said the Fed was created to manage our currency and stop Bank runs but then it started to evolve over time that they were seen as sort of the stewards of the economy then this really really happened under Alan Greenspan he was called the Maestro he was seen as this genius he was helping Stoke economic growth without inflation and so by the time Ben Bernanke came along there was kind of this view that the the Fed was it was like I mean I hate to use the Wizard of Oz analogy but they were like the wizard behind the curtain they were the people that would manage the economy that would keep growth happening in a smooth way and at the same time while the FED is gaining all this like Prestige and recognition our Democratic institutions are kind of falling apart and just becoming increasingly like dysfunctional and unable to act and that's what led to in 2010 the FED saying you know we're going to drive economic growth unemployment is still really high after the great crash is over it says 2010 unemployment's at nine percent we're going to drive down the unemployment rate by contrast in the 30s it was the federal government that did that the fiscal government Congress like built dams uh you know put shovels in people's hands uh you know broke up the monopolies regulated Wall Street all this stuff in 2010 we're like okay well we're not going to do any of that we're just going to print money through the Fed and I think that's a huge pressure on on the FED to to act and to be seen as like the the driver of economic growth you can't overstate the the pressure I mean you see it right now today on the fed and it's chairman Jay Powell like how are you going to keep the economy growing when really that's a question for our elected leaders in my opinion I do want to double click on that because I think it's um and and maybe listening you have this in your mind but I think it's a completely unfair character chair to just um paint like uh the fomc and Powell and Company as just like evil Bankers right like you're just just trying to kind of like just being completely irresponsible and Wrecking the economy and being completely Reckless without the context of institutional pressure that they are faced with because to your point Chris in the absence of our government actually working and Congress actually working look at all of the stuff we throw at these fed chairs so it's like uh yeah Powell fix the economy uh Powell it's covid you gotta how are you gonna fix that make sure that we don't recession oh and by the way like we want full and uh you we want to decrease unemployment too we want full employment and oh by the way like and and Pal's like oh my God yeah and so he uses the tool that he has but you know um I mean look at look at where we are now with kind of this this this runaway it almost seems like inflation where we've used these tools in the wrong way uh we're clearly not going but I I guess just putting your path into like these are human beings that have been thrown into an institution and they're almost like subject to the wheel of History like what out if your chair Jerome Powell what do you do in this situation you kind of just dealing with the the cards that you have like maybe it's more of a problem with the institution and the process and that we are in kind of the the latter stages of this institution actually working and we need some fundamental changes and less a problem with the individual people at the helm what's your take on this Chris as you've studied it well I I think the take-home headline is exactly that um which is that for for a decade we've been relying on the FED to print our way out of some serious problems and and it's really easy it's really easy to let the FED do this because it just creates money out of thin air it doesn't have to tax anybody uh there's not like some brutal Democratic uh uh contest happening but driving economic growth is not the reason we created a central bank it's not the reason at all we created it to manage the currency in a stable way it was not a jobs program per se you know and it's complicated because if you mess up the currency you have unemployment but Congress was the one that was supposed to do the job of figuring out how to do economic growth and support people in the middle class and all that so yes we're we're we really are at a terminal stage of relying on the central bank to try to solve these problems through money Printing and I think that is the most important point of the book I or my my view of this thing which is of course like I expressed in the book and driven by but yeah that's my view of it but uh I I do want to I I don't want to let these guys off the hook and and women men and women not just guys but like you know when I started this thing I felt I think a lot of what you just expressed which is like I wouldn't have wanted to be the Fed chair in 09 I mean that was scary crazy brutal you know depressions lead to terrible consequences I mean terrible terrible consequences so how can you fault somebody for doing everything they can to try to avoid that okay like I get that but I turned against this institution frankly when I was reporting on what they did in 2012 which was the third round of quantitative easing and this is I called that chapter quantitative Quagmire because it's like they're in this thing they've been doing quantitative easing for two years it's really not working it's and what's so interesting is Jay Powell the current Fed chair joined the institution at this time in 2012 and Jay Powell comes in saying basically honestly he's saying what you guys are doing is crazy because Jay Powell came in from the world of investment banking so he really knew how economics and finance worked and when you read his comments in these meetings in the beginning he's saying you folks are stoking an asset bubble and it's going to crash and you need to stop doing quantitative talking about the same guy right the same Jay Powell Jay Powell same guy what changed and uh-huh trillion dollar question trillion dollar question he's saying all this stuff in 2012 and and at that time the leadership of the FED is saying we need to do this anyway and they're basing their decision to do more quantitative easing on these forecasts that turn out to be totally erroneous and false and and the point I want to make before I talk about Powell is the the the the leadership of the FED didn't shoot straight with the American public they they were not open and honest about the fact that hey what we're doing is experimental we really don't know what the long-term consequences are going to be we're piling up a lot of risk but we feel like we got to do something anyway and and to me that's that kind of turned me against the leadership of this institution and and they continue um to have that like of Candor which does bring us right back to your question about Jay Powell how did he go from being a vehement opponent of this stuff in 2012 and 2013 to be in a huge public supporter of it um I interviewed him in 2012 and he told me quote My Views evolve with the evidence which is probably what you'd want to hear from a Fed chair but it also doesn't tell me a whole lot no and and Okay and like I interviewed his colleague a former Dallas Regional Bank president Richard Fisher who worked really closely with Jay Powell for years and Fisher said on the record which is pretty extraordinary he said there was no new evidence like there was no study that came out when Powell switched to support this stuff no new study said oh quantitative easing does not Stoke asset Bubbles and increase wealth inequality and um really Fisher's conclusion I think is very rational which is that Jay Powell accommodated himself to the leadership culture of the Fed and I mean the group changed he stepped into a circle of people that had engaged in practicing group think and stepped into the but doesn't it just like select for that like if his goal was to actually be the chair at some point you have to conform there's no way you're going to make it to the chair is that is that also true Chris like so does the executive branch appoints the actual Fed chair correct correct the President appoints the Fed chair and then they're approved by this okay so like and that's they're not going to pick someone who is um quantitative tightening um we got to take the hard medicine to swallow they're not going to are they going to pick someone that are bad for their political outcomes right so if I mean if you're trying to get elected you're trying to have an economy that uh is you know going up and to the right then you don't want a Fed chair coming in and spoiling the party do you so doesn't the political machine just sort of Select for people like Powell and if they're not um you know on board with that then they have to get on board or they never rise to that position yes let me say a couple things first is that when when President Biden reappointed Jay Powell to be the Fed chairperson there was this sort of mini competition between Jay Powell and another Governor named layl Brainard and it was like oh who's Biden going to appoint the difference between lale Brainerd and Jay Powell a monetary policy was non-existent they believed the exact same thing and followed the exact same ideology they both were huge supporters of quantitative easing and zero percent interest rates they did differ on Bank regulation to a degree okay that's real but I think your point is accurate and and the second thing that's been in the back of my mind that I haven't brought to the front yet but it's the institutional pressures we talked about the institutional pressure to be seen as like doing something and and and driving economic growth and and uh you know sort of be in the monetary policy hero but listen we need to talk about Wall Street and and you said it's it's unfair to cast these people as evil bankers and you're accurate that's that's true but during the covid crisis when when the fire alarms were going off and everything was burning down in 2020 fed chairman Jay Powell was on the phone with the CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink he was on the phone with this guy 17 times a day or something in that ballpark when the FED did quantitative easing you know the one group of people who were not going to complain were the biggest banks JP Morgan Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo the private Equity firms the hedge funds they all benefited from this because you hinted at income inequality earlier wealth inequality when the FED pumps this money into the banking system the biggest bank's benefit and so there's an Institutional pressure you know when Ben Bernanke is talking about doing these experiments in 2010 and when Jay Powell sort of replicated this whole thing later the big bank's benefit and and that's why the FED keeps stepping in to also stop stock market declines is that it's bailing out large institutions and getting credit for it and being hailed as a hero all day on CNBC so there's really no incentive to stand against uh those why should the why why should this institutional pressure from Banks be there though that that part's not clear to me is like is it just because there's some just friendship and or like nepotism or like in the industry it's right it's very clear to me that there'd be this political pressure on the FED as an institution because they want votes of course they can't get votes unless things are going well with the economy but why is there this banking pressure and House of how significant is it how severe is it from the the very wealthy and the largest banks how much do they actually influence the policy it's not clear to me why that that uh that pressure would even be there to begin with yes let's go back to the very beginning I kind of skipped past this but when the bankers and Senators started this thing the FED at Jekyll Island they said we are not going to displace Wall Street we're going to create our Central Bank to essentially stand behind Wall Street and let's talk about this in a concrete way when the Federal Reserve creates new money it does not create new dollars by making them appear in the checking account of people like Chris Leonard or anything like that the FED creates new dollars under a system created by Congress whereby it creates dollars inside the bank accounts of 24 licensed Banks called primary dealers these banks are JPMorgan Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs go down the list it's all the big Banks they're so-called primary dealers so that means that you know structurally the FED can only intervene in the economy through Wall Street we talked about quantitative easing the FED printed 3.5 trillion dollars the FED created that money by purchasing assets from the primary dealers okay from like JP Morgan uh I've literally I toured the the trading floor at the New York Federal Reserve where this happens so a Trader from the FED will call up JP Morgan and say hey I want to buy eight billion dollars of assets from you like treasury bonds and JPMorgan says okay here you go there's eight billion dollars in treasury bills the FED Trader clicks on the keyboard and boom eight billion dollars just appeared inside JP Morgan's Reserve account that's how the money gets created and so when the FED did QE it it was flooding literally flooding the Wall Street Reserve accounts with with new cash that drives up the price of assets stocks bonds commercial-backed mortgage Securities I'm sorry commercial mortgage uh bonds all those new dollars are chasing these assets which drives up the price of the assets who benefits from that you know the the primary dealers the big Banks the private Equity firms they all benefit tremendously now when the FED tightened as it's doing right now that can create a tremendous crash a downward you know correction and asset prices uh needless to say the the big Banks don't like that they they hate that in fact and so there's a lot of pressure not to do that there's a tremendous amount of pressure not to do that the reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media they

summary of why why does the FED make its decisions uh in support of some people versus others right is like well the bigger Banks they're probably already lobbying in DC anyways so like they already engaged in this Behavior if they can Lobby the Federal Reserve then they will either like explicitly or implicitly same thing with politics like if the president wants something done and he can they can exert some influence on the Federal Reserve then they will do that and while this institution is supposed to be independent you know humans are Folly and so you know who can't Lobby the Federal Reserve like the 99 right the people who are living in their homes right like they can't be bothered because they have to go to work uh and so it ends up being just like all right who are the large institutions that are proximate to the fed the most that uh have things at stake and that probably is politics and the biggest banks uh that's and so like I think not to think like yeah the Federal Reserve it's designed to be this neutral system but you know we've bumped shoulders with our neighbors and who are the fed's neighbors politics and Wall Street so I feel like that that maybe well there's no clear route of uh influence over the FED but I don't think there needs to be a clear one to make to make the claim that the FED is a political institution and if I could follow up on that I think you're exactly right and I I do you know Jay Powell is a very talented political actor politician type guy and you know in 2019 Jay Powell is going on these listening tours and speaking with like middle class people about what do you want out of your central bank and I think like literally like talking to homeless people and stuff like this but like what do we want out of here [Laughter] no inflation let's keep wealth like I mean reasonable inflation let's keep wealth uh inequality like measured I don't know that I'm looking for a lot more but like what what do people say to that well the fed's supposed to be invisible right so if the FED is working it's not supposed to be in people's brains like if if we're thinking about the FED it's it means something's going wrong correct but I you know what's fascinating is you know this Dynamic we talked about about the FED taking on more and more responsibility is like Congress Falls further and further into a kind of morass which has changed a little bit but the demands put upon the FED are actually getting larger uh in the sense that during these listening tours people were saying like we want you to tackle climate change no way absolutely accurate remember Google fed climate change yeah you know and right and and it it's true I want to get to David's point about who can Lobby the fed and who has influence but like yes it's true the fed's actions pump money into a banking system that supports fossil fuels and and so people who care about climate change are like stop doing that um you know you need to we need to fight climate change through the FED stop like but go back to the core thing of what the FED does it creates money by pumping it into Wall Street and so this is my thing David like if if if let's say the FED really really wanted to go in and like renew the dilapidated neighborhoods of Chicago or Cleveland it can only do that by creating money inside the reserve accounts on Wall Street that's the only mechanism the FED has like that's how they influence the world and so by its nature that is uh we're just using the wrong tool for the job here I mean it seems pretty clear yeah totally yeah totally Chris does um does the FED have like an arc to it uh and what I mean by that is like like a story arc right and if if you ask my opinion it kind of feels like we're towards the end of this story but I am a very biased crypto person who's acceptable of banks I'm on a podcast called bankless uh but just like if you're telling me that uh the Federal Reserve has absorbed a lot of responsibility that was previously expressed by Congress uh and they're not going to be able to fulfill that responsibility because again like all they can do is print money or or raise interest rates uh and like in the since covid I feel like the FED has been kind of delegitimized a little bit like we've started to make fun of the FED with a whole money printer go birthing so I'm wondering like where what's the rest of the legacy of the FED like what's the FED like are we where's this Arc going okay so in 2010 to 2012 you know the Fed was praised as this like heroic uh saved economy institution and there was um the head of the European Central Bank was that guy Mario draghi who later became prime minister of Italy and and draghi was famous for this quote in 2012 I think where he said we're going to do whatever it takes to drive economics whatever it takes whatever it takes I think they called it like the Bazooka uh quote like we're gonna take up Zooka to this fight much less noticed was in 2019 Mario draghi publicly said we can't have central banks do this anymore we we've reached the end yeah it's true it's in the New York Times it's in my book draghi is like we've reached the terminal points of central banks being able to drive economic growth like this has to stop and you would think that that would be the end but coveted hits shortly after that and the FED responds by more than doubling the size of its balance sheet during covet the FED printed 300 years worth of money in a few months in 2020. and so we live in this very very strange landscape where in a in a critical way the FED is at the terminal point I think of this theory that uh you know it can it can drive economic growth it could save the day Prosperity through money printing but you know there's this old saying like never bet against the FED I mean who's to say right now the the balance sheet is nine trillion will the balance sheet be 30 trillion in three years because we we experience another financial crisis because of inflation so the FED decides to just respond by massive amounts of money printing I mean it could happen and and so it's it's really hard to predict when this thing hits a wall and it you know it's so interesting where we are right now is it is hitting a wall um price inflation Rising so quickly has forced the FED to tighten money conditions really for the first time since like 2006. and that has started to create massive uh volatility and crashes and financial markets but you see Wall Street is betting that the fed's not going to really tighten even right now like the minute you get an inflation reading that's slightly uh promising uh or that you know inflation is not Rising that quickly everybody just assumes the fed's going to go back to printing money and making everything okay that's what's happening right now in Market and uh so it's just it's it's very very very difficult to predict uh the future on this thing the the um macro folks that we've talked to and had on Bank lists like they look at kind of like um the longer term perspective um they they talk about the next you know set of years number of years in the US being having to be kind of a deleveraging sort of episode where uh real inflation rates are far higher than kind of like actual interest rates and bond prices so essentially the way we get all of that excess debt off the balance sheet is maybe it goes from 9 trillion to maybe it goes to 20 trillion but the money's worth a lot less in real terms at the end of the day less purchasing power so maybe seeing period prolonged periods of higher than we're used to inflation um particularly in in kind of the the real rates I don't know if that's what you see if you have a forecast but um yeah what do you think Powell's going to do from here I mean he was very wrong about that whole transitory inflation thing and as David was saying earlier confidence the FED is pretty shot what does he do at this point in time given given the character of the man that you studied um like honest answer totally unknowable um first of all if anybody had an incline of where this guy is going to go that is the multi-trillion dollar question it really is in August uh at this Symposium in Jackson Hole Wyoming Jay Powell got up and said we are going to tighten uh We're not gonna allow inflation to uh you know push down the value of money and buying power we're gonna actually do what we have to do we're going to tighten we're going to let this D leveraging happen even though it's going to be really painful but we're gonna do it because that's what's necessary to keep the currency strong and after he said that markets fell dramatically you started to see problems even the markets for U.S treasuries uh the corporate debt markets and the corporate junk debt markets right now are just like this teetering teetering structure that everybody's just waiting to fall and if interest rates stay high for long that structure will fall and I can explain that but okay that happened in August and everyone was like okay oh my God this dude's going to tighten this is serious this is going to happen and then in October there's a story in the Wall Street Journal that kind of indicates some of the FED people are talking about maybe not tightening so much and boom markets rise you know three percent everybody's like okay this isn't going to happen what I'm trying to say is nobody knows which path Jay Powell's gonna take I I certainly don't um the picture I have of this guy is of a like a wildly competent fixer kind of guy I mean he's he's rotated his entire career between Wall Street and Washington you know Department of Treasury private Equity he knows how to handle powerful people he knows how to handle the intersection of big government big money um he can try to make things go forward smoothly but he's just in this impossible situation where he either accepts higher inflation which could be really volatile and damaging or is sort of wrenching downturn in asset prices so Chris because uh you've studied this um for so long and you know you've given us such a great lens into into the FED I I want to ask this uh this may be last question for you and just putting the big picture hat on here what do we do with this institution right the FED what do we do with it it's a public institution feels like it's no longer working for the people at least huge elements of it aren't it's failing we can see that in a number of ways maybe most perniciously the massive wealth inequality that we've seen that uh I know we studied in bankless is reverberating across a society right now and across our politics causing a tremendous amount of division no longer working for the people I'm in the sense you've given us today it's kind of reinforced my view that elements of it have become corrupted be corrupted by groupthink may be corrupted by the politics maybe corrupted by Wall Street as well combination of all of the above so what do we do with this institution do we reform it do try to re-establish the boundaries do we have Congress and legislators actually do their job and and step in and take some burden off of this institution do we do we abolish it all together I mean I recall a Libertarian who ran out a campaign of that I mean probably a decade or more ago abolished the Fed so what do we do with the FED right now so that's a that's that's the question um I'm really glad you brought up wealth inequality because that is honestly at the core of why I wrote the book it cannot be overstated how much they have driven the wedge between the richest of the Rich and everybody else it's been stunning and that is one of the most destabilizing factors in American Life today just full stop totally destabilizing so what do we do with this institution I I do think it's been corrupted and it's not corruption in this kind of like easy to understand way of like Goldman Sachs bring in a suitcase full of cash to dinner with Jay Powell it's it's this much broader institutional framework of who who's the fed's actions are benefiting and why it keeps taking these actions again and again in spite of the negative side effects so I really do see first of all you know my job in the system is to be a reporter to read through those internal debates to report what they said who made the decisions why they made the decisions and really to try to just like explain how quantitative easing Works to drive home the message to average readers of like hey they have totally changed the landscape through these experiments and so in that way my job is kind of done like that's what I do but I I don't want to dodge the question what comes next I am not in the school of abolishing the Fed I have a very hard time seeing how we manage things without a a a strong central bank to create and manage a national currency uh for which there's a lot writing on on the US dollar reform reform is critical Democratic oversight and democratic reform are totally critical and you know there are I hate to say this there are a lot of smart people in Washington DC and there are a lot of smart people around this country who care about this and so I'm sure that there's like a Wellspring of good ideas about reform you know the initial vision of the FED to be a decentralized body with checks and balances that had this sort of regional character so you know you had a a Committee Member who lived in San Francisco a Committee Member who lived in Ohio that's a pretty smart way to build a system I I support federalism but it's become highly highly concentrated Powers become concentrated with the chair and with this like culture of consensus and group think and you know 12 to zero votes so what I would say broadly is absolutely reform and Democratic oversight are needed and at the very end of the day the responsibility for this sounds so cheesy but like the responsibility for governing America is in the citizenry that's how we created this whole system like that literally that's what our whole system of government is based on and we can't just keep avoiding that obligation it uh the fiscal Powers the Democratic institutions controlled by voters need to take on that like truly gnarly burden of figuring out how to drive long-term prosperity and we can't rely on the central bank to print money anymore to do it I think you'll uh agree with me Chris if I say that um it seems to be the current trajectory of the FED it's its Legacy is going to be wealth inequality uh when we look back upon the FED like what did the FED do uh well for you know back in 1913 it stabilize the currency and then after that it slowly went from a stability in order into wealth inequality and I think uh the only way and I'm curious like if you think uh the fed the members of the FED will actually admit to that truth or not um but I think if we are talking about moving forward with the fed and like what is the next step for this institution a lot of it comes down if we're going to be like well the citizenry needs to take ownership over this well if that's going to be true it's got to be education uh because I think if you go down to like the average person average throw in America and you'd ask them like hey do you understand the relationship between the Federal Reserve and wealth inequality yeah I mean we're asking him for climate change help and really we should be asking him for wealth inequality help right right yeah but also like the FED seems to kind of intent intentionally create like this super weird jargon that is just so esoteric that doesn't need to be like that uh and and it seems to be kind of like if they use these crazy words like quantitative easing it's it's like uh it's it's not accessible to the 99 because like what what do you mean quantitative easing well oh you're just meaning putting putting money in more bank accounts like well put money in my bank account like if we can start to use words that more people can understand we might actually be able to enable a greater popular part of the populace to do the the Democratic thing that we want them to partake in when it comes to ownership over the FED I wonder if you have any thoughts on this huge huge huge uh first of all before the Fed was created this stuff was debated in the Public Square monetary policy was a retail issue one of the most famous quotes about monetary policy was made by my God I you guys are catching me on a bad day I'm forgetting his name but he said You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold William Jennings Bryan said that I think it was 1906. that was a that was about monetary policy and tightening the money supply this stuff resonated on the ground level and we've got to make it a political issue again in the sense of average people debating the issues that really affect them yes quantitative easing is a term intentionally invented well I guess I can't say intentionally but certainly it it makes it seem like it's this hyper technical obscure realm that normal people without a PhD cannot understand when you talk about printing money inside the bank accounts on Wall Street people understand that and in in terms of the wealth inequality I don't think most of them will admit it but by their own studies and metrics it's undeniable I mean these folks knew that when they kept interest rates at zero and when they pumped all this money to the banking system through quantitative easing it was going to create economic growth by boosting asset prices okay the richest one percent of Americans own 40 of all the assets whereas the bottom half of Americans own only seven percent of the Assets in this country so like they intentionally knew that their process and their their their their their program was going to drive up the wealth of the richest one percent in hopes that it was going to reduce the unemployment rate by like 0.3 percent so they knew what they were doing and yes wealth inequality is the legacy of the modern fed along with ruinous Financial Bubbles and asset Bubbles and financial volatility that's uh I love that statement monetary policy is a retail issue it should be a voter issue and um you know one thing about being in this crypto space is uh if you're in crypto you're certainly getting a monetary policy education in fact for me learning crypto has been the single biggest way I've actually learned how money Works previously didn't think about it why do you need to think about it just kind of works but it is so key it is actually a voter issue and of course uh in one way crypto is a way to cast a vote you're opting out of the existing Financial system that's an interesting movement in and of itself um Chris we're gonna have to end it here I think we could have talked about this but for another hour more at least but I just want to thank you for um providing some real journalism in this space yeah I think a lot of media uh can become almost like a mouthpiece of the fed and sort of like just uh be another way that the Fred the FED property its policy but you've
