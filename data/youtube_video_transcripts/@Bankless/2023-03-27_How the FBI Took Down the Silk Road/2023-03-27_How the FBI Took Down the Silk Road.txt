cyber criminals are opportunistic they're going to find the cracks they're just like water they're going to seek into the lowest cracks and they're going to exploit it for themselves and unfortunately crypto is too ripe with that right these days welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity I'm Ryan Sean Adamson I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys fantastic episode today a former FBI agent Chris Tarbell on the episode we don't often get to see through the eyes of law enforcement but this is our opportunity to do it this is the FBI agent who took down the Silk Road which was the largest crypto seizure ever recorded to date a few things to look out for in this episode number one we start with the story of Ross Albrecht in the Silk Road As Told by Chris the FBI agent who took it all down number two we talk about the Eternal cat and mouse game between cyber criminals and cyber police number three we talk about how to protect yourself from people who want to take your crypto what does a crypto hacker even look like would you no one if you saw them number four what what does Chris actually think about crypto is it good is it bad and number five if the FBI wants your private keys and you don't want to give them up how would they get them we asked these types of questions to Chris on the episode today David what were your thoughts going to this episode Chris it seems is just as far along in the frontier of innovative technology as as most people in the bankless nation and so it's it's really refreshing to get the perspective of someone who's been faced with the crime consequences that new technology brings to the table that crypto's brought to the table as well as being able to like articulate opinions about like tornado cash and ZK technology which is a subject matter that we bring up in the show and so this is really about the frontier of Internet Security and crypto with law enforcement and all the crime surface area that that creates and overall Chris is just a he was a really fun guy to talk to guys got a sense of humor on his uh and also a good head on his shoulders and this is a perspective that we don't usually get to have uh when we interview our guests but what is it like on the other side of the fence and that fence being just like nation state crime and law enforcement so pretty unique perspective and just an overall very fun episode yeah you know what's interesting is I don't think this is an episode for like seeing crypto Through The Eyes of the FBI because this is more than that we have to remember going to this episode Chris Tarbell is an FBI agent he is an individual he's a person he's got a family he's a citizen he has values and so this is not necessarily how the kind of the the nebulous cloud of the FBI sees crypto this is how one individual uh FB a former FBI agent Chris Tarbell sees crypto and I do also think that there will be some controversy about this episode um you know why is bankless talking about the FED Ross Albrecht the Silk Road um they were Heroes early crypto Pioneers they pushed crypto adoption also libertarian values and isn't the War on Drugs bad and all of these things and isn't it unfair for Ross uh to be locked up in jail for as long as as he is locked up David what are your thoughts on those critiques and and that controversy as we go into this episode historically I've definitely found myself in the Russell Brooks is a martyr Camp um although I do understand that there are details and nuances about how Ross came to be arrested that are worth considering there are the ideas and ideas that Ross old Brooks stood for uh and then there were his actions which those two things aren't necessarily the same things but also Chris uh keeps those opinions at arm's lengths uh I'd say and he really stuck to his ground of like I had a job to do there was crime happening and I stopped the crime and really doesn't really have a political opinion about um Russell bricks either way and that really wasn't the subject matter of this episode it was really about the intersection of you know Frontier dissident Technologies and law enforcement uh and so I I think the philosophical questions of like is the Silk Road good does Ross ulbrich deserve to be in jail for two life sentences and 40 years these are adjacent to the topics at hand and not really what we were going after here yeah and let's also remember that Chris doesn't get to decide how long Ross Albrecht stays in jail that that was not his job and if it's not part of his duties that is the legal system in the court system that actually executed on that uh but we'll have lots to talk about during the debrief of course guys our debrief episode is the episode after the episode and David I want to ask you a bit more about that you're kind of the

excited to introduce you to our next guest Chris Tarbell is a former FBI agent who specialized in cyber investigations well at the FBI Chris LED some of the most high profile cyber crime investigations in the world including the arrest of some members of the hacker group lull's sec I think I got that one right as well as the arrest of the founder of the Silk Road which I know all of crypto is familiar with Russ Albrecht and this resulted in the largest seizure of bitcoin's to date ever it was something like 133 K Bitcoins which is worth 4.2 billion dollars as of the time of recording and rarely do we have a Time an opportunity to pick the brain of uh someone who is formerly at the FBI so Chris we're going to do that today welcome to bankless thanks so much for having me you sort of understold me a tad and it was 177 000 Bitcoins once we got the Bitcoins off of Ross's uh laptop too so that was just was it really yeah it was 177 000 in total a little over 177 000. do you ever look at that number and you're like like okay so at the time could you ever imagine that 10 years later this would be worth billions of dollars I mean when you added those 5 000 extra Bitcoin it's like we're getting closer to five billion dollars that uh you seized that day yeah so uh no I would have predicted the the crash of Bitcoins after that um that that was my thing so we had been looking at cryptocurrency for quite some time uh there was a guy in my squad named Ilan yum uh he had brought it to us in late 2010 uh kind of the idea of cryptocurrency and what it was and we started mining just to kind of know what was going on back in our lab the FBI was mining yeah yeah and Tom Kiernan were mining uh you know just a simple PC computer it was you know just chugging away kind of learning things we we have a made a lab in the back of the lab 1A is where we named it and so it uh it sat back there and it chugged away and we learned about Bitcoins and I'm sure it's sitting on a hard drive somewhere on a shelf somewhere right now what did you guys make of uh Bitcoin at the time in cryptocurrency was it I I know obviously at the time it very much had the reputation of like um crypto anarchists probably a little bit and then like drug money was that the impression of the FBI at the time I can't speak for the FBI so I was on a squad called cy2 in New York and so we were kind of on the on the Forefront of hacking and we investigated hacking crimes and all that and so yeah the older guys who had been there for a while and then the younger guys I was pretty fresh with the squad ilwan was there right before me and so you know we wanted to learn about technology and what was going on it wasn't really used in crime too much at that point we weren't seeing it using crime um you know but then you know we did LOL SEC uh they started to take you know they had 500 000 followers on Twitter and they started taking donations um so this was a hacking crew that was you know taking donations through crypto so you know something we had been looking at for a couple years and now we're like wait a sec this seems weird um you know and then came the rise of ransomware um you know really that we've had cryptography fee for a long long time it wasn't until cryptocurrency came along that kind of made you know ransomware what it is today so when you were investigating crypto when was the aha moment if there was was one about just like oh this is going to become a problem for me uh yeah I ran the low sick investigation when we knew bad guys was using it for funding their infrastructure and like how did you imagine that that would go is like oh this is a new frontier of the internet now there's money on the internet like what what did your your brain think of at the time well put yourself in a mindset back in 2011 2012 when we didn't have like chain analysis and these other tracking tools it was a wild wild west I mean this was Cash on the internet and just like you can't trace cash you cannot you could do anything with these I mean it was a whole brand new thing to us that you know we were trying you know it was it was hard at the time wrapping our mind around Tor and how we can't track IPS um you know in cyber crime there's two things you track you know IP addresses and money um and now we had some two things coming together at the same time it was like oh  what are we gonna do um and you know you you adapt yeah and I'll probably ask the bank list listener to put themselves back into the shoes of 2012 2013. when we get our hands on Bitcoins or ether or crypto nowadays we do it through a decently regulated crypto exchange who takes kyc information that wasn't not true back then but the proportionality of people who got their hands on bitcoin via mining via non-identifiable information was much much much higher and so this pseudo-anonymous nature that chain analysis gives us is much more modern going back into 2013 like a Bitcoin transfer there was no way to link that to an identity in the same way that there is today and so I would imagine Chris when you're stumbling upon the inter especially the intersection of Tor which was we're going to be is going to be a reoccurring theme in this podcast along with Bitcoin it probably just looks like a Rat's Nest of unidentifiable illicit transactions on the internet I'm guessing that's how it looks like to you Chris yeah I mean we had to invent our own tools we had to invent our own way of coming up with doing things and our own ideas and how we're going to possibly combat this um you know fast forward to even the bureau after I took down Silk Road and I had that 177 Bitcoins at a thumb drive um you know I brought it back to the office and at the time it was like 200 million or 200 some odd million um and there's a vault inside the office and and it only opens on Tuesdays and Thursdays or when something special happens well I came back on a Friday and I said I've got this 200 million in my pocket what are we going to do with it and they couldn't understand that's a thumb drive it's not 200 million dollars what are you talking about um and so I had to walk around all weekend with that thumb drive in my pocket you know luckily I had a gun at the time too and a machine gun um but wait wait wait when was this so you had two million dollars on a 200 million dollars 200 million dollars on a thumb drive coin this was the Silk Road bust yeah and you were walking around with this on a thumb drive I couldn't do anything with it because we I had to put the Vault so it's a valuable property and so FBI rules I have to put in the vault but the Vault didn't open until Tuesday Morning uh but here's what's crazy though is like um you could have taken that thumb drive and made a copy of that thumb drive before you put it in the vault I mean like are there um I mean all right all right about that eventually yeah well I I suppose so uh but like what are the processes for you you know I'm sure the FBI has all these processes when you uh seize gold bars or like cocaine or something like this or like you know bags full of money but is is the pr did they take this as seriously because a thumb drive at that time just doesn't look like 200 million dollars to anybody and that's the point I couldn't explain to anybody what the hell it was like what are you talking about it's worth 200 million dollars it's not worth 200 million dollars like I was like no it really is um and that's that's the difference like if I walked up with the bricks of cash that Vault would have been opened in the middle of the night on Friday and put it in there but because I couldn't explain it properly to the right people they wouldn't let it just it didn't fit the protocol so cool though Chris isn't that so wild and cool it was cool at the time but it was also nerve-wracking you know I didn't I didn't want to be in charge of 200 million dollars like you know what happens if I break it or something so no protocols there's a free-for-all back then we actually we did the transfer uh so there was a really smart guy named Matt Edmond he's a a a PhD computer science guy he's helped me on all the crypto stuff from the very beginning and we did it in his apartment and we transferred it we started a transfer then we walked across the street and we um we had barbecue all night and then we went back to his apartment and it finished running so you know that that was the time we transferred all the crypto um in uh in chunks of uh 324. well people people now consider the bankless podcast kind of a crypto OG podcast but I think Chris uh you know you were using Bitcoin before probably 98 of the listeners of this podcast for sure so yeah yeah it went Satoshi ilwan yam and then me so that was the order so well so Chris the knowledge that the FBI currently has about Bitcoin and crypto that you were probably the Pinnacle of that as then you were the one who was at being faced with having to learn about this system and you probably pass on that information to the FBI you were like a patient zero for the in the FBI and was as it relates to crypto so I'll say I was the face of it like I had some smart guys ilwan was behind me Matt Edmond was behind me so I was the face of it um but yeah but that that's really kind of the problem with the FBI institutional knowledge doesn't really kind of get passed on too well um I don't know why um it should um that just wasn't Improvement as I was walking out the door of the FBI is that I told them that they you know we really need to make sure that we don't we we don't make the same mistakes we need to learn our lessons uh moving forward and unfortunately that's something that they're not that good at well let's uh rewind for a minute here Chris because we've just gotten in there's so much uh you know juice to squeeze out of this episode we are so excited to talk to you today um but let's rewind to the story that we've been alluding to all along and so we we played this out at some point you get 177 000 correction that time uh worth of bitcoin now worth 4.5 5 billion let's call it but this story starts well before that can you tell us the story of the Silk Road from your perspective and and maybe start at the beginning so how did it pop on your radar so the beginning goes way back so um we did an investigation of anonymous LOL SEC um and I ended up arresting a Sabu the leader of anonymous a guy named Hector montagor and one of the guys during that so we arrested Sabu he was the head of the organization and when was this this was in June of 2011. okay um so this was around the 50 days of Lil sex some of your listeners probably might know about it and it's a long time ago um but so one of the things we let rest of the head guy uh when you arrest the head guy they don't know the people under them normally they get an investigation for like uh Mafia you started a street guy and work your way all up to the head of the organization well we got the head of the organization so what are we going to do we're going to get into oh sorry real quick Chris Wall SEC versus Anonymous for listening are they tied together are they different Anonymous is the collective group lossek was the hacking group with inside Anonymous thank you for the guys with a skill set and to kind of you know a private Channel okay okay so so the muscle behind behind Anonymous at the time um and so we got intelligence from from having Hector there he didn't know anybody like people call him a rat and all that sort of thing he wasn't because he didn't know who people were um but one of the guys that was reaching out to him was a guy named annar chaos and he quickly became our number one cyber Target because he was hacking into all the police departments around the world and releasing very sensitive police information including like addresses and police techniques and you know where where informants lived and that sort of thing but he was using Tor so he was on tour and hiding his identity that way um he stayed on for about six months and we kind of finally figured out who he was after you know he told things he told too much about his life he gave away too much information and we would put the pieces together the guy named Jeremy Hammond in Chicago so we kind of got this tour thing and around that same time after low sick was done we started seeing a lot of cases come up like you know investigated this IP IP came back to tour case close it was happening all the time in FBI investigations anytime an IP comes up in your investigation you go to that that thing you always see in the movies where the they type into the FBI computer and it's got everyone's profile and everyone's FBI record which is not true um and you look kind of it's a kind of true though uh it's in there but if you don't have a reason to look at it which you know I learned don't look up DB Cooper or they're going to call you and say why are you trying to look at the DB Cooper file so uh you look for an IP address that's associated with your case and you know it was always coming up tour around that time so we started thinking we just had some a good success on so on um low SEC let's take a look at um at Tor and what we can do with Tor and uh so like I said we were the hacking Squad in New York the side of the criminals hacking so so we needed to find a Nexus to hacking so we went on tour and we found 26 different sites that offered hacking services or hacking tools hacker for hire um and and Silk Road had going to be number the number six site um and so we added that to the uh a case we called it operation onion peeler um and we opened the case uh it took a lot of explaining to management uh to do this because remember law enforcement is very uh reactive so something happens and we react to it a hack happens and we investigate it this is sort of a more of a proactive like hey bad things are happening and we want to look at a protocol well protocol didn't do anything bad so you can't really investigate it so we needed to find those 26 sites but we knew that Silk Road was sort of the golden ring within onion peeler because you know it that would bring the most Felicity that was the biggest one out there um Senator Schumer was talking about it on the floor of Congress it was in Wired Magazine so we we knew that if we wanted to sort of make a splash and tour that that Silk Road would be the one I don't mean to back us up even further but Chris I think the average image that people have of the FBI or people in jackets with guns that uh show up at people's homes uh but I think what you're familiar with and you're part of the FBI is like the mental model might be like cyber police like you know uh fighting cyber crime like stuff on the internet can you explain like this part of the FBI I don't know if you call it a division or whatnot but just like the Cyber police side of the FBI like this must have Arisen out of just a need to track some of this stuff right just talk about that part of the FBI sure so I mean we're all special agents we all go to Quantico and become FBI agents with guns and badges and the same training we're all doing knuckle push-ups we're all breaking down doors and that sort of thing but during week the Wednesday of week six this is when I I don't know if they change it but then now but you're given orders week and that is when you are given your field office and your career path um so you kind of get to order with the offices you want to go to and your career path and it's rare to get what you want most guys want criminal and they want some place close to home or something like that I picked cyber in New York and I got both of those so I got lucky on that one but everyone throws in 20 bucks and the person that gets the worst office the lowest one day rank gets the pot so they get to take that home so like we all started off as you know trained 21 weeks to the FBI Academy and did shooting guns all the same qualifications but then we kind of break up into our career paths um that doesn't mean much if you end up in a very small office I had uh you know classmates that ended up in let's say Santa Fe they were on the SWAT team as soon as they got there because the older guys don't want to be the SWAT team um I I ended up in New York New York has the most agents so there's resident agencies within the FBI um they're the like the satellite offices the New York office has a satellite office has it already in Brooklyn um if that office was a standalone office it'd be the fifth largest FBI office so just kind of give you a perspective how big the New York office is um so you know I jokingly say a lot of times like when there's a bank robbery in New York they ask well is it right-handed or left-handed because you know there's a left-handed bank robbery Squad and a right-handed bank robbery Squad that's not true but it just shows how specialized we are is so yeah our Squad in New York was very specialized we did criminal cyber intrusions there was a national security cyber intrusion Squad but at the smaller offices you know cyber guys might be doing um you know uh bank robberies they might be doing uh CT so it really depends on you know every FBI there's 56 FBI offices and it's 56 different FBI ways of doing things um so it really depends on the office but yeah we were very specialized only looked at 18 USC 1030 uh cyber intrusions um and you know it really depends on your career on what that looks like okay what is that legal code 18 would you say 18 USC 10 30. it's computer intrusions got it and then so like back to kind of David's question too it's like so there's over 50 FBI offices um you have a specific uh legal code um looking for a kind of intrusions in in computer systems that sort of thing but like you know my impression is the FBI sort of broken up by geography as well and what's interesting about the internet is it's very like not Geographic right so a high level understanding is FBI it deals with um Federal domestic issues right so it's not dealing with National Security issues in the context of another nation-state attacking the us at least that's what I think although maybe there's some some involvement but even the Internet it's like not you know City by city or state by state like the internet is is is everywhere it almost doesn't have geographies so how do you partition that out to a particular part of the FBI so so I'll correct you a little bit the FBI does have a reactionary for State state-sponsored hacking against U.S infrastructure it does yeah the FBI would investigate that so that's the National Security side of the FBI it's sort of two different sides of the house a criminal side the National Security side um so and you were on the criminal side I was on the criminal side so you know the the FBI is investigating anything against the U.S whether it's criminal or nation state just depends on where it comes into and again like I said the smaller field offices they don't have the their cyber intrusion guys are doing National Security and uh criminal intrusions um so it just it really depends on where you are the the way it kind of works with the wild wild west of the internet and how it comes across is you need to pair up with a decent Prosecuting offices office that's why some of the bigger Prosecuting offices like I've seen cases done in smaller field office Mariposa was a botnet a huge botnet that was done out of Hawaii um the k station it was a great guy on in Hawaii but he like the the Prosecuting Office out there they didn't really have prosecutors that could handle a you know a global botnet so he got a prosecutor out of the DC out of headquarters to work on the case which is really a pain in his ass that every time you want to have a conversation with his prosecutor he had to you know wake up early in the morning so he could talk to people in DC and that's really what it boils down to and so it's it's pretty easy in New York in La uh San Francisco has a big cyber office because it just the traffic just has to pass through the server to get jurisdiction um it's you know it's pretty easy and then in the FBI we fly out to a place I can get a search warrant out in San Francisco I just have to go to a judge in San Francisco to get that search warrant if the server is out there um so it's nice being a law enforcement agent that has you know all across the the nation has powers so okay that's helpful well that was a quick side quest I'm sure we'll talk more about the FBI uh a little bit later but uh thanks for let's continue the story of the Silk Road so now it's popped on your radar as maybe this Marketplace for um hackers and it seems to be gaining some steam and so this onion peeler project which I'm guessing you guys code name because like you know to wear onions and you're peeling back okay yes you're smiling so yes and you'd be surprised how much time goes into naming a case yeah well it's a good name okay so you guys are peeling back the onion you discovered this Silk Road thing then what happens um so we started looking into it starting putting things together there's a prosecutor over at the southern district of New York Sarah turner He's sort of headlined in a case with uh with the DEA um and they're trying their traditional way of doing things you know their arrest in dealers they're addressing people having drugs delivered to their house uh and trying to work their way up the chain but people just don't know each other it's not like they're going on a street corner and say I bought the drugs here um and and you know that this is where I got them they're just saying this is the envelope that it came in that's all I know this is the website I went on um and and they so we took sort of more of a cyber approach what could we do to look into you know what what's on the server what's going on the server what what can we find out about this uh this site um you know and then we found out there's a there was a.com so there was an IPS a real site for a forum where they described on how to package your drugs and send your drugs sort of a customer service type approach um so any little crack we could find in the electronic approach uh it was what was the where our investigation was going could you illustrate just the growth of the magnitude of the Silk Road case like it was it a big deal for what you stumbled upon as soon as you stumbled upon it or like how how did the the magnitude of what you were diving into grow over time and what did it take to realize all of that it really took some time going on the site and learning what it was doing what it was moving what you could get um you know they they really was a rule there was only two things you couldn't get and that was uh fake college degrees and guns and and really only the reason you couldn't get guns is because that was on a different site at the time um so you know it it was the scariness of what you could get on there that kind of pushed things up the chain on you know how aggressive we're going to be towards towards getting this site uh versus you know the 25 others that were part of our nuclear we put the same effort into the other ones but well I won't say the same effort it it became very quickly realized that that Silk Road was going to be the main target uh for this entire investigation and just to be clear you found Silk Road because Silk Road was Distributing hacker technology or other tools that also made the FBI's life difficult and and so in an effort to stop all of those other things you found the Silk Road and it's like oh this is like the Nexus of it all is that right I mean we knew about the silk I knew about silicone forehead like you know staying ahead of you know cryptocurrency when it first came out just knowing Technologies you know sort of when you again when you are live in such a small bubble of cyber intrusions you kind of think everybody knows about it you know you you pass people on the street like everybody knows that Silk Road is um but we were living in a world so it had been in wired and we were aware of it um I wasn't totally in in fully engrossed in it until I got on the site and started going around and figuring out what was going on there I think my impression of the Silk Road is is mainly like you know drugs and I'm sure that was a a lot of the volume but there's more than drugs that could be purchased there is that right or can you characterize like what sorts of things could be purchased he said almost anything I guess that's anything aside from guns and University diplomas that one can imagine but was that common or was it just like mostly drugs it was mostly drugs I mean it was but there was I mean there was sections for hackers for hire or other services hackers you know hacking Services um you could buy you know fake IDs really anything that you would think that you'd have to go to like a street corner to buy uh it was there and you could you could ask for things uh you could propose things and someone could connect you to it so um you know I've said in the past you know you could go on there and you could buy like baby parts that's the most extreme I don't think I've ever saw that but it was an example of something that are on some of these black markets uh so what was the what was happening on Silk Road that the FBI really didn't like what was it the drugs like what was the part of Silk Road I know like the whole thing was offensive sure but what was the what was like the the thing that was like okay that has to end yeah um I guess the totality of all the circumstances really there wasn't one thing I mean in order for my squad to take a look at it and my Sac to sign off on us opening the squad it was the hacking tools and hacking for service you know if we could also take out all the drugs on there great big win for everybody but but yeah I mean again the Nexus we were very charged towards the hacking tools and hacking Services okay so you've got this uh online Black Market Marketplace that seems to be doing a lot of volumes getting pretty big published in in wired so more notoriety more visibility more traffic I imagine more Commerce that's happening uh so then what did you do how did you how did we get to that the the seizure of the Bitcoin at the end of the story oh you want to fast forward therefore so no no don't fast forward there take us through it slowly if you will Chris yeah all right so uh you know subpoena search warrant traditional you know investigative techniques um building out a map um you know the the cliche of the you know pictures with red string that goes to each one of them connects it all you know I didn't you guys do that I used a green marker I used a big roll out piece of paper it's in my closet right there I still no way yeah so um I haven't brought that out in a long time but yeah I still uh I still have it so it's a it's a picture connecting all the dots all the I you know because you get lost with IP addresses and dates and times and numbers and you kind of have to connect things together so you know maybe it's a cliche that I took it from Hollywood maybe maybe the FBI never did that I just saw Hollywood doing it I was like well like I gotta do it I got a big case I gotta do it so who knows who knows chicken or egg what came first here um but but so put all that picture together started seeing some patterns um we started monitoring online about you know people talking about things about misconfigurations and that sort of thing uh explored that whole setup and was able to find and locate the server in Iceland flew over to Iceland with uh the prosecutor took Sharon Turner and we met with Icelandic prosecutors and Icelandic police police officers uh and they opened up a parallel investigation uh which makes it a lot easier and faster to do things so now they're investigating Silk Road too um and we're telling them hey it may be sitting here over in kekliovic uh so let's go over the Data Center and see what what can happen so that was that was the next move okay and so you you find the data center where it's happening uh can you bring us to um where where did Ross Albrecht enter the story so we get these we get the server it comes back the copy of it you know the way it's the way the server is configured it was in raid zero um so I don't know if people know where raid zero is so if you're running a server uh it has two hard drives so if one hard drive was to fail your server doesn't fail um but the bad thing for that is all we have to do is pull out one of the hard drives and we have a full copy of it and then plug another one and it makes it own copy of itself um so the bad guy really never knows that anything happened to his server um the way it's configured so yeah probably a bad security move I'm definitely not making a road map for your listeners on how to commit crime but if you're going to run a server don't don't do it with raid zero our listeners don't don't commit crime perfect that is perfect um wooden dream and the other thing is that the server was completely unencrypted another thing you might not want to do if you really yeah it's wide open it was ones and zeros could see everything okay how egregious of a mistake was that that's horrible that's horrible but again I'm not telling how to commit crime but that's an easy one I know that one David okay you know I I talk here and I'll say I'm saying all that but think about back in 2012 2013 how slow tour was add encryption on top of it you know maybe you're not going to get the customer base then maybe that's a business decision that you think you're you're not gonna you're gonna protect it through the internet Innovative tour it's the ux security trade-off right yeah yeah exactly so you know so we get it back but there's a funny story there so the Icelandic Senate to Sarah and sarin walks it over to my office and I I say I'll get to it in a few minutes uh he walks away and I take it back into lab 1A and uh and we plug it in and it's encrypted I can't see I'm like oh  the whole thing's done uh the case closed you know I can't go any further um and so I I screw around with it for a little while Tom Kiernan comes back and helps me with these yeah it's a crypt I can't do anything um so I called Sarah and say yeah he must have encrypted so we got to come up with a new plan new way of going let's let's get a you know a prtt up on it get some traffic analysis see what's going on uh he's like oh they sent a password um the icelandics had encrypted it so if it got lost in the mail people couldn't find it so Saran had forgot to tell me that they put it in a true Crypt volume so uh throw that quick password in there and voila it's wide open everything's there amazing um so from there we were able to find some Network stuff going on um there was a backup server in uh Philadelphia so copies of the server for for since it had started were over in sitting in a guy's data center in like his garage on a computer sit on the ground um and that's well within FBI jurisdiction obviously Philadelphia right but like yeah does it take special permission to go to another government to go to Iceland and crack open a server there we didn't do that Iceland Iceland opened a parallel investigation and then through intelligence they shared a copy of the server with us they had their own case so they got a search warrant for the Icelandic server uh based on information that we provided to them um so yeah so yeah we got a search warrant for Philadelphia which yeah right in the US Territory take it and all that we're good to go so I think if bankless listeners really want to dive down into the fullest story of this there's like there's a Netflix documentary there's an Amazon Prime documentary and so I think we really just want to zero in on some of the focal points here I want to also take a moment to zoom back out and just ask like the timeline of this whole thing like how how long was this investigation because like my next area of inquiry is going to be like how you got to know dread pirate Roberts AKA um uh Ross Albrecht like because I would assume investigating him from afar starts to create some sort of like uh character Arc if you will so like how long was this Silk Road investigation and and like where are we in the story so far with this uh server talk yeah so we opened the case in the winter late or is it 2012. and we're in the story now we're into like late summer of 2013. okay um and so and then when is ultimately Russell Brookshire arrested uh October 2nd or 3rd of 13. okay so this was like roughly a one year Endeavor yeah and so more or less so when we got that Philadelphia server again we had all the backups from everything and so we had every chat log the DPR had been a part of um so from that I got 600 and some odd Pages printed out of DPR conversations so I got to know DPR pretty well um DPR dread pirate Roberts okay that is that is the name that Ross ulbrich gave uh there's actually a funny backstory to that I'm sure you can tell that that story Chris can you talk to us about how the dread private Robert's name came to be um well he had a guy that was working with a guy named variety Jones or Roger Clark who ended up being he was uh in England and he was in Ireland but now that he was in Thailand um he gave him that information to kind of so the story behind Red probably Roberts is it's it's not really a person it's an entity and if someone goes away anyone can be dread pirate Roberts so dread pirate Robert sort of can live forever it comes from the the uh Princess Bride the the movie oh yeah it's classic right and and it's just like a franchise The Dread pirate Roberts right yeah well also it's a name to in in hopefully throw people off of your Trail because if you are you aren't dread pirate robbers dread pirate robbers is an idea so like kind of in a way it's like you know don't chase dread pirate Roberts you're chasing a headless brand even though it's not actually true is that is that right yeah it's sort of the idea behind it yeah it could be anybody at any time um and sort of that that's but it wasn't it was just one guy it was just one guy the whole time yeah so and and I'm assuming that was that fact is relatively obvious from the get-go uh yeah I mean it has you know from the start of the chat logs are the same and it all goes back and he had a diary on his computer and he literally from the time he started to all the way they ran through um not to fast forward too far but uh yeah we got his laptop and it had a diary of all his activity uh on on Silk Road so and it was obvious that dread Pirates Roberts because this was on the public forums dread pirate Roberts referred to himself as dread pirate Roberts the operator of Silk Road correct oh correct yeah and he also many times that I'm the captain of this ship if you don't like the rules get the hell off the ship so that it was he was the leader he was the you know he made all the rules so so like I said before I arrested Hector montsecure and he was Sabu I I I quickly realized Sabu with Ruthless People hated him people were fearful of him he was a mean guy online Hector Montague the the real guy sweetest guy you'll ever know he'll give you his last dollar if you need help and all that so I read the DPR chats knowing that you know like I I had that institutional knowledge that that you know just because you're a Persona online doesn't mean that's who you are um so you know before I wouldn't if I if I didn't have that experience with Sabu that I would have gone and said oh DPR is this guy you know but but it's just an online persona for reference her bankless listeners just to back that up so Chris um you now do a podcast with Hector the guy that you arrested the hacker that you arrested uh his name is uh his code name was Sabu who you said was just an absolute like dick like online is online persona but in real life is like David to me is it like your podcast co-host and somebody that you're uh I partnered with in some way yeah I am a dick online though yeah so on Twitter everyone is okay yeah yeah so am I I mean look ask off the internet but but yeah so there's not many people that have arrested their their podcast co-hosts so it's uh it's an interesting dynamic between the two of us yeah we haven't gotten there in our podcast relationship yet David but but someday you should at least risk it I mean at least my co-host so you know so Chris I want to ask you taking a slight turn uh away from frisking my co-host um uh uh oh my God you're flustered Ross Ross Albrecht in the crypto world uh is considered a martyr by most I'd say um I've met Ross Ross's mom at Bitcoin 2019 in San Francisco she was getting petitions to to free her son from jail from double life in prison I believe double life plus 40 years double life is Plus for a year so like uh can you just like reflect on Ross ulbricht as a martyr for for many not all but many in in the crypto space like do you agree with that does that how does that ring with you I mean I really don't go public with my my have my personal opinions on the whole thing um you know my job was to uh you know bring down Silk Road bring whoever it had to Justice the Justice you know there was 12 jurors that came up with the the verdict there was a judge that came up with the sentencing um I have my own personal feelings but I I don't really go public with what those are so sorry okay all right I think that's fair so you're basically um can we talk about what uh Ross was actually charged with though so what what what are his crimes is it um the operation of this website in general or what what did he get the double lifetime sentences plus 40 years for so it's basically he got a it was a uh one of the biggest charges it was like a drug czar charge kind of like uh it's it's there's certain amounts of each drug that the site met the volume um at least 10 million dollars in sales and having I think three or more employees and maybe four or more employees uh so you know it's a drug czar status is is really what the biggest charge was what was your understanding of the person of Ross Albrecht so um you met him I'm sure you also frisked him but you did you know uh didn't are not now doing a podcast with him of course a different circumstances you would okay well sir tell us about him like you're you're and I think um listeners should know that that Chris is um basically acting as a uh um you know in your duties as an FBI special officer of course a special agent and so um but like what is what is the person like when you met him you said you read his Diaries can you get us in his head why do you think he he created this because part of sort of the the Martyr thing that David was reflecting on is I think there is this um libertarian uh crypto Anarchist type of ideology um that is I I think at the bottom at the base layer of crypto and it's in its most pure forms I think a lot of people would probably disagree with it uh including including me myself but there are elements of it that um are necessary and are helpful and are good and are kind of almost embody the spirit of of the United States and you know self-sovereign individuals pursuing happiness um so what did what where did Ross go off track in your mind and what was the person like so like I said I know DPR the most uh I read all his chats and what he acted online uh I met Ross I spent an afternoon with him uh I had breakfast with him next morning and that's the only time I've ever spent with him um he seemed like from and again I read his his diary and his emails um so you know whatever you can glean from that if you can judge a person based on their writings and spending you know maybe five hours with them um I I I'll say that I don't think that's a fair assessment to tell you guys who he was as a person and what his ideology was uh I do believe he did truly believes in the libertarian way that you should make your own choices about where you uh you know what you ingest in your own body and that in those choices along the line um so I mean that that's really I thought he was a nice guy I thought he was very nice I wish I we could add more conversation um I know he told other agents uh after his arrest that he thought he and I were gonna be like friends um but you know what once he be you know asked for a lawyer there's very few things I could talk to him about um you know illegally so you know we didn't really delve into that too far Chris how come it went a different direction with Sabu versus versus Ross so it's with Ross went to jail right but but so did so did uh Sabu for a period of time did he not did he not go to jail for something like nine months or something but but he was I believe cooperating working with you um to maybe take down other uh targets that the FBI had was that just not an option for for us I'm wondering about the contrast here that you see it was he decided not to I mean so uh so uh we arrested a Ross in a library um I took him outside and set him in a uh like a covert FBI van um that was across the street and we sat there and I showed him his the arrest warrant it was an arrest warrant you know which is very eye-opening to a lot of people to see you know United States government versus uh you know Ross Albrecht AKA DPR AKA dread pirate Roberts um so you know there's a what maybe five six people in the world that knew that Ross Albert was dread Pirates was DPR and so for him to see that that the United States governments now knew it was sort of like that eye-opening uh moment um I let him sit there and kind of reflect on it for five ten minutes and I came back and he asked for a lawyer um and so from that point on I mean until he talks with his lawyer um you know I I can't ask him to cooperate and do all that thing I offered it to him if he wanted to talk to me and all that and he decided to have a lawyer which is is perfectly within his right and I I you know that he he made that choice and anyone that's been arrested you know you get to make that choice whether you want to sit there and talk to the FBI agent that's all that's arrested you or you know your legal rights my understanding of this story and I haven't been um super close to it is that there were other possible charges you know um I I don't know if that these charges were ever um relayed Beyond kind of the the the drug czar charge um it may be some payment for assassination some of this has there is there any substance to that or what can you tell us about that side of things so uh the the dirty side or the the raw side what are you looking for on this one because I would like I would like kind of like both sides so that people should sort of make up their own minds and investigate further sure so there was an investigation out of Baltimore there was a task force put together with DEA Secret Service and HSI that was looking into Silk Road long before our Casey was ever opened um and they were doing Undercovers and doing these other things and they arrested a guy named Curtis Greene uh who was an admin on the site um and part of that arrest of Curtis Greene two agents a serious service agent and an HD agent stole cryptocurrency from the Silk Road um they stole it through Rock through Curtis's access to it which Ross then changed right after that where the cryptocurrency was on a different server um that only he had access to that the other admins it wasn't on the Silk Road server anymore it sat someplace else um but part of that is then the DEA and Secret Service is the whole task force developed a plan to go to talk to Ross that hey Curtis uh is trying to steal from you um we can kill him for you um and so they faked Curtis's murder and Ross paid for that um and then another guy named red and white um out of Canada came through and he was also sort of the strong arm and offered to pay to kill other people um for a DPR that had stolen from him um you know it's sort of the first time the the Ross paid you know yeah I'll say quote paid for these murders he did pay he got pictures uh that the murder had happened again it was fake um and he did pay the cryptocurrency thinking that the murder had happened um the ones in Canada um the guy sent him you know said hey this this kid that stole from you he's got three roommates um we can't kill him without you know with the other roommates around and Ross was like We'll Kill the roommates too so he became more callous as it went on um and he paid for those he thought they happened um really this guy had just tricked him um the the you know into sending the cryptocurrency for payments for hire so there was a total of six murders For Hire they had all been used to trick Ross but you know looking at it from our side of the things um you know Ross paid for murders that he thought had he had happened and ordered and Ross was a very principled individual and he built uh the Silk Road on these certain libertarian principles and one of the reasons I believe uh I think your memory will probably serve you better than mine is that you can't buy like um a doctor's license on the Silk Road because that will potentially do harm to humans and so this idea of Ross paying for assassinations goes against directly against the principles that he espoused as dread pirate Roberts uh publicly on the Silk Road correct uh yeah I mean but I could go any further I mean I'm a parent and you know giving children access to heroin I think could also be harmful but that kind of goes against the libertarian you know mindset the the one what I know of libertarian I mean certainly somebody in your audience could correct me I might be wrong that there is a principle that says children shouldn't be able to ingest anything they want but uh you know the general you know scope of things I I you know heroin straight off the block out of Afghanistan can be pretty powerful stuff um so yeah we did I would definitely invite um listeners to to go do some more reading about that and um so these uh these charges that the uh murders for higher charges were not actually brought uh in a court system that that's not why Ross is in jail uh but nonetheless there is kind of evidence of this that um that people can go research is that is that correct Chris sure yeah I mean the murders were higher were right in his diary uh they were on a file and controlled by him by a password that he didn't share with us or anything like that so I mean um he proclaimed at trial that his uh computer had been hacked into and files were placed there um there I didn't find any evidence to any of that um and so we arrested him with his unlocked computer and his fingers on the keyboard at the time so it was a computer in his control and there was a diary that discussed all of these murders so Chris where was the Bitcoin when all of this was happening so there was some sort of Vault is the way the Silk Road worked that they just took a transaction fee for for a purchase like that was at the business model and they they took it in Bitcoin and so Bitcoin was accruing in some Vault somewhere tell us about where the Bitcoin was this whole time and and how the F but FBI you guys actually seized it um so the Bitcoin was sitting in another server in Iceland um and uh elwan yum the guy who taught me about Bitcoins Matt Edmund and another agent named Pat Hoffman they all went to Iceland so the Silk Road uh arrests or takedown was a three-pronged approach uh arrest Ross Albrecht the DPR um put a splash screen up where the onions for the onion site to show that you know we had access to it and all that and then sees all the cryptocurrency um those guys in Iceland they did a great job they timed it perfectly um and they had two of the prongs they had to the they got the the crypto all moved over to a to an FBI controlled wallet and they were able to put up the splash screen um that was hosted at a data center in the United States it may still be there if you go to the original Silk Road onion site the splash screen still may come up I'm not sure I'm not going to want to get on that I don't want to get on a list there Chris 100 it's not a list I know exactly where it is but I'm gonna say that probably no one's paying that bill anymore I'm sure that that that that uh that server is it isn't being run anymore okay so that's how you required the the Bitcoin and then there was that that was the bulk of it that was maybe the 173k worth and then there was five thousand no so there was that was like 130 something and then there was another 29 and some change on Ross's laptop but just sitting on his laptop kind of unencrypted no encrypted he was all encrypted uh everything was uh protected and all that um the problem is is he would copy and paste his password uh and so the password Tom Kieran found the password in his bash history um and so it was pretty easy to get past this encrypted is encryption so he didn't have to give you any of his private keys in order to to seize that Bitcoin you basically could derive them yourselves yep well importantly a part of the operation for arresting Ross involved seizing the computer in its unlocked State correct correct that was the when I gave the execute command to arrest him I said let him run if you want just get the laptop like we we had a plan that of getting a laptop we had said he did was running the Silk Road you know his drug Empire from a table in the the library and we had put an undercover FBI agent a female agent sitting at the table across from him reading a magazine right and so the important point was that actually you were after the laptop more than you were the human if if Ross ran you just you know tomorrow but you but you can't get the laptop in its unencrypted state and so it was about seizing the laptop while he was logged into it live right yeah correct that was the hard part well yeah when we arrested Jeremy Hammond I mentioned that case like he closed his laptop and locked it up even though we had him in a communication talking uh we sent a SWAT team into his house and as the SWAT team going in um to the left was a bunch of kids smoking pot in the family room so that's kind of where the SWAT team went the last two SWAT guys through the door watched Jeremy close the laptop it was encrypted so it took us quite a long time to to get that laptop open neat uh Chris one of the after effects of this uh taking down of the Silk Road uh was that ten hundred thousand carbon copies of it just like cropped up in its place uh and and so I remember hearing a quote from you on a different podcast saying like we gave them the Playbook yeah the Playbook of combining Bitcoin with Tor uh what was what was your reaction to this to this after this result after the fact well I mean so after the first arrest the first wave of Black Market websites was I don't know if you guys remember I don't even know how old you guys were at that time I mean the first ones that came around was this like a place called Sheep Marketplace um and really all that was was to steal crypto um they put up this Marketplace and you put your money in escrow and all that and the guy ran off and stole all the crypto so that was sort of the first wave after Silk Road because Silk Road now's in the news and people are like oh  I can go on to tour yeah and I can get crypto and I can buy whatever the hell I want I'm gonna do this so these guys set up these fake marketplaces is and then nothing um and then after that sort of came the wave of alpha bays and sort of the you know the sights and it just grew I would have never thought that if uh if someone was sentenced to two life sentences plus 40 years that someone would have the balls enough to start another one of these um but people have I mean again the guy running Alpha Bay he ended up hanging himself in a in a foreign jail um after he got arrested so but they're still out there there's still tons of them out there I'm not gonna tell you where they are the names of them because I don't want people to go in there um but but they're not hard to find yeah how has just cyber police and cyber crime how is how is like the efforts of the FBI have to had to adapt as a result of this I mean there's a cryptocurrency uh Department within the Department of Justice um on young Choi runs that that out of their DC I mean that that would be unheard of I mean again I went from carrying around 200 million dollars in crypto in my pocket because people didn't know what the hell I was talking about to now there's a whole division within the Department of Justice Just For that um so I mean talk about the change in the last 10 years it's been it's been insane uniswap

we cover the news in crypto and throughout 2022 it was like Bridge back after exploit after like vulnerability and hundreds and hundreds hundreds of dollars falling into hackers D like a decent number of time that would be like North Korea et cetera and so like Ryan I was talking to Ryan's like at some point we just need cyber police we need police to be going after these bad guys in these internet Landscapes is that what the FBI is like who are the Cyber police is that is that the job of the SBI I I think the FBI is doing a good job uh the IRS the the criminal investigation division they're doing a good job but you know they kind of a motivation behind wanting to do a good job you know taxation you know they said they want you know the piece of it and all that um you know HSI is doing a great job in this space in dark markets and all that what's HSI uh Homeland Security okay uh sorry yeah so they're part of the Holy their Homeland Security investigators is the they're the the 1811s in 1811 this is a special agent is the code in the government for special agents um but but yeah I mean so you you mentioned hackers though I mean there's a lot of you look in the crypto space in the end of 2022 there's a lot of you know let's call it Market manipulation um there's a lot of Old Stock things that are happening you know the way people used to trick people with stocks and that sort of thing happening from like the 80s and 90s um I think the crypto space could use some of those uh you know some Wall Street police too uh I'm not saying bring in Regulators uh I'm not I'm not always pro-regulation but you know the same things that we already had you know in stock manipulations are now happening in the crypto space so you know Lessons Learned that's why I say I mean even the FBI we talked about early on institutional knowledge is lost um yeah we need to bring some of that institutional Knowledge from Wall Street over into the crypto space um but again I'm not saying like the SEC or some Regulators stepping in is the answer um but you know at least to come back you know the good guys need to combat the bad guys in this one certainly and I don't I hope bankless listeners don't think that we are just like this these naive like uber optimists about crypto after this 2022 crash and especially after FTX the FTX exchange uh insolvency I went down the uh 1929 stock market uh crash rabbit hole and like the comparisons is like oh these are these are the same events and like we're doing the same thing over and over and over again but Chris I want to get your perspective um when you uh early in your FBI days you see the combination of Tor and Bitcoin and that was probably like uh uh oh like that's uh complex and hairy when you look at the world of crypto when I look at the world of crypto I am like a crypto Optimist right I see a bunch of bright future ahead I see the world of self-sovereign finance of uh permissionless be your own bank I see good stuff I see I'm optimistic about crypto when you look at crypto like what do you see all the bad sides uh unfortunately do you really yeah because the world I live in I mean we get I mean so I I started a cyber security company called nexo and we do a lot of like crypto recovery and uh crypto fraud I mean we are being contacted you know 10 15 times a day of people being defrauded out of their crypto and it's it's easy fraud it's you know computer takeovers oh I allowed them to enter my screen and I allowed I gave them permission so it's not the complex stuff that we're seeing it's the low low end the low-hanging fruit um you know people losing their retirements um I'm seeing all that and it's really kind of sad to me because I mean I like crypto I'm a technologist I I like things moving forward I want to see us come up with new things new inventive things and all that um but you know I'm faced with victims every single day and it makes me sad because you know cyber criminals are opportunistic they're going to find the cracks they're just like water they're going to seek into the lowest cracks and they're going to exploit it for themselves and unfortunately crypto is too ripe with that right these days why why does crypto give more surface area to that is it because it's it's digital it's is because you know um bags full of briefcases full of money are just hard to transport you have to be there you know physically is it because there's more surface area for attack why do you think this is um uh the case with crypto is that people not protecting their their private keys people not understanding the technology there's a lot of that people to get into it um think about when we talk about ransomware I mean we've had cryptography for 75 years but now you know when I locked up somebody's computer and information in the past they'd have to give me a big Briefcase full of money and then I have to go pick that up physically now with crypto I don't have to do that anymore so there's that attack Vector um you know it's just and now it's valuable like let's say I'm a hacker in the 90s I hack into something I take some information and I sell it that that takes a couple different people I need to know who to sell it I need to know where to go to doing all that with crypto if I just steal that which is the same as stealing an electronic file or someone's information it's just sealing ones and zeros that's much easier to move I don't have to go through a middleman I don't have to you know only take 40 of it if I steal it I got 100 of it you know as long as you know someone's not tracing it and I you know don't try to use an exchange in the US or something along those lines um but you know it's you know also having all this stolen crypto you you know nowadays it's kind of tough it's getting harder at least they're making it much harder for you to be you know a crypto Thief millionaire yeah that what's so interesting about um about crypto and why we wanted to have your perspective on because your lens is just you know a former FBI and the FBI is is the agency people call once when they get hacked when when their Bridge gets stolen from hundreds of millions of dollars who are they calling they're not going to go Trace down the funds themselves they're literally calling the FBI uh and you yourself you you work in insecurity and you can see all of the ways that that crypto has allowed surface area for hackers and criminals and and thiefs and scammers to actually exploit people and so you're seeing that side of things um you know what what David and I see with with bank list what many in the crypto Community uh see is like the the freedom uh self-sovereign good side of crypto you know not quite the Utopia because we need the those that are going to help protect our security and those that will you know go chase after the criminals and prosecute them but at some level we don't necessarily have to deal with the consequences of that do you know and so I part of the reason we wanted to deal uh get into this episode content with You Chris is to sort of help us break outside of our bubble a little bit you know in that like hey these are private keys that actually have to be secured by individuals and if you live in a a country where you can't trust your physical security and bankless is over here telling you to be your own bank but somebody can like find you using your on-chain data and um break into your apartment and beat you with a wrench until you give up your private Keys it's not too fun being your own bank and you sure would like to have some sort of nation-state level local governmental security some sort of force to protect against that and you know this is the origination of of governments in the first place like they carry a bigger stick than the bad guys and sometimes I think the crypto utopians us included maybe I'll throw us under the bus in in this episode we forget that we're like be your own bank uh don't worry about the bad guys and I think you're coming at it probably from a perspective of that's all you see you are the person receiving the call uh about some bad guy taking taking off with with the crypto um I'm wondering if you could just kind of reflect on that and maybe help us bust out of uh our our crypto utopian bubble a little bit and paint that reality for us well I mean it seems like you're not going to this very be not very naive you understand that you know something can be beaten to death or beaten close you don't want to beat him to death because if you've been in death and you're not getting their private keys but you want to beat them close to death or at least a loved one and let them watch um but this is dark yeah and that's that's unfortunately that's the world I live in you know you know I talk about Insider threats and all that and I I tell people that you know the biggest Insider threat is your kids um because you're letting them on your network uh they're inside your house already um so you know as a parent that's a dark thing for me to think about and say but that's the word I live in and I can see where like local cops become you know a little bit you know calloused over because you're only seeing the bad side of things you're only being called out to someone's house when they're in their lowest moments um and that's sort of the way I am with crypto I mean I'm not you know it is nice I will say once in a while we'll find somebody's crypto or we'll we'll unlock their crypto for them um or we'll get a piece of it back and it's that is is a very good feeling to the the you know these these people are getting part of their their retirement savings back or um you know their life savings back on in some cases um but there's a dark world where like you said people are trying to Target you all the time even if you just have a computer and then internet internet you're trying to be targeted because they want to use your computer as a hot point to the next attack so when the FBI investigates the attack it comes back to you um so you know yeah you like you say if you advertise that you have crypto and that you're storing your passwords and people don't a lot of people in crypto the lower level people in crypto don't understand the importance of those private keys or those seed phrases they don't understand how much the just possessing of those means that you own the Bitcoin um you can't go back and call somebody and say you know what you know get the money transfer back you know oh the money went to a bank in in London we need to get that money back and it's gone once those seed phrases are gone and so a lot of people don't understand that unfortunate and that's what I deal with on a daily basis Chris is uh the immutable and also traceable nature of crypto has that um been a made your life or the FBI's life more difficult or is the actual traceable nature of Bitcoin uh property that the FBI has been able to leverage more than it has been uh something that's made their life more difficult I think it's getting better I think it was very very difficult to start and it's become better um you know some of the tools um but the problem is a lot of people are now becoming very uh tool-centric uh you know it kind of goes the way with a computer forensic went back in the late 2000 or the early 2000s where you know people had to know exactly how computers work to understand how to investigate computers uh and then everything went to push button um we're kind of going to push to go ahead and rely on these tools and not understanding how crypto Works um and that's that's sort of my fear with some of the the crypto investigators these days um too much reliant on the tools and not knowing exactly how it works and so let's say we go to a coin that's not on one of the tools and you know you're jumping chains um you know you're kind of screwed then if you don't understand how it works and you don't understand how you know how the laundering is happening Chris uh you know for my part I actually appreciate a little bit of this cat and mouse game you know and that there is a cat and there is a mouse and um that the cats aren't completely in charge of things that is sort of the the dark world that um that we see kind of the crypto Community sees if we move to a world of a whole bunch of Central Bank digital currencies that are implemented by the nation state and tied into maybe a credit system that um you access to your funds property can be seized for a political dissent tweet on on Twitter that is a very very dark world and I feel like humanity is marching into it with the Advent of everything's becoming digital we have many of these freedoms preserved in in the analog world but as we're marching into the digital they're kind of slowly uh eroded away right we just talked about some cash and there's a commentary open the crypto community that if they if Congress tried to vote on the idea of cash money today it would never pass what you're talking about like money that is completely peer-to-peer it can't be traced we have no like this could be in the hands of of pedophiles and terrorists and criminals all of these bad people and yet and yet for some reason Chris and I know you're an American Patriot because I've heard you talk about it before and yet this is very calm that this is very core to the idea of um freedom in America and in the Constitution and embodied in our Bill of Rights uh I'm wondering if you might be able to because I sort of gave the Steel Man case for your position on crypto or maybe the FBI's position on crypto or Security Experts person uh position on crypto which is that man this is such a hassle it's like it's harder to track down the bad guys but can you Steel Man the crypto case have you ever thought about that um I really haven't put too much thought into it but to be honest with you you know I I'm fairly in line with you um you know from my personal feelings that you know just because I say the wrong thing or I say what isn't the popular opinion you know I can lose my job uh the next the next stage is I can my money can be seeds I I won't have access because my bank account is Frozen uh that's a scary thought that's a scary scary thought that I can't you know feed my family or do anything because I said the wrong thing and we are going towards that that sort of path and that you know scares the out of me um and so the idea of having being in my own bank and controlling my own crypto and having a network of people that's willing to trade with me you know the crypto Community uh goods and services for that well what you know what what we value as you know uh whether a Bitcoin or any sort of cryptocurrency um is nice um and the government I think is going to push back on that because you know the how does the government you know how do they do things taxation uh they haven't quite figured out a great way of taxing these trades if you do something for me and I pay you in crypto well you're supposed to owe the governments a portion of that how do they figure out how what that portion looks like what does it do you know we're starting to see that with like saying like oh all of our tracks transactions on on venmo uh you know I think we saw it last year yeah your vet you're sucking anything over 600 venmo is going to notify the IRS and all that so um it to me it boils down to taxation um so if if they can't tax it they're scared of it Chris are you familiar with tornado cash yeah yeah uh how do you feel about uh technology tornado cash as a technology it's scary man um I've always said and I don't think this is the case I don't know but if I was to run an undercover operation the first thing I'd want to do is have the US government say uh don't use this it's too bad uh because you're giving credibility to all the criminals going there um so that's exactly my playbook if I was running an undercover crypto sting is to have the US government say man don't go here this is way too bad um but I don't know that's my personal opinions on it uh but you don't have any sort of like philosophical like oh yeah this should be a legal piece of technology you don't have any like opinions of that nature I mean I can tell you like like I'll I'll take a little let me be a politician for a second you know there are people out there that rent their children they literally take you know six months olds I've seen it of which cases in the FBI six months a year old and you you can rent them to people um do we want to have a thing a place where I can't trace who those people are that's the worst thing I can think of I can't think of anything worse than someone renting out their child's body for sexual gratification to other people that that's disgusting it's it's beyond belief and tornado cash can Aid in her bed in them getting away with that I mean again I'm picking the worst possible scenario uh and throwing it at you and that's what politicians do with this sort of thing um but but you know I understand privacy I understand uh anonymity um I I strive for it myself you know I you know will buy things in an LLC that sound traceable back to me uh in order to have you know some privacy and that sort of thing um so I see both sides um I I want the anonymity for myself uh but it scares me when other people have it I guess you know just like anybody else sort of a hypocrite that sort of fashion yeah yeah I mean I would imagine that like you know the internet facilitates a bunch of bad activity and you're not a fan of banning the internet of course so I guess it all boils down to just like facts and circumstances and the nature of who's using what and perhaps if only five percent of people are using it for privacy and 95 of people are using it for bad things then perhaps it's justifiable that we deem this thing to be illegal yeah I mean yeah exactly I mean I couldn't say it better than that speaking of which uh We've read the chain analysis report that just came out uh last week I believe and they report that point three percent of all crypto transactions are quote unquote illicit uh it's just quite a low number considering I have to imagine like physical cash is a lot higher than 0.3 percent do you have any thoughts on this um so I didn't read it is it point three percent of all transactions or of all value [Music] the FBI just took down Hive And Hive they they literally can trace a hundred million dollars in crypto being sent to high of the ransomware group um in the last year can you tell us about that story so what what is the hive story so Hive is a ransomware group uh that would uh break into started breaking in I think it was like October of 21 they started um and and ransomware for your listeners that don't know ransomware is simply you break in and encrypt people's files and then demand a payment in order to unlock them um we've done pretty well I say we the side of pursue Community done pretty well uh with that in in an easy way to defeat that is just have good backups um and if you could just restore your system from the night before whatever you lost um but now so now these guys are also doing data exiltration um so they'll lock up your information then they'll take your information and if you don't pay they'll embarrass you by publishing that information online uh And Hive was one of these groups the the FBI are working with the Germans and the the guy the Dutch who made the Dutch cyber cops you do not want to mess with them those guys are good they have some skill sets um they were able to find where these guys were located and on their private servers um using legal process in those countries they broke into the computers uh took the private keys and then shared the private keys for the encryption um with uh I think it was 1500 different companies uh in order to unlock their data uh and that is only so the FBI found um I think they found 1500 companies that had been affected by Hive and only 20 percent actually replied back to them so most of these companies that were that were facing ransomware would not even reply back to the FBI but they had found that Hive had received over 100 million dollars in crypto payments for these this ransomware attacks in the last two years so so what is Hive and like what is the profile of a hacker uh so Hive is probably a group it's a collective of people um that are working together um you know they're they're essentially a hacking crew um just like we talked about low SEC it's it's certain guys have certain skill sets uh and and they can you know I'm sure there's some crypto guys in there um there's some guys that can uh find o days uh and find the systems running the O days and then they get in and they spread the malware mostly through a phishing campaign uh if they can't get in themselves are these like um I mean there's the Hollywood betrayal of a hacker um Elizabeth Warren likes to call people in crypto shadowy super coders right so there's that you know black hood of course over your head and you're just you know on a keyboard uh is that what a hacker actually looks like and no okay what's what's the profile of a hacker which there is no profile of a hacker if I was to tell you I one time said something at a corporate event or something somebody got very upset that uh uh if someone on the internet tells you uh they're a female they're really a cop um so I've learned my lesson to uh to to not say that because I they came up and said uh said you know there's a lot of good female hackers out there and they really are I've met a lot of good female hackers um and actually they may be better because I I've never arrested a female I never caught a female hacker so they got away with it exactly exactly they're so good they stay they stay free so I've learned my lesson there is no profile of a hacker it could be anybody there's a lot of hackers that have professional careers um they're you know they do their thing and then at night they sit around and they hack into things I I knew an FBI agent probably one of the best hackers I ever knew when he was a kid he was a really good hacker and now he's an FBI agent but I'll never say his name yeah I'm sure there's always this fork in the road it's like oh I'm really good at hacking into systems do I do this for evil that's what they call a black hat light hacker right yeah yeah and then there's gray hats the ones that kind of walk that last line mm-hmm uh Chris is this the modern Frontier of online cyber crime like ransomware or like what what's the current new thing if it's not online drug marketplaces uh not to say that that's been solved but like what's the new frontier of cyber crime and the Cyber police like where if we're if this is a cat and mouse game where where's the end of this game so I think ransomware is the sort of the last couple years uh now it's going back into dadal exfiltration um recently on our podcast hacker in the FED Hector says that 2023 he's predicting it would be the in the year of The Insider threat um uh and he's saying that because look at all the tech layoffs you can have a lot of people with a lot of skill sets that are pissed off that they just lost their job um and so we're already starting to see some we we just talked about a story of Credit Suisse had an Insider who released all their information just last week um and so we're kind of tracking to see what it is but he's saying it's going to be the uh The Insider threat is is going to be the big thing this year the idea being just like Specialists are no longer beholden to the organization that they are have specialized in and now they have other incentives to apply their skills towards and perhaps those incentives are nefarious I think that's the idea sick that's uh Peak drama I will say um how about uh nation-state actors so we mentioned the some of the massive hacks that happened in crypto this year um here's a headline uh from CNBC this is North Korea linked hacker was to say North Korea linked hackers behind the 100 million dollar crypto Heist as FBI says this is um the Lazarus Group which I believe is is kind of the code name so yeah nation state level actors making a lot of money from this um there's reports that North Korea made hundreds of millions of dollars last year from from crypto like how do these enter the the the the the story nation-state actors and like whose jurisdiction is this is this FBI or is this Beyond FBI is this now National Security well FBI does not some National Security um remember that so but yeah I mean we're going to have to put together you know it's gonna have to be sanctions in order for them to not get the paid out of the crypto like where are they cash in their crypto where they you know who they who are they trading for goods for crypto I mean I guess China I mean we can't really tell China what not not to do not to accept the crypto I think China's kind of against crypto these days I don't really know what publicly I think they're kind of wishy-washy back and forth uh themselves so um you know this is a global problem that we're going to have to lock down if uh you know and North Korea is good about it they're they're connected to a lot of different schemes um that involve crypto stealing or crypto payments we uh we had thought about this like if so if you're in the FBI issues or some National Defense uh you know National Security Agency issues and you're seeing all of these hacks happen you're probably asking your questions not only how do I you know stop stop it via sanction on the other side but how do I even prevent it from happening how do we be proactive about this and I'm wondering if there's ever been any effort to like actually audit code in some of these smart contracts for instance that are housing hundreds of millions of dollars and pointing out security flaws to uh you know projects before they get hacked is there any ability for law enforcement to actually you know kind of Step into the defense perimeter side or is that completely left up to private individuals and projects private individuals law enforcement okay they can't go in can't you know it's reactionary something bad has to happen and then an investigation you can't preliminarily go in there uh but yeah we're finding it even at naxo the the none of these guys so they're coming to us and asking us maybe what does it look like what does it cost to do a Security review and they're not really wanting to do it because it is it's costly I mean it it takes a little bit of money uh to secure yourself um but you know we're pushing people towards this that you need to get a security person in here to review it um you need someone from like a Wall Street background to see whether it fits in some some sort of the frauds you know look for fraud investigation from old Wall Street scams um so a technical review and a manipulation review is what we're prescribing for some of this stuff and unfortunately you know law enforcement can't do it until that manipulation or that hack has already happened just the nature of of the way the system's set up what are some of the big honey pots for hackers these days is it all information or now that there's crypto it must be not just information and kind of secrets that are out there but also like there's literally money on the internet that you can go and steal and it's vaulted somewhere like you think about a coinbase and how many you know hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars it holds inside of a vault what are the big honey pots and targets for hackers these these days well in our world Honeypot means something different Honeypot is like a trap fake traps on the internet for the hackers to go into but um why go after coinbase coinbase has probably spent a lot of money securing their stuff and all that why can't why not go after Mom and Pop that I can trick them into clicking on a link and then I have full access to their seed phrases I mean there's a there's a 200 000 hit I mean that's really where they're going is the the low-hanging fruit the people do not understand security and can click on something you know it's great if I could get into coinbase I'm sure I could ask just a lot of things but there's no need to there's a lot of money out there just sitting around on the end users can you uh talk about that then um how do end users protect themselves there's a lot of people listening obviously we're all you know citizens of the internet right now we all use the internet and um you know there there are lots of places where that can be unsafe but we have a lot of listeners that do hold their own private keys in some way um do you have any thoughts for them on how to protect themselves sure first they have to understand that they are a target a lot of people don't think they they're they're a Target or could be a Target um you know I I know there was a recent court filing of so there's a lot of you know crypto stuff going defunct and there's some court filings um that probably shouldn't go public that include like addresses and names of people connected to that well those people now are being targeted with phishing scams and that sort of thing just to understand and have a heightened awareness that maybe your name somewhere you bought crypto somewhere and your name was leaked from a third-party vendor that that you didn't want to so people don't know how's that work Chris does that do hackers have like the same thing that uh the FBI has some sort of like um profile on individual people like is is David's name my name somewhere in a database a hackers database with a whole bunch of my stats things that they know maybe my social security number date of birth all of these things how does that work one thousand percent you're sitting in a database somewhere um so yeah this is sold on the black market information about you databases are expanded databases you know uh are built just like Google's building a database about you Apple's building a database about you criminals are building a database about you they are keeping every information they can about you uh in order to maybe exploit it in the future anything that's broken into hashed passwords uh lists of your passwords that this you know data aggregation is huge it's been huge for years um you know everyone's selling it and selling that information you know selling bulk information so Chris um since starting the bankless podcast and becoming a very very public crypto person uh I have lived in three different cities uh and so my address has changed my IP address has changed the computer that I used has changed I've built my computer from scratch how much of my data am I able to like jettison with this sort of activity this sort of behavior and how much of that data is just doesn't matter it's just about me who I am I mean do you pay an electric bill at all three of these addresses I I have previously yeah yeah so your your stuff's out there I mean oh yeah but I don't really care about my own um you don't but what about like those questions that your credit report or something like uh list your last three addresses you know the ones that verify you like Equifax um that information your mother's maiden name pretty popular your dog's first name you know um that's one thing I never answer those questions truthfully um like uh like never answer those security questions as as truth come up with something different that someone wouldn't know um as a joke I know like I one of my questions on one time one uh this isn't use anymore um it was like where'd you get your first kiss and I said like on my grandpa's lap it was a joke but I figured no one would ever guess that I'm reminded of I can't I can't remember her name even if you guys remember her name is uh Dick Cheney's running mate uh for president the presidency she was like hack her email was hacked uh because of like Cheney the uh he never got elect he never got obviously uh John McCain yes she was hacked because like all of her security questions were like stuff you could Google is like what's what's your mom's last name what's your dog's first name like all of this stuff was available that she just posted on the internet like oh my dog Rover uh it turns out that's like her password uh and so like I always think that's a that's a funny story yeah so every time your site is hacked into that you put a password into your username is most likely either the beginning of your email or your entire email um those passwords are all collected into a database and they start to find patterns of how you make passwords um um you know if you whatever you do lead speak or do you add some sort of ending to it or anything like that like your pattern making is now being sold on the internet of how you design your passwords so hackers have this data repository let's say they have a a brief on David they have a profile and David that they building they might know his address they might know um you know different Social Security is his date of birth his you know password style all of these things then what do they do do they sort of then prioritize their targets based on um lowest hanging fruit or highest value Target and are they specifically going after like an individual in the in this case would they be going after David or do they just go after like cohorts of tens of thousands of different people that that fits specific filter criteria I mean one of the things they might do is go after if they find out your listeners who are your listeners they all registered with an email account there's an attack because most likely those people have cryptocurrency or associated with cryptocurrency there's an attack Vector why go after people if you're looking for crypto why go after people that have no interest or no knowledge of crypto so that little insight gives them information um that oh these people are interested in crypto they listen to it maybe they have some I'll send my phishing emails with them um you know I'll specifically Target them uh to click on something they'll maybe send some sort of message that looks like it's coming from David oh hey you won something from the podcast I know you're a listener they'll be like oh how'd they know it must be David because nobody else would know that I'm a I'm a bankless listener um you know maybe it's apple and David they're the only two people that know and so they'll they'll fine-tune their attack that sort of way again not a roadmap have to commit crime here uh but that's one way they do it bankless listeners fun fact Ryan will know this if you ever get an email from me I don't even check my my email so you're not getting an email from me yeah one time I got an email from David and uh it was definitely a scam so uh yeah he was trying to Frisk you so I I mean so I I guess some some advice from this is look a lot of people in crypto listening to this have had their data leaked before um you know Ledger do you know the hardware wallet Ledger have you ever seen those like the the modern version of your USB key type of thing their entire database was breached a couple years ago names addresses all sorts of information about people who purchased Ledger wallets right not a good thing to have leaked and so people in crypto are they get text messages all the time they get emails all the time and I guess the best advice is like do not click the thing like be very careful to make sure that um the person on the other side of that message is the person you think it is take a few more seconds to like double check and then triple check that particular correspondence is that good general advice Chris are we onto something yeah at least hover over the link and see if the link matches what's there um you know give you a little preview and if you got any email from Ledger then maybe just go to ledger.com and see if there's an announcement or making some sort of Public Announcement hey we're sending out emails so people that may have been affected by this hacker or Google it and see if there's a news a press release about it or something like that um I've always said like if your bank calls you just hang up and look on the back of your debit card and call that number it's the same way with all of these emails you get you know if they're trying to contact you find a good contact that you know can't be manipulated and reach out to them Google their phone number I always so the hardest part is being an FBI agent you would be surprised is to call up and say hey I'm an FBI agent people are like  you you're not an FBI I said Google any number you want for FBI it has to talk to me and and and call me and I'd pick up say christabel FBI and they say oh you are an FBI agent so the same thing and you know it's not offensive yeah yeah so you know that do the same thing just understanding that you're you are being targeted just being online you are being targeted for something Chris are you familiar with um ZK as zero knowledge technology zero knowledge proofs sure yeah I had to to what degree do you uh the implication for ZK Tech in the crypto world is that basically everything will become private on the internet the internet itself will become private now there's a big is opt gap between where we are now with ZK Tech and where it will be in the future but this is the promise of ZK Tech is that anything about anything will become private like your transactions will become private Your Existence can become privatized uh privatized it can be made private um does this scare you no but I don't know how it's going to be implemented like I buy my internet service or an internet service provider how are they not going to know what I'm doing or have the ability to know what I'm doing you know you can do encryption but they'll still know basic metadata about me when I'm on when I'm not on when I'm using traffic when my traffic goes up when traffic goes down I mean so you know yeah I I just don't I don't maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand how it's going to be implemented sure I'm also not smart enough to understand I just wanted to bring up the subject matter everyone is everyone is super bullish on the fact that ZK proofs can be integrated into absolutely everything and so my general understanding is that uh it is a huge shift of power towards the individual which uh as a privacy person I'm like great uh but then as like a crime stopper person I might be like oh I mean it sounds good um let's take the small steps first like I'll suggest to your users start looking into like fighter devices we talk here about passwords and all that final devices are little token based devices that do endem encryption you have to set them up it takes a long time to set them up because you you set up a connection with everything you share a password with but it gets rid of passwords so it's a physical token that creates Google allows it Apple allows it there's a lot of stuff out there let's take that step the the exchanges allow it to crack and dust you can you can sign in rather than two-factor a you can sign in with a Fido key and I do recommend the Bluetooth ones or the ones that are USB I I I say agnostic all of it if you switch to Fido that's fantastic I'll just leave it at that all right um I I like the USB ones personally that's what I use but you know not having Fido if you if the Bluetooth is the only one you want to use then yeah I was just worried about you know the FBI uh truck sitting in my front yard and being able to pick up that Bluetooth connection and intercept me you know that's that's you gotta buy it you got to buy property where they have to be at least 30 feet away from you and then you can defeated them uh if if the actual device is compromised is at a risk like how what's this what's the security around that if somebody steals my device from me am I am I left you still have to authenticate to it it's not just like a plug and play It's good to go you authenticate to it and then once you authenticate to the fighter device then it has it keeps all your connections another key advice if you get a fight or device get a second one make a copy of it phrases you lock yourself out you're screwed um so always have a second one that wherever you put your seed phrases put it there put all your eggs in one basket that's what they say it's Securities best right uh yeah you know what um I think that um everybody's gonna have to level up their security this decade right like everyone if this is not just a crypto thing this is what we said is a skill for the 2020s and 2030s is everyone's going to have to get better at private Key Management because passwords are going away I think and I hope and uh we're gonna need to kind of embrace this future um Chris this has been a lot of fun um yeah just just as we close uh one thing that we noticed this year I didn't get a chance to to ask you so the Silk Road story actually continues so this is uh the story that we we mentioned on our weekly roll up uh from November uh 2022 and uh it's a CNBC article again the feds announced the seizure of 3.36 billion in Bitcoin stolen a decade ago from illegal Silk Road marketplace the second largest crypto recovery that just happened within the last few months um I think this guy had maybe 50 000 Bitcoin or something and the FBI 10 years later tracked him down I believe he was like keeping the private keys somewhere I don't know under a floorboard somewhere hidden in his house basically um yeah what happened here like how is this story ongoing is are there still missing funds from the Silk Road do you do you want to know how he up what he did yes yes he took his fort Bitcoin cash and converted it over Bitcoin and so the 10-year statue of limitation had passed on the theft of the big of the original Bitcoin but since he trade he exchanged it it restarted the clock and so he was able to be tracked because it was Bitcoin wait a second why did it restart the clock wait but there is a clock there's a clock there's a statue of limitations so you commit a crime the government can't come after you after a certain amount of time so except for like murder and rape and all that sort of stuff so if I steal if I steal billions of dollars all I have to do is wait 10 years wait them out and I'm good well then why there might be other things there might be tax evasion and stuff like that but but the the I don't know all the rules of limit statute of limitations but there is a certain amount of time that the government has to prosecute you why did the clock reset when he swapped currencies uh because he did it in 2017 or 2018 and so Bitcoin cash because he took the pro yeah yeah he he so he got Bitcoin before it forked it forked and then he had the same amount of crypto cash and so they were able to seize that and get his information his kyc information uh where he exchanged it out after the fact so he stole it back in the day like I said two thousand you know 11 2013 when you know people couldn't trace it then he then he moved he should have just left the Bitcoin cash left it alone he would they wouldn't have found him but he got greedy and wanted to to switch that out and and how did they find him it's like like um just the kyc information okay using something like okay exchange like hey who is this character oh my God how did he get how did he get this in the in the first place was he part of the dread pirate Roberts crew or was he just uh out of a payment he he manipulated the system again wow the Silk Road was not configured properly I've been saying this for years people people don't believe that uh he stole it out of out of the system because of a misconfiguration all right Chris but if I'm this guy and the FBI shows up at my house and I have private keys and the FBI wants to get it from me and I don't want to give it to them how does the FBI get it from me uh cut you a deal turn over your 3.3 billion dollars and you're not going to go to jail and so you have to decide how much like the jail time is the money two billion dollars that's basically it that's the method that's what it comes that's all it comes out to yeah I mean so we can't force you to give your password I mean that's not all now if you're overseas I mean places like England and all that there's like another crime if you don't turn your password over but that's another crime but still that's an additional charge they'll lock you in jail until you can until you cough up the private Keys basically ah they don't lock you in jail that long over there they're pretty they're pretty uh convenient like so the law set guys uh 125 years over there over here over there they got you know slap on the wrist in jail for like maybe a year um same crimes so the systems are very different the US is pretty tough on on cyber crime this has been so fascinating Chris uh this has been uh ask everything you've wanted from an FBI uh
