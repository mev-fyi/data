solve ponzi games we don't want this game studios taking further cuts this feels like microtransactions do you think any of the criticisms are valid so i think there's very valid uh hate around them to be honest with you gamers remember when they couldn't get an nvidia graphic card because bitcoin miners you know 200 300 price hike on trying to get a graphics card the ponzinomics conversation i think there are valid conversations in some games where it is problematic and so you really have to think about it this way i'm not joining 3 for where web 3 is today i think it's version 0.5 i am very excited about what web 3 looks when it's v3 v4 v5 and you know skating to where the puck is going if you will right now there are problems there are scams there are rugs there are carbon footprint issues and so if you and i are just talking about in its current state there are very valid arguments but i am trying to take a three or five year time frame horizon and that's why i'm making the jump that's why i'm optimistic despite all of this backlash and frustration
