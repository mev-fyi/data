[Music] welcome bankless nation to this episode of meet the nation today we are bringing on two contributors to the cordon ape project which is a brand new project that is helping daos coordinate and they have a fun little play on words with cord and nape because we are all dumb apes trying to coordinate inside of daos and what coordinate really does is it allows people and allows contributors of the dao and other dao members to identify inside of their own sphere of influence sphere of knowledge about who is contributing what value to the relevant dao and so in the world of crypto we like bottom up organizations rather than top down control that's kind of the ethos of this industry and what coordinate allows allows dao's to do is it pushes out the decision making of who should receive what funding down out to the edges and so it allows daos to select how its members want to choose who to uh reward with with financial compensation either with a dallas native token or with like die or usdc or any other token on ethereum and that allows for the individuals to make their own inputs into the dow at large as to where they think funding should go uh kind of kind of like get coin but for internal to daos and so we get into the details of coordinate with zach and tracheopteryx the two contributors that we brought on to discuss coordinate and then we also get into a much higher level more cerebral conversation about dowse at large and how dows are really a new paradigm in straight-up labor and organization and we we talk about how we have as a society as a globe we have planetary scaled problems that we need planetary scaled organizations for uh and so they brought out in the model of like um if we want to plant a billion trees or if we want to solve global warming it's going to take organizations that transcend the globe that transcend um that's transcend countries and dao's can really only be the entities that really tackle these planetary scaled organizations and we also talk about just the the concept of what happens when you take centralized decision making and push it out into the periphery out into the out into the edges and we've seen this pattern play out throughout history and uh trach uh has a lot of really interesting opinions and ideas about why this is necessary for daos why they need to push out decision-making powers to the fringes rather than keep it centralized to a cue a few core community members and so i really enjoy conversations that go specifically into the details of things how coordinate and how coordinate works and what it does but then also we can extrapolate that to the big ideas like the cultural implications the society level uh conversations and that's what you're going to get in this episode of the bankless meet the nation so thank you thank you to the coordinators for coming on and introducing themselves to the meet the nation so let's go ahead and get into that conversation but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave dot com all right bank list nation i am here with two contributors to the cordon ape project i got zach and tracheopteryx uh out of coordinate and coordinate is a new dow uh infrastructure utility that is being heavily used by the bankless dow as well as other dows as well and we are going to get into the details of what actually cordon ape actually is um so zach and tracheopteryx which i'm now going to call trach moving forward uh welcome to the the bankless nation thanks for coming and stopping by yeah it's great to be here so tell us a little bit about coordinate so let's start but we'll get into the details of what it actually is but maybe start about with the inspiration for why it came about and why it was needed great yeah well coordinate emerged out of urine's grant process so i'm a core contributor at urine as well and you know when right after we started and money started flowing we didn't you know urine was a uh a big bang of of decentralized chaos with no structure right away and so we didn't have any systems for doing things and making decisions and we just started doing stuff and one of the things we did was start giving money to people and we figured out you know we got a uh a governance proposal through to allow us to do that and we started giving money to the community and being on that group of people that would decide how to give money to people i saw how inefficient it was and kept kind of wishing for something better um because a small group of people even though we ask other people you know you never really know and this top-down method of allocating resources is really inefficient that's why you don't see it done in nature very often right so coordinate emerged as a process really from from a process that zach used to use uh which you can you want to tell them about thunder zone dome sure uh yeah thunderdome was a process that i used in um in my other work uh my consultancy called converge and when we do projects no one's on salary um just projects when they're done money gets put at the middle of the table and we divvy it up and the process is over when everyone says okay i'm good um so it's really yeah that equitable sharing and it really comes also from a lot of theory and that we're really interested around teal organizations and gift economics and things like this and we realized that this was a really good space and really needed space to develop in so trek let's talk a little bit more about the process that you were going through with urine and how you would divvy up funds can you go into more details as to just the problem that you identified and the process that that that looked like and that ultimately led to the establishment of coordinate well with a truly decentralized contributor community right you've got people all over the place you know i think you're seeing this at banquet style right there's all different types of people contributing trying different things how do you reward them how do you compensate them right it's not the old model where you do an interview and then you hire them and you agree on something it's like here are people that are creating real value for a community and it it it makes sense to give them some proper compensation even if you're thinking about it purely from a kind of self-interest it makes sense and there's not a good mechanism so when you do it in a top-down way and there's a lot of a lot of daos take this approach where they form a small council and then they're in charge of grants and some of them have more process some of them have less ours was even was small process but we would we would ask around who's doing great work who should get money this guy is doing awesome stuff let's give him a thousand bucks awesome right and we did that for months you know for six months seven months uh we called it one-time grants and then some people get recurring grants right which is you know people that were kind of like on whatever salary it would mean in the urine and the the real problem was it just it wasn't very effective you know we give a person a grant one month and then they keep doing good work and we feel like we're not supposed to give the same person a grand again because maybe that should be recurring or what and they wouldn't get something we give somebody else something when you look over the entire allocation you realize just how inefficient it was purely but we were really good at it too we were really good at it it's just purely based on the mechanism and something we've heard from from other dows that are using the platform is it also creates a real challenge to subjectively say like what's more valuable you know someone chipped in and translated the docs and someone else is moderating discord and and how are you supposed to make the subjective just decision on what that's worth so coordination has just asked the community one other quick piece of this is that you know really the wisdom is at the edges of this type of work people believe that it's at the center but the people that are actually doing the work know best how to compensate for it so uh we're about to get into specifically the details of coordinate but i want to flesh this out just a little bit more so so trek while you were managing this uh what you are calling top-down distribution of funds what really like ground your gears about like man this makes no sense like how why this the way that i'm doing this thing uh needs to change is there anything that comes to mind with that just really looking at this incredible community of people that are doing work and just feeling like i needed to work harder to properly compensate them and that i didn't have the information or the or the processes or the tools available to do it right that just sucks you know okay so let's go ahead and get right into coordinate how did coordinate uh how did you build coordinate what is it and how does it solve some of the problems that you were talking about with distributing rewarded uh funding rewards at urine yeah so really at its simplest i think coordinate is a way to make better decisions you know it's a way for a group of people to make better decisions about specifically now how to allocate resources and you know it comes from a bit of a different world view you know we see the world as you know this this emergent space upon the physics of blockchain that allows for intersubjective collective organisms to run around and and and blood of money to flow through their you know subject their new bodies right like this is the totally wild realm that were that were operating really are organisms made from multiple people and so how do you how do you create how do you direct these resources flow and um so that it makes those types of decisions it can also coordinate also allows for communities to bootstrap their contributors pretty easily you can create a decentralized basically membrane for a network where who becomes part of the network and who is not part of the network coordinate has an nft badging system which you can do in a centralized or a decentralized way to define what a community is in the most decentralized any badge holder can create another batch holder or maybe you want to say any three batch holders need to agree to create a new batch holder but it doesn't have to be top down it comes from the edge or if you want to be a central super admin you can do it that way too so it allows you to bootstrap a community and allows everybody in that community to have access to community grants right off the bat so you can have some process for deciding what rhythm and amount these grants come at mostly it's monthly you say okay we do 10 000 bucks a month to our community that's all you have to decide and then every month at the end of the month there's a one week epic where the community decides how to split that money up and then how does the voting power work in the community does that is it like one member one vote or what what is the decision making a waiting process like yeah this is one of the novel kind of mechanisms we developed is that every person gets 100 give tokens and these are non-transferable they're not erc20 tokens these are just used within the process so everybody in the network whether you're the founder or you're the newest dude uh to come gets a hundred give tokens and you allocate those to everybody else in whatever way you want and we suggest that the best way to do this is not trying to step into the shoes of a compensation manager where you're analyzing all the reports and making a perfect allocation just look at who you have directly seen provide value and give them a gift and then when you look at that allocation across all of the different people it actually has tremendous wisdom uh and it's much more effective and successful than what we've seen previously so with the bank list dow there's like an absolute insane number of guilds there's the audio video guild the marketing guild design guild developers guild legal guild like i could go on uh and is spending you can really only be in an expert of one or a few guilds at most right and if you are trying to keep up with every single guild like you're probably frog monkey uh you're there's only a few people that can actually keep up with all the gills and so what you're saying is and i i i hear you using a lot of nature terms and i want to get into that after we talk about more concrete things but i think you're just talking about distributing the decision-making process to the periphery right the human brain actually only coordinates a fraction of the resource management over the human body and a lot of that happens at the actual cellular level right and so you're saying give a hundred give tokens to every single cell of a dow every single individual member and allow them to choose what neighboring cells that they are familiar with where the resources goes there is that is that a decent way to articulate this yeah for sure okay so and also just noting that that all of this is configurable too because for some dows it it might make more sense to have some folks with more give tokens so the gives are really like just poker chips that people can use to represent value and some folks have tied those to the amount of native tokens that that are in the dow um so it's configurable but the hypothesis is is that if everyone gives from their own subjective place it's going to represent value in and value out so trey you said everyone has a hundred give tokens is that kind of just like the default and is or is that like a variable that you can like tinker with that's the default in our recommendation but that can be adjusted right and so like maybe some dow could like have that related to how many dow tokens they have or maybe the dow could just elect a few members that people collectively agree that they deserve more give tokens just by the nature of their contributions um and maybe maybe there's a way to earn more give tokens as a way to elevate your own influence inside of the dao how have you seen people experiment with these uh you know tinkering with the balances of give tokens i mean i can speak to how i've seen um one protocol basically wrote a script so that the amount of native tokens that you hold correlates to the amount of give that you have um so that core contributors would have more i think though bankless dow actually used a thousand give as the default because it was so huge and they wanted to have a lot to spread around other folks have tried just it's a more traditional grant approach but they want more transparency around it and so there's a small group that has a lot of give and others that that have very little so that they have more control so it really depends on the context of of what makes sense but but the hypothesis and the theory is again spread the decisions to the edge and let the whole organism decide what's important very cool very cool um so let's say that go through a hypothetical scenario we've handed out give tokens people have allocated uh their give tokens to towards other people you said that they were non-transferable does that mean that you are just like signing a message or or how does that work well they're transferable within the um the mechanism of coordinate but they're not it's on a database you know these this it's like poker chips they're not er c20 tokens they're not in the blockchain these aren't um on unit swap yeah and really they don't need to be you know because what happens in in one epic is everybody gets these they they give them to other people and then that generates a merkle tree and that's how you do the distribution and that's what's unchained uh okay so the the it's a off-chain token spreading around generates a hash for a merkle tree uh or a miracle distributor and then the mergle distributor goes on chain and that's where people get paid correct okay so let's talk about the uh balances between give tokens on the the database and then people actually receiving money uh take us through that's in that that walk through everybody gives out their give tokens at the end of the epoch there's a distribution you know one person's gotten 100 one person's gotten 10 one person's gotten 20 whatever the monthly budget is for that period gets divided by those amounts and then the person that's got more give tokens gets more of that budget proportionally and you know what's happening technically is that you know that final allocation is uh becomes a merkle tree which is then pushed on chain uh the the funds are held in the urine vault and you can fund your community purely on yield if you want or you can find it on capital you can fund it with your own native tokens if you want as well and then that distribution then the each person's allocation is available for them to claim so so you could you could in theory distribute usdc you could distribute like uh for the bank list out the bank token uh you can really just distribute any token that's on ethereum and so maybe even in theory like you could have two sets of these things one for distributing the bank token for the bankless dell or and usdc like depending on like how much of your uh how you want to manage the treachery so it really seems to be like that there's a pretty open-ended design space with with coordinate yeah we've really found that this this idea of the gift circle is a pretty uh useful and magical concept can be applied to a lot of different ways like our friends at get coin they're using it to distribute their token with internally within their team so the gtc to the team members um you know the strategist group at yearn is using it to distribute some shared funds income from the strategies to new strategists done in a bunch of different ways and i think the interesting thing is that um i'm going to go ahead and guess that this is true is that at the end of an epoch there's a new blank slate so the next epod the previous epoch doesn't impact the next epoch so everything is new and so somebody can come into a dow say the bankless dow uh work really really hard for an epoch uh and then go on vacation and that epoch can can uh track that level of in theory uh so long as the community is tracking it or it doesn't happen automatically the community has to do this but that um blank slateness allows for new people to come in and start contributing immediately right uh and then and then have that um that reward appropriately truncated when the the value creation stops happening or not yeah i mean we really see it as basically the greatest hiring funnel that's ever been created because you don't have to worry about it all you know we saw this happen at yearn where 95 of our hires at yearn were just people that showed up and started doing the work they were already doing the job we could see how good they were at it and we're like hey you want to do this for money and they're like yes we're like done you know that's the entire hiring process takes out all the risk because you see the people do the work so in the case here any community can fire up a coordinate gift circle the entry requirements can be determined by them you know you get into the circle you st if you're doing good work you're gonna make money and if you're not that's okay you know stick around maybe you'll make some money later and then over time you know you really just build up this um contribution history all right guys i hope you're enjoying this conversation as much as i did like i said trek and zach they think really big picture and i really enjoy people that can build stuff that needs to be built and then also explain how it's going to impact the world and why it's going to change society in the second half of the show we continue in the big picture side of things and talk about you know what does it mean to have like these these dows that kind of mimic nature and how how do we solve some of these big problems that we have both inside the industry with regards to coordination and also the problems that we have in society at large we talk about how dows can overlap in their labor force which is in stark contrast to centralized companies that you know claim one employee and say you are you are ours and no one else is what happens when daos have like one third of their their labor force their workforce also working for other dows like all of a sudden daos can become collaborative instead of competitive i really enjoyed these conversations with the coordinators but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success bouncer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto bison cells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to seven point four percent interest on 26 various

bankless i've been telling basically everyone that'll listen that dows have money and they are in need of labor and one of the uh coolest thing about dallas is that exactly what you're alluding to you don't actually have to like go through an interview process and sign up you just have to go into the dow and start contributing value historically however uh building enough like rapport and trust and reputation inside of a dow like takes a while and uh it's people i don't think are really ready to be like i'm going to commit to working for this dow for two months and then and then i can convince them to pay me so i'm gonna work for free for two months and then maybe i hopefully cross my fingers they can pay me money uh and that's kind of how i've just alluded to people like hey you can go get money you just have to work for this dow and establish trust and rapport for a decent amount of time until you can convince them to actually put them on put you on the bankroll with coordinate it sounds like people can start like earning money like in in theory on like day one right because it really just lowers the barrier for what you need to do to actually add value and it also lowers the barrier for the dow to identify and appropriately compensate interested members uh and i've always been uh i i've thought that the most the the the best dows out there are going to be the ones that lower the barriers lower and lower and lower to meaningful contributions right how can we have a dow that's 30 000 people large where there is absolutely no leader and it's entirely a chaotic mess yet there is still value being created and value being compensated for because the dao has figured out how to lower the barriers of contribution to the absolute minimum and when you lower the barriers up to the absolute minimum you have the maximum number of people that can help work for the dao any thoughts on that yeah man i mean how can you grow a body with trillions of cells you know where each cell is getting exactly the right nourishment and growing and and moving within the exact right space at the same time this is the magic of nature and this is like the foundation of of the worldview that all of this comes from you know we we we're on this period on earth where we've got these giant uh organisms on the planet these uh apples and microsofts and these come from these old machine style understanding of human coordination and then there's some new kind of family-style versions the non-profits and the patagonias and things like that but dows are even beyond this these are the organisms right these are the collective organisms that are forming in ways that no one human mind can understand that no executive board can control you know in order to have this level of efficiency this incredible scaling ability and power you have to have structures that are enabling the wisdom and the insight from an organism to spread from the edges in from the out inside out in every way that needs to be made and to grow the structures capable to support this new type of life form yeah it's a one framework that we think about is that the olds the machine style has a deliberate process and a deliberate outcome right so they know what their kpis their key performance indicators and here's what we're going to do and how we're going to get there and dials are a deliberate process but emergent outcome so we can say here's the structure and process we're going to use but we don't know exactly where it's going to lead to where we sort of follow our nose and and cross the river by feeling for stones um in a more organic way cross the river by feeling for stones i love that that's a great that's a great line um i i think this is really parallel to a lot of just the progress of science that that we have seen like computation at large is being pushed to the peripheries right like my my bed has a chip in it right it's got it's got like a and there's like my coffee mug it like it heats itself it's got a chip in it there's computation that is being pushed to the periphery and and i see this in the same uh what you're saying with with the bankless dao right like and now instead of having like central databases which we still have um but we are also now putting chips in absolutely everything so computation can happen like in your home thermostat right like in your refrigerator like in the 17 devices that we all own and the if if you really want to extrapolate that out like when we can connect all of these things we generate like a mesh network of computation across like that blankets the entire world and i see that same process that same model going on with with what you guys are trying to do at coordinate right like how can we make every single dow member a computational unit that is focused on the good of the dao and what is the number one uh way to execute is by allocating resources and what is money other than like the ultimate nourishment and ultimate resources i i'm reminded of the um the story of uh the russian uh russian prime minister or leader uh i can't remember which one it was but he comes to america and he sees that there's like all these grocery stores and all these like bakeries and they're all super efficient and none of them have a line and so he wants to be taken to like the minister of grocery and and bakeries because he wants to talk about how efficient they are like why how did you get these so things these things so efficient and he couldn't comprehend the concept of a free market that allows the free market to do the computation as to what is needed uh on the periphery rather than rather than a centralized like top-down system and the reason why the united states won the cold war is because capitalism allows for computation to be pushed out to the edges like allow the free market to actually determine what uh what the world needs uh and so i see the same effect being created here here by coordinate yeah man totally absolutely yeah and it creates i mean there's also you know there's a learning curve to this too because we've all grown up in these hierarchical systems you know from when there's a teacher and a principal and then we go to work and there's a manager and a ceo and so it can be difficult at first to sort of wade into this water of ambiguity you know and it's like you when you lower the bar to end to the dow and say yeah come contribute it's like what do i do well i i don't know like yeah you exactly you do the computation exactly it puts a different kind of onus on people and it takes some time and and and i think that's one of the things that's exciting to see about dallas is as people get better at swimming in that ambiguity um you know that we try stuff i think one of the coolest things about coordinate is not the the output that comes just from saying okay here's your allocations but that also is then a reflection and a way for the dow to ask itself like what are we prioritizing here wow we just gave all of our gives to this person who's making memes like is that maybe that's good right right is that what we want what are we doing um and so it creates a way for sort of self-reflection of the dow to say what are our priorities um wow you know and so over time we're already seeing this with yearn you know is that people get better at distributing resources you know people start to take ownership for strategic direction people speak up in the telegram of the discord and say hey we should be paying the translators more you know they're kind of off doing their work they're not loud but it's really important and so it creates a sort of collective intelligence that shared display is really important so we're all looking at the same thing and then we can make decisions based on it totally totally it seems like um the doubt no since uh especially with bank list out the data i'm familiar with the most um there seems to be a very few number of people who know what's going on but most people only are really familiar with their specific corner of the dao and when most people are like that we could also think about hypothetical data where almost no one really knows what's going on holistically and what you're saying is that well the coordinate like leaderboard can allow the dow to actually instantiate like it's it's collective consciousness it's like oh yeah when all you individual units do your computation as to where you think resources need to go the collective like the collective result of all those resources is like a a reflection of the consciousness of the dow's like hey this is what the doubt deter has determined is valuable now that you guys now all the individual processors know what the dao is individually prioritizing you can continue that if you like it or you can change your behavior now it's up to you but it's actually instantiating the information and pushing that out to all the little processors the individuals and that informs them as to what could or needs to change or not yeah you know having been in the engine room of urine since the beginning and seeing all of this stuff play out and like really learning from these these experiences you know making this stuff visible having good visualizations of this type of data and then making that you know the old style would be okay give that to the executives they can decide no give that to the public and you know everybody that's on the team can see that everybody that's that's the contributor can see that and they can make the best decisions that they that they uh are able to fantastic so guys does the coordinate conversation stop at just uh distributions and and these give tokens or where does the does it keep going to the moon man we're going all the way all the way um i mean really this is just the first kind of product we have a dozen other products that we've been working on and we're focusing on this first because really the goal is to get every product every protocol needs this you know every like the amount of people reaching out that want this is is massive so you know we see this world that really changes labor where every protocol in defy has their own contributor network that has this really easy uh low bearing entry uh way to start getting rewarded right away and you have like what the gig worker should be you know like the nomad worker the free worker somebody that can just come and and contribute wherever they want and they get some money from sushi and they get some money from urine they get some money from bankless and they don't have to worry about all their their needs are met and then they can they can marry somebody if they want to but you know they can just play around um but beyond the gift circle there are so many other pieces there's how do you use this same philosophy to make decisions around budgeting how do you do it to make decisions around investments how do you do it for contractors right so there are ways to apply the same thinking to all of these different uh parts of dao's growth specifically around you know sharing resources yeah real a real critical part of of coordinate is the visualization so you actually get a visualized graph you can see very transparently who gave to who and who received from who and that that shared display helps but you can also start doing the same thing with you know different initiatives um a way to sort of collate and understand where is the collective intelligence and where does it want to go i think the other exciting thing is as we start to think about people having these nft badges that as they move between their circle at that bankless or urinary sushi we'll start to get a picture a sort of network map of of defy you know we'll be able to start to zoom out and not just look at this circle that allocated but start to look at many circles together and start to see you know who who are the people that are adding value across the space we're going to have that graph to be searchable so you can start to look at like who are the really good people it means who are the really good people at ops at gov all these things and so it can be there's a lot of powerful data there too and just seeing the broader network yeah oh my god i'm getting goosebumps i'm reminded of the d5 like mesh network visualizations that came out like not too long ago where you can see all the inter interrelationships between the different defy apps as people send money between each ones and make transactions that call on on multiple different apps and you can see that grow and grow and grow into this very like vibrant mesh network of all these defy apps with intermingling transactions and so i'm kind of guessing that perhaps that's where if we're bullish on dows which i'm definitely bullish on dallas uh that that might grow the same like first we see like the contributors of bankless dow yearn and all the other dallas like and starts just a few dows but i think we all know that like there's an explosion of dao's coming if it's not already here and like the one of the things that i wrote about in the my future of work article which was focused on like how dows and the model of labor and dowses could change everything is it seems to be that like because there's such a low barrier to working for a dow and because dao's are non-exclusive dow members can work for multiple dows there's going to be some people who are good at dowing there are people who figure out what it means to dao and you're going to see those people that kind of rise to the top as like and they won't even be like oh yeah this is um this one dao person who does a lot of daos and he's a part of this one specific doubt like no no he's a power of many he or she is part of many daos uh and they are just a dower uh and they're known for dowing and they work for all and and uh people the dallas might really really want this person because he or he or she does really good work for all these dows and you can see their relationships from all their give tokens as as a way that um illustrates the activity of not just one person but of basically the entire network of of dows at large right that if that visualization comes out that'll be super awesome yeah i mean visual linkedin of dao's um visuals with is within the ambition of coordinate yeah and like the future that we want the post-competitive future where there is this ecosystem of protocols and human beings uh each kind of following their hearts and doing the work that they are called to and having that all be uh compensated in an easy kind of seamless way it's just incredibly exciting you know potential so let's talk about the coordinate team uh how many people does it take to maintain coordinate well we're pretty young i mean we're only i think six full-time people and i'm full-time at yearn and so i and i help you know with all this stuff too and um but we're growing um and how do you guys get funding or is it just a passion of passion of love labor of love we've been lucky to get some grants from some we got a grant from urine we got a grant from sushi swap from cream uh alchemist the alchemist dao also gave us a great yeah another big grant donation recently from an amazing human being and um we uh yeah we're probably going to do a seed round to raise some funds and um but we're good for right now and we're really just working to launch the uh you know the public platform the open platform that anybody can permissionlessly launch a circle as soon as we can so you guys aren't this isn't just a short term like hey let's build out this infrastructure and then and then let the dows like use it but this is more of a long term like this could be a lot of people's full-time jobs for for a while if not forever yeah yeah no i mean we're going pretty big and there's a lot we want to make um yeah the coordinate dow will form uh in short in short order uh and you know we'll the best ideas for how to to grow this kind of platform are going to come from from those fringes so we're we're excited to start activating all these folks who are also you know obsessively thinking about how do we make dao's deliver on their their promise and you know in partnership i mean we're really close with colony and jack derose and you know there's a bunch of other people in the space that are working on stuff and you know we have incredible partners to to build this whole space out with well a dow that is focused on building dow infrastructure makes a ton of sense if anyone's gonna figure it out it would be that dal so i'm excited to see the progress of of court and ape dow and happy to join it whenever it goes live guys so are there any other components of this conversation that we haven't touched on yet i think one thing i want to bring up is like how you know i mean this is such a longer conversation when you think about dowse you know most people have a very monolithic idea about like a you know coin vote system where everybody gets to weigh in but really we're learning that the decision space for any organization is so much more complex and this whole new range of dow tooling is coming out coordinate is one of those and there's so many other pieces too like the governance 2.0 stuff the constrained delegation piece that gabriel shapiro and i wrote for yearn which is how urine now operates with why teams and you know discrete tokenized powers that can be transferred around you know we're really looking at the frontier here of a really incredibly new and powerful decision-making space you know that um that coordinate was just like a small piece of really so a question for you guys since you guys are intimately familiar with dials what other tools do you guys use that's not coordinate i've used a bunch of them um i mean we use snapshot at urine for for voting um gnosis safe wallet that's essential um and use colony as soon as that comes out i've used i love molok dao for you know if you're specifically i think they did some really amazing uh ideation early on and um yeah zach what about you um i mean i i think you know there's there's more coming out all the time i'm i'm i'm a lot newer to the the defying crypto space actually it's when my my first light bulb came on listening to you and kevin owaki on the slaying moloch episode of bankless and and my my uh my previous line of work was about real world like networks solving complex problems and so um yeah the thing that that's gotten me most hyped on dowse is not just the what we can do in d5 but you know if we can break from the concrete for a minute like what's most exciting to me is is dao's train people to be in ambiguity they train people to take agency and to collectively organize and these are the skills that we're going to need as we navigate like this this really critical time on on the planet so it's it's a little bit you know um pie in this you know it's it's it's a very high ambition but i feel like if if we're going to meet some of these wicked challenges that we face like on a planetary scale it's going to be dows that do it you know if we plant a trillion trees it's going to be a decentralized network globally that does it so um beyond all the all the tools and the concrete meeting of the needs i think the thing that's most exciting about dows is the the unlocking of a real coordination at scale and i think that's something that's important that we continually keep putting at the forefront because it's going to be really hard and there's going to be a lot of bumps as these dowels come online but the inherent skills that it brings out in in navigating a different way of of relating to each other is is super critical yeah so something i want to riff on with you guys coming off of what you just said zach is um uh we we have planetary scale problems and so we need planetary skilled organizations to address those problems and i think one of the really important second order effects that might come from dows and is just changing people's dispositions to labor and work and value creation right where so many people are used to applying for a job asking for permission to work it's like hey how can i help or hey tell me what to do rather than like i have an idea let me do it uh and people are just we're like used to a top-down environment where they have to ask for permission and just pray that people say yes so that they can start contributing value whereas dows are they they spin it around on the individual and say hey like we have money like come provide value we don't know what value we want we don't even know what we want you might know what we want but the onus is on you uh and so uh i'm perpetually focused on the way these technologies change our culture and change our psychology and of dowse and getting earning money it rewards people who take the initiative and take agency and also do uh good analysis as to what the dow wants that's how you get the most money is you answer the question of what the dow wants and if you're correct you get rewarded and if you're incorrect you don't get rewarded as much um but like if we have these planetary scale problems i think we need a populace of humans that put one and put like take the first step themselves and and solve the problems themselves and take responsibility before they're even asked and that kind of cultural shift if we can scale that out to the whole world is how we can start like tackling problems without asking for permission and just start doing it as a society yeah a thousand percent yeah i mean it's the it's the foundational crypto beliefs you know personal sovereignty and taking ownership and responsibility for your own actions and and all these incentive structures and processes that reinforce that you know and when you have that type of sovereignty you take responsibility you know for yourself and your environment and others and yeah that's that's everything so i think it there's sort of a uh i hope there's a call that we're doing all this awesome financial innovation in defy and and recognizing that that's not you know that's the first step it's not going to be perfect once we have you know the global financial rails on d fight this is just a practice to make sure we're good at dowing for when we get into the you know to get into some real real deep water well if you don't have the blood supply then you don't have the heart and you don't have the heart and the blood supply you don't have the brain you know you we build these things up in layers collectively totally totally i'm reminded of the podcast we just with josh rosenthal as to the crypto renaissance and one of his big uh actionable items was that uh there's a revolution coming there's a renaissance coming and you need to participate in it rather than have it change your life you want to undergo the revolution rather than have have it undergo you right uh take the revolution by by the horns and i think that people that learn how to dao now are going to be the leaders of the next generation as they come and teach people it's like hey this is how you dow and this is how this works yeah i mean this is what brought me to this space too i mean i've been following crypto since you know for ten years but um i only really entered it because of dao's because you know as somebody that's been looking at the world for a long time and and seeing you know if we're going to change these uh zero-sum games and resource wars and win-lose dynamics you know you need a fundamentally different uh organizational structure you know working at the level of politics or at the level of conflict or whatever that's all great too but it's the underlying stuff you know in the physics of blockchain you know has allowed for a completely new collective intelligence space to rise and you're seeing this in d5 with all these different protocols but you don't have to join apple and then be against microsoft you can be a member of one place and a member of another and remember another all collaborating together because of the the form of the dow you know is we need these structures because if you don't have these structures you import the structures from your memory and you project those onto this new formless space but once you create the structures then people can learn how to use them and they can operate in a completely new way totally totally like imagine as like a thought experiment for the listeners like imagine if apple and microsoft had like one third of their employee base overlapping like would they be competitive or would they make or would they make collaborative products rather than competitive products i used to think about that all the time when i worked in the sustainability space and i'd go to factories in china and uh you know they'd have all these environmental regulations for nike and they'd run a line and then on the same line they would have to change things around to meet the adidas specs and run the same show on the same line it was like wait if we're what is the goal here what are we trying to do you know we need a lot more coopetation and i i think the the younger generation uh and the millennials and the zoomers that really fits with them like they want that they they there's a this is maybe a far-off connection but like one of the reasons why i don't think there's any major wars happening left with inside of humanity is people don't have the taste for violence and then in the same vein like people are having the taste for like uh competition just less and less and less at least like zero sum competition like we all we all understand that competition's good and competition's necessary for the progress of humanity but there's there's competition for like versus others or versus your past self right like you're your own version of yourself like how can we improve and how can that be made the competition rather than like oh there's this other dow over there or there's this other company over there how do we crush them it's like oh no no like how do we collaborate with them and be competitive against our own self right how can how can we challenge ourselves and how can we leverage collaboration to make that happen um if if we can figure out how to tap into the power of collaboration collaboration as an industry like that's one of the main reasons why like this industry is quote unquote going to the moon yeah this is something we think can talk about a lot and that you know so moloch really lives at the heart of every decision and it's it's telling you like if you do this wrong you will lose or you have to make you have to get what you want before somebody else gets what they want um and and you know we're in the society where there's all different types of people right so how do you how do you do this right because there are people that have grown up in war zones and they believe that their life is in jeopardy all the time it's a lot harder to collaborate with them right unless you are you know want to collaborate at that level and this is what like uh don beck and and uh with spiral dynamics and looking at how all these different you know psychological levels of psychological development each have different world views each different worldview is going to see a scenario in a different way right the thing is all of these different perspectives are valuable and all the actions that all of us make really are aimed at doing good you know even if they come from the shadow or they come from other some other confusion so how do you create a structure that can tie them all together one part is is understanding the dynamics of these structures another is understanding the psychology and the perspectives that all the different people on this big ship you know come from and and how to utilize them because they're all valuable totally so i have to ask how did the name cordon ape come to be in a telegram chat um i forget what we were i think i coined it actually i posted on twitter um you know we talk about apes a lot you know and uh it just was a funny pun yeah yeah it's just stuck and that was it it was a funny pun that somehow yeah that somehow stuck and and just seems to make more and more sense as we are you know just the intelligent apes trying to figure out how to how to do a little better together i think it's good to not take yourself too seriously too you know like we all are apes you know we all have some stupid ideas we all are pretty dumb sometimes and we can find things funny so it's fine for now love it love it so what is the coordinate movement looking for if some some bankless member is listening to the show what do you want them to do yeah i mean we want contributors and we're going to be hiring while we are hiring a lot so we're really open i mean um all the different skill sets are welcome all the different interests are welcome zach is there anything particular you think of um i mean it's sort of like i what i most want is to find those people who really have that inspiration to to connect like this lofty ideal of like straight up we're slaying moloch and be able to connect that down to how do we solve a pain point for dows right now you know so um we don't want to get too lofty and we don't want to get too focused on you know the tech and the tool um and so keeping those two in balance but i think what we need most right now are just contributors who are as excited about really helping dows deliver on their promise um you know if if you've got that that passion and understand the potential for this these structures and this technology then then there's lots of stuff for you to do yeah i mean following the ethos of coordinate you guys know better than we do what we need so you come and do it you know yeah we'll welcome you love it yeah if you weren't gonna say that i totally was uh do you guys have a discord we do it's it's brand new and uh the party's just starting so everyone is is more than welcome we'll provide that link that should be in the youtube youtube site uh description right below and uh do you guys have a twitter account as well yeah it's coordinate which is coordinate with ape at the end and we're also coordinate.com com coordinate ape or the sorry instead of the t it's with the p instead of a t so it's chord it's like the word coordinate but the last three letters are ape coordinate we will also get that into the show notes as well uh guys one final question um what if how how could you distill down uh a successful dow versus an unsuccessful dow into like a the shortest description possible how would you do that hmm i mean i remember i went to a retreat with rupert spire as amazing invite a vedanta teacher and somebody was asking you know how do i know if my meditation practice is working well and his answer was like how happy are you yeah so i think if you look at how happy and how fulfilled and uh you know how much your people in that community feel like they're able to express their talents it's a pretty good metric zack any opinions on that i think the key to a successful dow is is some key principles like trust not control um really believe that trust that that what's going on at the edges whether you think it's right or not like we'll see right it's really like it's taking the step and trusting that the ground is going to meet your feet it's it's trusting other people's judgment too and trusting that collective intelligence and i think the most successful dowels will be the ones where people individually can notice every time it comes up like we shouldn't be doing that i got to stop that i got like the impulse for control will continually come in and you need to continually remember like no let's just trust what we're doing let's trust all these people's intentions let's trust their talents let's trust ourselves to notice and and compensate you know talent and contribution trust not control is what's really gonna let dows thrive guys i've really really enjoyed this conversation and i i really hope that coordinate allows a thousand dows to flourish this year and then a million a million dollars next year uh so i hope the best for you guys and i'm looking forward to seeing the growth of coordinate thanks man what a pleasure to be on with you appreciate it yeah absolutely appreciate all your work helping to um to spread the consciousness of collective collaboration as well appreciate all the work you guys do happy to do it all right bankless nation that
