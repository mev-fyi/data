if you look at like rainbow one of the wallets it's kind of hard for a developer to use sometimes because you want to be able to switch networks but you'll notice that there's not a lot of network switching a lot of the network switching is abstracted away from the user that's probably what the future looks like in terms of am i even storing this on an l2 or l1 i don't even know i'm just hitting store and it's working and it's fast and cheap and the bridging and all of that stuff and kind of happens under the abstraction and the end user just sees quick and fast transactions
