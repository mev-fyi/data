if we want to build a truly Limitless internet of value internet of roll-ups it has to be trustless so all the bridges must be ZK and that means that all the chains participating in this network have to be zkgs this is our vision for hyperscalability EK evm is here it's on mainnet David we've got the episode announcement just went out as we are pressing publish on this episode what are we talking about today we are talking about ZK sync era the mainnet is live as of right now so we got the two people from the zkc team we got Alex glockowski who's been with ZK sync since forever co-founder and CEO of matter Labs the team behind cksync we also got Anthony Anthony is the new head of engineering which is a very ambitious role as it relates to ZK stuff that sounds challenging we're going to walk through what this announcement is what does it mean for a ZK evm to go live in the era of bank failures we have a new era for ethereum at least that is what the ZK sync is saying uh along with their ZK sync era chain uh so that is the announcement we're gonna get into all these details and more so you can be informed about what this new frontier ethereum is yes this is the frontier of the Frontiers and that's where we're headed today hey David before we get in Gotta Do a shout out this one's for the devs we gotta a special announcement for the devs sponsored by our friends over at consensus on the infuria team David what do they want folks to know yeah specifically for the nft devs out there this is coming down from infuria so inferior's got an nft SDK and toolkit for you to build your nft projects and so it's got 14 different endpoints that allows you to read data from eight different blockchains you can aggregate it analyze it filter it build a dashboard and this SDK allows you provides you tools to write to five different blockchains uh all of the use cases that you need for your basic nft stuff selling nft buying nft minting nft all of this SDK from inferior is to help you the nft dev build your nft product there is a link in the show notes to get started with this spiffy new SDK from inferior that's really cool inferior of course started with ethereum nodes now they're providing a full nft API SDK for the devs go check that out David before we get in we have some disclosures to make of course you can always find all of our disclosures on our disclosure page at banklist.com disclosures just want to let the bankless audience know we are advisors to zksync we are friends of the project we believe in its Mission we believe in scaling ethereum through ZK EVMS that is not why they're on the podcast today they're on the podcast today because they built something they launched something really big David what should folks pay attention to going to this episode this is truly a new frontier we all know what a roll-up is we have experienced these Roll-Ups with polygon arbitrum and optimism these are a different kind of roll up this is a new unlock and so uh simply put ZK evm ZK Roll-Ups have more scale but if you just think that they are optimistic Roll-Ups with more scale you're going to miss a force for the trees and that is a conversation that we have in this episode there are specific and unique new use cases that the ZK roll zkevms unlock that are not unlocked by optimistic rollups and so this is a this is a new frontier there are there's new treasure out here there are new things to build there's new optionality for devs to build cool new things that optimistic Roll-Ups even though we love them as much as we do just don't offer uh and so as you are listening to this episode dear listener perhaps Dev listener uh try to identify what those new opportunities lie and we name some specific ones but really it's up to your imagination because right now many new ZK EVMS are coming online they are all relatively blank slates of opportunity and we've we've played this game before we all remember maybe not all of us but I remember a time when ethereum was just a layer one and now there's been a bunch of layer layer two opportunities uh now we get to experience that all over again with the ZK evm Revolution with ZK sync leading the charge uh so right that is my long rant about what listeners should pay attention to in this episode yeah here you go guys we we told you later two summer was coming we've been telling you for two years it's here how do we know that because we're shipping to mainnet that's how you know go try this out of course there'll be some risks in the episode you can listen to that but this is an opportunity for you to get on board to the ZK evm platform guys we're gonna get right to the episode but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible included our number one

having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web3 Bank First Nation we are here with the matter Labs team matter Labs the creators of ZK sync we got Alex glukowski the co-founder and CEO of matter Labs he has been on the podcast before Alex welcome back to the show hi David hi Ryan hi hello everyone pleasure to be here and new to Bankers we have Anthony Rose Anthony Rose is the head of engineering at matter labs and has a background in software and machine learning interestingly enough prior to joining matter Labs Anthony spent a number of years in the industry building teams at SpaceX but pretty cool that we snagged him for the crypto World Anthony welcome to the show thanks a lot uh yeah very happy to be here so we always love Frontier metaphors here at bankless and with this announcement that we're going to walk through today we have discovered a new frontier to explore can you guys walk us through the announcement of what you guys are dropping today what what is the big news uh well the ZK sync era they uh our zkvm solution is now open to the users everyone can now start using it it's a consummation of the launch which took a a very long time but that's also the beginning of the new journey and that's that all right we're we're wrapped the network is live it's here and it's fine okay but what does this mean Alex kind of walk us through the significance of this can you kind of place this into perhaps even like ethereum's history why is this a significant thing both for matter labs and zkasync and why is this significant for ethereum at large I genuinely think it's significant for ethereum is a large because zkavms have been considered the uh Holy Grail of scaling ethereum from from the Inception of this concept uh it took a very long time it people thought it's going to take much longer but here we are and this is really the the pivotal point for ethereum where the real Mass adoption with like full preservation of all the things that make ethereum valuable really begins we will talk about those things but this is where uh you know we there is by now I think a broad consensus that is your knowledge um tag zkeral specifically and more specifically ZK VMS is this pass into the future and it has multiple reasons and there's also a new name for this network can you walk us through this uh new brand for for ZK sync uh yes we we really think it's New Era for Humanity where you can uh fully own yourself your assets your identity all of your transactions so for us uh we started the kissing four years ago with the uh from day one there was a mission there we want to accelerate the mass adoption of crypto we love the ideas from Bitcoin we loved ethereum uh we love those Technologies because they open Humanity to more freedom gives you the ability to to actually you know uh transact with anyone in the world without barriers without asking for permission without Banks without any kind of intermediaries and um it was revolutionary it's for the first time in history that we we have this Technologies of global ski cooperation without the trust assumptions and for me the question was like how can we bring it to anyone in the world what needs to happen to get there and it was clear that a few things must be changed or must be invented and implemented uh we we had a long way to improve the ux people had to build applications people had to build wallets and all the infrastructure around the crypto but there was this one technical problem of scaling which seemed impossible from the point of view of technologies that we had four years ago when they stumbled upon the the idea of ZK proofs 16 their knowledge proofs or better call them proofs of computational Integrity or snarks uh it was this aha moment where like I thought wow this could be it this like it feels like magic like not clear why it works but it works and you can really verify any number of transactions with a single lightweight Hardware like your cell phone or a full node or Raspberry Pi and uh there is no limit you can you can you do one verification all the blocks all the transactions are processed So you you're not breaking out of the blockchain or you're you are breaking out of a bookshelf you're not introducing new truss assumptions you don't have to trust anyone you still verify everything uh but in a trustless way so the new name is called uh ZK sync era that's what uh you are launching with and uh certainly we are living in an interesting era in interesting times um David and I have done so many podcasts this week and I think we will next week and probably the weeks to come about a bank crisis that seems to be going on in the United States and Europe and other parts of the world uh we're not sure how far this will spread or what all of the implications are we're still trying to unpack that as is everyone else but the root of it is kind of a you know a meta banking crisis that we will probably never be able to resolve in the existing banking system and that is we cannot verify transactions we don't know if the dollars in our account are actually backed or what they're backed by this is the the promise of something like a technology like ethereum uh the reason ethereum has fallen short on living up to that promise so far is it hasn't been scalable as of yet although a lot of talented Engineers have been working on that including matter labs and now here we have a ZK evm launching on chain on mainnet and available with the next stage of that promise uh being fulfilled for ethereum and I gotta say well um the world is kind of on fire in various ways uh crypto is silently building this new scalable infrastructure that we hope and I know you guys hope can onboard the world into this bankless money system so um congrats and thank you for shipping this is hugely it's it's a Monumental event that we have a ZK evm in production on mainnet uh and uh you guys have been doing fantastic work in the in the background to make that happen one question I have for you is um we've talked to uh many layer twos um you know previously on Bank lists our listeners will be familiar with this um what kind of staged rollout might we see at this point so when you guys say it's available on mainnet it's here uh what does that mean what's the user experience are there gates are there still kind of um you know places that are off limits for now or is this fully enabled fully permissionless fully open can you talk about that for a minute I am happy to talk about that but before that I just want to say thank you for for all the good works and I I also want to extend this gratitude to the entire Community to all the people who were contributing work to first of all to all the employees of metal labs and all the all the people who we worked with um to make this happen and to all the people who contributed to the creation of zero knowledge proofs to the creation of ethereum to bitcoin like all of this Technologies we're standing on the shoulders of giant uh of giants it's not an isolated thing everything is interconnected and everything is contributing to to everyone's else's work so this is really a combination of the work of the entire Community it's not just our children so to the user experience and what to expect from uh from the minute uh the staged rollout is here in fact it started a long time ago we launched we deployed the existing uh maina contract with the address that everyone can see now and if you look carefully at the address you might know this interesting thing is about it um half a year ago so it was the the first moment where we we touched the magnet uh as we promised that FCC back in summer uh we started experimenting with it ourselves internally we conducted a number of security Audits and we a bunch of stress tests and and a lot of things a lot of experimentation a lot of learnings from from operating the mayonnet and we opened it to developers about a month ago so the builders who registered uh could deploy their applications Bridge their their whatever tokens they wanted if or or your C20 tokens and start building and start experimenting on the test net or certain on the mainland the test net is live for for over a year and have has processed uh I think something like 8 million transactions right now so um this time we are opening the gates to everyone we actually started onboarding the users also two weeks ago at eat Denver where we uh sponsored the uh food truck experience so all the people who got the food truck tokens from with Denver could use them in a very limited way not interacting with spark contracts but just using uh using them to pay for food trucks using our account obstruction feature but now it's it's opening to everyone so what you can do you can Bridge your assets onto our education era you can start interacting with projects that are live from day one every day we expect to see more and more products go in live we know that the pipeline of projects uh uh about to deploy is much longer than I know it's currently live and we encourage everyone to do it gradually and only move smaller amounts and and do things you know like don't risk a lot because it's a brand new technology that has never been tested before it has never been used in production before until now so we we don't want to rush we want to uh you know to take the maximum cautious approach to this so what what it means in practice for the users um the basically there are no limitations except that withdrawals will be delayed by some small time frame so the withdrawals or finalization of the blocks rather to say initially is going to happen after 24 hours uh from the moment of the book commitment uh we're we're soon we'll reduce this time to several hours and eventually want to get rid of it once we get rid of the word Alpha in in the name of of the network right now it's in Alpha so the the contracts are upgradable there is yet not see no security Council like treated as a as a guarded managed Network that is life in production it's fully available No Limits but it's still in kind of this test flight mode okay so the the theme park is opening Gates of the theme park Parker opening users can go in uh there are some rides there some of these rides might might throw you off and like you know might have a bad time on the roller coaster so be careful there's caution tastes right now around some of these things only only uh cross the line if you were an Explorer if you're on the frontier as I know many Bank list listeners are but once they're there let someone else go first yeah I'll let David go first JK I'll be there uh so um but but like what can we actually do there when when we get there so you mentioned some projects uh are launching have launched so what are some of these early theme rides I know more will be added over time of course but is there you know what would be kind of the you know your first recommendation on on a project or a place to visit once folks have bridged across to ZK sync era I I don't want to pick to pick favorites you just go to ecosystem.kissing.io and you will see the status of the project who is live who is not live and you can just experiment to come from there all right well well said incredibly neutral approach yeah I I wanted to emphasize like we we really we are doing uh our best to remain fully neutral from all aspects so we we have not like we opened the uh the main ad to developers with the white listed um uh registration but we have not centered a single application like everyone who applied could use the the network so it was more for us to gather contacts and to be in touch with those people but not to prevent anyone from launching so we're following a strict Fair launch approach we're not going to take any favorites to like push them to make them special case we want to create an even playing field for everyone this is really important that's cool okay so Anthony and Alex cannot pick favorites but of course David and I can so we'll go test this out and we'll probably release some updates in the bank list newsletter about some of our favorite places to visit uh Anthony did you want to say something too just I would definitely recommend taking a look at the page that Alex mentioned regarding the ecosystem there is a sort of uh huge cross-section of the projects that many people will be familiar from layer one but some of the other things that are exciting are you know the projects that are building sort of layer 2 native and you know thinking through what you can do in an environment with uh you know higher transaction throughput much lower fees you actually start to open up the design space for applications um because we often get this question about you know what what do you expect people to build at Layer Two um but I feel like maybe I have a very bad imagination but if I like rewind the clock I don't think I would have predicted you know some of the really interesting things we've seen in the world of D5 I definitely wouldn't have predicted some of the you know really interesting use cases for nfts so you know for me the exciting thing about layer 2 is also you know I wonder what we'll see next and uh some other sort of creative ideas that you can build in an environment that like unlocks application development that isn't maybe economically prohibited in the way it might have been at later one yeah and and Anthony I got more of uh engineering questions but really just to drive this point home if to make this just super cleanly obvious I know we have this uh drop down menu in metamask for example when we need to switch to arbitrum or optimism and we expect to see just ZK sync just added to that network list as soon as you add the RPC endpoint inside of metamask so now you know arbitrum polygon optimism ZK sync the first ZK evm to be added in in this drop down menu I'm excited to see that that logo there but Anthony uh this is different because it's a zkev I'm not an optimistic roll up optimistic Roll-Ups have the benefit of just being able to be basically clones of ethereum like microcosms of ethereum uh but this is different and so as the head of engineering I can't imagine a more intimidating job to be the head of engineering of a ZK evm I I could think of one David maybe launching launching Rockets right good touche uh so Anthony like wins security is another interesting thing yeah yeah we have a whole entire security conversation to talk about but as it comes to teams that are onboarding from regular old ethereum layer one or other layer twos what are the engineering challenges about that uh what are the engineering challenges that I don't even know to ask about like how big of a lift is this whole thing and how do you expect to get new projects migrated onto zksync yeah this is a great question and obviously something we think a huge amount about um I would say that a lot of the uh the way that we're thinking about this is broadly you know attempt to make decisions with uh like developer first in mind you know obviously the engineering team we are engineers and we think about uh the people that we're building for so first approximation I mean are also developers you know we have a system that ultimately we expect the application layer to add value to you know eventually millions and tens of millions of users but in terms of the design decisions that we make the people that are probably affected most directly particularly today are the developers who are going to be building on suitcasing so we do think a lot about uh you know uh good ux and the good ux is not just uh the user experience but also the developer experience so when it comes to building on era or migrating from say layer one or another evm compatible Layer Two the goal is to reduce that friction as much as is possible you know we've invested heavily in building a compiler such that we are source code compatible that to a first approximation most teams um experience in terms of like you know migrating from layer one onto the test net or now the mainnet has been that sort of things just worked you know you can take the contracts that you originally developed for for ethereum or for you know whatever other Layer Two it happened to be recompile with the zksync compiler and redeploy and to a first approximation this has been uh you know it's a kind of a good and bad thing for us during the test net phase because you want lots of feedback but in cases where things just work you know the the experience is sometimes smooth and there's not a lot for developers to say um there are differences though you know we are building a virtual machine which is uh optimized with uh the future in mind you know a lot of the design decisions that we've been making are not so much based on you know what's the what are the properties of the system that we want to see exist today day but really you know what are the design decisions that are going to allow us to extend the future in a way that makes sense where we're talking about where we really want to be you know projecting forward six months 12 months 24 months in as we mature the system you know the version of the system that will be going live or is going live today is very much an alpha you know in the same uh way that I think many teams think about building you know the approach that we've taken is let's build the core critical pieces of the system let's make design decisions today that set us up not just for the system you know to make good architectural choices for the system we want to see immediately but really provide a firm foundation on which we can like build and extend towards the future um so we've extensively documented areas that I think are unique to ZK sync and where we've made design decisions that deviate from what people might expect elsewhere and some of these are where we've made sort of opinionated decisions that are in our opinion probably uh you know going to provide a nice feature set for uh interesting and uh you know powerful application development I think Native account obstruction is a good example you know there is if the idea was to just go as fast as we could to build the system and get something on midnight you almost certainly would have you know not attempted to take on a project like that an extension like that uh so for us you know this is a really exciting time we have uh sort of the combination of two years plus of engineering work um finally you know really really uh ready for for the external world to engage with in a way that we're excited about um but there's so much more to come and you know this is sort of one step on a very very long journey as we really extend the system into the future and Anthony really just asking the Bare Bones simple question what does all of this engineering effort get us uh again we are familiar with arbitrom and optimism but when we zoom zoom out and look at the massive engineering lift that is a ZK evm and we try and look at the forest for the trees like transactions on arbitrum pretty damn cheap you know like these ecosystems are are pretty live what does the ZK part of this whole thing really unlock for us that's new and just as it relates to the user experience and user story and perhaps the applications that can also be built yeah I think the the ZK part and the reason why I think I would argue this is critically important in the fullness of time is really about that trustlessness and that security like inheriting those properties that I think broadly you know everyone at matalabs and and probably many of the listeners listeners like these are the properties of ethereum that resonates so deeply and the question is you know how do we take on this serious problem the scalability problem without compromising these in in any serious degree so the proof of computational Integrity like the guarantee of the correctness of the state transition of of the layer 2 is really the thing that I think today you can point at and say this is this is a massive step forward in the fullness of time I think you know when we're talking about hyperscale when we're talking about really you know uh sort of projecting the application layer much further into the future talking about Millions tens of millions hundreds of millions of users we believe that it is also true that the ZK like the this uh trustless aspect of the system is going to provide you know this uh this future architecture that can support hyperscale where you can have multiple instances trustlessly able to sort of communicate and move move data or move value between them Alex I just have a follow-up on that too just to um make this crystal clear so what can you do with a ZK evm that you can't with an optimistic roll up so is it to do with fraud proofs is it to do with like lower transactions uh lower cost transactions what is kind of like the bottom line and if we're not here yet what do we hope we can we can get to from kind of a user experience perspective this is a great question I would split it into two separate groups the first group of like the first sensor will cover all the kvms what are the kvms fundamentally give you over optimistic Roll-Ups or any other scaling Solutions or specifically optimistic problems because anything else about Roll-Ups doesn't really matter in in the ethereum world and the second group a second answer will be about the specifics of like what you can get if you use the ZK technology to its maximum so to answer the first one ZK roll-ups basically allow you to bridge faster like the what what the users will feel like apart from security and trust us as guarantees that you get the tangible result of using ZK over optimistic Roll-Ups is to be able to bridge faster back to ethereum uh you don't have to wait seven days period you don't even have to wait this 24 hours which I mentioned before because that's just a training wheel which is going to be removed can Bridge immediately now you probably don't really want to bridge back a lot from from the roll up to to layer one because Roll-Ups are here to enable scale like layer 1 is going to remain for uh very few use cases which require some specific things to happen in the layer 1 context most of users most of applications will live in a layer 2 space but there will be a very important use case of bridging between the roll-ups and if you're bridging between optimistic Roll-Ups or between a optimistic and Zeke roll-up you always will fall back on the longest wait period when optimistic case it's it's like the seven days um and you can't really accelerate that like you can you can only accelerate that by using you know like external Capital using some other things that that work in you can't accelerate it without taking on additional risk or uh additional value cost requirements yeah understood okay so you can't really so that that means like you you basically can't accelerate without having some trust assumptions introduced injected into the system if we want to build a truly Limitless internet of value internet of roll-ups it has to be trustless so all the bridges must be ZK and that means that all the chains participating in this network have to be CK chains this is our vision for hyperscalability this is probably this is a much bigger topic that will require several conversation but this is long term what the what DK attack will give you like infiniteness or Limitless of scale but then there is the second aspect um it only applies if you use um zkvm in a specific way so you you might opt to be as close to ethereum as possible and just emulate optimistic Roll-Ups and this is what we see uh many zkdm projects that are currently existing in in development are doing they are going for this like let's get as close as possible to this old system as be backwards compatible let's do um data availability management the way optimistic Roll-Ups do let's publish data availability for every transaction let's publish the inputs of transactions for example as as one thing and we here is where we deviate from all of them from all these ekv apps in existence today uh we decided to look at ZK proofs and ask themselves like what is what what can it give you if you like what's the the best way you can use them and uh we decided for example that we want to um to manage data availability by publishing this state diffs so like the updates of the of the storage slots that the transaction touches and that gives you uh a few very interesting properties for one it gives you free call data you don't have to pay for call data for transaction inputs um to like you don't have to pay for data availability of this you're only paying your knowledge proofs and the general Electro generation is cheap and it's only going to get cheaper so it's just a fraction of a set that that that is not important so you can have a very large input you can process a lot of data which is very important for such use cases as account obstruction because in account extraction you want to submit you know like you you're you you have your user key that controls the account but then you want to submit some limits for this transaction you want to submit the custom signature that maybe you you signed on your iPhone in a secure Enclave maybe you want to submit some additional metadata for the trading routes and limits that you want to take on on on interacting with smart contracts all of that will come essentially for free so that's one big game second big game is data compression that is imagine a use case such as Oracle updates on optimistic rollups and on ZK VMS that use this optimistic approach optimistic grow up approach to data availability you would have to pay data availability for each individual Oracle update and remember data availability is our scarce resource that's what all Roll-Ups share like there is a single limited bandwidth of data availability on ethereum it doesn't matter how how scalable your ZK proofs are in circuits you still have to like share that and like all the Roll-Ups compete for this limited space so the more transactions we have they we will see the same dynamics that the transaction prices will go up uh so Oracle updates you have to pay individually for each of them with optimistic approach with what we're doing you're only going to pay the final price for the for a single storage slots at the end of the huge batch so you can do the Oracle updates as frequently as you want you can do them every second they still will be trustless they will still be feeding you you can you can use a lot of oracles uh but then they're going to be much cheaper and the same thing applies to all use cases where users interact with the same contract with the same data or with change in data for that matter within the one single patch and the batch can be very large for example uh trading on on liquidity pools like unit swap pools you do a lot of Trades but at the end you only pay for one or all the users in the device will pay for so that that is that is to data compression and finally you can do data extension uh there was the architecture we introduced a long time ago called ZK Porter which is a variation of of a validio system where the data some of the data does not need to be published on ethereum some accounts or for some specific use cases you don't need the absolute 100 security inherited from ethereum you only need this the validity of your transactions to be guaranteed by ethereum so that no one can do wrong things but the data maybe it's discardable maybe it's you know it's just some one-time voting campaign or maybe it's it's a wallet that you only use for some small you know like your current account where you put a little money and you don't want to pay huge fees but you want to do a lot of cheap transactions you can use the keyporter for that and in our architecture ziki Porter will be seamlessly interoperable with the zkirola which is not possible again if you if you're using um the transaction inputs so those are things around just one specific aspect so Alex just uh just kind of from the user perspective uh bridging much faster it can be instant that that can't happen in optimistic roll up you know you have kind of seven days and this will reap many benefits uh just curious on kind of a way a user experiences what you just uh said that optimization that efficiency so if like a mainnet transaction costs a dollar on ethereum right and something like um an optimistic roll up gets it down to like you know 10 cents or maybe five cents or maybe one cent or something is our ZK Roll-Ups and uh is a ZK sync error going to deliver another order of magnitude lower cost on transactions that's one like this may be a Damon's question to you but this is one way users see it is like are my track transaction is going to be cheaper another way I I want to ask the same question is like um I remember the early days of arbitrim deploying they were like Hey we're deploying mainnet um this is our first deployment we still have some guardrails on we have just increased the capacity of ethereum by one so we just shipped one more ethereums and that was easy for bankless listeners to understand and and then they delivered some efficiency and they were like now we have three more ethereums right um can you give us some comparable seven now okay there's seven ethereums there how many ethereums are we gonna get out of ZK sync how low can our gas fees go uh we will get at least as many as optimistic Roll-Ups give you but in addition to that for it depends on the use case for for some transaction types it will be comparable to optimistic Roll-Ups just because it's an individual transaction you still have to pay for it full data availability but for other transactions you will have to pay zero fees because the contract will subsidize this transaction and this is possible with account obstruction this is possible because it we support it natively and the from the economic perspective for for this uh for this protocol it will make sense because they are only subsidizing it once for all the users because they will be then reusing the same data availability storage and the the this gives you like hundreds ethereums or thousands of ethereums but from the user perspective like the magic is really you don't have to pay anything it's like the transaction is completely gas free um and it's like this is why it was important to implement it natively unfortunately things like EAP uh 4337 would not allow this to be on ethereum even if you use this these three layers if you you agree to use this third party relayer they still cannot do it for externally owned accounts which are most wallets uh in an effort today but it's possible indication so the idea of like how many ethereums do we get is a very easy way to just imagine this and the answer is with ZK sync we get a lot of ethereums we would see with CK Tech but I don't want to double down yes I really want to double down on like that there's this idea of this uh the the some of the parts I always mess up this the whole yeah the whole screen the whole is greater than some of the parts thank you that's the Kickstart I needed so yes we get we get more ethereums we get more scale uh things get cheaper there are also faster but it's not such a just a linear as like oh we can do things cheaper and faster it's more than that not only do you get cheaper and faster which enables new use cases like oracles uh we can have more oracles because more oracles become viable we have more use cases because more use cases become viable we have native account abstraction because account extraction becomes viable we have cross ZK evm composability because that is now viable you have instantaneous withdrawals to layer one and that's with uh now viable all of these use cases can relate to each other and offer surface area for Builders to extract the value out of those interrelations that specifically zkevms create so understanding like yeah we get 10 ethereums is like a great way to start but also you get the level of composability that ethereum created in a zero to one moment from like Bitcoin to ethereum on the app layer and smart contracts we have like another zero to one moment in terms of use case composability because of the instantaneous nature of ZK Tech across all use cases in addition to the raw uh cheapness of the transactions that in of itself also unlocks New Economic uh activity and so I like this is a kind of a tough idea to wrap people's head around so like all of these security dependencies but I really think like the whole the sum is greater than the whole of the parts I think it's a great like mental model to be left with when we walk away from I mean my mental model here David anytime you say that and by the way that always gives me shivers when you when you go on your ZK EVMS are amazing uh you know play it's just like it's gonna feel just like fintech it's gonna feel just like the best fintech platform you've ever used except now you're not dependent on the banks like and I'm not saying now I'm not saying day one I'm not saying like when you guys release but when we get account abstraction and smart contracts and everything David already said we we developed that app layer it's just going to feel like a web 2 app except it's completely backed by you know trust trustless guarantees and crypto Economic Security which is with the amazing thing is that about right or are we like overselling it yes absolutely right and and I just just have one thing to add like if you throw ziki Porter into this mix then you you basically get infinite number of almost ethereums which is coming very very close to the security guarantees of ethereum not quite there but like it's it's good for for a lot of good things and you can get infinitely many of them so like so this infinite part is really important like or I should rather say not infinite because it's a mathematical term Limitless we want to get to a point where there are no limits on how many users we can accommodate how many transactions how many things can run in parallel this trustlessly is only possible with ZK attack and if we want it to be on ethereum then it's only possible the CK evm so that all the applications can leave on all those infinite parallel chains that are like like this Multiverse world of multi Roll-Ups interconnected interbridgeable maybe just a echo something you said there because I think you really captured at least you know a sort of reflection of how we think about this that I think is really important to highlight you know when you first start thinking about scale it can feel like an infrastructure problem right it can feel like how do we optimize the system to be able to process lots of transactions drive down fees and if can start to feel very much like this is really the way to think about solving the scalability problem but actually I don't think that's enough right it's account abstraction because if the if we don't address the user experience that I think many of us have like you know come to learn to live with at layer one this isn't for everybody right you know it's still true today that I think the user experience at layer one can feel uh you know janky awkward at times even scary you know when you're uh you know moving substantial value this you you know it's not a super friendly experience at times and I think it's that sort of combination of both tackling those architecture problems so you know thinking about how you think about performance thinking about how you drive down fees but then also you know you do need to have an environment in which people can build applications that millions of people will want to use and millions of people won't be uh you know forced to confront some like awkward user experience just to engage with the system um so I do think you know what what we're working towards you kind of have as an infrastructure problem but as a user experience problem as well and I think account abstraction is like a critically important part of solving that part yeah yeah well said well said Anthony and I really just want to drive this point home one more time like Ryan and I infinitely bullish on optimistic relapse we love all of our layer twos um but linear scaling is not going to be like the quote-unquote Broadband moment that made the internet into what it is today like Once Upon a Time internet 1.0 was a text-based forum experience where jpegs loaded over 10 minutes right and now we have YouTube and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter that was a Broadband moment that was a zero to one Paradigm Shift uh and you know optimistic rollups are great for adding you know single digit more ethereums to layer twos but really like the linear scale isn't really going to take uh this revolution that we are all trying to make people uh feel into the mainstream and it's really going to take uh what is uh you know more more than 10 ethereums but then also the second order consequences that I also Illustrated so uh this is just what I really want to impress upon listeners about why this CK cryptography magic is is so impactful uh Alex Anthony I want to ask you a few more questions in a couple of different categories uh polygon ZK evm hot on your guys's heels we want to talk about about how ZK sinks era is different what are you what is the era chain optimized for what have you guys really emphasized here and prioritize and what is your competitive differentiator between the other ZK EVMS that are coming onto the scene uh and so I want to ask about that and overall just like where does this go from here what are the next steps what are the short-term goals and long-term Milestones that we should all be paying attention to as the scene develops but first before we get to these conversations a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft the aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer salon is taking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide your uglies burn the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February Baker station we are back with Alex and Anthony of ZK sync of matter Labs with a brand new ZK sync era main net launch once again congratulations guys Alex I've heard over and over and over again that you have this incredible backstory uh and why Trust useless cryptography so important to you I've been hounding you for a podcast for now for a while now and we'll eventually get that one recorded but I want to ask you about how zksync era has come to express certain priorities what is it really doubling down on what makes it unique there are so many other not so many there are other ZK EVMS that are coming onto mainnet I believe CKC might be first I think that's right uh but why is ZK sync era different than the Alternatives that are out there on the scene I can highlight a few things which I think are are really at the core of the kissing and uh I think it makes them different I mean there might be other projects who also want to embrace these ideas and Implement them who will be really happy to see the space uh get a richer through it but I think what what defines us is the these three core priorities number one alignment with on ethos with ethereum with the general crypto Community we are here for a mission we have always been there for a mission and will always be there for action it's not a commercial project in the first place it's it's a mission-driven project it's a mission we're not a company we are really a mission uh our mission is to accelerate the method option of crypto or to say it's simpler to scale freedom we're in it for freedom because freedom is the uh what empowers people what good creates wealth what creates uh fairness in the world what lets people uh you know defend themselves against corrupt regimes corrupt uh interest institutions and so on so like freedom is is everything that like the the end goal and also the way we operate the matter Labs the company the our team is structured in a way that everyone has uh very broad autonomy very broad ownership over our topics and uh and they they they own them um freedom to operate the way they want so freedom is number one uh and Ethos uh number two is we are um we prioritize security it's really important for us like we understand that this is a space where there is basically no margin for error and you can't rush and you can't cut Corners because one big mistake and throw the entire space like years back because the trust in the undermine so we're we're taking security very seriously and we we are like we are anti-hype in this regard we always emphasize this we always push we always like from from all the choices that we can make we take the one which is most safe now that doesn't guarantee that like things will not happen and like this is again my my uh attempt to to convince everyone to take things slower not rush experiment with only with with like this very high risk awareness so security is number two and number three is we are in for a very long run we understand that this space will only succeed if we all run marathon not a Sprint so we are building things for the future that might set us back slightly in the beginning like you know like we're not going for a fully VM equivalence it would obviously be easier to just like go for fully VM equivalence and have like all the applications not like not to have to change a single line of code no one is really doing that no one no one can do that like the some modifications are required in any roll-up no matter of Mr crazy okay it's just the degree of the specifications that various and we're not going to optimize that part we are optimizing for the future not for the past this future orientedness is the third priority so two to recap values uh security and building for the future Alex we're on this new frontier there's a bunch of new use cases that we're all very excited about there's also new risks uh and so as users come and use zksync as Builders build on zksync what are the new concerns what are the new risks that they might need to be uh informed about um certainly uh there are let's begin with this like this is a brand new technology so we have like just basic systematic risks of like any smart contract that you deploy uh needs to be tested with time you know like recently we had the uh back in uh Euler uh finance that has been lived there for eight months and it has been audited and and there was still this bug and it was like exploited see you you need time you need to put a significant stake at risk and and then like bottle test it uh but then um even that is not enough you you have you you want to put in more mechanisms more mitigations like layers of security like if one thing fails you always want better things to to rely on but like things happen even even planes can can fall you know like so like even if you take it with uh the most conservative approach this complex systems have inherent risks it's really hard to predict where in the complex system risk and can materialize so that's why you want to build systems that are as simple as possible as isolated as possible if you have a multiple subsystems they should work through clearly defined interfaces and you want some guards between those interfaces but like really from the end user perspective it's it's hard to say what can go wrong you know so uh the basically the the the the the only scene approach would be like take things carefully yeah my uh my take on this is how we end every bankless podcast by the way we're not ending right now but uh recall bankless Nation what we say crypto is risky D5 is risky you could lose what you put in this is the frontier right and that's really where we are we're on the frontier of the frontier with some of this ZK uh evm technology we wouldn't rather be anywhere else this is where we want to be and yet at the same time uh your explorers and you know uh things can happen on the frontier for sure um one I I think I guess trade-off or a decision point for any roll-up team to make is kind of this trade-off between security and decentralization and maybe that's not even the right the right Vector but a lot of teams have needed to keep um access uh like maybe we'll call it root level access to be able to make changes and modifications to a a roll-up in case something goes wrong in case funds are locked and that sort of thing can you talk to us about the path towards full decentralization because I have to imagine this is somewhat similar to other roll-up implementations in that stage one is not fully decentralized yet you have some safeguards in place you have some train training wheels in place and we we would probably expect that right I mean you want to make sure that you can unlock the keys if you lock them in the car um Anthony I'm wondering if you talk about this path to decentralization and and uh how ZK sync is thinking about this maybe if you allow me to to begin uh because I I was part of this journey with ziki sync version one which we can now call as a kiss and quiet and I just just want to touch a little bit on those yeah go for it I I I would say like this is a choice or dilemma between um security and trustlessness not so much decentralization at this point like decentralization is is a broader concept but here you're really asking yourself am I going to keep um some trust assumptions with on the team or do I want to go fully trustless but then no one can intervene and fix my problems that's right so we encountered that back uh when we launched the the first roll-up uh education Collide the Ezekiel roll up specialized in payments uh this very first version was completely immutable with a dying locked upgrade ability where with the team could propose an upgrade uh but there was no way for us to accelerate it it was it would take several weeks and the users would have an option to uh to withdraw from uh layer 2 to layer one fully permissionlessly without any censorship through layer 1 emergency hatch or like the priority queue uh we then realized that it's not going to uh it's no problem to do this because there was a vulnerability and we we had to uh to make an upgrade and Luckily everything was fine but like we realized it it's really important um to go slower and introduce some trust assumptions in the system so so that because the probability of a bug is much higher initially at least for even from the user perspective from external user perspective then the probability that the team is going to be corrupt so for the alpha we decided that we we just gonna introduce the instant upgradability for for the kissing era uh for uh for light what we did was we came up with the concept of Security Council we we were the first introduce this idea where we said let's summon a group of Highly trusted community members from ethereum Community we had 15 of them and it will require their permission and approval to accelerate an upgrade for an emergency use case thank you for using emergency then the team can propose and upgrade the security Council can improve it and then it pulls faster on The Fast Track bypassing the this upgradability uh time lock and this is the next stage which we will use for error like after we feel the the the then the the protocol is stable enough and mature enough we will transition to Security Council but we don't want to stop there because the Security Council is also a um you know there is is this like set of people that can can basically do anything with the protocol even though it's a broad set of people we it's not what we want the crypto to be so for for the ultimate Vision we can imagine um going beyond that and lowering trust assumptions even further so for example we could say that the security Council can only initiate freezing of the protocol not immediately upgrading but only freezing for a short period of time and then we could rely on a broader protocol governance to decide what's going to happen with with it with this problem is this are you problem or was the security Council corrupt if it was a real problem then the the governance can approve an upgrade path forward and we can go in even further from there what if the governance if you know if we have some broad Community uh participating through I don't know some means to decentralize it maybe we have token maybe you have like we have we have to to like the token holders have to vote for it but what if the majority of the token holders is again corrupt then we would like we we need to save the minority because that's what crypto is standing for full trustlessness not relying on honest majorities So eventually we can build a system where the security Council could freeze the contracts and then it would take the soft Fork of the layer 1 itself to resolve the conflict if if there is any problem there so this is my rough thinking wow I see that Ryan wants to ask something no I was just gonna say that's really cool um you know well spelled out and we're I guess we're in the first stage where the team still has uh some of the control and then you're moving to Security Council later and then you limit the powers of the security Council and then you have some sort of governance uh coordination and ultimately it's kind of fork Choice rule in the same way that uh ethereum or Bitcoin are on the main net that's pretty cool Anthony do you have anything to add to this I mean I think Alex has subbed up really nicely but one thing to say maybe just to to try and be unambiguous like the plan for the alpha label is essentially to be a very strong signal to the community to developers to users about our sort of internal security posture and confidence in the state of the system we aren't expecting for example there to be sort of this uh Journey Through the Greek alphabet of like now we're Alfred now we're in beta it's really more this once this as long as this Alpha label is attached to the system this is meant to kind of imply that we're in this early phase where there are these trust assumptions I mean you can look at tools I think there's this um maybe many people are familiar with this uh really beautiful page put together by the l2b team regarding sort of risks across the L2 space phenomenally helpful and a huge amount of work has gone to try and distill a lot of this sort of complexity when when people have to think about the risk in these systems but even you know you look at that tool and you realize the problem for users is uh a there's many of these systems and B the the risk space is complex and to have like a principled you know internal opinion on the risks of all of these different systems when you're not an expert is extremely difficult and I would say maybe even impossibly difficult for most users because the opportunity cost of even reading you know every single one of these things is extremely high so for us the alpha label is our signal to the community about like our posture here and we will attempt to be extremely unambiguous when we're talking about risk uh and we're talking about uh you know and we'll be releasing a huge amount more security as Alex mentioned before is uh always uh top of mind for us and I think we've got a track record at this point of of that being you know us having a serious commitment to that um but it's that Alpha label that will will attempt to distill everything into it to a degree for users by nature of this new technology this new frontier the risks are present today yet there is still a bunch of building to do in the app layer with all the builders and so all the cool fun stuff that we can imagine in the future still needs to be built yet uh the the risks are always here on day one so that is always just a word of caution for for all the users out there but Anthony with all of this uh future state of the you know ethereum's Broadband moment uh everything that ZK Tech can really unlock for ethereum what do Builders need to know uh is there's so much left there's so much room for activities on ZK sync uh how do Builders find out what they need to do in order to start building on zkc and where's the top of the funnel for this rabbit hole for the builders yeah it's a excellent question so um I would say you know if you wanted to get started as a builder on zksync we have uh overhauled all of our documentation in the sort of build up towards uh this moment and over the last few months and we've also attempted to be thoughtful about how we uh you know consider the focus for this documentation so much overlaps in terms of what you can do with L1 given the evm compatibility so you'll see that where we've deviated from L1 or where we have sort of uh you know new things available at L2 there'll be uh just a much richer set of documentation you know we focused on things like account obstruction things like Bridges um so in terms of the documentation there is a a lot there is also a lot of uh focus on the specifics uh that become available for you when you're thinking about working on on zksync era um beyond that we have an extremely active and passionate uh Community the Discord is very very active we're growing you know devrel and Dev experience teams so we have both you know a highly engaged Community but also lots of technical support um and so for sort of real-time conversations about you know you'll have this idea I'm thinking through how I implement this Lindsay kissing or I've run into this issue and I'm trying to work work my way through it um there's multiple channels but but definitely the the Discord is uh fun and helpful uh so both technical support and uh you know lots of interesting Community memes and bits and pieces well we all get the the links to the Discord in the docs into the show notes but and also Anthony what's the the link for the users out there the the ecosystem applications link where they can go check all those out if you could just say that one more time yeah sure so uh if anyone wants to see the state of what they can um engage with on the system today it's just e cases ecosystem.zksync.io this will be a page with very frequent updates in the coming weeks as as more and more Builders deploy and configure applications and yeah Things become available for for users to test basically users can find all links from zksync.io it's it's the central Hopper beautiful Alex Anthony Saint thank you so much for walking us through this announcement is extremely exciting there's a New Frontiers and we love this Frontier metaphor here on Bank list uh not too many people know that ZK sync was actually one of the first ZK Roll-Ups not evm ZK Roll-Ups where people could process payments I remember using it back in 2019 on git coin so it was a a way that I got started uh bootstrapping my own content production here in the ethereum ecosystem and Ryan in the bankless uh get coin as well so we have things to give you guys for that as well uh Alex I know you've been in this space a very long time Anthony you're a little bit newer but I know that this topic is very very large and very very big is there anything that we haven't touched on yet today in the show that that we absolutely must before we close out here I would just add that uh we're still growing our team and uh if you are feeling like you want to help us scale ethereum and create this trustless future please check out the the drop drops that we have opened on our website I'm sure there's a lot of milestones and developments ahead of us um when might one of those Milestones involve a token the next things that we're focusing on is really decentralization so well they making the system fully permissionless removing any points of trust any points of uh central control of this to remain um and then also in parallel improving performance improving security implementing new mechanisms uh in new features so what I'm hearing about is uh the when token conversation is similar to the when the central decentralized answer perhaps um yeah when when necessary Anthony Alex it's actually one of the most clear answers we've ever gotten from a layer two one token or when it's necessary wow just that's it well said Alex Anthony thank you guys so much for joining us on Bank list today I appreciate it thanks for having us bankless nation gotta end with this none of this has been Financial advice of course your standard risk and disclaimers apply as with anything in crypto even more so when you're on the frontier but crypto is risky so is D5 so are new Roll-Ups you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign
