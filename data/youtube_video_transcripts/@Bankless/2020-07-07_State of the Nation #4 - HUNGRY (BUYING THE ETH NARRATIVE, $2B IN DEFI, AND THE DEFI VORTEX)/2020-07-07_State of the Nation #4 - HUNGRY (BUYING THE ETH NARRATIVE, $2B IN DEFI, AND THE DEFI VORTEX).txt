welcome everyone to episode four of state of the nation state of the nation is an every tuesday episode where david and i talk about what's happening we relate it to big picture stuff the things that are going on in the bankless community in the bankless nation and we hope to drop some insights and action items every single week david how are you doing sir i'm doing absolutely fantastic really stuffing up the youtube game with his brand new sexy graphics that you guys see on the screen uh this is just a video recording but soon it will become a live stream uh really stepping up the bankless youtube channel david is now a certified video dj at least he's going to night school for it so we're excited to see his skills and if it's a little choppy you know who to blame wow i'm just kidding he's it's gonna be great so okay so every tuesday we release this on youtube and then it comes out on the podcast on wednesday and actually today we are super excited to have a special guest we're not going to tell you who it is yet we'll get to that in a few minutes but i think you are going to be excited as well but david we should talk about what's going on in the the main podcast too because it's it's an exciting month already we just finished a podcast with uh chris berninski which was absolutely fantastic what were your takeaways from that sir yeah recording that episode with chris was was just fantastic and i'm really glad that he allowed us to to take uh a lot of time and go through diligently a lot of different topics because they all related to each other and they all deserve uh you know they all deserve their own time right and so uh chris was really generous with us he gave us like over an hour and a half just to go one one by one through the various topics that have really surged in the ethereum and defy world um going all the way back to like things like fairness and equity and the way that these digital nations are different from nation states and how that relates to liquidity mining and the comp token system and the governance tokens everything kind of stitched together really really well so just fantastic conversation with chris and we have a fantastic guest coming up next week as well uh ryan you want to tell us about that one yeah you know what so so uh it's vitalik yeah vitalik is one of those people who doesn't need a last name i guess he's sort of entered the uh the madonna um phase of his fame but i i am so excited to bring vitalic on i've never actually you've done a podcast with him david but i've never actually talked to him or spoken to him so i'm incredibly excited uh the bankless community is already providing a ton of fodder for questions we are going to be uber prepared for that um i gotta be honest i'm a little bit nervous about this one i don't know why it's it's just uh i mean it's metallic we're like is that normal uh i i think i think when it all comes down to it you will find that it's actually very chill uh vitalik's like one of the most chill people that i know uh and so like people get like people people think like it's like a massive big deal and everyone gets nervous and about metallic and oh there's metallic and he doesn't think like that and and i don't think you should either it's he's a very chill individual he is yeah and you know he definitely um has an incredibly interesting way of thinking uh just a funny story when um i tweeted that out that we were having vitalik on vitalik obviously already knew about it but that was sort of a reminder for him and he pinged me and he said oh when's our podcast again and i was like i told him the date and time uh and then he goes so in 46.5 hours and that's like exactly right i whipped out the calculator and then i was like yes 46.5 hours vitalik we'll see you then you know he just has an incredibly unique way of thinking and that's going to be a an exciting podcast so he's counting down he's counting down until the podcast maybe that's what he's doing he's preparing his 46-hour timer to count down all right we've got a lot to cover uh before we get into the topics we should talk about our fantastic new sponsors we have dedicated sponsors now for state of the nation first time david can you talk about our first sponsor yeah our first sponsor is ave which is just elegantly floating onto the screen right at this present moment ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum except it's got cool extra gadgets cool extra mechanisms that you might not be used to with your typical borrowing and lending application the one that i'm really excited about is the stable interest loans and so you can borrow from ave with an interest rate that won't change under your fee so that's a really important system a really important protocol to to leverage so you can have stability in your financial life uh we all love maker dow but watching a .0.5 percent uh interest rate skyrocket up to 20.5 percent interest rate in 12 months uh that would have wrecked a lot of people if they had depended on that for their personal life for their business etc and so that's something that you can do on ave you can check them out at ave dot com awesome and our second sponsor is argent which is also showing up right on the screen wallet nice nice job david you are just nailing it well done the night school's paying off so uh argent is a bankless wallet this is one of my favorite wallets i you know what it's my favorite mobile wallet uh in the d5 space i think it's the best actually so you have easy access to ave compound pool together kyber token sets this is so easy that your parents can use it i'm telling you it's just a mobile app download go to the app store you can download it it's secure it's easy to use ux is fantastic there's no seed phrase there's no ledger to worry about you can set your guard guardians on it so there's social recovery and they've got over 20 million dollars locked inside of it today so this is a non-custodial way to go bankless this is the ultimate bankless wallet i think argent is definitely the future you got to go check them out if you're doing anything in d5 and doing anything in the in the crypto space check them out at argent dot x y z we will include a link to both of these sponsors in the show notes david my question for you sir is this what is the state of the nation today the state of the nation is hungry we are hungry hungry okay yeah so and this is exactly what we're going to get into with our special guest who is yet to be revealed uh so wait wait wait wait wait how how hungry are we are we like like hungry like um we've been intermittent fasting for like you know three days kind of hungry or like yeah that's right that's right we have not done the 72-hour complete fast but we are intermittent fasting uh this the tummy is grumbling uh and but the thing is like we're also finding food right so uh another thousand btc just came to ethereum tether just in usdc continues to uh reach all times highs on ethereum a lot of assets come into ethereum right realty by the way passed two million dollars in tokenized real estate on ethereum uh and so like we're we're passing those milestones too right so anybody that has assets off-chain assets on ethereum is reaching all-time highs on ethereum right like find one protocol or system that that puts assets on ethereum that isn't at all-time highs like right now and so the the ethereum ecosystem is sucking in assets sucking in value and we're hungry for more we want more worry for more assets you heard it there uh for apples assets so yeah so i but i don't think i mean you know not hungry yet in a gluttonous way right so we're not we're not filling our plate yet there's there's at the at the all-you-can-eat buffet there's a lot of room i think to grow there's a lot of room in the belly is that the analogy we're going for um so we'll talk about that today but the first topic we want to talk about and this is where our special guest comes in uh is on the subject of eth the asset so um we brought in luke martin he was kind enough to join us from venture coinest uh luke is one of i think the most interesting narrative investors in the space uh he does a ton of trading lots of other things a great account to follow you got to check out his full body of work but i put out a tweet recently that said this um so as david was saying ethereum is hungry it's sucking in all of these assets and i said i'm a fundamentals investor i don't dabble as much with narrative investing but if i was to put money on a narrative it would be this d5 boom equals eth moon what's good for defy is good for eth the asset nothing certain but this seems like one of the most obvious narrative plays i've seen in crypto again i'm not a narrative investor as much i think a little bit more about kind of fundamentals though narrative investing is an incredible way to make gains in crypto i will admit um i've seen luke martin talk about this and write about this previously so we thought we would bring him on to sort to sort of wait in on the subject all right so we brought luke in luke how are you doing today sir welcome to state of the nation i'm doing well guys good to be here i'm hungry as well you know you guys are talking hungry it's got me hungry uh hungry for breakfast but i know a lot of people are hungry for yield and everything else so a lot to talk about yeah and you know what else they're hungry about is um narratives because that can be a key way to invest um i sort of want to clean this through my travels but also through some commentary that um i i've heard you say on the subject and i sort of think that there's kind of three approaches one might take to crypto one is sort of a a trader type approach right where you're looking at charts and you're trading the second is a narrative investor approach where you're looking at hey what's the next narrative we can front run and then jumping on that and the third is uh fundamentals you know and some people whatever fundamentals are in crypto right that's there's some some room for debate there but those are the three ways of thinking about crypto um yeah so what are your thoughts on the the narrative side of things um you think this like we see the success of d5 that's pretty clear and ethereum sucking in all these assets but we're not seeing eth price rise um is there a narrative here that like exists and that we can front run or do you think it's just not going to happen see this this is a really interesting one uh even you saying that the eth price has not risen yet it's just been a muted rise especially when you compare it to how well some of these defy tokens have done right you look at lend you look at thor comp and all these coins that have gone up many multiples over the past few months eth does look like it hasn't risen but if you go back to march april may eath was one of the only majors that was rising you know compare that to tron or the ripple or to eos which have all kind of steadily gone down until about a week ago so i think we're just starting to see maybe a more mature eath it takes a lot more money to move an asset like eath versus some of these smaller tokens which are now getting some traction right i do think this defy narrative is a massive tailwind for eth i just think it's going to take maybe a little bit longer to get the kind of moves we're used to in the past and how do narratives like these usually work luke when you see them how do they kind of propagate and um you know is it what's the what's the art to this or what's the science and sort of predicting the next big thing i i honestly focus a little bit less on predicting and it's funny you know we've had so many narratives the narratives really never stop in crypto you know following the ico boom uh when all the tokens kind of first came out when there was a token boom and new coins hitting the market uh 24 7 there was a massive focus on coins that could scale ethereum and even if a coin really wasn't focused on that or if the project didn't have too much merit if it branded itself as scaling ethereum people were rushing to buy that coin then we saw it with decentralized exchange coins we've seen it kind of over and over again we're seeing it right now with d5 and the funny thing is you didn't even have to be early i mean i've made one of my first e5 trades i think uh probably 30 days ago or a month ago and it's doing quite well and i wasn't early at all right i was quite skeptical kind of late to join on the train but but still doing okay uh momentum and trends just dominate here in crypto when there is even if you know fundamentals do play a role it's really hard to value how much the fundamentals uh you know should attribute to something's value so narratives and momentum in the trend really kind of dominate what's happening and then think about it go ahead david how much do you think that this is the fact that like so we have this ethereum's like this ecosystem right and it has the market cap of ether the asset but then it also has the value of all the other assets on the platform right and so when all of these different defy tokens come into existence like comp did and then smack their way into a billion dollar valuation and or you have things like lend ave's token that does like i don't know what like 30x over like nine months or something so the market cap of all the tokens on ethereum grows and so like part of the narrative i i think is just the fact that eth is just proximate to all these things and so like maybe in a more concrete way uh like investors are speculating that the profits from all of these tokens are going to just cycle back into ether but that is that is that is that a narrative or is that actually something closer to fundamentals and how does that impact your your decisions i think you could you could tie that to either i would say it's probably largely uh more a narrative just because if d5 is the narrative right is that d5 is going to continue to compound this infrastructure is going to last more and more assets are going to continue to kind of be staked and be used in this infrastructure that's the narrative and the narrative is that eth will take off because of that i think you could also draw another relation and say if you're a large asset manager if you're a large investor even a high net worth individual that wants to invest in some of these things it's really hard to do especially if unless you're deep in in understanding how these things work you understand how wallets work you can navigate a decentralized exchange um so really the only way to get exposure to some of these things is to try to invest in the platform they're running on which is eth so i imagine there's a pretty big handful of people that see defy see that that's bullish right now see those tokens are doing well and say how do i get involved i'm just going to buy eth anticipating that that rises with this narrative growing i totally get your point uh earlier where you said hey look the narrative actually is positively impacting ether price it's not it you know it's um appreciated relative to other layer one assets like you know tron or xrp or things like that and i agree with that um that said we haven't yet seen the the parabolic growth in eth like we saw in 2017 so when eth's first use case kind of blew up which was ics which i think of as d5 right this is um this is you know permissionless d5 fundraising if you will that we didn't call it that back then eth absolutely exploded in price uh someone at the same time yet now we have uh d5 assets kind of going parabolic and reaching almost similar levels of um uh hype and ridiculousness yes and eth is not yet moving so i guess um my question is do you think it's it's different this time do you think that uh there's some reason for that has the narrative just not you know sunk in enough or are we looking at a dead narrative i think there's two key differences i think the first one is with icos uh you had to be buying eth to participate right it was the reserve currency and in order to participate in that ico you were buying eth you had to hold these to deploy it into the next ico there weren't stable coins right sure well there were but there wasn't that much of a focus on them and you definitely weren't uh depositing into the ico with your stable coins it was very rare if if ico accepted a stable coin or bitcoin very very rare right like maybe one or two that i can think of so constantly having to buy eth and then even after you sold that coin you would have to reload your eath to continue participating in this ico boom that's just not happening um and i know that eth does work with some of these infrastructures work with these sim work with these systems but you don't have to touch each if you don't want to i think that's one factor i think the other factor is the hype is incredible with this d5 thing i think it's really the first meme and narrative that's taking a hold of the entire crypto space you know even if you're a bitcoiner and you don't like what's happening you still hear about this stuff 24 7. um and that's new so uh but even kind of taking that into account people outside of the crypto atmosphere the crypto environment i don't think they're as in tune with what's happening as they were with the ico boom i don't think it's reached kind of mainstream hype uh the same way that icos did and partially maybe because it's harder to get involved like i said it's a very steep learning curve if you want to get involved with lending or with yield farming or any of those things just to understand what's happening and then to actually deploy assets into them is a way bigger step than it was just with icos one or two clicks so uh i think those two things play a role but maybe maybe time kind of helps conquer both those yeah the nice thing with uh d5 of course is that any asset can get involved so if you are really excited about bitcoin the asset you can start using bitcoin on defy as wbtc or tbdc and some of these other derivatives so i think yeah hopefully it will draw some more attention uh and draw some more interest but but back to this idea of like um it feels to me a potential narrative is is this uh for maybe institutions maybe more classic investors who are like i don't necessarily want to buy comp token because that's complicated um but i want some sort of proxy to the value appreciation of defy and the meme of well um eth captures upside like defy tokens are like the smp 500 of ethereum and eth captures the upside of that as the reserve asset of defy it seems like that narrative even if it's not like regardless of what you think of of the fundamentals or how true the reality is that narrative could take hold on the even the institutional side who can now because ether is a commodity who can now start purchasing eth in a fairly you know regulatory unburdened way what would it take for a narrative like that to sort of sink into the institutional side of things and get more mainstream investors really excited i mean i think i think it's already happening right and and like you said whether they can't invest in comp because it's too risky or they don't understand it or eath is just more liquid right for a lot of investors you know bitcoin and ether the only options because those are the most liquid options um so i think it's already taking hold if a crypto investor wants to be involved in this defy thing and can't do it in such a granular level and they want to be involved they're probably choosing the eth route and it's probably going to continue as d5 picks up steam so i think that's only going to build on itself there's also a couple other narratives that i think could really help you know you see ada right now doing quite well and the staking in the yield farming is only going to continue to pick up steam as east 2.0 and staking and all these things kind of combine they're really going to start to reinforce each other so i think the narratives can can kind of combine in a way as people continue to look for yield as they get more comfortable finding assets that give yield in the crypto space i think eth is going to play a pretty big role in all those things one thing that's pretty interesting to me is that the eth 2.0 hype definitely impacted the 2017 eth price run up to like fourteen hundred dollars that's true and like i i think we're around the same at least with what we understood at in 2017 2018 ethereum 2.0 was like right around the corner like it was perhaps no more than 12 months away and now that's roughly still the same projected timeline but like that means like the hype of ethereum 2.0 is theoretically right around the corner so like maybe we're kind of just waiting for these stars aligned with ethereum 2.0 plus this whole new narrative ecosystem that we've been generating yeah i mean it's uh i remember when i first got into this space that was early 2017 and i was reading about east 2.0 coming out so who knows when it comes out i'm sure if italic will uh you're as next guest we'll have a lot more to say about that than than i have any insight there but yeah i think um you know yield farming and staking we've seen clearly that people are chasing that trend and momentum tends to last year i try not to fight trends here because um you know fighting momentum in any asset class is tough fighting it in crypto is is pretty brutal so uh you know who knows i think as long as the ball keeps rolling uh with defy i think eth is going to be a very nice uh benefactor of what's happening there so luke you like yield farming you like staking you like defy any other narratives that we should be watching out for for the folks that are tuning in and are interested in doing some narrative investing themselves uh i'd say ethan is probably the most interesting and i want to make a note i find all those topics incredibly interesting but i learn a lot from you guys and people like tony shang and andrew kang i am trying to learn as much as i can i don't participate in some of the the yield farming and all that it's still over my head some of those things but i absolutely love when a narrative like this does take hold and we are starting to see ethan and other assets benefit from that assets actually moving there so i think that's going to be huge i think uh another thing to watch is if bitcoin and the s p if this correlation actually does break down i think that's incredibly bullish so uh it's going to be a fun time ahead and watching how eth develops through all this is is top of my list of what i'm watching luke it's been awesome to have you thank you for taking the time uh for the bankless nation to share your thoughts on the narrative side of things luke how can folks find you and learn more about what you're up to definitely i appreciate you guys having me on i'm most active on twitter at venture coinest or you can just search luke martin i'll be one of the first ones to pop up and on youtube as well but twitter's where i'm most active awesome luke thank you so much we'll talk to you soon appreciate it guys cheers yeah i think um i think luke's right on there david um you know ethan is definitely one of the big narratives uh to watch um how much do you personally partake in narrative investing versus you know just yeah stacking your e stacking your bitcoin um the only thing that narratives really impact me is how aggressively i stack or not if there's perhaps less hype less narratives maybe maybe i'll keep keep some more cash in my legacy world but uh if if the hype definitely comes like it has recently i will definitely back up the truck as much as possible i've not i've not ever been private on the fact that you know i generally hold as a minimum amount of cash in my bank account as possible because i want to live a bankless life and so when there's value there it gets moved over to ethereum yeah absolutely all right our second topic this goes back to i think the state of the nation being hungry so we just passed another milestone and that's 2 billion locked in d5 i'm going to show it on the screen for everybody because i'm so excited about it but david what does all this mean i think the also the right milestone is uh the fact that not only the are we into 2 billion into d5 instead of the previous 1 billion where we were but the speed at which it came right so it took us you know over a year and a half to get to one billion in d5 probably even longer than that and it took us what like six months four months to get to get it to two billion uh and so the the narrative is that you know d5 is going to be knocking down these billion dollar milestones faster and faster and faster and so like the next step in my opinion is not three billion it's 10 billion 3 billion is going to come tomorrow 10 billion is going to take a little bit more time but that's where we're going so you are saying basically d5 pulse should stop uh showing their graphs linearly and move to a log logarithmic graph because this thing is going exponential well i mean look at it right like so the first one two three four five uh units uh lines vertical lines that they have there are the the majority of the line is all under that first five million dollar mark and then this last two units or one and a half really it it crushes three uh three half billion dollar increments in the last like month and a half so at some point like that the the linearness of a graph is not going to be able to tell you good information yeah it looks like here it's um it's interesting to kind of look back and see what the rocket fuel was that that entire first segment here um up until you know february or so seem to be driven primarily by collateralized lending right sort of uh protocols like maker um is maker not the king maker is not the king maker was the reigning king for a pretty long time um and i think that was basically the first two years or so of growth that we've seen but now we see this very clear inflection point in around mid-june where d5 is taking off yet again but this time we know what the rocket fuel is we did that episode of dan elizer and that's uh yield farming with comp tokens that sort of thing um so that seems to be the next wave and sure enough comp compound is now is now the reigning king so it seems like what's happening in the evolution of d phi is we're going along and then we hit some inflection point and then things shoot up and then we hit another inflection point another breakthrough and then things shoot up it it seems difficult to predict what the next inflection point is going to be right like is it first of all i think we'll probably get a really decent run on this yield farming stuff but after that what's next well so i think a lot of it you got it right a lot of things are happening all at once here right and so yield farming and liquidity mining isn't really just one thing right and so it's what that thing is is really just it broke the floor of what is possible on ethereum and it and when i say broke the floor i mean like the gravity well that is aetherium uh is now deeper right it's now stronger there's more assets on ethereum um hold on i'm i'm something's going wrong with this stream uh where'd zoom go okay that's weird uh it broke the floor of ethereum as in like it there's so many more and more different assets coming to ethereum like bitcoin on ethereum is at its all-time highs um uh and stable coins on ethereum are at its all-time highs and just and like i said earlier like realty tokenized real estate is on ethereum at an all-time high right and so like it's liquidity mining just allowed for the gravitational pull of ethereum to become a lot stronger right and so all assets are coming into ethereum from all different corners because the gravity well that is d5 that is one single composed ethereum structure of applications is just more useful for all of these assets right that i think brings us to the third topic david and i'm going to show this uh this image this graphic on this on the screen in a minute but that is this image of defy as a vortex um you're talking about the gravity well i mean you could you could use a black hole as an analogy or image this is really uh a vortex type of image so almost like a hurricane on the screen that that you're seeing can you talk a little bit about this yeah right so this is a fantastic graphic and uh when i i wrote this that article ethereum is an emergent structure way back when and when i saw this graphic i was like this is what that is illustrating right so the whole thesis about ethereum as an emergent structure is that all these applications on ethereum are compo compose themselves together that's really the power of ethereum is composability right and so this vortex what this vortex is showing is that the liquidity gadgets like balancer uniswap and curve are directly related to the payments and aggregators in exchanges like kyber um one inch and and dydx which is really connected just intrinsically connected to the borrowing and lending applications like compound and ave which is intrinsically running on the demand for various assets on ethereum like that come from maker dow synthetics and uma and set and then those applications run on the liquidity pool so we're back at the very beginning and so this ecosystem this one single composed structure offers incentives to place your assets there assets in this vortex are more useful are greater or stronger are more valuable it's more valuable to have your assets inside of this vortex right and so wherever value is coming from outside of ethereum into ethereum uh it's getting funneled into this vortex because you are able to leverage the value inside of those assets better and so as it sucks those assets in it also grows larger right because liquidity begets liquidity so it is against utility things beget things like it's it's a place of begetting yeah and so you know someone was uh asking the question uh where's ethereum in this vortex right so there's d5 the d5 vortex in the center but there's no ethereum where's where's ethereum the whole thing is ethereum like right the ethereum is the substrate ethereum is this it's the background right and that's one of the beauties about ether and ethereum is like the whole principle the whole ethos of this system is that you can operate in the ethereum operates in the background it is in the ether right it is not in your face and it's one of the core differences between bitcoin and ethereum right bitcoin is designed to be in your face you're supposed to think in satoshi's you're supposed to think in bitcoins denominate yourself in bitcoin assets and ethereum is the opposite it's right like you can use and leverage ethereum without having to think about ethereum the network or ether the asset because those things operate in the background and so what this you can just rename d5 vortex and you can basically just label that ethereum that's what it is it also not to break that analogy because i like it but it also makes me wonder and this is kind of a question i have for vitalik right we are very bullish on the defy system as a bankless money system and as being a primary use case for crypto um it's not necessarily the only use case for ethereum uh metallic makes that point too so it's it's possible you could have like you know on the planet of jupiter how you have all of these swirling clouds these swirling vortexes and you have the the red spot which is the the largest of the vortexes but then you have all of these other smaller hurricanes that are happening in parallel i i do wonder if other vortexes will emerge that aren't defy on ethereum as well you know haven't necessarily seen that yet most of the use cases have been tied to finance and money but um it is an interesting question because this is a this is really a general purpose settlement system property settlement system for the world and it's hard to imagine what the next use cases might be i mean i think that's the beauty of it right absolutely and and i think the i think the d5 vortex in this image here i think there's a theory that i have that this is also the l1 vortex right this is where all of the big applications the tools that support everything else on ethereum rely on right and so not only are we going to see certain transactions be on l1 or on on l2 but we're going to also see certain applications be on l1 and on l2 right like i predict that compound and maker and are going to be perpetually l1 applications and then some exchanges perhaps like like uh uniswap we see experiments on l2 balancer on l2 like the difference between l1 and l2 is that like they're big heavyweight applications and the l2 their each l2 is its own ecosystem right and so there can be l2 vortexes that build off of the l1 vortex right and so i think what we are showing here is the the stitching together of all the different financial active activity but it's because it's all happening at the same time like that's why gas prices are so insane right now and we've seen this insane emergence of l2 systems be developed and released in the last six months i think we're going to start to see some some mini vortexes spiraling off of this uh one big vortex yeah absolutely and that reminds me david we should talk about our sponsors for a minute all right so we are super excited to have diversify as a sponsor diversify is one of the vortexes that david was just talking about this is a professional grade defy exchange a decentralized exchange so it's completely self-custodial it's built for serious traders it's high speed it's low fee it's private and it's deeply liquid 900 and 9 000 excuse me transactions per second so that's instant execution and low fees my question to you is why use a centralized exchange we are starting to build out exchanges like diversify in the d5 space and you should check them out they also have a governance token called nectar that's nec you should check it out it powers their dow it currently has over 400 eth inside of it and a lot more eth pledged it's a perpetually deflationary token as well so it's they have a buy back and burn scheme and these guys with with neck diversify was one of the original liquidity miners back in the day they were liquidity mining before it was cool so check out what they're doing on their governance token neck also check out diversify start using it as an exchange go to diversify.com we will include a link in the show notes we have a new sponsor called ampleforth which is also a new experiment on ethereum and so this is kind of going to be a different it's a different category than other other sponsors where because this is brand new a brand new experiment and so it's a new monetary experiment it's like trying to be a new m0 except the way that it's different is that it's instead of having a variable price it's a stable-ish coin it's supposed to track a dollar but when demand for this token grows instead of the price going up the supply grow goes up and so it gives you uh supply discovery instead of price discovery and so amples the the currency of the ample system is a new base money experiment and it's very rules-based and like like bitcoin it's very non-dilutive so with a 20 million dollar market cap if you buy 1 million of them you are have the assurances that you are going to own 1 120 of the supply but you don't have assurances of what that supply is going to be so like crazy experiment where i'm excited to watch this play out so you can take part in the ample liquidity mining uh with the geyser at geyser.ampleforth.org part of the health of the ample ample fourth ecosystem needs to have distribution and so if you are interested in helping ample distribute uh you can go to geyser.ampleforth.org and check them out and get your hands on some ample via the liquidity mining that we all know and love all right david this uh is last topic it kind of ties into the vortex that we were just talking about um and that's when you were talking about the vortex it made me think about the tech trees i used to play like games i used to play do you ever play you know games like civilization where it's uh you know an rts you know or turn-based strategy types of games um there's always in those games there's always this tech tree component that your civilization has to discover if you're a character in a in an rpg you kind of have to level up using some sort of tech tree or skill tree so like in civilization you know first comes the alphabet and then you need to discover the alphabet before you can discover writing and code of laws and that leads to literacy and that eventually leads to a republic and and then you can get nukes and make you protect yourself from gandhi who's definitely going to attack you um that's a quirk of the game nothing against gandhi in real life so uh but that's that yeah great guy um so that's sort of what's happening with ethereum right now is there is a tech tree being built out um this is a tech tree which is kind of sketched out on bankless that that looks uh at sort of the launch area where we started with eth and then we started with this very basic primitive that we discovered we created but also discovered called the erc20 and that led to the birth of icos and that was sort of the the first phase of unlocking in the tech tree but once we had tokens then we could start creating uh something else and we entered into this kind of collateral era where we're starting to create things like lending protocols like compound and stablecoin protocols like maker and also trading protocols like uniswap and then once we unlock all of those we can then start to unlock other things like the die savings rate which is basically a kind of a savings account for your die and then once we have that we can start to unlock other things like the argent wallet which is new argent while it wouldn't be very interesting if all of these other primitives in the tech tree haven't been built out and it's only possible in year like you know three or four of ethereum it would not have been possible in year one so we keep going through the tech tree as an ethereum civilization as a bankless nation we keep unlocking things as we go and discovering new things and then a whole new world of possibilities uh opens up like who would have known that you know the invention of writing would lead to um you know landing a man on the moon right but we had to have writing in order to get us way downstream in the tech tree and that's sort of what i see evolving on uh on ethereum yeah there's a classic line in the crypto space that crypto the crypto world is relearning the lessons of economic and financial history just sped up and that's what i see here right like the the erc token is a symbol of value and then you have the store value eth and then we have all just the we have credit coming out of the maker system we have bundles of assets coming out of set uh and and that's what i see we are relearning the progress of history on ethereum and i'm what i'm really excited for is is seeing when we actually start to break through the frontier into brand new things and perhaps that's what uh liquidity mining and and defy tokens have been in this last new phase uh and the what really gets me excited is the compounding rate of progress that you get with this right so and at the very beginning in your launch era that you have highlighted there's only a few things that are really crucial and then in the next area there's a lot more things because the building blocks compound and so there and in in the world of ethereum the more protocols there are on ethereum the more dye the more uniswap the more whatever compound ave maker like the more things the more potent potential there are for more things and so and so that's why developers are so important right compounding progress leads to compounding developers which leads to compounding progress right and so i think with this in turn of the page that ethereum has really seemed to have taken lately we're about to see a lot of compounding progress on ethereum absolutely um i want to go back to that the phrase that chris berninski used in our podcast with him and he called this infinite white space um and i don't know if he's been influenced by by bankless but he talked an awful lot about uh the journey west and how there was not opportunity on the east coast yeah and uh how you know pioneers and people who are looking for new opportunities who predominantly were younger or outcasts not part of the existing uh social structure found their opportunity west that's what this is we are building an entire crypto nation an entire crypto economy and there's infinite white space we have no idea what's going to be unlocked next but once something's unlocked there's you know dozens of protocols that can be built on top of it hundreds of businesses that can be on top of it ways to earn money with like the opportunities here and i think it's only a matter of time before millennials and gen z uh this is definitely going to be a gen z type of platform so at some stage dave you and i will have to pass the torch to the next generation to uh to to keep carrying us but um like this is where the opportunity is um not in the nation states anymore if you're squeezing that out we've got opportunity in this infinite white space as we unlock each branch of the tech tree yeah and one last thing to wrap up this conversation is that when new protocols come to ethereum they make the older protocols better right and so uh the the hold on gotta fix it um there we go uh when new protocols come on to ethereum the old protocols that were there previous can tap into this new system right so like the the oldest protocols on ethereum like auger are now benefiting from systems like die and xerox which came after them right and so like compounding progress also works retroactively right and so that's why i always say that defy and ethereum is this one single composed structure of financial possibility right because everything relates to everything else there's no there's very few things that are disconnected from ethereum at large right any progress in one domain is progress in all domains absolutely uh david you did a fantastic job today we're going to wrap it up here but i just want to say you did a great job video djing man he's it's just you blew me away hey i i appreciate that man uh but uh let's hope that it actually works because i haven't seen it when it when it plays but uh we'll we'll see what happens all right well if if if it works we should do this every week i think we will do it every week bankless nations yeah exactly bankroll station uh you know not a ton by way of action items but one thing we'd like you to do is we'll include a link to the twitter thread um with vitalik where we asked what questions you have for vitalik uh we'd love to see up some good questions from the bankless community for that the other thing you can do is think about the next crypto narratives if you want to dabble a little bit in narrative investing uh you know take a look at some what luke is doing and think a little bit about what the next crypto narratives might be put your list together um we we definitely advise that you have a um you know a stronger fundamentals based portfolio but narrative investing can be an interesting way in in crypto to produce yields as well that is it from us thanks a lot for tuning in this has been state of the nation episode four hang on i'm gonna do a little self drill real quick uh i got an article coming out in bank list tomorrow that talks a lot about what we have been talking about in this episode uh it's titled uh the global public goods and the protocol sync it definitely relates to how all protocols impact each other and also it talks about what what is at the very bottom of the gravity well that defy liquidity vortex what's at the bottom and that that answer that article answers that question so that's coming out on bank list tomorrow so stay tuned for that i want to find out what's at the bottom what's at the bottom all right thanks a lot all right
