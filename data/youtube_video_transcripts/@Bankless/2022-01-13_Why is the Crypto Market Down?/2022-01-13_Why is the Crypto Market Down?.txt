what's happening in 2022 you can't always attribute uh crypto market movements or even general marketing you usually cannot do stories you usually cannot but in this case i think you definitely can so jerome powell and the fed had a meeting they talked about shrinking the balance sheet they talked about um getting a bit more hawkish including reiterating that they intended to raise the rates this year i think the shrinking the balance sheet statement was the the one that caught the market most off guard and stocks tumbled crypto tumbled along with it you think this was the primary catalyst for the uh the wreckage that we saw over the last couple days i think the timing is pretty hard to ignore uh it happened right at the release of the minutes there are other possible explanations kazakhstan had a massive power outage which caused bitcoin to lose i think 13 of its hash power which is pretty significant could be other things as well but i think this one is definitely the the hawkishness from the fed the possibility of raising interest rates beyond what the market expected got to be in the lead for the biggest reason why the markets took the tumble that they did
