thank you bankless Nation we have a special bonus episode for you today we have van Eck on the episode today they've made a bold call for the price of Eve yes they brought the numbers is eth price going to 50K that's what they call their bull Case by 2030. they also have a base case and a bear case we'll talk about all three of those and the variables that go into it and I gotta say this is probably the best report that I've read on each price definitely all year maybe ever uh and it's by one of the most respected institutional analysts in the game this is van Eck speaking today a few things that we're going to cover and by the way it's just me solo today David is out but I've got this covered super excited to talk about what happens when we model eth the asset as we might model an equity based on block space sales we also talk about the base case the bull case the bear case for ether the asset 50k is the bull case we we talked about how we got there and how the variables that went into this analysis and the puts and takes can we model ether the asset as we might model Bitcoin the asset or is it different in some way how about Solana how about atoms how about other alternative layer ones we talk about that that today we also talk about what other institutional investors think about either the asset are the institutions even here yet are we about to get another bull market or are we going to have to wait maybe another bull market doesn't come I asked the analysts at vanak those questions today guys before we get into the episode want to introduce the concept of diligence fuzzing to you from our friends and sponsors over at consensus they are telling us to just fuzz it this is next level smart contract security they call it diligence fuzzing this is for solidity developers if you are a solidity developer you gotta ensure that your smart contract is safe before you publish it on mainnet well have you considered fuzzing it first consensus offers a free diligence fuzzing tool that you can access right now that will help you fuzz your smart contract before you publish it on mainnet highly recommended smart contract security needs to be our number one priority and that's what consensus is doing here with diligence fuzzing if you are a developer and you need this tool access the link in the show notes you get to find out more at this point in the intro I usually ask David what the significance of this episode is but since he's not here I'm going to answer the question today you've heard the mental model for ether the asset on Bank list before we we've talked about how to think about ether the asset but we don't often have the opportunity to get into concrete numbers here in today's episode ban Eck has brought the numbers that's what's significant and exciting and I think this episode will help you think like an investor it'll help you re-establish your conviction on this asset class it'll help you check your assumptions it'll arm you with data to predict what will happen next for instance at one point we talk about one layer two what happens if one layer two on ethereum gets disproportionate market share they become really big is that a good thing or a bad thing for the price of eth according to our analysts today it might be a bad thing for ether and they give their reasons why another concept this model reveals will another alternative layer 1 outstrip ethereum will there be an ethereum killer this is an opportunity to look at the actual numbers that would provide a clue to that the leading indicator of something like that happening I also think this is an opportunity to see how institutional investors are viewing either the asset van Eck is in a position to no are the institutions seeing what we see is there still an opportunity for retail to front run the opportunity that's what we always talk about in bankless and I think there still is so this is one of my favorite types of episodes it's an episode that's really going to sharpen your tools as a crypto investor and we're going to get right to it with Matthew and Patrick the analysts over at van Eck but before we do we want to thank the sponsors

bankless Nation we are super excited to introduce our next guest from Van ack we have Matthew Siegel he is the head of digital assets research at van Eck he joined van Eck in 2021 after 10 years in research Investment Banking now leads a team of 10 working full-time on crypto at van Eck and his first hire was Patrick Bush at least that's what my notes say hey Patrick he is an analyst at van Eck digital research as well his uh role at Van ack is to focus on finding tokens that go up I don't know who wrote this but it's brilliant that's my job too I try to do that too uh he does a lot of financial modeling and ran crypto assets these two gentlemen I believe were responsible for the report that we're going to be talking about today Matthew Patrick it's great to have you on Bank list how you doing great to see you Ryan thanks for having us good to see you it's well you know what it's good to have you here it's good to have you writing like this in the space I think uh David myself and bankless we've been on a quest to um to actually try to understand this this asset called eth uh ether you know the the asset that ethereum produces and I think you guys have done a fantastic job uh in this report and I almost feel like um we should just dig right into the report I've got a lot of side questions for you but like it kind of starts here uh and here's the report I'm going to show it on screen ethereum price prediction 11.8 K that's almost 12K by 2030. and here's the opener for me that just kind of like hooks the reader right into this in light of ethereum's recent hard Fork which allows users to withdraw staked eth and in our view creates a major new competitor to UST bills we Revisited our ethereum estimates and this is the report a major new competitor to us T bills how dare you yeah like that sounds so audacious uh Matthew over to you how can you say something like this in a report like this well uh we are an audacious shop vanak is a is a macro shop we were founded in in 1955 uh with a history of trying to manufacture Innovative new products that will capture the investment Zeitgeist and in the 1970s that was gold gold stocks Believe It or Not Right gold had been illegal to own for three decades and the founder of this firm got conviction that something was going to change and he pivoted an international mutual fund into almost entirely gold stocks in the early 70s so he was an Austrian Economist with a hard money bent and that mutual fund ended up being the best performing mutual fund in the country throughout the decade of the 1970s and the firm's DNA was built around that ethos which is going off the gold standard is going to have unintended consequences it might take a decade it might take five decades but here we are and we are on the hunt and have been on the hunt for alternative storage of value that will retain the characteristics of hard money during an uncertain times so the founder who did that as deceased but his son Jan vanak now owns and runs the firm and he got conviction in 2017 that Bitcoin could be a major competitive competitor or alternative to gold and we began investing our gold profits into BTC into eth into Venture Capital investments in the crypto ecosystem and startups and we have a number of products that we offer to investors and also off of our own balance sheet that have helped us gain insight and a network and some confidence in the space to try to model something like eth so we first took a crack at this in 2021 that was before the hard Fork to proof of stake and we staked a de minimis portion of our funds after that after the hard Fork last September and now with the chappella upgrade we really got a lot more conviction we've increased our staking by an order of magnitude and what gave us the conviction to do that is the fact that you can now withdraw so a lot of institutional money managers are operating on a monthly calendar uh our private funds get subscriptions and redemptions monthly and it's crucial to be able to withdraw your staked digital Assets in order to satisfy your customer Redemption requests hopefully we don't have too many of those but should they come so when chappella came we thought it would make sense to revisit our estimates in light of the consensus mechanism changes and see what uh see what price Target came out so that's what Patrick and I have done yeah it's so cool here and I'll I'll say this to the bank list listener hearing Financial analysts use the term chappella just brings like a lot of um warmth to my heart I mean these are like esoteric ethereum hard Fork names and that's how closely this group is kind of paying attention to it and I think that comes out in the model I want to ask more questions in the background of Van EP because I know it's a trusted name in institutional space but I feel like a lot of crypto folks don't know too much about it so we'll get to that in a minute but I want to throw the first I want to throw the same question to Patrick so this this a major new competitor to UST bills calling eth that okay Patrick did Matthew put you up to this like how did you have the audacity to write this in a report is is eth really a competitor to t-bills what makes you say that and how does that sound to the typical Institutional Investor I'll throw that one to Patrick yeah I think ethereum represents the guardian not Finance at least all crypto does whoever can figure this out controls the future of Finance in my opinion and I don't think that's that's uh that's too far to say um I think a really interesting point to look at is the way we see this is it's accruing a lot of value from use case more than monetary premium the monetary premium comes in and changes the multiple more than anything else um I think that's kind of how we view it other institutions do not view in such a way that you more as an asset that's similar to like a really high beta NASDAQ type stock we see it as that but also more okay well that's good um before we get back to vanic then maybe since you've opened the door Patrick let's talk a little bit more about the model itself and the numbers here which are very precise so we've got 11.8 K by 2030 and that's one of the cases I'm pictured here but I'm going to pull up the the full chart here this is ethereum revenue and price targets we've got today what the price was at the time of this report you know uh around oh actually this isn't price sorry this is uh ethereum Revenue that that we're looking at and that's where you're deriving the price Target but around today we've got the bottom here um one thousand nine hundred dollars that's what eth is trading at approximately right now-ish although I haven't checked the price in the last five minutes we could be over under by you know 25 or something because it's crypto we've got the base uh 2030 case of 11 Point uh or one sorry 11 849 we've got the bear case which I don't like to look at but 343 dollars for the price of eth and we've got the bull case of uh 51k all the dates there by 2030 if you're listening on the podcast you can't see this I encourage you to go check out the report in the show notes or take a look at the YouTube so you can get the um the visual here and the way you're modeling this as I understand it to your point Patrick is you're basing this on revenue on cash flows this almost looks like the way you might model an equity of some sort so I think the substance of this report to your point Patrick ignores monetary premium entirely we'll come back to monetary premium what that might mean I think we're looking at this as a cash flow type asset um I guess similar in some ways to a piece of property or an equity or something like this something that can be modeled as a an asset that produces cash can you talk about this a little bit more and let's talk about how you're actually able to try to predict the revenue because I think it breaks down to categories so I'll throw this one to you first Patrick and we'll come back to math Matthew maybe I'll just take the first part because there's a top-down element and then there's a Bottoms Up element and the top-down element is what are the principal and markets that intermediate uh transfer of value so we divide uh into three there's Finance which covers like Banking and brokerage and lending um there's metaverse which encounter which encompasses gaming social networks advertising and then there's infrastructure which is you know decentralized uh storage decentralized compute those are the principal and markets and we look at what are the revenues that are being generated by those end markets today and we make some initial assumptions as to what percent of the value in each of those end markets will be intermediated by open source blockchains so that's a starting point I see how do you by the way how did you break that down in ethereum like transactions how how did you determine you know which of those uh you know um like which portion of this is attributable to your Finance banking payments versus is this a whole like total addressable Market type of analysis here okay yes so the total addressable Market is divided into those three segments finance metaverse and infrastructure we look at existing business models and how much revenue they're producing in those three end markets and then we make some um admittedly unknown assumptions about what percent of that Revenue opportunity can be captured by open source blockchains so just to Dimension that in the case of Finance our base case we're only assuming that five percent of all banking brokerage lending payments activity the right the current Revenue stream only five percent can be or will be addressed by open source blockchains in the case of metaverse where we incorporate social media as well as gaming the estimates are much higher 20 because we think new markets will be born off of this technology uh and new use cases uh and then for infrastructure a more modest 10 um so that think of that as the percentage of like AWS or Azure market share that might be chipped away at by decentralized Alternatives which right now might be more costly but provide other use cases so it's with those penetration levels I guess that we kind of set the Tam and then to what extent can ethereum address those end markets what are the possibilities that ethereum can take a meaningful market share of those penetration that's where the the kind of line-by-line estimates come in and I'll toss it over to Patrick for that yeah so like the way that we think about this is that these these end markets have this large Revenue base and going to the Future they're going to look at crypto as an opportunity both to reduce costs and find new Revenue opportunities so we thought like a logical way to think about a take rate was the construction of how that business would unfold in terms of what they would pay so in our model we talk about what current um businesses are deployed to blockchain like uniswap or AVI or compound or ping in terms of block fees versus like what they accrue in revenue and so we thought that'd be like a logical split um one of the things that this looks at is it says okay the transaction rate was going to have some sort of take rate we don't precisely know what that take rate will be and why um and that gets a little bit more into the modeling going forward like one of the problems we run to in our model is if you see significant execution use case and ethereum you have substantial burn going forward and we're not sure if that's kind of a way to look at the ecosystem um being value positive for burning substantial amounts of Supply like in some years if you have a massive adoption or massive growth in adoption you might burn 20 to 30 percent of the supply and so we don't really know precisely how these these the value will be accrued by blockchain but transactions seems like the best point for it but that's kind of like the starting point so businesses are deploy to blockchain or they're going to save costs on blockchain or combination of both and some of that will accrue Valley to ethereum can you talk about like the current state of ethereum because I think some people aren't aware that ethereum basically produces Revenue today right they're just they haven't even really looked at a ethereum from this perspective so how do you get the the numbers in the today column over here yeah that's simply a gas usage so we look at the total gas you should going back a year and then using Artemis data we're able to segment the different use cases that are currently using gas in the ethereum so looking at Finance Banking and payments we found the protocols or applications that logically fit into those segments for an estimate of what the percentage breakdown of the current usage of the chain was and so if you extrapolate that further you look at okay what's the burn rate versus what sir what's the the base rate the burn rate versus the tip fee um that's kind of how we looked at so we include that as transaction Revenue next line item was was Mev Revenue looking at the Meb Revenue was a little bit difficult to to estimate there's there's various sources like flash Bots and others but we figured long term there'd be some sort of take rate on the assets and that would kind of mirror something you'd see in in tradify looking at like something like the CME Group um and the relation to prop Traders that's kind of how I got my estimates for long-term Mev was okay how much capital is deployed on the blockchain and what's the approximate revenue of these proprietary trading firms what units am I in right here so if I go to ethereum total revenue today I see 2539 what is that that's 2.5 billion dollars uh so we have we have today's annualized revenues for eth at 2.5 billion growing in our base case to 51 billion in 2030. and you're right that we're looking at this as a traditional cash flowing Equity so to speak so we take that Revenue we tax it and then we discount it back to today at a weighted average cost of capital of 12 which we get by analyzing ethereum's beta to equities over the last number of years it's the best part of this whole thing though like the margins are enormous like this kind of business model is like very high cash flow like there's a ton of value that comes from this directly in cash that's why it's I think it's a very exciting asset class compared to like a traditional company that has large amounts of overhead like you don't see any of that here and and to the point on kind of monetary premium uh our terminal valuation so um what multiple on that Revenue number will investors pay in 2030 that's kind of the the 100 trillion dollar question we hope uh and we're assuming that the market will pay something like um you know 30 times free cash flow so that equates to like a three percent yield uh which is something that feels very normal and yeah those are compared to equities 30 times free cash flow it's a growth stock uh so it's similar to like uh a Netflix or you know yeah probably higher higher a little bit higher than those names so in a in a speculative leverage driven bull market in which like say Emerging Market consumers are just desperate to get their hands on a hard asset that is different from the dollar and willing to borrow to do so like could that 30 times free cash flow go to 300 times maybe uh like if you look at an asset like gold that essentially has no free cash flow except for a de minimis stream if you lend your gold out you can earn a small stream of income that may cover your storage costs goals free cash flow is not three percent at all right it's maybe an order of magnitude lower than that so uh to those who who look at this and say like oh it's too conservative um you know maybe that's maybe that's the reason is uh we're not assuming a leverage driven bubble conditions this is more about the cash flow that's that's the beauty of this model that's what I really like about this and so I want to make sure that um listeners understand this so far so today in on an annualized basis we have ethereum total revenue that we see of 2.5 billion dollars annualized okay transaction fees that is the gas fees essentially make up 1.9 billion dollars the team at vanak have split this into a few segments basically and you can kind of do that the finance banking payments the metaverse infrastructure that those are the sub segments that compose that 1.9 billion dollars in uh eth transaction fees but that it doesn't stop there because we also know a bankless listener is about this thing called uh Mev of course this is block Builder revenue and sort of the kind of the take rate you can you can make as a an Mev block Builder that's a 497 million dollars annualized we have this other catalog that one is really hard to estimate we're not sure what that is like 500 million is like a decent ballpark yes but it's really hard to know how that's going to play out going forward regulatory concerns I mean what users want to pay because the other day that's just contention for state right like you're looking at block space you need it now that's what you're willing to pay essentially right yeah I mean Justin Drake Came on the podcast a couple weeks ago bankless listeners may have caught that episode and so basically the summary of that episode is what does ethereum sells a product what product does it sell it sells blocks and what you can buy in those blocks is um either uh you know congestion fees so that that is purchase the actual block at your transaction in the block and there's a overcharge for congestion fees those are gas fees and then contention which is block ordering right so ethereum sells blocks congestion and contention that's what you pay for that's what the market demand is and that's what's reflected here in transactions and Mev and to Patrick's Point we don't quite know it's very difficult we don't have enough data points to really model what Mev revenue is going to be in the future but right now we can see it maybe it's something like 500 million dollar dollars annualized this other category though ethereum security is a service that's the third leg of the stool here of ethereum Revenue drivers explain this category what what does that actually mean is that different than um selling block space because it's not monetary premium it's something else what is this category so that's taking the approach of looking what eigenlayer is doing and extrapolating that as a new value accrual to eth so the idea is like okay maybe you can take the East token you can use it to do everything from securing a new blockchain maybe securing an oral network network maybe looking at some kind of contractual agreement where ethereum is the collateral like so this is massive new use case that you can take with something that you know has value and that's where we get this ethereum security as a service and we derive that value from what we think the opportunity cost would be for not staking youth times a multiple so we give it a multiple because we think okay well if you're going to use maybe eigen layer or maybe even if you enshrine on the ability to have each Security Service um within the protocol there's gonna be some kind of like there's some kind of opportunity cost to that and so that's where we we get those figures from you guys are doing your homework so this is basically restaking yields is sort of what we're seeing here and the potential for that and it's zero to date but we're seeing some growth here and I I think these numbers are somewhat conservative by the year 2030 on what this could be because it's somewhat of an unknown okay so we have 2.5 million in annualized Revenue basically in Block space sales for ethereum and that's today and just to refresh us on the base case for this in order to get to uh almost a twelve thousand dollar eath price by 2030. you're assuming total ethereum revenue gets to 50 billion dollars 50 51 billion dollars annualized that is the base case here and some might argue a kind of a conservative uh case so it depends you also have the bull case which we could get into but I I just want people to understand the mechanics of this model is um not unlike modeling cash flows for a stock like that there's no Voodoo here it's just like you're taking this product in this network which produces blocks and you're projecting the sales moving forward and you're doing a disc counted cash flow of what those sales might be it's not that complicated um I guess I'm wondering high level how this type of model lands with institutional investors who look at this asset because I think if you try to model other crypto assets for monetary premium or even like you guys have been doing this since 1970s it sounds like try to model gold you like there there are no cash flows for gold and that's the way we've sort of had to model Bitcoin in the past and even people tried to apply that to ethereum this is a departure from that this is much more kind of the way you might look at an equity how is this Landing when you um talk to institutional investors or like you know serious Financial analysts about this are they seeing the picture here are they in disbelief like how does this land Brian I think you make uh a good point about the valuation of gold for example and how Commodities are usually valued which is what's the marginal cost of production right like if the price Falls below X then some number of uh producers of that commodity will not have the money to keep digging the shovel in the ground and they'll have to shut down that will decrease Supply and bring the market back into balance and with each transition to proof of stake like that type of analysis is no longer is relevant because the cost of goods sold like the electricity uh the need for electricity went down dramatically and now we have to really look at what are the underlying cash flow of this asset and that's why it's been so gratifying to see the performance of each Supply since the transition of proof of stake and the the defense deflationary Tendencies the fact that eth earnings are now so solidly positive and that gives us the ability to do this type of cash flow analysis but there are a few drivers in the model that that move the needle pretty dramatically that I think maybe we should we should chat about because we did have to make some uh some assumptions about you know what what is the the value capture that accrues to the L1 versus the L2 because you'll see in this model that Patrick has I think it's 95 percent of all the transactions happening on the l2s right and if you have um just a handful of dominant l2s they might have better bargaining power to take a higher percentage of the value from eth whereas if that tail is extremely long then the balance of power might shift a little bit so it might be instructive just to have Patrick kind of lay out that's really where we where we landed with those assumptions so let's talk about those assumptions because I think that that drives it and while we're getting there let me just set the context so the base case by 2030 is 50 billion per year in annualized ethereum total revenue but there's also a bear case here which is only 2.5 billion in annualized Revenue which is basically flat from where we are now only that's in seven years that's by 2030. if we do that the model spits out a number that I don't like so much which is an either price of 343 dollars quite low and that could happen too that's on the table too then we also have the the bull Case by 2030. if you dial all the the numbers up which Patrick is going to explain for us the difference between bear and bookcase but if you dial everything up and you get 136 billion dollars in annualized Revenue we get an eth price target of 50k all right now we're talking in seven years an eighth price of 50k that's if you want to go extremely bullish on this asset so okay Patrick get into the variables that really drive this and kind of the assumptions uh behind the model that separates the their case from the base case and and the bull case yeah sure um uh one thing I want to mention though I think one of the most unpalable things to the whole model before going deeper is the Mev construct so when you talk to institutional investors the initial reaction so that's that's front running right you're ordering transactions and doing things as you see fit and then sorting orders as you want to um and so we're making this this uh this piece a logical analogy this is essentially like a supermarket monetizing shelf space where you walk into a supermarket you look at the different Shelf at eye level you look what's below you and there's a premium to things that are eye level versus things that are below you and there's a reason um why that's monetizable right because it's the first thing you see and that's similar to what you see here I think in ethereum it's kind of like the way we look at it if that makes sense I I should also and I'm going to toss it back to you Patrick to actually answer Ryan's questions which we're not doing very well I'm not there yet like how is this Landing with institutional investors uh we like the stage here is that in the US there is no institutional investment uh it's family offices it's rich people but the typical institutional buyers which are um the wire houses right the Brokers the independent um uh advisors they're not allocating to crypto full stop why why because they can't because this SEC is hostile to the space and has proposed rules specifically around the custody of digital assets that make it impossible for a bank with retail customers to offer crypto projects so it's really regulatory uncertainty right now is that is that true in just the U.S or is that also globally true would you say institutions aren't allocating here it's especially true in the U.S but it is largely true globally that the traditional Distributors of financial products are banks and they are not in this game at all so that's the hurdle we have is like okay well if we can't onboard institutions into proof-of-stake crypto then we have to rethink what an institution means and that's why like personally I'm I'm quite focused on bitcoin adoption as legal tender Bitcoin as a reserve asset and we have done a lot of research on what are the types of countries that might adopt Bitcoin under those circumstances and then we ask ourselves well what about ethereum why wouldn't they adopt ethereum and I think it comes down to time Horizon and the types of countries if you're a country that is extremely poor in human capital but you are rich in um energy Capital then it makes sense to try to monetize some of that energy by mining Bitcoin and then you can sell that Bitcoin and build whatever physical infrastructure that you want if you're a country that is rich in intellectual Capital with the wherewithal to maximize the use of the ethereum blockchain by staking restaking asset creation like all the types of smart contract functionality that ethereum has to offer uh you know that's a different type of country that's a country that is quite Advanced from a technology perspective and maybe those are the countries that are going to be buying eth for their Central Bank Reserves uh that's not the types of countries that are likely to acquire Bitcoin for reserves so I personally I think we're just a little bit further off on the adoption of eth as a as an Institutional asset at the state level and we're in this pause where the world is waiting to see what's going to happen in the U.S from a regulatory perspective and until we get that Clarity ain't no banks that are going to be buying ethereum anytime soon that's a very good perspective and before we kick it back to uh to Patrick I just want to kind of finish that thought so when when I ask you the questions about like how are the institutions thinking about this and as if if you could write the perfect report or explain either the asset better that suddenly institutions would would pop aboard and you're saying that's not it at all they ain't touching it because we don't have the regulatory Clarity you might get the family offices and the high net worth individuals kind of more interested through a report like this but for the institutions something like this understanding an asset like ether to this level is not going to get them interested in the space for that we actually need more uh regulatory Clarity particularly the banking level worldwide and maybe most particularly in the US is that a good summary Matthew I agree with that take all right more work to do but great news for you bankless listener of course none of this is financial advice it never is but this is a program all about front running the opportunity of the institutions uh aren't here then maybe retail gets a shot at this one uh Patrick let's talk about the difference though in the variables between the base case and the bear case and the bull case um what what is the bear based on like what are the the dials that make the most difference in this model and take us from 300 eth to like 50k eth the biggest principal components to this is the understanding of what the underlying markets will do in terms of adopting crypto so as Matthew mentioned earlier we're seeing a base case for um five percent or so of Revenue of banking is applied in some way to crypto and public blockchain so that'd be the base and so we dialed up a notch um in our Bowl case to let me let me look real quick to make sure on to 10 likewise we do the same thing with each of the other categories metaverse infrastructure the bear case we pulled that down to one percent five percent one percent respectively and the idea behind that is that we see regulatory climate or adoption curve failing in each of those so that's kind of like the first construct of this model the way to think about it is it's basically a waterfall and ethereum's got its cup at the end of it and each level um to get there is how much of its take rate it is so the first level just be what's the adoption of those underlying block of those underlying businesses the next is okay what what is The Logical take rate what's the take rate um and what kind of Revenue will theorem get from those those places that's this is transactions and so we see something like Finance Banking and payments whether it's fine you have opportunities or reducing costs that would be three percent um and so then the next level down is okay we see the crypto Market taking that kind of percentage what percent of the crypto Market is is ethereum and so that's the third case and so for each the bull bear and base cases we tweak ethereums market share to reflect that outcome so in the bare hyper bearish scenario that not only is like the the end Market's not using blockchain but ethereum has a very small market share and so that's like in the in the transactions category um the layer 2 settlement category um which feeds in the transactions kind of also reflects this so we think about like the value capture of ethereum and the l2s Matthew mentioned earlier that depends upon the structure of l2s our assumption in the base and in the bull case is there's thousands of interchangeable l2s that don't have any real way to differentiate themselves they're just using ethereum as a blockchain to settle ethereum essentially as a monopoly there's no real differentiation it takes place at L2 and so in that kind of scenario you can see the Cut Rate that ethereum could take of those settlements would be much much higher or the underlying businesses so that's kind of like the basic idea for how it works um Mev that's also going to be tied to just generally how much of adoption rate of those underlying businesses in that case it's going to be digital assets on blockchain so when we think about like how Mev works it's really just how much on-chain activity it is and that's a reflection of how many assets there are so that's kind of like the base and how we see this okay maybe we do one of these models um in our base case like we think there are uh a lot of winner take all characteristics to digital platforms right we've seen that in web 2 that the dominant platform 10 cents to take 70 plus percent market share and the top one percent of creators on that platform often take 90 of the economics and we think that that our base case is that that is going to be even more true in web3 and so when we model one of these tokens in our base case we assume that ethereum will take 70 market share of all open source blockchains and when we do our models on Solana like that our base cases that's so long it takes 70 on atom that atom takes 70 and then we see what type of upside we get when we put in those assumptions and we look at owning each of these tokens is basically we're owning a bunch of call options that each protocol will become the dominant protocol even though it's impossible that they all could do so and then we manage our position size based on what type of upside we see does that make sense it does and it's uh really smart actually it's a good way it's a good way to to look at this I think learning about crypto is

a high level for ethereum but you could you could broaden this to any blockchain that sells blocks which is all of them if you ignore monetary premium right you just focus on kind of the the revenue generation side of it and you've got like okay how successful is crypto and worldwide adoption in like solving actual real use cases as a percentage of the total addressable Market in the metaverse and payments and all that we're doing with with Finance how much does uh crypto kind of eat the banking world uh if you will um so that's your first level of analysis you have to put some assumptions on that and then your second level is okay how much of the market will ethereum actually um dominate right so we've got change of cell blocks smart contract blockchains maybe ethereum and you said in your base case is like 70 is that what I'm looking at the the terminal market share 70 in the bear case it's 15 in the bull case it's 90 and then the final variable it sounds like or the Big Driver of this is really uh is it is it make sure I understand this uh Patrick is it how many l2s there are and basically if there's a a large number of l2s not very concentrated it's kind of a multi-polar type world out there then ethereum does better in that world but if there's a few concentrated l2s the idea is they'd have greater bargaining power um maybe ethereum is not able to charge kind of the the block space fees that that it would hope to and selling its product and so that kind of world would be a bit more bearish for ethereum is that the third um you know spot on the waterfall here yeah the the third spot is actually like what percent of those underlying revenues that ethereum occurs in some way so we said before that banking would be like roughly three percent of that Revenue base that is settled on public blockchain um and then the fourth layer would be the breakdown split between l2s and ethereum ethereum is an ecosystem it's an execution-centric robot for the l2s for ethereum itself is becoming more a settlement layer so the idea is that okay like that next construct is okay like the transactions will happen on the l2s the l2s at the pay fees how does that breakdown occur what is that what does it look like logically and as as you cited that just reflects like what the dynamic of the political economy or lack of bear term is between the l2s and l1s it's similar to like you know an Empire with lots of such wraps the set traps are the the l2s but the Saturn becomes really really big maybe they push around the boss and say hey like we're gonna not pay as much tribute like that's kind of how we see it okay so for ethereum you see it as being um I guess bearish if one particular L2 gets too big then yeah I would almost argue this in ethereum's favor to push lots of non-differentiated l2s like make sure they have as much tooling as much ability to access block space as possible and make sure that nothing is enshrined with an advantage um that comes into context I mentioned that because of the arbitrum buying Prismatic and maybe something interesting there long term not precisely sure but it looks like it's the um the start of some kind of capture and that's something that worries us have you guys done any analysis on LT tokens themselves or is that kind of a next layer sounds like you've done some of the similar analysis on other layer 1 tokens how about l2s most of our deep Dives have been on either layer ones or Apple application specific projects like dydx as an example um we have not done one of these models for l2s and I think there's just more uncertainty around how that's going to play out and the market caps are smaller and there was a considerable amount of farming and kind of artificial activity that we want to see play out uh before we make a big bet on the l2s here yeah yeah Ryan to to go further like one of the things that we're really interested in is looking at how the addresses churn from using ethereum exclusively to using L2 exclusively and that's something we're kind of looking at right now because right now what you see is you see a lot of users on daily active user accounts and on value but you're not really sure like okay like are people really migrating their execution to the L2 um for sure that's something that we're doing right now as a long-term analysis would you guys model Bitcoin this way or can you model Bitcoin this way or do you have a different model for that we really look at Bitcoin as a distinct asset so in our token strategies uh they are largely they are X Bitcoin um we see Bitcoin and as a competitor uh to gold and we've been valuing it based on a percentage of the gold market cap now the fee a dynamic in Bitcoin has changed dramatically right it's an order of magnitude Bitcoin transaction fees were were two percent of issuance uh a few months ago and now it's 20 so there is a possibility we'll have to see how this develops with with some of the l2s that are being built on bitcoin but if the cash flow story changes then we would look at it in a different way but for now it's uh we're looking at as a as a very different type of asset this is too simple to say Bitcoin is kind of like modeled in the same way gold is and ether is modeled as the same way what I mean in the intro you said a new competitor to T bills can you compare ether to the bond market is either the internet Bond or I mean oh it's the Philip Morris right it's the high yielding Equity okay well hopefully not as toxic but uh you know dividend paying asset um that can be held over um a number of different time Horizons what do you think is bigger is is the Tam I guess I mean it seems like you could also make the case to also model ether in the same way you model gold too have you ever looked at it from just a pure money-ness perspective or do you just don't think it takes that kind of adoption Pat like do you need to choose one or the other or could you do a hybrid model where you do this to get the kind of the the base level of ether and then you add this gold-like monetary premium aspect of it over here and kind of combine that analysis to get a synthesized analysis for this does that even make sense so I I personally think that by introducing the restaking business line we are um already assuming some money-ness right because that eth is going to be reused by um and it could be slashed validating another chain uh and so it is a form of Leverage it is a form of moneyness to even have that exist it makes the entity more levered um and our cash flow multiple should incorporate the money-ness right so that goes back to like my my comments at the beginning like we're assuming 30 times cash flow for this if it went to 300 that would be more like that would be a gold type situation we just think that that's unlikely to happen in the near term although the team debates it you know internally we all have different views on this I think it's less likely to happen because I don't think a nation state is going to be buying ethereum because I don't think there's the same stranded energy Dynamic that there is in Bitcoin like why would you buy ethas if you have granted computer devs who have no web 2 options to work on so let's stuff them all into web 3 and then put our Central Bank Reserves behind that Network I I just think we're many many years off from that whereas for Bitcoin the opportunity is nearer term but you know Patrick May disagree Others May disagree even even within the van Eck team that you've created there's kind of like this this question of this debate of how much monetary premium should ether have versus Bitcoin which is I think the entire Market's trying to figure that out quite honestly I don't think the Market's taking a um like a position on it yet and we'll have to see so what is the what are people saying what are the arguments for ether to have more monetary premium that you're hearing in your in your team Matthew yeah um Patrick maybe I'll you know you were kind of rolling your eyes as I was uh giving my bullish Bitcoin Spiel there like maybe maybe you have a more of an East Maxi take than I do well I mean I think I think like if you look at it just money by itself like Bitcoin definitely has a monetary advantage and a monetary premium it has it built right in the code only 21 million it's immutable and that's very powerful I think what ethereum is value proposition would just be like an alternative Financial system where the rules are written in code and you had to follow the rules and you can't break those rules everything you see is transparent so the example would be like when I was a proprietary Trader I traded to see me like I kind of knew how the execution algorithm worked and I would see in practice how it worked when I get fills for my trades but in reality it's all closed end you don't know what's going on in the back end you don't know how um you're getting allocated precisely and so having something like this on on ethereum having the ability to trade value ethereum were incredibly neutral I think in building Out programs and services that are completely open and transparent I think is a really powerful narrative so like I don't think it's really fair to like give it like a kind of monetary premium by itself and if you really felt the need to you can like that in the price multiple um because at the end of the day it's still a consumable asset and when you're using it to buy is block space and so the so what is the blog space how would see each go a few years without a hard fork and then the the monetary premium will will increase right there it is there's the the Bitcoin the Bitcoin take here um can I ask you what this would look like if you a model then maybe you already have and I haven't seen it yet another layer one like a Solana or like an atom um what do the numbers look like just in comparison uh I've never modeled those chains out or I've not seen a model to to this extent I have to imagine the total revenue is a lot lower and you also have much higher dilution um so what are the numbers spit out from from those uh layer ones and how are they different or similar to the model that you've put forth for ethereum yeah the the idea is that we organize them according to the same first principles the idea that they're taking Revenue share and there's some kind of trickle-down effect based on how the ecosystem is structured so something like an ethereum where you have your use case you have a clear idea of like how it's going to accrue value and what that will be um you see what stands in the way of it getting full value capture it might be like the L2 so they have to remit some portion of the total ecosystem Revenue to the l2s um the same is not true for for Solana so Salon is going to be a single monetary execution layer so under its bullish case and it's bear case I mean it's in its base case a logically it's going to get a higher percentage of the ecosystem take rate and then likewise for Adam will have a lower ecosystem So Adam in its current standing it's Square to kind of like a it's replicated security model and actually it's Mass security model but the idea is the end of the day um you're having some sort of Revenue share between the chains that are allowing and to validate it and so it's more like a revenue take percentage you under that idea like our our bull case for our Solana would be higher just because it's going to have more value capture logically under that assumption and it won't have the lowest that ethereum somewhere in the middle that's kind of like the understanding in terms of upside one once you layer in like our top two assumptions of the penetration rate and then if you assume that Solana takes 70 of all open source blockchain activity uh the upside becomes much higher uh but with a much higher level of risk as well and the other thing that we observe especially with Solana is that the Mev is a much higher percentage of the revenue line and that points to issues of centralization right there's opacity in that chain fewer number of um really active participants extracting value and that it just introduces question marks so even though we have more upside in tokens like Adam and Solana it's smaller position sizes because of the unknowns though is it the fact that you have a separate client being created by one of the larger proprietary trading firms in the world and fire dancer so you really don't know like on in terms of the value capture how Solana is going to be able to deal with the capture most value that would prior dance will probably be made just the way that jump will be able to take advantage of it right like that's one of the the issues with we have with Mev and Salon as well I see so it doesn't necessarily mean the soul take the sole token owners will be recipients of that Mev if they're cited off in some other way maybe by a client or something like this right right and also the other thing about is is because most the execution of ethereum or even atom it's gonna happen on the l2s or other Chains It's like okay what portion of that's going to drip down to ethereum that's like a big question right so like the L2 political Dynamic but the L1 is really going to matter right it's at the end of the day if I give thousands of different l2s competing for Block space the subtle ethereum well then they're going to have to remain a substantial portion of the revenue to the ethereum just for that privilege right otherwise you might be seeing like one dominant L2 have like really Mass margins it's really fascinating it's also fascinating to consider like are the non-etherium layer ones are they competing directly against ethereum there's a way in which they certainly are are they also competing against block space of ethereum layer twos there there's a way in which they are as well right and so what are the sub substitutes for uh you know a non-etherium layer one it's kind of a question one other question I had for you is like so right now we couldn't say this in 2018 or you know 2019 for ethereum right there was not two point this is a bear Market by the way right 2.5 billion dollars in annualized Revenue all right this was like minuscule back in 2018 2019 this would have been a very very sad analysis uh would you have published the report at that point in time I also some other layer ones are kind of like there right now right and the question is can they get out of that so I'm looking at seven day average fees and you have to scroll down pretty far binance is actually kind of impressive I don't know if you've done a BNB sort of analysis I know that has different dimensions entirely maybe we're dealing with a whole other class of asset here but you have to scroll down before you get to like the um uh pretty far before you get to like Solana or um I guess Avalanche used to be on here it's not and then what you have with some of these alternative uh non-etherium layer ones that is is a lot of daily issuance which is kind of different from like there was a time where ethereum's issuance far Supply surpassed its revenue on The Daily and now since proof of stake and since kind of the burn mechanism that's kind of reversed so I'm kind of wondering about when you look at uh non-etherian layer ones and you look at kind of total revenue and you model at the cost like it's got to be pretty um pretty low at this point in time you have to inject like a lot of growth assumption assumptions on those block space sales to actually model it out I don't know if I'm I'm correct in this Patrick and Matthew but do you guys have any comments on that yeah I mean you're you're I think it's important to remember that this is an asset class that still requires inflows to keep the price flat right because in aggregate um the the whole ecosystem is inflating and so everyone's getting diluted if they're not staking or buying more um and there are very few exceptions to that and ethereum seems to be one of them so when we think about our overall macro views right now on the market where we're pretty cautious like we're we're we think a new inflationary normal began in 2021 it's driven by the structural under Investments and like the most reliable and cheapest form of energies it's exacerbated by the politics it's breeding this disillusionment across the world a search for alternative systems but it's not a great time to be in Risk assets right now and and so like investors around the world are focused on cash flow and and what type of equities are producing cash flow and they're not all that interested in buying really speculative long duration assets that aren't producing cash flows and that's where unfortunately most of these alternative layer ones are where it's a theoretically interesting technology they found some level of product Market fit but not enough to be uh producing cash flow at scale so we can make our assumptions about where the world may be and in that environment if Solana or Adam were to take that 70 like they would be 50 Baggers or more but right now the the activity on those blockchains is not indicating that and so we're tilted more towards the profitable blockchains the cash flowing assets and we're on alert for a change in the macro that would make us kind of get more aggressive around the more speculative chains so there you go guys we solved it we know the price of Youth by uh 2030 it's between 350k according to our models here and that doesn't include monetary premium but I in all seriousness I want to ask the question so like then you model something like this what do you do with this information how does it inform your strategy at van Eck and where you where you allocate and how seriously should we treat models like this yeah we have a few different strategies like we have a beta strategy that aims to outperform an index of layer ones that we created and that type of strategy would be fully invested at all times and it tries to capture the growth in the space at a reasonable fee and we might own like 50 eth in a strategy like that because we're looking for um broad exposure to the space and then we have an alpha we might have something like an alpha strategy that aims to own like the best 20 tokens that have the most clear the clearest value accrual and the best kind of product Market fit demonstration and then we we would manage cash aggressively and try to bring down our investments when things are better very frothy and redeploy when the Market's very bearish and in in that strategy we're focused on themes like stable coins used for payment settlements uh nft form factors used by traditional companies simple defy decentralized physical infrastructure and in that type of strategy each might be a much smaller percentage just because there's there's less upside right so we have like eight times upside in our base case for Ethan the model that we just went through but in some of our for some of our other tokens we get to 20 to 50 times upside with a lot more volatility and so it's about kind of managing that volatility and bringing position sizes down when everyone is really optimistic and then trying to increase the position sizes when there are big drawdowns or deleveraging events yeah I think the activity is is is really important because it gives you like an understanding okay like what is the potential of this system like how does that value look compared to where it's trading now and then you position size accordingly also as a relative exercise you say okay like how how does this thing approve Valley versus something very similar like what is a token economic Dynamic and how does it look like when you actually put pen to paper and model it out so um I can't speak much more on that but that's kind of how we see this just is an interesting exercise the eth model really serves as a benchmark because in in our token strategies we're looking to outperform ease that's that's the Benchmark asset so if we have yeah very hard if you have seven or eight times upside on each like you need to have a multiple of that to get conviction on a much smaller project guys uh thank you for putting together this report it's been incredibly useful and um I I was mentioning this to David in the roll-up like I've not seen kind of a you know I would group uh Vanek I hope you're not offended by this as a traditional Finance uh certainly if you guys are delving into crypto in a way that is supremely crypto native and actually understanding this asset class and like um great work Matthew and kind of building this team and Patrick as you know the Matthew's first hire uh to put this level of report out um really takes some understanding of the tech the technology and the economics and the networks that you're investing in which I guess I mean you're investors that's that's what you'd want to do I just want to close and ask kind of this question because it's been on my mind and on the minds of a lot of uh bankless listeners so it's 2023 and we're trying to figure out where we are in the market I've kind of called this the the apathy Market the board Market it feels like it's that part of the the cycle some people as they always do at this type of the cycle and maybe I'm trying to you know lead the witness here but I don't mean to I um I really genuinely want to know if we get another bite at this does crypto make a comeback are we uh just is there another bull market ahead if so how long out is that um or is this kind of like hey you know that was we had crypto's biggest big rise and now we're sort of on the other side of that and it'll be like there'll be some uh growth and some appreciation but the biggest gains are are over what's your take on where we are will we get another huge uptick cycle maybe I'll um I'll ask you that Matthew since uh you kind of started this whole thing at van Eck yeah but I mean both Patrick and I left our jobs in Trad five because we believe that there's asymmetric upside in these decentralized systems and that like an innovator's dilemma is keeping the biggest web 2 and banking companies from embracing this technology uh you know right now there are um there are headwinds that are uh politically driven and inflation-driven uh but they seem to be abating right on schedule so we're a year out from the next Bitcoin having and Bitcoin looks to be tracking uh along similar having Cycles so it's not that hard to imagine a year from now a very different political backdrop in the U.S and a different environment for um Bitcoin specifically I personally think that Bitcoin is the asset like on the back of which that all these other decentralization assets which are a spectrum are levered to uh so we think there's going to be adoption cycle that it's driven by countries outside the U.S and that's likely to be most pronounced next year so that you know that's why we're all here is to cap hopefully capture the upside from that adoption cycle Patrick what would you add as we close yeah I would say we're clearly in the phase the market of the gut check where a lot of the things you believed in a lot of the crypto Lords turned out to be Hollow and going forward I'm really encouraged by all the things that are being built and the progress screen being made you don't see that reflected in the price but the potential is enormous there are tens of thousands of the smartest people that are working on the space and they're trying to think and applies technology really interesting use cases every single day I'm encouraged by the things I see on Twitter in person with the conversations I have with the people and the interactions I have so I can only say it's going to be up only from here there's going to be a lot of Rocky Roads there's gonna be a lot of gut checks still but I'm extremely positive about the space going forward time to test your conviction bankless listener and if you want that conviction tested or maybe reinforced make sure you check out this van Eck report we'll include a link in the show notes Matthew Patrick it's been a pleasure to have you on Bank list thanks so much thanks for having us you're welcome uh risen disclaimers time for me to remind everyone none of this has been Financial advice eth could be 300 in a couple years it could be 50k we really have no idea play at your own risk of course all crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign
