so can you tell us about big green dow and the the why the what and the how of a big green doll we started out very successfully building these beautiful outdoor classrooms in schools around the country but the problem is they're always put in the corner of schoolyard and usually a teacher would retire or a passionate parent would graduate their kid and then the garden would stop getting looked after and you just have to put more and more money into it every year and we decided to try a different approach which was a more permanent beautiful classroom that is edible schoolyard where kids grow food as they learn lessons but when covert hit schools were shut down and so it was around then that i started to just talk about well how could i help in other ways web 3 kind of was this magical solution that came along right when we needed it and web web3 is this way to build community without a physical presence
