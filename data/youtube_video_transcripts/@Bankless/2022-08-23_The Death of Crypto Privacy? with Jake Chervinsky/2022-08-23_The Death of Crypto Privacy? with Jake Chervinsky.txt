hey bankless Nation welcome to another episode of state of the nation we've got a meaty subject to dig into today with a crypto legal mind Jake travinsky our question the top of mind question I think for crypto is have we seen the death of crypto privacy recent ofac uh sanctions against tornado cash we'll get into that the arrest of an open source developer we'll talk about what that means is code speech a lot of questions that we've had over the last couple of weeks in crypto and at bankless and what we really wanted to do was was bring Jake into the episode who is a legal mind and can give us some legal commentary on these things of course he'll be first to disclaim that none of this is legal advice will allow him to do that but he is one of our favorite crypto lawyers and thinks about out these things deeply and has a great sense of where things are going uh David what else are we in store for in this episode there's a we've had these conversations both on the weekly roll-up and an actual other podcasts and other podcasts have done this as well let's talk about tornado cash and the future of crypto privacy and I we're not going to begin at the very beginning because that conversation has definitely been had I think we really want to fast forward and see how this plays out and see where this all goes when we kind of go to this logical conclusion and there's lessons from history to pull from and I think that's really where we want to start is we can actually go back before the Advent of cryptocurrency and go back to cryptography and take a leap out of the lessons of history and kind of extrapolate from there like if we won these battles before can we win them again and overall there's also just the general landscape of regulation in crypto like what what is the Congress what's the state of Congress and the White House and in Capitol Hill and the state of crypto regulation there and so so we will get into all of these subjects and more with Jake travinsky hey I gotta let you know as we get in our friends and sponsors at smart con this is a conference put on by the folks at chain link it's a fantastic conference usually this thing is virtual now it's conference season and they're doing it in person this year in New York City on the 28th and 29th David I'm gonna scroll down look at these attendees man Eric Schmidt right former CEO of Google uh Sergey from chain link belagi uh we've got SBF Ed Felton Stoney Kane this almost looks like a list of previous bankless uh podcast guests David what other information do you want to share about chain link and where can folks find out more yeah the train links Marcon they do this every single year it happened uh it used to be all virtual but this is the first conference that is in real life happening in New York and so if you are a regular attendee congratulations you get to go and be in person for the first time and also if you use code bankless you can get a hefty discount off of your ticket to smartcon 2022. another perk of listening to bankless guys go click that link in the show notes for more info on that David I'm going to start with the question I always ask in these episodes what is the state of the nation today my friend the state of the nation Ryan is lawyering up we are lawyering up right now uh and so this is the state of crypto in this present moment as we have some legal fights ahead of us uh and so we are going to we're Consulting with our lawyers although Jake travinsky is not your lawyer nor is he ours uh but he's still a lawyer and so we are going to uh talk to Jake as a the resident lawyer of crypto Twitter what we need to do to move forward in this industry okay who knows uh legal legal could be a public good but we are hitting the gym today and lawyering up uh and getting ready for this privacy battle ahead of us guys we're gonna get right into the episode with Jake travinsky but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our webtoon we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web 3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to

on to help us answer that question Jake is crypto Twitter's favorite lawyer I think he's bankless's favorite lawyer maybe although we're credible we don't have too many favorites every lawyer we have on Bank list is our favorite but Jake's our most favorite uh he's the head of policy at the blockchain association where he and many other legal minds are actually working to defend crypto against unjust laws and policies this is the legal layer uh of our fight he's been on Bank list many times of course and uh Jake I know you're gonna ask so I want you to be able to do the disclaimer up front because you are definitely not our lawyer any anyone who's listening to this Jake is not your lawyer uh what do you want to uh disclaim before we get into the episode well you covered it pretty well and and thanks for having me back it's always great to talk to you guys although usually it's uh you know under uh less than optimal circumstances sorry about that no hey look that's what I'm here for and it's like it's an honor to be considered uh you know in the conversation for you know first among equals the lawyers who come on here so I appreciate that um no but I mean I guess the quick disclaimer as you said is I am a lawyer but I don't represent you guys or anyone else who's listening so we may discuss some legal issues but nothing that I say is intended as a legal advice and if anybody out there has concerns about what they should be doing in order to comply with the law then they should you know find their own lawyer to give them personalized advice um so that's that's all there is there well you know we're a little bit scared or something bad has happened as he said Jake because because you're on the episode and David uh I know you've got the details to maybe speedrun but we are talking of course about ofax sanctions tornado cash could you just speed Speed Run uh what's happened recently and we could do maybe a recap with Jake real quick for for folks who've missed it yeah and like I said in the intro this topic has been around the content Sphere for a while now and so we're going to speed run through some of some of the beginning stuff and get through some of the the further along parts of this conversation and so Jake I just want to kind of highlight some of the high level themes of this whole entire episode and just make sure that we're on the same page about what the big questions are so the first one and obvious is tornado cash is now banned for U.S citizens which really brings up the question does the rights of ofac to prevent North Korea from accessing money come before the rights of individuals who access privacy tools are of fact rights Superior to individual rights I think that's the big one big question that we have and also you know along with that question is why should we lose our rights so that ofac can sanction Bad actors I think that's one big theme another big theme is that this whole incident is unique because tornado catch is not an entity or a person it's a smart contract which begs the question is it even legal to ban a smart contract um so that's one big theme as well uh Alex pursov at the North a tornado cash developer was arrested in the Netherlands is it now illegal to write open source software uh is open source code illegal now if it's used by nefarious actors that's another big theme and then perhaps the last one is now the industry is really taking a look at what else is risk at risk in defy like what else is under perhaps the the under the crosshairs of other Regulatory Agencies and at risk of censorship is this is this just the beginning and if so where does this end so these are the big themes that I see I'm wondering if there's any others that that are floating around in your brain or anything you want to like double tap on uh no look I mean those are the big questions not just of the day but I think the big questions of crypto in general right as as sort of a movement I think um you know in a way this is a perennial question how do we balance the interests of National Security against the individual rights of citizens and it's a hard question and it's one that we've struggled with long before crypto came up um and it's one that I think will be battling for a long time I think the only other thing that we should maybe touch on in addition to I think those sort of philosophical Concepts is what do we actually do right as a community as a group of Builders as advocates how can we try to advance the interests of civil rights and the rights of U.S persons to use these permissionless Technologies in a way that isn't going to get us in even more trouble with policy makers who frankly don't always agree with us about how we rank the priorities when we when we deal with these issues so and I think the list you uh you gave is exactly the right to write set of topics for us to be thinking and talking about Jake can I ask you just base level question like were you surprised by this course of events like because I know you're thinking about all sorts of intersections between law and uh and crypto and then suddenly we've got smart contracts in the ofax sanction list but did this surprise you um yes it did actually and I I say that uh fully realizing that that might mean I wasn't doing my job as well as I should have because look I'm as you said I'm the head of policy for the blockchain association my job is to represent the interests of our members which cover the full range of the crypto industry here in the US with respect to what is coming down the pipe from government and the issue of privacy is one that we talk about and think about all the time because one of the issues that the government tends to have with crypto is the perception that it can be used for illicit activity more easily than the traditional Financial system or traditional financial instruments like cash so we spend a lot of time thinking and talking about this illicit Finance issue and how we can get policy makers to understand that the benefits of crypto outweigh those risks and so ofac is one of the agencies one of the um departments within the treasury Department that we think about a whole lot and sanctions is something that's on our radar nonetheless I would tell you that I did not imagine that ofac would sanction a piece of software as opposed to sanctioning persons or entities or their property I knew that and all of us have sort of known that tornado cash has been a concern for you know anti-money laundering regulators and for law enforcement right folks that have identified the use of tornado cash by the Lazarus Group which is the hacking group affiliated with North Korea for a long time so we knew that this was sort of um an issue that government was looking at but the idea that they would go after the software itself was a huge surprise to me and I think left a lot of people uh who you know work on these issues all day every day pretty surprised one thing that uh strikes me is I I sort of thought that we were okay with privacy uh blockchains in the US because we've had Z cash for like ever right and I thought okay the first action we might see against ofac or or treasury or anyone in government might be the delisting of assets like zcash asset the SEC asset from centralized exchanges we haven't seen any of that yet zcash has been you know fully private blockchain that's been in production working for for a while so this was not on my radar either Jake and I'm wondering if you think it it just Rose in importance is because like well North Korea wasn't using zcash in order to uh do some illicit transactions do some kind of money laundering cover their tracks but they were using tornado so that's when government picks its head up and says oh this thing like this thing cannot be allowed to exist and I went through the process of sanctioning smart contracts what do you think uh well I think a few things it's I mean first of all it's a really good point tornado cash is one tool that allows people to get privacy in the crypto ecosystem it's not the only one by far and it's not the first one right we've had other privacy Technologies for much longer than tornado cash which launched in 2019 I think um here's maybe one way to understand this and I'll preface this by saying um it's hard to sort of psychoanalyze policy makers from a distance so I always hesitate to sort of read their minds so I am I'm speculating a little bit here but I think first of all Monero more so than anything else Monero and and also Z cash but other privacy preserving technologies have been on the minds of regulators for a long time they haven't taken such aggressive action against any of them as they have here with tornado cash by literally making it illegal for U.S persons to use the technology but they have at least reportedly put pressure on centralized exchanges to de-list assets like Monero to limit the ability of people to access those assets for example the Department of Justice put out a framework related to cryptocurrency investigation and prosecution maybe one or two years ago and they talked about what they call aecs anonymity enhancing cryptocurrencies and basically what they said to exchanges in that public guidance was you should think very hard before you list any of these aecs because it may be impossible for you to comply with your legal obligations if you have these things you know these assets listed so it was kind of a a light but very clear and not so subtle message to exchanges that we do not like this technology that provides privacy to you know to any people who can get access to those assets um the thing is with tornado cash I wonder and this is where I'm going to speculate a little bit I wonder if ofak was really trying to Signal a consequential shift in policy that privacy technology is not allowed or if there's some other explanation for why this happened one of them is what you mentioned North Korea was using this tool quite a lot not the majority of use right all of the the stats that we have about the use of tornado cash say North Korea accounted at least recently for maybe 30 to 40 percent of volume through tornado cash that's a lot but it's it's still a minority of total volume right the majority of volume in tornado cash was was legitimate nonetheless that's a lot of illicit use and I think that puts tornado cash just as a factual matter in a different category from something like zcash where you don't see that type of of abuse by Bad actors the other thing is um and this is sort of inside baseball in DC but typically when you have a pronouncement of a big policy shift it comes from the people who are really in charge of making taking policy right in this case we would expect it to come from perhaps the director of ofac or the deputy director you know someone who's really working on this within ofac instead the announcement was made by political appointees by Brian Nelson who is the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence in the treasury Department that's a position that is nominated and appointed by the president and then also by secretary blinken who's the Secretary of State not even related to the treasury Department that made the decision and I think what this signals is this might have been more of a political decision than it was an attack on crypto right it may be that someone on a national security Committee in the Biden Administration said hey we need to signal that we are tough on North Korea what options are legally available to us and they were presented with a menu of potential options and one of them was sanctioned tornado cash and in sort of a hasty manner that was the solution that was picked so I know I'm going on and on here but I think the point is um we don't know yet what the government's view on privacy preserving Technologies broadly are and there's some weird things about the fact that tornado cash gets sanctioned here and not any other technologies that signify you know maybe this slope isn't quite as slippery as we think maybe privacy isn't totally dead this is just you know sort of a one-off situation that we need to figure out how to address that's definitely some of the conclusions that I've been thinking about that it's it it's obvious that there are there are other privacy tools out there as you said uh that are not untouched in this present moment and there's no real coincidence that it was tornado cash and North Korea North Korea really seemed to be having a centerpiece tornado cash it's definitely used for like Petty money laundering too but that really wasn't a centerpiece of this whole story that wasn't really didn't really come up in any of the verbiage used by ofak or any of the surrounding uh political spheres and unless I'm missing something and now there there's uh this conversation of Monero which if you're telling me that like the previously Regulators went over to exchanges and it was like yo yo yo be be careful about listening Monero tells me that they're actually pretty technically Adept in understanding Monero and that level of privacy and what it means to at least Loosely what it means to have base layer privacy but they didn't ban Monero based off of its usage they banned Monero or didn't Monero they I don't know what you would call it they uh communicated suggesting Restraint of using Monero from these exchanges based off of the technical properties of Monero rather than who is actually using these things now there's and and this is goes back to something that Ryan and I have said about just like the concept of privacy is that privacy is actually better suited as an application rather than a layer one chain because that's and that that has actually I think shown up in this particular case where you combine the liquidity of ether or the liquidity of usdc inside of ethereum with the application of tornado cash which instantiates privacy into those assets and all of a sudden you have a really strong use case that North Korea latched on to and so that makes me think that really this the Battleground for privacy is actually going to exist in the actual app layer where you combine the highly liquid assets in in defy you know die uscc ether with very strong cryptography that you would find in tornado cash but I also want to like bring up this conversation of like Aztec as a layer too Aztec another privacy tool on ethereum that has just as strong as security properties and privacy properties as tornado cash if not better but not used by tornado cash and so I I'm wondering Jake just like what you're thinking about like the peripheral application services that are adding privacy that aren't another layer one blockchain something that that gives you privacy on any asset uh that exists on ethereum that isn't like another layer one blockchain like Monero like that's not being used by North Korea like how at risk do these players seem to you it's a great question and it's a great point I mean the short answer is I don't know and I think one of the big challenges of this decision about tornado cash is it raises this question of at what points is ofac going to decide that a neutral tool is being used Too Much by the bad guys that nobody gets to use it anymore right we need to sort of understand where the line is I mean like I said tornado cash was about 30 to 40 percent according to the numbers we have used by North Korea that's still a minority what if it was 25 what it was what if it was 20 right at what point does North Korea get to decide hey if we use something too much then nobody in the United States is going to get to use it anymore I don't think we want to empower one of our largest foreign adversaries with the ability to shut down any technology in the U.S just by deciding to use it a lot right what if they decide that they want to use Aztec a whole lot does that mean that even though uh you know no legitimate uses of Aztec have changed right there's still people who are using it for all of the good reasons why we want privacy just the fact that North Korea is using it mean that it has to get banned I think that's not a you know a world that we can live in I just one other point though um I think it's important to to know to your point about government having a pretty good um sort of sophisticated understanding of the technology that I think that they do understand quite well that they cannot shut down ethereum and they cannot shut down the tornado smart contracts so I think people who are you know coming out and saying look at these stupid policy makers they don't understand that this decentralized technology is out of their reach I don't think that's what they're thinking I think what they're thinking is although we can't shut these systems down what we can do is limit access to them thereby limiting how effectively they can be used to launder money or carry out you know illicit Financial activity and I think in the tornado cash context given how to tornado casual Works in theory limiting U.S persons from using tornado cash will limit the anonymity set which means it will be easier for the government to identify Bad actors who are using it right the fewer legitimate uses there are for tornado cash the more effectively they think that they will be able to identify the Bad actors so it's not totally crazy that they would have made this decision it's just that it in my mind anyway violates sort of the core tenets of what we are trying to build in crypto which is a permissionless open inclusive Financial system that anyone can use right a neutral tool like like any other and just to drill down on that tornado cache and tornado cash users achieve privacy by pooling themselves altogether and so if you take out all of the legitimate actors out of the pool you only have nefarious illicit actors left in the pool and so it doesn't really matter if you put your ether through tornado cash if the only people putting their ether through tornado cash are like North Korea drug Runners and like tax evaders like sweet you're just commingling all of your ether or die or whatever with all the other illegal people of the world uh and so this just like much easier to trace down uh these transactions when everyone going through these things is illegal but it still begs the question is like sweet now we don't have any privacy tools as like good honest people of the world and I I'm wondering like this the outcome of privacy and crypto I don't think there's any way around this as in if we have privacy and crypto we are by definition co-mingling honest users who just want their basic free freedoms and privacy with money launderers drug runners in North Korea like I don't really think there's any alternative outcome so naturally this must end up in the courts right if that if that is a premise of an argument is like yes in order to have privacy you're putting honest people right next to North Korea the only way that we really have like Clarity on this is if we actually like Make That explicit and also win that win that outcome that we're allowed to do this in the courts would you agree with that Jake I think that's right I guess two points on that one is I think there is a a false belief that using tornado cash is commingling your assets with the assets of Bad actors it's not technically true and I think as a legal matter this is a really important and significant distinction right if we view the pool as having many participants all counterparties of each other then indeed it's not unreasonable to say it is illegal for you David to put your assets in tornado cash because you are transacting with a North Korean entity the North Korean entity is sanctioned it's illegal for you to transact with that party if that party is your counterparty in the pool then sure the US government has a legal justification for Banning access to the to the pool that's not really how tornado cash works and in fact this is an issue that crosses many different types of D5 protocols that use pools whether it's an amm in a decentralized exchange protocol or or a pool in you know something like compound or Ave right a borrowing protocol um I think it is it is factually incorrect to say that all users of this pool are counter parties of each other when you supply assets to tornado cash you withdraw your own assets you are not actually mixing your assets with anybody else the fact that there are other users creates an anonymity set but it does not mean that you are transacting with a sanctioned party and I think as a legal matter that's a really important distinction maybe a bit of a of a sort of wonky one but I wanted to to at least say that so my 10 ether going into tornado cash is the same 10 ether that I withdraw as in that the buckets of water do not get poured into the same bucket exactly you are not getting North Korean ether and the North Koreans are not getting your ether that is fundamentally technologically not how something like tornado cash works and I think that's that's pretty important um the the yeah and I forget what the second thing I was going to say so I'll let you know if I remember that but yeah so what's important is this is similar to how zcash works too right the more kind of users of of zcash the stronger the the the pool for anonymity right it's not you know this is a a central premise of some of these um zero knowledge privacy Solutions and so back back to what David was saying is like if ofac doesn't want U.S citizens to go use tornado which by the way was like a fantastic tool for protecting your privacy on chain I don't know of any other tool that allows us to do that so my question to treasury is cool what do you want us to use then what should we use what's legal to use instead treasury are you saying we are not as American citizens entitled to privacy of our transactions on chain is that what you're saying because it sure feels like that if you start Banning the only practical privacy tools that uh we we could actually use yeah um and that reminds me of what I was going to say before and and exactly to that point um do we have to end up in court over this issue right is there some reasonable um I want to say compromise but really what I mean is Common Ground that we can find with policy makers who have these concerns about National Security and Bad actors abusing the crypto ecosystem that will still preserve our privacy without us having to run to court and I think the answer to that question is maybe I'm not sure yet but I think we have to explore those those options so let me say a couple words about about David's question does this end up in court so that we can protect our privacy I think um the answer is probably yes ultimately and and here's why we've always struggled at least in the last 50 years since the bank secrecy Act was adopted in the 1970s and we've talked about the bank secrecy act on prior podcast so I'll skip sort of the background about that we've struggled with this question of where pointless surveillance right how much will we allow the government to intrude on our privacy for the purpose of detecting and Prosecuting Bad actors and in the digital era the pendulum has swung very far in favor of government surveillance and against individual privacy and the problem there is the idea of privacy is we should have the right of financial privacy even though Bad actors will also have that right this is sort of like a core fundamental part of our Fourth Amendment right to privacy right the Constitution basically says the government cannot search your persons houses papers and effects without a warrant and that's true for bad guys too right the government can't just come barging into your house without justifying that search even if you might be doing something illicit right the right to privacy matters more than the right of the government to surveil everything that we do to catch every single you know person who might be violating some law and I think that crypto has presented a a really um uh really Stark challenge for us because on the one hand we are now dealing with a disintermediated financial system this is very different from how anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws have worked in the past they typically deputize intermediaries in the financial system write Banks and money transmitters and and other institutions that are processing transactions for us and forces them to surveil us on behalf of the government it deputizes intermediaries here we're building a disintermediate mediated Financial system there are no intermediaries to play that role that's a huge challenge to the way that these you know anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing laws work on the other hand however government has been pretty comfortable with crypto for the last 10 years because the blockchains are public and they can surveil transactions anyway they don't need an intermediary within the crypto ecosystem to do that surveillance they use the intermediaries at the edges the Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps to kyc right to identify all of the participants in the ecosystem and then using a forensics firm like chain analysis or trm labs they can trace all the transactions as they move through the crypto ecosystem so even though it's disintermediated they're not really losing anything tornado cash changes all of that right these privacy preserving Technologies fundamentally challenge the ability of government to continue with this warrantless surveillance program that they've come to be very comfortable with and that they want to continue and that I think is where we may end up having to go to court to fight this battle to say even though you've enjoyed the ability to surveil everyone's transactions for the last roughly 50 years that's just not going to happen anymore and we need to come up with new ways to do law enforcement right to detect and prosecute the bad guy eyes who make no mistake we want to be detected and and prosecuted and punished right we're not supporters of the North Korean dictator here it's a brutal regime they are our foreign adversaries for good reason we want to undermine and and you know work against them but we can't be sacrificing our privacy you know just in the name of doing that that's a warrantless search is a great name for that if we if we don't have privacy on the base layer of blockchain that's essentially what we're subjected to and I guess what's interesting about this is the Us and other governments have had the ability to uh do the enforcement through intermediaries to date through crypto exchanges even something like like zcash or Monero what's interesting about ethereum is it is an economy and a financial system unto itself so what I find interesting as David was describing earlier of like um the North Korean shuttling money to tornado cash is they didn't go through an exchange first and buy their eth in order to like shuttle it through tornado casts that that was actually like funds procured through a hack likely the Ronin side chain or like other multi-million dollar hacks so it completely routed around and bypassed the centralized intermediaries and I wonder if us gov and treasury is just like oh wow they could do this I like I thought we were comfortable with our posture on crypto and now they're realizing that um what can be like the centralized intermediaries can be completely bypassed and so they are just spinning some stuff out as a result and seeing where their their power lies something like that could have happened yeah I totally agree I think um I guess two things one is uh Ronin is exactly the right um event to point to as I think a major contributing factor not just in this decision to sanction tornado cash but in in a political if not at foreign policy shift uh in how the US government views crypto North Korea is a rogue nation state right it's one that everyone in the world is quite concerned about and in terms of U.S foreign policy there are really three countries that the foreign policy establishment in DC is most concerned about um maybe four that's Russia Iran uh China and North Korea right so so there is a lot of thought given in DC to how do we address the threat from North Korea specifically the threat of them developing a nuclear program right no one is sure whether Kim Jong-un is crazy enough to use a nuclear weapon if he feels like it's necessary in order to stay in control of that regime and typically the way that North Korea has been prevented from developing nuclear weapons is number one by trying to prevent other countries from giving them Aid this is a big problem with China right now which has taken sort of a supportive view toward North Korea but secondly by cutting off their sources of funding right and this gets back to the purpose of sanctions in the first place the purpose of sanctions is to deprive a foreign adversary or some other foreign actor who's doing something the US government doesn't like from having access to the U.S economy and to the extent possible from having access to the global economy to starve them for money and the Ronin hack was a very material amount of funding for North Korea there's no way around the hundreds of thousands later sorry uh hundreds of millions of dollars we're talking about I think it was 640 million dollars and this is like so putting on your National defense national security cap you're like we had choked North Korea off of the global economy and now because defy was sloppy with one hack suddenly they've got 640 million dollars to go fund weapons uh against uh you know the U.S and its allies exactly and that's the second point I was going to make which is all roads lead back to defy right we love defy we see all of the amazing benefits and features of it we see how it's a revolutionary upgrade on an analog Financial system what the government sees is this is financial infrastructure that North Korea can use and it was somewhat hypothetical until something like the Ronin hack and if you add up the Ronin hack with others that the Lazarus group pulled off I think they made over a billion dollars in one year that's like 10 times more than they had made in the year previous from all illicit Financial activity that they were doing in all contexts around the world so this is material and I think it's important to recognize that just to understand where the treasury Department is coming from when they sanction something like tornado cash it's not necessarily an attack on software developers Free Speech rights or on our financial privacy rights it might be and we have to take that threat very seriously but we also have to under understand what the sort of well-meaning valid motivations are behind that that decision as well and yet we have an open source developer who is also been arrested as a result of all of this which is kind of some mixed signaling uh Jake it's it's either mixed or um or entirely confused and unintentional and I think um look I this to me is the most terrifying part of this whole story uh the sanctions are a decision made with um with at least some thought and and I think it was the wrong decision and I think we will have an opportunity to educate the treasury Department about that but at least there's some explanation for why they would have thought this was the right thing to do I cannot for my life imagine why Dutch police decided to arrest a software developer for the supposed crime of writing code and I guess just to get a little bit of background one of the three main developers behind tornado cash I think uh maybe three days or so after the sanctions came down from the U.S was arrested in Amsterdam and has now been held in detention as in behind bars for I want to say 10 days and has not been charged and what Dutch police said at the time of the arrest was that he was involved in concealing criminal Financial flows that he was engaged facilitating money laundering but they did not make any factual allegation whatsoever other than he was a developer who wrote some code and the code happened to be used by Bad actors perhaps without his knowledge and and without his intent and that to me is completely unacceptable it's unacceptable in any country but especially in a western democracy that purports to respect civil rights we cannot go around arresting software Developers for exercising their right to free speech which is what writing code is so we're still waiting to find out what the what the details are there but you know my heart goes out to um to to you know the developer who is still being held Behind Bars even though he hasn't been told exactly what he did wrong as we speak here today what's the connection between ofac having its ruling and banning tornado cash and then three days later having this person be arrested in the Netherlands is there any chance that there's a relationship here between the Netherlands and the United States or like how are these things connected it's a great question I don't know but I'll give you my best guess I think it's too coincidental to say that there's no relationship at all right there's got to be some connection there I think the connection could be as simple as and this is my guess as to what's really going on here um the treasury Department decided to sanction tornado cash largely as a result of political pressure to be tough on North Korea they did not communicate anything about that decision to their foreign Partners in other uh you know departments around the world that were you know focusing on similar issues the Dutch police are known for being particularly aggressive they took the wrong message from the sanctions which they only read about publicly and they thought well we've got one of these bad guys here in our jurisdiction let's put him in handcuffs and lock him up which is a horrible thing to think happens but the reason I think that's what happened is because typically if there is intergovernmental coordination which often there is for actions like this right all the governments sort of get together the US and their allies and make a joint decision about going after some bad actor or some terrorist group or some you know type of of uh weapon or something like that and they all act together that is not what happened here the other developers behind tornado cash have not been arrested they were not personally included in the sanctions which is very important if the treasury Department thought the developers behind tornado cash were bad guys their names would have been listed in the sanctions along with the tornado cash website and all the addresses and the smart contract that got listed there that did not happen so I'm guessing that there was not intergovernmental coordination that the Dutch police essentially went rogue and were you know took them too aggressive stance I think where that leaves us and this is the last thing I'll say but I think is sort of the most frightening aspect of all of this where that leaves us is Dutch police sort of being on their own with this arrest they probably do not have the support of the US government or other allies and so either they need to admit that they that they should not have made this arrest and they need to release this developer which would be very shameful for them rightly so because the decision that they made to arrest him is shameful but it's not often that governments are willing to sort of admit addict on something this wrong this fast or secondly they have to charge him with some crime which means they would have to charge him with the crime of writing code which again is a pretty shameful thing to do so I think that Dutch authorities are stuck in a in a pretty tough situation um the only other thing sorry just one more Point here is we don't know and it's just worth saying this we don't know if there was some other illicit activity going on that explains this arrest it is at least possible although I've seen nothing to support this it's at least possible that this developer was doing more than just writing code maybe he was aware that North Korea was laundering money through tornado cash maybe he provided them material assistance maybe he was paid for that maybe something else was going on totally unrelated we just don't know but it's a problem that we don't know right and it's a problem that the Dutch Authority's explanation in their press release doesn't say anything about that so that's sort of where we sit today and the secondary effect of this Jake of course it goes without saying though maybe we can talk about this uh after the break a bit more is that there's a massive chilling effect that this has on the industry and uh what I'm showing I don't want to show all this what I'm showing is a website for Alex uh percep this is the developer in question I think one thing that we can do as a as a crypto Community as the bankless nation is get get loud about this and so Dutch authorities need to tell us what the charges are you can't just arrest an open source developers developing privacy as a public good and not tell us what the charges are okay that is not allowed there are protests going on for Alex uh we'll include a website in the show notes where you can get involved signing petitions uh joining telegram groups to coordinate and also giving to some organizations that are paying for the legal defense of Alex should he actually be charged with something so we've got to get loud if we don't want this sort of action to continue David I know we've got a lot more to cover do you want to tease this out for us what we're going to do once we get back from the sponsors yeah there's uh hey David you're muted though yeah we're gonna go down memory lane and back into the 90s because there's a lot of parallels here with this story but also an important difference um we have been here before not as the industry of cryptocurrency but as the industry of cryptography we've gone toe-to-toe with the government over privacy tools so we're going to do a quick trip down memory lane and kind of go through some of the court cases that have set precedence and then we're going to ask Jake how is it the same how is it different and we're going to go to that through that story right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that

click the wallet icon to get started and we are back with crypto Twitter's favorite lawyer Jake Stravinsky uh Jake I want to go through some what we call the crypto Wars and this isn't the crypto Wars as cryptocurrency this is the crypto Wars of cryptography and there's a lot of parallels to court cases and legal precedence that has happened in the past and I want to start in 1991 one year before I was born where Senator Joe Biden proposed Bill 266 which allowed the government access to plain text contents of voice data and other Communications when appropriately authorized by law which basically meant that the government would be able to spy on all Communications available at will through through the internet and all other telecommunications channels by the way David did you say Joe Biden Senator Joe Biden yes interesting interesting right meanwhile Phil Zimmerman this individual named Phil Zimmerman was building RSA encryption an encryption algorithm for messages and files and this RSA algorithm was considered military grade encryption and Phil Zimmerman who was trying to release this it was meant to democratize access to strong cryptography and make the ability to communicate privately available to everyone he called this program pgp which shows for pretty good privacy a name inspired by a little-known grocery store called Ralph's pretty good grocery within a week because of the internet people started using it around the world and within a month thousands had already downloaded it it was soon used by Burmese Freedom Fighters and had even spread into Eastern Europe where one person replied to Zimmerman if a dictatorship overtakes takes over Russia your pgp is widespread from the Baltic to the Far East now and will help Democratic people if necessary let's move forward into 1993 where pgp fell into the sites of the U.S government after having attention drawn to Zimmerman through rsa's intellectual property dispute Regulators initiated a criminal investigation onto the violation of the arms export Control Act during this time in history cryptography was regulated under Munitions it was a it was a weapon and so it was regulated under this arms export control act as and you cannot export cryptography and Zimmerman was charged with exporting cryptography outside of the United States so Zimmerman was given a court date and the eff the same eff the Electronic Frontier Foundation that is coming up to to save tornado cash and fight for these same purposes now and also the public rallied behind Zimmerman and in response Zimmerman printed copies of pgp source code onto a hardback book cover as a political stunt books being protected by the First Amendment and under under Free Speech even though cryptography was not now we have cryptography on a book which is now regulated by the First Amendment so we have this uh juxtaposition between regulated cryptography and fee speech um but however Zimmerman's case versus the government did not look good he had public support but he unquestionably had violated the Munitions act but then came a little bit of an overreach by government which was the Clipper chip which was a manufacturing standard that encrypted data but also simultaneously gave the United States a back door to allow the government to access all Communications so it was like yes you can have your encryption but we get to have a back door says the government and that would be like a government version of tornado cash that has a back door for the U.S and the public just erupted against this and three major court cases came later 1994 Karn versus the United States which uh set the precedent that written cryptography in a book is not subject to the Munitions act that's not illegal to do that 1995 Bernstein versus the United States Bernstein's case that proved that cryptography was to be protected under the First Amendment under free speech so even more Broad and free than just not being under uh the Munitions act and then finally in 1996 jungler versus the United States leveraging the recent cases of Carnes and bursting jungler's case would emerged victorious in 1999 to conclude how software would be protected by the first by the First Amendment and later that year of October 12th Bill Clinton signed the executive order 13026 which removed cryptography from the Munitions list and played it placed it on a lightly controlled schedule the export of cryptography was no longer prohibited and through this order Zimmerman's case would be also dismissed because the consequences consequence of exporting no longer carried any weight so that was a history and these court cases stand to this day and these are the precedents that we stand on but this was about cryptography Jake not about cryptocurrency and so my question to you is is this the same or is this different and are we going to have to do this all over again understanding that this is the history that this industry stands on how does this go forward from here Jake can you just before I I just want to say David that was incredible dude can you get this guy a job as a paralegal or something because that was like I am I've done my reasons I did some homework before this well done yeah co-host David Hoffman thank you extremely well done we are hiring for spring diesel interns Association David I would love to uh to have you join very well done um you mean to answer your question it's the same and it's different right um I'll tell you sort of which pieces are are a witch it's the same in that code is speech right end of story code of speech and speech is protected by the First Amendment and all of the Precedence that you just explained from the 1990s from the original crypto Wars all of those are still good law right all of that precedence stands and so if push comes to shove and we have to go to court you know today or next year to argue code is speech I will feel very good about that argument there's no question about that right the first amendment protects our right to express ourselves publicly it's it's an essential right to have a functioning democracy right it's tied up with the right to to you know freedom of the press and freedom to dissent right to petition the government for a regressive grievances as the First Amendment says we have to be able to express ourselves and engage in public debate over the issues that matter to us in order to have a functioning democracy and we can express ourselves this is the law in any way we want to not just through words we can express ourselves through body language through symbols through languages other than English including programming languages and if you guys have ever you know worked closely with software Engineers or developers you know that when they write code they are expressing themselves right there is an artistic element to this they have ideas about how the world should be and instead of expressing those ideas in English or in a blog post they're doing it in a different language in code that is absolutely first Amendment protected activity here's where it might be though a little bit different in the crypto context first of all we are talking about value not information and the law not the Constitution but federal law sanctions law the same law that authorized to a fact to designate tornado cash for the SDM list the specially designated Nationals list that law has an exception called the Berman Amendment which applies to communication of information this is why you have sanctioned parties on Twitter right this is why it's not a violation of sanctions law for Twitter to allow Iranians or you know Russians or whoever else who are sanctioned to participate on social media because there's an exception for information we don't have that exception for transactions in value or for sales of goods and services so there's some lesser protection in statute for cryptocurrencies than there are for just general encryption which protects our ability to convey information to each other so that's one difference another difference is the law protects speech but it does not say that government cannot regulate speech at all what it says is government must meet certain requirements in order to regulate speech right first of all there are some types of speech that are not protected like fighting words or you know famously the example of yelling fire in a crowded theater right something that's going to create imminent danger for others or obscenities right child pornography things like this are not protected by the First Amendment then you have types of speech that are protected less than others so commercial speech for example has less protection than non-commercial speech and the government can still regulate those types of speech provided that they have a compelling interest or an important interest and they tailor those regulations to the specific type of speech that they're that they're trying to limit or restrict and you know the body of First Amendment case law defining when the government can regulate speech is very vast you know they're obviously you know Law School courses that are taught on this issue and people who dedicate their entire lives their whole professional careers to analyzing it so there's much more than we can cover just in a minute here but it's important to know that just because something is speech does not mean the government cannot regulate it at all there's also a very important distinction and you'll find this in some of the cases that you mentioned David Junger is one of them there's another case Corley which is very important which distinguishes between code AS speech in other words the writing of code in a way that expresses ideas versus the use of that code to carry out some type of activity and what courts say basically is when code is expressing ideas it's protected by the First Amendment but when it is only being used as a functional piece of technology it is conduct not speech and therefore it is not protected and the question for us is when is a piece of software a smart contract or a protocol when is it speech and when is it conduct and I think one way to think about that is if you're a software developer and you write code and you publish it you just put it on a website you make it available to download you put it on GitHub that is first Dynamic protected speech but then as soon as it's deployed on a blockchain and someone is using it not to convey ideas to other people but rather to convey instructions to a computer or to a machine right to the ethereum virtual machine well in that case maybe it's not speech maybe it's conduct and courts would say this is not protected so these are pretty sticky issues and I definitely think you know in the context of of processing transactions quite different from just the 1990s question about encrypting messages or you know conveying information all of these things uh Jake is you know it does feel very much like we are in like 1990 though right in terms of like it feels like the court systems at least in the U.S and probably internationally need to go through the process through court cases and precedents to actually clarify what what the lines are and what um in the because the U.S the Constitution uh allows U.S citizens to do and what it doesn't I mean do you think that there is a like a case for ofac uh to stand on and treasury to say hey this is um constitutionally valid sanctioning smart contract addresses and prohibiting American uh Americans um use of tornado for privacy services or do you think that that is at the base unconstitutional either in the First Amendment for First Amendment reasons Fourth Amendment reasons or other reasons um so my opinion is that it is um that it is unlawful that for ofac to sanction a smart contract address I'm not sure that it's unconstitutional I think it probably is I think that there are very serious first fourth and fifth amendment their Fifth Amendment due process rights that we haven't discussed um you know those issues I think all come into play here I think maybe more importantly it's a violation of the statute ayiba the international emergency economic Powers Act which is um sort of the the Fountain of all sanctions Authority comes from ayiba I think it violates ayiba I think it also likely violates the cyber-related sanctions program which is one of the executive orders uh that was issued in I think by President uh Bush uh number 43 in the 2000s um and I do think that it may be that this is an issue we have to take to court I I'm sure that ofec has a legal analysis which is privileged buried somewhere deep in the treasury Department explaining their theory for why this is a lawful and permissible use of their sanctions power I would love to know what is in that memo and what their argument is it's not clear to me what their what their justification is and you know the defy education funds uh where I'm a board member has been doing great work on this they submitted a foia request Freedom of Information Act request seeking more information from treasury about what justification they have for this my guess is they will not respond to that foil request they are not required to um because of an exemption uh having to do with National Security so I doubt we'll get an answer to that question but I think this is a key issue right we need to know how treasury understands the interplay between the right of individuals to privacy and free speech and due process as compared to their ability to prohibit all U.S persons from using technology but so help me understand the process here is there any downside for a treasury to do something like this even even if they have some legal analysis buried somewhere in the treasury archives right it's like you know potentially that analysis comes out and says hey this is kind of like legally dubious anyway uh but but is there any downside for treasury to just you know blanket smart contract ban I mean if they're wrong do they have to pay a penalty or do they just go they brought to court Court decides and they just go oh I'm sorry we want to do it again like I don't know that how much stake skin in the game there is for for treasury is it just egg on their face if they're wrong or do they not really pay any any cost individually they basically don't pay any costs at all I suppose there's maybe a you know reputational risk like you said egg on their face right they look stupid for having done something that was illegal and then having a judge say that they shouldn't have done it um I don't think that's a very significant concern at this point and the reason I say that is because and this is sort of a just a macro point about how things are in Washington DC right now um Congress doesn't function very effectively right Congress doesn't pass a lot of of legislation and what that has led to is the administrative state right the federal agencies pushing their authority to its limits just to get anything done in DC and they understand that they may push their Authority Beyond its limits and they may lose in court but their view is kind of like well we got away with the sanctions for some number of years we had the impact we wanted to have and if in five years a court says we shouldn't have done that well so be it we're not really going to pay a price for that the individual individuals at the treasury Department and this is true broadly in government have something called qualified immunity they are never held personally liable for their actions if carried out under color of law as part of their government job there's some exceptions to that but broadly speaking no one in Treasury Department has personal skin in the game for making a decision like this so how do we drive this to the court system and actually court cases like what happens next to do what we did as David described in the 1990s where we actually get court cases and decisions that are made clarifying what um what the what the real position of the U.S is on this yeah a great question so I there's a couple things that we can that we can do now and that we should think about one is learning the lessons from the crypto Wars of the 1990s and part of the reason that we won the crypto Wars was this litigation strategy right these these decisions that we got from courts saying that code is protected speech that's not the only reason that we won the crypto Wars the other big reason is that the private sector said in order for us to build new products and services on the internet we have to use encryption right this came down to e-commerce there was no way without encryption for people to buy and sell things online unless they were able to encrypt their personal identifying information their credit card numbers or their social security numbers right so there was for industrial reasons for economic reasons a justification for why encryption should be accepted and that really got the government to back off of this issue and I think we need to learn that lesson in here if companies want to use crypto and if that becomes an important element of the US economy then maybe we don't have to go to court because the government is going to agree with us that privacy matters more than just their concerns about National Security so that's part of this another part of it is testing whether the slope is actually slippery right not All Slopes are slippery and it may be that treasury is not in fact going to start sanctioning other protocols and sanctioning ethereum and causing validators not to build on blocks that have tornado cash transactions and all of these sort of you know fever dream nightmare scenario concerns that we have which has been a lot of the chatter recently by the way on crypto Twitter right we just fast forwarded a nightmare scenario dystopia totally and look I understand that and you know many of us are a bit paranoid in crypto and I think that you know we come by that honestly we have good reason for it but it may be that that's not actually where this is going next and and the reason I mention that is there is a downside for us in running to court and and bringing these cases it's exactly what I've just said before about the possibility that a Court decides that code is conduct not speech and by going to court to challenge this decision we actually end up with precedent that harms our perspective right that sets bad case law that reduces our civil rights and civil liberties and particularly in the National Security context courts tend to be very deferential to the government so even though we understand the benefits of tornado cash a judge may think well this was just something North Korea was using for money laundering why would I care about this and and it's actually a set of facts that could end up in bad case law for us so we have to be really careful about running to court however if at the end of the day it turns out that we simply have a fundamental disagreement with U.S policy makers about the importance of privacy that their view essentially is Cash is bad we wish there wasn't cash if we could ban cash we would because we do not want anyone anywhere to transact privately we want to surveil every single transaction in the entire world and we think the Constitution allows us to do that we will take them to court and we will win so we have to play this out I think a little bit longer to see you know sort of the reality on the ground but I do fear that that is where this is ultimately heading in the next few years so this is a game of chess and we have to choose our moves carefully and choose which cases we decide to bring to court and fight very carefully as well as what you're telling us that's exactly right one thing I want to bring up uh before we close this out Jake is the conversation of the overreaction of the crypto industry um we had as a result of ofac we had Circle ban uscc from inside tornado cash and I don't really think anyone really considers that an overreaction I think that everyone kind of considers that like yeah that's that's pretty expected but then it kind of overflowed from there we had uh Microsoft the owner of GitHub take down the tornado cash repository removing tornado caches code from the internet and also removing some tornado cache core devs so I want to ask you about that was that an over overreaction and then we'll also get into some other reactions perhaps overreactions after that as well but let's start there did GitHub really need to pull down the tornado cache Repository uh so you know I don't want to give legal advice um so I'll just you know drop my disclaimer back in there right don't do or not do anything because of what I say here my personal view is no I don't think that was required I do think that was an overreaction I can understand uh having uh being a compliance lawyer in my past and knowing a lot of compliance lawyers these are folks who are not comfortable with uncertainty so I can understand why the compliance department at Microsoft for example might have said we don't want anything to do with this there's no benefit to us in leaving this uh this repository up let's just take it down and let's just ban these these accounts I think that's a mistake and I I would hope that companies that have software developers as one of their key constituencies would be a bit more aligned with the principles that that those um those developers care about so I think that's quite disappointing in terms of of others who have for example blocked sanctioned addresses from their front and interfaces or you know in the case of circle I think that any of that is an overreaction I think it's unfortunate but you have to understand these are U.S companies they are you know headquartered in the United States they're people who go to work in the US they're subject to U.S jurisdiction and the message of the Treasury Department is sending and I you know I've had some conversations with with officials over there I won't you know divulge any specific details but the message that we're getting from treasury is the industry needs to do more the industry should not be waiting for us to designate every single address that should be blocked the industry should not wait for it to be clearly illegal to do something for um you know in order for uh for them to take action and you know I think that is a demand for over compliance and I think to the credit of many folks in the industry there's been a lot of resistance to that so you're already sort of pushing against this demand from the treasury Department to do more than is legally required but sanctions laws are very expansive and the fact of the matter is if you're a U.S person it is illegal for you to transact with a sanctioned address it is also illegal for you to facilitate third parties transacting with those addresses and I think we just have to understand where there are companies that have control over these types of systems they're going to have to comply with sanctions laws there's nothing we can do about that and if you don't like it then build more decentralized systems that can't be controlled which is which is really the message of the day right decentralize everything Jay can you just like bottom line this like underline this for us so if a U.S citizen uses tornado cash right now what are the penalties and recognizing that you're not a lawyer but like in it just a maybe a conservative reading of what uh treasury has just said yeah um if you do it intentionally in other words like you didn't mistakenly hit the wrong button or something like that and transact with tornado cash by mistake if you intentionally transact with the tornado cash address which has been sanctioned it's a crime and it's punishable by fines and imprisonment and I look sanctions laws are quite weird and ofac um exercises a lot of prosecutorial discretion so I do not think again not legal advice but I do not think that a law-abiding U.S citizen who mistakenly transacted with tornado cash after it was sanctioned is actually very likely to go to prison but this is a strict liability offense from on the Civil side and if you do it intentionally it is a crime as a matter of Law and so yes that is the situation that's the bottom line it is illegal for U.S persons to transact with tornado cash or to facilitate transactions involving can I just get the like the gut feeling there as tornado cash is a privacy tool that uh I have used in the past right not in the future by the way not post-sanction uh U.S treasury Janet Yellen case you're listening um but in the past it's a very useful tool to protect your privacy on chain what you just said is if I were to go use tornado cash tomorrow I could be thrown in jail for that that feels authoritarian AF like that is incredibly disturbing just like it if you got to this point in the episode you've all heard all the president all of the case but like you just bottom line it like that and the fact that the developer one of the developers who actually created that privacy code has now been in jail for the past 10 days and we don't know why like I understand why all of crypto why all of us and I hope you listen or understand why we're talking about this so much is because it feels dystopian it feels scary it feels like I don't know where I'm living anymore is this just like a clerical error mistake Jake or is this like what our future is increasingly going to look like I don't know um it's worth being concerned about I'll I'll put it that way I I don't it wasn't a clerical error that's for sure um it may have been a mistake like I was saying before this may not be a pronouncement of U.S policy that privacy is not allowed in fact it can't be that because the Constitution is the law of the land and the Constitution guarantees us privacy rights under the first amendments and the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment yes the freedom of speech is also the freedom to speak anonymously there's a right to privacy in the First Amendment it's not just the Fourth Amendment uh warrant requirement that gives us a right to privacy and I it would be again a shame if a western democracy if the if the country that is supposed to lead the Free World the United States on issues of Human Rights and civil liberties were to say we don't believe in privacy anymore and I I am confident evidence in if not the executive branch and not the legislative branch at least the Judiciary right the courts to enforce that right and like I said it may be that someday before long we're in front of the United States Supreme Court arguing for an expansive interpretation of the right to privacy I will feel very good I'll sleep very well at night making that argument so that's what we have to do then that's what we'll do one last airt one last area Jake before we go on and wrap this show up and once again thank you so much for for all of your time I don't really think there's a lot of clarity here but I'm going to go ahead and ask the question anyways uh conversations in the crypto on crypto Twitter and in the crypto space quickly came to their logical conclusion as to will entities like Lido or coinbase sensor transactions that go into the blockchain that are uh like ohflac non-compliant right so like if I go and if I go and touch tornado cash will my transaction even get into the blockchain and I'm wondering if there's has there any been any uh conversation that you've been listening to or any like thoughts that you have about the actual censorship of the protocol level from entities like coinbase or Lido is this something that you could see ofac um actually Bringing Down the hammer on like if you are a block producer you are not allowed to process ofac in compliant blocks uh what are your thoughts on this this angle I the short answer is yes I I do think that um you know and I don't want to speak to any particular company but like I said before if you're a US person in other words you're a company uh Incorporated in the United States you're subject to sanctions laws and the sanctions laws say don't transact with tornado cash don't facilitate transactions with tornado cash I don't think it's a facilitation word that really makes us relevant right yeah I think so right I mean in a sense Miners and validators are facilitating transactions and if you look at the Bitcoin context uh you know look this isn't the first time we've seen addresses added to the sanctions list in 2018 Bitcoin addresses were added to the sanctions list the expectation is a U.S minor will not mine a block that includes a transaction with one of those sanctioned addresses though I don't I from what I've gathered that actually hasn't been done like uh Bitcoin node infrastructure doesn't actually restrict Bitcoin those Bitcoin addresses on the ofac list so I don't want to speak to what anyone in particular is doing I I think you know again putting my um my lawyer hat on if I had a client who was a U.S minor I would be telling them it is a technical violation of sanctions laws to mine a block that includes a transaction with a sanctioned address here's where I think there's an important distinction is it also a violation of sanctions laws to mine a block that doesn't include that transaction but Builds on a previous block that does have one of those transactions and the widespread industry standard view is that is not a violation of sanctions laws right you're not facilitating some transaction in a past block just by building on top of that block if that were to change the fact were to change its its view on that at least as far as I understand its current view which is that that's permissible that is a humongous problem but here's the thing and again not to give Folks at treasury too much credit because I know that we all like to sort of you know come up with conspiracy theories about how evil they are but like I don't think they're trying to destroy crypto I don't think that that's their view I don't think they're trying to take down ethereum so I think that um that it's reasonable to assume or at least to Hope and it's on us here in DC to you know do the education and the advocacy to make sure it stays that way that they will not take the view that you have to reorg the chain or else you're in violation of sanctions laws Jake this has been incredibly helpful and you know I'm curious because you're in DC we don't really know this is back to kind of the action items like for us we don't really know if what we're doing is successful so here's Bank list we're making a lot of noise about this I'm tweeting things Jake I I do it on the daily basis I tweet things okay we talk about it on the on the show um we we give where we can to political advocacy groups that are fighting for these rights uh does treasury see any of this like does this have an impact and can you give us a list of the things from your Vantage Point that have the highest impact because as we've said here on Bank list we're less worried about the future of ethereum and we're more worried about the future of in this case the United States the Western Liberal Liberal democracy and restricting freedom of its citizens like uh the events of the last few weeks have once again made me question what country I actually live in and I'm glad you reminded me of all of the constitutional rights I have because I kind of forget them when I see actions like this taken by ofak and like right to privacy being restriction if I use this privacy protocol I could get sent to prison anyway what are the most impactful ways we can actually change the tone and tenor of the conversation in the executive branch legislative and U.S government writ large so first of all this has a huge impact and my message for the two of you for you know the bankless boys as you've come to be known on Twitter is like keep doing what you're doing this is this is hugely influential I will tell you every time I've come on Bank list I've heard within the next week or two from high ranking sometimes officials in government who have listened to our episode and have internalized some of the the concepts that we've discussed and I'm guessing in the next couple weeks I'm going to hear from Folks at treasury who have listened to this so you guys are having a real impact this really matters I think um what else can we do I think keep talking about the positive use cases of Technology like tornado cash I think the main issue specific to privacy that we need to address is the belief on the part of government that there is no valid use case for technology like tornado cash that is a perspective that they have know that reality use case for a mixer and I think that's absolutely wrong but we need to elevate the voices of people who are using these Technologies for good whether that's you know your average uh you know employee of a crypto company who's getting their salary in crypto and they don't want everyone in the world to know how they're spending their money so they want to use a privacy preserving technology to the dissidents or Freedom Fighters in other countries who are using this technology not because they are anarchists and think the U.S government is evil but because for example they don't want Vladimir Putin to know what they're doing with their money or Xi Jinping or Kim Jong-un or someone like that right that's who this technology in large part is for we need to elevate those voices we need to tell those stories so that we can explain the human cost not the theoretical or philosophical cost to the real human cost of restricting access to these Technologies and that I think is how we can change Minds we can win hearts in the treasury Department these are these are good people trying to do the right thing trying to look out for the the best interests of the United States and and all of us we need to help them to make good decisions so I think that's the best thing we can do keep talking keep writing keep exercising your first amendment rights right I think you know one thing that's just worth saying is as dystopian as this feels we still get to do this podcast and we still get to say we do not like what our government has done we think they are wrong we get to dissent and no one is going to put us in prison for that and we should be thankful for that right because there are a lot of places in the world including in North Korea where if we did this we would be arrested and that is what we have to fight against I think that's what we're all here for well said uh bankless Nation you've heard it here and if anyone from treasury is is listening of course just a reminder that David and I have not transacted with tornado cash here lately since OPEC but but we were users before true for legitimate reasons very legitimate reasons uh but you've given us a Content challenge here Jake which I think is uh more emphasis on the positive uses of privacy and a reminder uh to folks of of why we need privacy uh and uh the freedoms and protections that it brings to the average individual uh Jake last thing here for Action items blockchain Association how can we support it also you mentioned defy education fund how can we support your work specifically in the crypto kind of advocacy work in DC can you give us some uh ways to get involved here and and support it financially yeah for sure so um for us at the blockchain association we're a trade Association we have members that again run the span of the entire crypto industry in the US if there are you know folks out there working in the industry we'd love to talk to you about joining the blockchain association that's the best way that you can get involved directly with our work um I think you know if you're looking for someone to donate money to obviously we appreciate any support that you can give us but just be aware and Ryan you were tweeting about um about uh you know either a Bitcoin round or you know a way to sort of get money to support these advocacy efforts you know thankfully we have membership dues so we you know have money that comes in from our member companies the defy education fund doesn't and they are doing some of the best work on this issue the director of their Miller White House Levine is really a star in this space and I would recommend you guys have him on um if you haven't to talk about what he's doing there they do not have members they do not have more funding they were funded by an initial Grant from uniswap governance and so they could really use your support the same thing for a coin Center or the same thing for the Electronic Frontier Foundation fight for the future and you know other organizations who are doing this work I think if you've got some some dollars to put behind this effort then look at them guys the last thing is if you want to amplify those dollars bankless is going to uh help create co-create with the community kind of a care package of these crypto advocacy groups that's got to include defy education fund coin Center the eff and others and there is a git coin grants matching round it's going to be at least three million dollars that will be matched for your donation you guys if you've used Bitcoin the grants matching before you know how this works you give a dollar it's Amplified by like 20x or 50x so you've given 50 towards these sort of organizations so give now or mark on your calendar September 7th that time window the next get coin grants matching is opened up Jake I want to thank you again for going through these these items with us today we'll bring you back the next time the house is on fire as we always do thank you so much for your help looking forward to it pleasure guys thanks take care bankless Nation gotta end with this as always risks and disclaimers eth is risky all of crypto is risky so is D5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
