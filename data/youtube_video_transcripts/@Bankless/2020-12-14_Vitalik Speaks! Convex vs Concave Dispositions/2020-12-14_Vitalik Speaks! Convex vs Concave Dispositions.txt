design design decisions behind proof of stake and when you uh when you you know verbalize your arguments and kind of just like thought out loud about these the weighing the pros and cons uh the way that you did that turns to our the next uh article that we want to talk about which is convexity versus concavity um yeah and and so like and we're just burning through your articles here so you can put out a blog post faster than anyone uh and and i totally aligned with this article and ryan and i chewed on it together and had some conversations about like the implications of this before we get into those conversations maybe you can kind of give us the synopsis on like convex versus concave dispositions uh yeah so i think the core idea here is basically that like whenever there is a trade-off and there's like a choice between a kind of taking one path and taking another path um one of the kind of more subtle differences between how people view that trade-off is basically like do they uh is how they view the kind of extremes as opposed to what like the the options in the middle right so basically do they view it as the sort of a situation where a a moderate op the moderate option is kind of more likely to be better than the extreme options or do they view it as this scenario where you know it is one or the other and if you try to mix the two together then it just completely does it doesn't make any sense and like you know it really is either this or that uh and so like those two graphs that are right there like they do a good job of kind of showing what the perspective is right like basically like the graph on the left like the concave worldview as a kind of like you have a yeah a graph that's kind of sloped downward so it's kind of like a hill right like so there's there's always some option in the middle that's best but you know whether it's uh kind of in the middle but much closer to the left or in the middle much closer to the right that's something you can legitimately argue on but then uh you know as you go further to the extremes um then eventually on either side it just uh start starts becoming worse versus the convex worldview which looks less the chart looks like a hill and more like a valley where you know he pretty much you wants to be either on one side or the other side in the middle is the worst place to be uh so again like this starts off being very abstract but if you go like once we uh kind of go forward and go a few paragraphs down like we could see out of where uh it starts becoming more concrete and where you can see some like specific examples of like what concave and convex means right so here i just like give us some examples of like what kinds of things someone with a concave might disposition versus a convex disposition might say so like one of them uh so like one kind of concave statement uh going to the extremes has never been good for us you can die from being too hot or too or too cold we need to find the balance between the two that's just right um if you implement only a little bit of a philosophy you can pick the parts that are the best and avoid the parts that are risky but if you insist on going to the extremes then once you've picked the low hanging fruit um the next fruit that you have to pick or but you'll be forced to work harder and harder you'll have smaller and smaller benefits and the risks might multiply and outweigh the whole thing um the opposing philosophy the philosophy that you favor less probably has some value too and so you should generally try to combine the benefit the the best parts of both and definitely avoid things that the opposing philosophy continues to consider to be extremely terrible um you know it's just in case they have more of a point than you realized and then some examples of our convexa statements uh one is that we need to focus otherwise we risk becoming a jack-of-all-trades master of none um another example of a convex concept is the kind of the slippery slope concept so if we take even a few steps down that road it'll become a slippery slope and um only pull us down even further until we end up in the abyss there's only two stable positions either here or there uh and we want to stay here um if you give an inch it'll take a mile um whether we're following this philosophy or that philosophy we should just be following something and stick to it stick to it making a wishy-washy and a mix of everything doesn't make sense um and so so after this like i get into what's probably the kind of motivating example of this idea for me which is basically the bitcoin versus uh kind of ethereum you know like before before before we get there like i feel like i've met these two types of people right like i i've met the the you know the binary thinker the convex disposition thinker where it's just like you're with me or against me kind of individual right and then i've definitely met the the concave disposition which is a bit more the pragmatist i could see it this way i could see it that way why don't we find the balance in between um and one of those definitely sounds like more of an ethereum not to stereotype and one of those sounds definitely more like a bitcoin or again not to stereotype part of me wonders how much people are just hardwired into these modes like from like birth and genetics and like whatever happens to them in the in the in the early ages because i don't know like i've definitely met these types of people and i'm not sure how much they can kind of help it and it's definitely noted in the crypto industry like when you come into this world you find yourself quickly moving into a camp of sorts like usually bitcoiners or aetherians and like you kind of find yourself in to be one or the other and there never really seems to be any this like moment of flux where people are confused they just kind of come to find themselves aligned with one of their particular communities and it's i think you've totally tapped onto a very real parameter of personality that i think would predispose someone for one community or the other no definitely i think right again it's a it's definitely a really interesting question like to to what extent someone uh someone's a disposition toward this like is you know either genetic or just like some cultural thing that's like so deep like five thousand year old or whatever that might as well be genetic um like like if that's true then you know that does mean that you know for example even if you personally like ethereum more than bitcoin that there you're there's just no way that you're ever going to convince 100 of the world population to also be in that same camp and so like you just have to acknowledge that bitcoin is going to continue to exist and there will always be some constituency that it appeals to and if you're a bitcoin person then you'll have to kind of pretty much admit the opposite um so you know if people really are different in that way then that does also just like say something for a kind of maximalism versus pluralism in the world and i guess just one of the nice things about cryptocurrency as opposed to say traditional nation states is that it's just so much easier to kind of sort yourself into the community that reflects your values more so what i want to ask you about your opinion as to the scalability of these social organizations that people find themselves in so the way that i interpreted the convexity versus concavity graphs like one is a u shape and one is a n shape right and so if you put a ball on one of on both of those on the on the con cavity it rolls off to the edges right it fall it falls off to the edge and then there's like a pit that the ball would fall into like a uh and my mind goes to what amin sulemani calls a moloch trap right a little trap where people like fall into where the convexity is uh it's a valley right you you rocks that fall down to the bottom of the valley the center of the valley so my gut take is that a convex worldview or convexity is a more scalable group of coordinated people with the same opinions because they tend to converge upon pragmatism they tend to converge upon the same idea ideologies whereas the concavity seems to find itself in falling into a thousand different traps in different directions uh would you actually i think just one quick way to fix your analogy unfortunately i think it's it's the concave world view right that's the one that's more inclined to stay in the middle like the problem is that like in economics the concept of utility is like positive utility is better right and so like the graph like how good whereas the gravity analogy is like you know he wants to fall down right and so down as like the the direction of the tendency or like preference if you want to like uh talk about fundamental physical forces that way uh so like look at it upside down i guess if you want to analogize it that way but yes and i think that but like module of that it's definitely a great way of uh looking at the issue uh because like i think one of the challenges with the convex worldview is that basically that um like if your worldview was that right now we're on the top of a mountain and we are gonna fall on the left side of the mountain versus the right side of the mountain then your first instinct is going to be well which side of the mountain uh see or that seems less bad to fall down and we're just going to fight like hell to make everyone fall down that side as fast as possible to avoid the greater evil of people falling down the uh falling down the other side of the mountain and then if you have people on both sides they're both thinking that way then you know you basically end up getting into a tag of war so and i think that like that's definitely a very kind of good consequence of that intuition pump and so for for for those uh listening in who maybe um haven't seen that yet do we have some examples from the the bitcoin community for from the ethereum community to kind of maybe maybe prove this out i consider you almost in this article like it's a little bit philosophy but it's a little bit anthropology as well right where you're like studying the culture of bitcoin and the decisions that the culture has made and contrasting that to the um the decisions and the culture that that ethereum has but what are some good examples of this like for was the block size debate a good example of this cultural temperament um absolutely uh so basically uh and if you remember the block size debate like basically the block size at the beginning was one megabyte and then there were all of these arguments about you know do we make blocks unlimited do we make them 20 megabytes to make them eight megabytes do we do some 248 sort of thing and eventually the side that ended up winning is very close to the extreme small block side it basically says amino blocks are one megabyte and then there's just one kind of soft fork called segweight which de facto increases the block size to 2.3 megabytes and then there's basically no increase that kind of going from there right and if you remember during the block size debate in the big block camp there were a lot of people who are were in favor of moderate increases so people who were in favor of you know eight but not twenty or four but not eight um and there were people who are in favor of just not having a block size limit at all because they felt that um you know the system just needs to be able to support as much capacity as the needs or like the market should be deciding block size and like there's a bit of a tangent about how that particular claim is crazy because the mechanism isn't really a market but and basically like you did have like these people who wanted very big and i remember like one of the arguments that that the very big block people would make is basically that well you know if you opposed uh like what the small block people are trying to do is that you should follow that thinking to the quote logical conclusion and you should realize that ultimately the correct approach is no block size limit at all right and i remember being fascinated by that because like okay so basically if you're saying that um you know moving from um like point x to point x plus one uh like if you support moving from x to x plus one then you should also support moving from x x plus ten to x plus eleven like no i don't believe that at all like what kind of world view is this that's a convex world for you it's a very complex world yeah it is indeed and so that was uh convex people on the big block side right and then convex people on the small block side like they're like i argued against someone in a lot of places like reddit whatever all the time right like a lot of the smaller blockers would say things like i would say oh no you know see we need to compromise and we need to make sure that it's possible to read the uh to read the blockchain and it's also possible to write to the blockchain you need to send the transaction and transactions to the blockchain and at affordable rates and we need to find some way to compromise between those two and they're like no you know either the system is decentralized or it isn't and if it's 95 decentralized then really that just means it's on a track toward not being decentralized at all and either you can verify the thing or you can't and everyone should be verified everyone should be totally verifying yet anything that involves any degree of trust just is trust and you know we should all just dismiss any any level of trust as being basically the same as just using paypal uh and i remember also finding this this world view like very unreasonable and dogmatic as well and actually i yeah on that specific issue i wrote another vitalik.ca article recently if you remember the one that's called on trust models uh this was from august right like this is the one where i talk about the differences between yeah if you have a philosophy section i think it's there uh third one there it is that's 20 20 august 20. um basically you know there's n of n trust models there's n over two event trust models there's one of interest or zero of interest scroll down a bit you see the graph right there it is uh so basically the the thing that i argued is that one of them trust is actually much much closer to zero of interest than it is to n out of two of interest right and like on the graphite it really does seem like it is much uh like much closer but a person who has a convex perspective on trust would say you know no no either you're at zero of n or your trust and if you're trust then you're on team paypal and well okay paypal is going to support ethereum now so you know we can't keep my uh a pal i don't know who are we supposed to hate um what's interesting about it is because this convex um bent at at first blush it looks um very strong because the community absolutely stands for things there shall be only 21 million thou shalt not print more bitcoin ever but then when you like when you kind of look at it a little bit more and maybe this is just the the concave in me kind of speaking but you also see this brittleness like i wonder quite frankly what the convex bitcoiner community is going to do if it finds out that it needs more security than 21 million bitcoin at some point as these happenings continue into the future does it does does that convex uh like mode just tear at the center and become brittle does the community completely fracture apart because it can't make any compromise on anything at all it has to stick with sort of this this maximalist type of ideology and philosophy so it's weird because it appears that there's a strength to this like philosophy but there's also a brittleness to it and i'm not sure how to i'm not sure how to see that no and i definitely think that's a very good way of describing the trade-off like the this concept of shelling fences and um just setting heart boundaries and saying we're just never ever going beyond them that's like that's definitely a powerful thing it's a it's definitely can be a scalable form of social coordination it can be very emotionally appealing as well but yes you know it is brittle and as soon as you enter into a kind of territory that you were not expecting it is can easily end up backfiring on you uh so like in the case of bitcoin right like if they discovered that transaction fees are not enough they basically have three choices like one of them is uh print more than 21 million the second is a switch to proof of stake and then the third is just accepts that the blockchain will get 51 attack from time to time and uh you know like you'll just have like people uh like sometimes days worth of transactions being reverted and it's surprised to be into an insane extreme extent just how many people are willing to accept the third option right right like i don't know have you seen any of this like even on twitter like oh no no no no no you don't understand that like transactions being ever being final was never one of the intended properties of bitcoin pierre rashard makes this exact argument that it's no big deal right like we could wait days for transactions to finalize would you characterize this as a moloch trap good question um is this emo uh is this a molag trap i guess well a molar trap would be a situation where like everyone or most people want the situation to go in a certain direction but just because they can't get along and ends up going in in the opposite direction i guess in that bitcoin case like would it be a moloch trap like one possibility would be that like people actually literally genuinely prefer the blockchain breaking once every few weeks to violating either one of the core tenants but i think what would happen in reality is that there's a small minority that genuinely feels that way but the average bitcoiner i think is more pragmatic and they really would rather switch to uh proof of stake or add a small amount of issuance and then accepts that state of affairs uh and so like i could i could definitely see just like coordination failures between those two leading to like a split or weed or just taking a really long a really long time to resolve the situation and i definitely categorized that as being monologue well a split is not necessarily involved but if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing so vitalik it was very obvious to me when you were writing this that uh it was coming from the design philosophy of blockchains um the line the design philosophy of cryptoeconomic networks but on the bankless program ryan and i talk about how these cryptoeconomic networks are very comparable to like a neo nation a new a new generation of a nation right and so when we're talking about design philosophy of a blockchain network we're also kind of talking about the design philosophy of a new type of social organization a new kind of nation and so when ryan and i resonated with the concave view it seemed to be out of an endeavor and and also when we uh kind of come to the came to the conclusion that ethereum seems to be resonating with the concave view that ethereum is trying to offer this uh credibly neutral layer and what is credible neutrality other than being in the middle being a pragmatist about uh the middle of a curve and so when a good nation state to me allows people to go about their day and achieve their personal goals without having the any any sort of convexity of the design dispositions of a nation state or a crypto economic network getting in the way of this individual's goals right like we want to empower the individual but it's important to have an organization where the whims of one individual doesn't impact the whims of another individual in achieving their daily goals and so that's where the neutrality of a nation-state or the neutrality of a cryptoeconomic network comes into play in order to really empower the individual without enabling them to get in the way of of empowering others is it was this kind of what you were thinking about when when you wrote about this yeah and i think this kind of concrete versus uh convexity definitely has uh implications going far beyond uh uh out of crypto uh politics and i think like nation state issues are definitely one place where that this becomes uh also a really a really important concern i mean down the road line i even give examples around uh like nation state issues like dealing with the coronavirus and taxation and how convexity and concavity and war like um how they end up kind of affecting those uh and one philosophical thing that you could argue is that like even the concept of freedom is to some extent a fundamentally concave concept right because uh like one way to think about freedom is that like if side a is my way of life is better and everyone should should live according to my way of life and side b as your way of life is better and everyone should live according to your way of life then and i know freedom basically says well people who like my way of life live according to my way of life and people who like your way of life live according to your way of life and that act like that is in some way a compromise between those two options right uh so and yeah you can definitely look at jagged concavity in that way but then and as we see there's a lot of kind of different layering here you can look at concavity in a lot of different ways uh i mean you can even look at concavity versus convexity as something affecting your personal decisions so like a bit further above uh in the case of uh bitcoiners right yeah the carnivory thing was uh one great example of uh this is like proof that this actually does get into like like this is convexity right like if you're uh you know like a concave person would say oh you know you should eat a balanced diet and you should make sure to have like some have some salad have uh some good like beater fish or whatever you like have some uh um have some grains but a uh convex person would say no no there's one thing that's healthiest that you should you should figure that out using research and you should just eat it right so carnivores are convenient vegans are also convex um but you know on the other hand um you know normal people end up being being more concave and on the diet issue i find myself work on cave too what a coincidence it's it's funny because um i think this this is the type of article that you have to kind of like chew on and um you can apply to so many areas of life but i i will tell you that one gift it gave me is actually understanding crypto twitter and understanding like bitcoiner culture and ethereum culture because for so long vitalik like i just didn't understand it to be honest like i didn't understand the perspective where you kind of explain something or you talk about something and there'd be still such a chasm such a delta and it's because of these totally different worldviews like once you see it it kind of explains everything i'm curious where you where you got this mental model of the world um i mean have you seen anything like this elsewhere or were you influenced by anything when you were when you were thinking about concave versus convex i haven't seen anything quite that illustrates it in this way yeah i'm i'm not sure if like this exact presentation like existed in some literature before um like again the like concavity and convexity are definitely like things that you would understand in mathematics and like like concavity is definitely a thing in economics like for example and like i talk about taxes below and that's like one of those uh examples there um but like and i think it just like took years of brushing up against this kind of like a versus b logic and eventually just like figuring out like you know like yes this is where the divide is so what are the implications here does does this mean that um at some level that ethereans should try less hard to uh explain their positions to people who are very convex in thinking because there's just going to be a delta there that can't be passed uh and maybe we should focus more on finding the other concave people in the world is that one implication what are your thoughts on the implications here it could be like i think there's definitely yeah people um who i think are just attracted to the uh the convex perspectives in a way that would be very hard to kind of make uh get them to find the ethereum camp appealing and um you know maybe that's okay and uh again that's just like one property of like of uh opposition to uh you know like bitcoin maximalism that i guess there can be this uh multiple ecosystems and they can all kind of prosper within their communities um and and i think ultimately uh um you know for crypto to become mainstream like yes it does needs to just to kind of reach out to the wider world and explain its perspective to the wider world more i do think that we should continue kind of making the case for ethereum and um i think one of the ways in which uh i i think the philosophy here can help is that i think ethereum sometimes gets framed as not having values because it's not willing to just dogmatically take a direction and stick to it but i think like i don't think that like that's not necessarily true right because like i think if you're in past values it has things that it's that it's pushing toward but uh concavity is a good mental model to explore explain how like it's possible to believe in something but at the same time be moderate about it and at the end and it's possible to actually have this as a as something you believe and not just like something you are because you because you just don't know what you are so say for say we fast forward into 20 30 years into the future and ethereum is maximally successful to the degree that we all hope that one day it becomes do you attribute that success to a con a concave mindset on behalf of ethereum i definitely think the concave mindset is a very good one too for at least what ethereum's goals are which i think involve a kind of broad adoption and uh bringing uh decentralization and permissionlessness to like basically report large groups of regular people uh and like on the bitcoin side it's interesting right because i think bitcoin is kind of of two minds in terms of what its goal is like one of its minds is basically replacing gold and like becoming the new digital gold um whereas the other one is like let's be let's focus specifically on censorship resistance wealth transfer for people and like authoritarian regimes or uh in general people and every regime is authoritarian to some non-zero extent um so like people who brush up against that side of things and like having a convex approach like it can definitely buy you a kind of success in that second side of things because you know there really are people who just need fairly fairly extreme trade-offs though i mean at the same time i do think that ethereum is also fairly capable of satisfying those trade-offs except ethereum's approach is different and it relies more i think on just creating this uh uh thing that provides broad value for and of much larger groups of people even if like in some cases the average value per person could um it could end up being a bit lower than you know literally saving your life uh rescuing your life savings and like ethereum can still literally rescue your life savings in some context but like the median use cases are i guess a little bit more closer to it to average people's experiences you know there's an element too i i wonder i must in the bitcoin culture community if um that second pool that you mentioned that that convex pool who has formerly been uh ardent supporters of um you know censorship resistance if if that's not being being driven out a little bit too because it just seems like this narrative and this this need for like price go up um yeah has has driven out a lot of the original values and maybe i'm being a little harsh on bitcoin or culture but it just seems this embrace of kind of crypto banks if you will and um like custody and institute like that wasn't part of the the original convex plan for for bitcoiner so it there's almost this hollowing out effect where you get this convex um culture around things like 21 million right and number go up and when ate everything else when our friend nick nick carter talked uh on bloomberg about the happening being priced in and he was absolutely crucified because apparently that's not canon with you know some convex members of the bitcoiner community um like it's those types of things that have become more important than elements of censorship resistance so there's almost like this hollowing out type of effect of the values that at least i thought used to matter in in bitcoin or culture i don't know if you guys observed that but it's something that has been surprising to me these are not necessarily the extremists die for the cause martyrs that maybe they once were i'm not sure maybe that's harsh yeah no and i like the one of the kind of big fault lines i'm seeing is basically that so the store the the story that small blocker values were originally sold under right is that you don't need that much security on the base chain because the lightning network can basically make up for it right and they bring a lot of their kind of heart and soul into the lightning network but what's been happening over the last couple of years is that the lightning network has only received fairly limited adoption and instead we're seeing uh middle liquid start taking off and liquid is of course a permissioned consortium chain so basically the same sort of thing that they denounced as evil back in 2014 um people are just like they're cheering on um you know etfs and like being the same kind of institutional adopt like adoption that doesn't actually translate to any kind of decentralization and like some of those things like some level of those things is definitely a kind of natural and good and uh like good for adoption but it does seem like the problem for me is when it gets to the point where it's so extreme that like these people are literally like start excusing the like the the growing lack of accessibility of fully self-sovereign options right like basically like when they start saying oh it's totally fine if like centralized intermediaries become used for most things that's when it really starts kind of turning me off so it feels like it's kind of just letting the like it feels like it's the letting the winds of uh kind of technical uh kind of historical defaults push it in a direction and then retroactively kind of retconning the narrative to say that it always was that direction all along right um and like there's definitely a big part of that that's kind of difficult for me to relate to like you know if they had like i think someone who is honest about maximizing censorship resistance would realize that intermediary minimization is a pragmatic and needed part of censorship resistance and if you want to minimize intermediaries you need to have the base chain be able to provide more things potentially even add some level of risk to that making of that making the base chain a bit heavier um but like if you're just care if you just care about permissionlessness of the base chain but you know you care as much about the ability to do trustless and permissionless things on top that definitely
