[Music] all right bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation episode david what are we talking about today what's the theme we are modeling out ultra sound money we put out the episode with justin drake uh a while ago and so now we are getting justin drake back onto the show to get into the granular details of what makes ultrasound money ultrasound money there are numbers to discuss and so we are going to discuss all of them there are numbers to discuss there are models to discuss there are four different pieces to this david you tweeted this out pre-episode uh and we're gonna get into all of them 25 staking annualized ap terms each supply maybe it peaks at 121 million and never gets higher than 121 than 120 million kissing kisses 120 million and comes back down long-term eat supply target possibly 100 million so that's the coming down part and the potential for cell pressure to be reduced by 90 justin drake has brought the models behind some of those astounding facts that i think very few people have actually looked into i mean the first exposure to uh eip 1559 and uh to the merge the staking merge in a comprehensive way i feel like was was almost the podcast that we did with justin ultrasound money now that was very metaphor driven that was very high level to help people understand the narrative now this is the supporting data this is the supporting numbers the supporting um financial projections behind all of this so i'm super excited to dig into this and david all-time high eth coincidence i don't know i think not sir i think i knew it this episode was coming i i choose to believe that as well all right david uh what's new in the community before we get to justin gotta talk about badges if you are a bankless premium member pick up your badge we've been saying it for two weeks definitely do it pick up your badge this is the week we're doing more raffles this week so check your email for that email from lucas banklesshq.com if you have issues with that email support banklesshq.com also david we've got a killer episode coming up on monday um you want to just give a taste of what we're going to cover in that episode yeah this this episode makes some very very bold claims we like to make bold claims on the bankless podcast but this one uh is br brand new uh josh rosenthal uh who is probably a name that most people don't aren't familiar with but he is a historian of europe european art money wealth history and we make the claim that we are on the cusp of a digital renaissance that is equal to or larger than what the renaissance that came in the 1400s uh and the connections here are in the 1400s we invented uh the uh gutenberg uh pres the the the wedding address pretty impressed thank you uh and also double entry bookkeeping and in the modern day the printing press is now the modern day internet and the modern day double entry bookkeeping is blockchain uh and that actually is unlocking a brand new renaissance a crypto renaissance and uh he did a fantastic job just going through the history and drawing the parallels we talked about renaissance meme culture meme culture actually started perhaps in the 1400s we talked about the parallels between martin luther and satoshi and we talked about what so cool so cool and so there's a lot of awesome through lines here and it's actually one of already been one of my favorite episodes come out of the baby when we were recording that david i just like goosebumps almost almost the entire time when josh was speaking just talking about these these various parallels between the kind of the old renaissance in this renaissance so be sure to check that out bankless nation as well david uh dharma is still cooking some things up they wanted us to let you know that they have now rolled the dharma app out they have a direct connection to your bank account in all 50 states in the us and david when people ask like me about defy especially my friends who don't know much about them i'm increasingly pointing them to start with the dharma app because that is a great onboarding experience direct from their bank account to defy in one tap super cool anything else you want to say about dharma yeah we know retail season is coming and dharma is probably the best place to send retail who are still looking for like that kind of tradfy experience of like you know just good ux but it's defy in the back right and so one tap one tap separates you between your dollars and your bank account and ultrasound money on ethereum dharma.io guys check that out download the app all right david i'm gonna ask you the question i ask at the beginning of every state of the nation what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation it was going to be bullish ryan but i was like we've been but we've used that before and i was chatting with justin uh before the show and he asked him for inspiration or ideas about what the state of the nation is and he said ultra bullish and so the state of the nation today is ultra bullish as you can see if you go and look at the eth price chart and as well what will be an ultra bullish episode coming to your ears in just a moment it was crazy dude i have two emails waiting for me one is a 80 page report on a why why ether is sound money and the other is an institutional report these just came out today an institutional report i should say around ether as an asset um ultra bullish that the narrative is spreading both in the institutional side and the story of of ether the asset is is spreading among analysts too so i've got tons of reading to do but like it's all ultra bullish news and it all feeds back to what justin presented uh to us the first time around with ultrasound money right so much of those reports tie into the ultrasound money thesis and so you know tip of the hat to justin for really pioneering this message and i'm absolutely stoked to bring him onto the podcast in here in a second this is what bankless is doing helping to develop the narrative layer the meme layer also helping to spread the education of what these bankless systems are doing in the real world we're going to get to justin in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible vinclas is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission has become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange bankless nation welcome back we have justin drake back on the podcast again this is the third podcast video show recording that we are doing with justin he of course is an ethereum researcher he uh was on two podcasts with us previously one is on ultrasound money the other was on cryptography both incredibly important episodes for you to listen to and understand part of the bankless canon now justin how are you doing today i'm doing great we are excited about this episode and we're going to be sharing um some models that you put together in a few minutes around some of the concepts that we really dove into uh quite deeply in the ultrasound money podcast we're gonna put some like numbers behind some of the concepts we were talking about but before we do i feel like we need to uh maybe ground the audience again in understanding ether as an asset and of course we talked about the properties that are coming online for ether soon in particular eip 1559 which adds a fee burn component uh and also the advent of of full proof of stake in the shutting off of proof of work we're calling that the merge those are all important concepts in the the case for ultrasound money but there's also another analogy that i think bankless listeners are are familiar with that we want to want to get into here and that is the analogy of eth as a triple point asset that david and i have used so often before and the concept of eth as a as a triple point asset is similar to sort of the the states of matter that people might have learned about in you know in science i don't know uh seventh grade science eighth grade science where wherever you learned about that perhaps lower as well so and the concept is that matter can be one of three states it can be a solid it can be a liquid and it can be a gas and ether as an asset can also be one of three states it can be a solid so it can be staked as a capital asset um it can also be liquid so it can be used as a money and uh it can also be used as a gas so it can be used as a combustible uh consumption good to purchase uh ether block space so that is the the triple point asset thesis and the the triple point asset model for money which which we have used and it's kind of cool because it maps very directly to the asset super classes like an asset can either be a capital asset or a money or a commodity and ether can be all three of those you have now extended that metaphor a little bit with a new analogy adding sort of this this temperature dimension to ether as a triple point asset can we start there can we dig into that so tell us about the temperature analogy you want wanted to share with the bankless community yeah so i think the the temperature metaphor is as you said a generalization of the triple point asset so not only can we look at the the individual state of let's say water that will represent uh money ether but we can look at more fine-grained temperatures so you know for example money you could have money as a long-term investment which is kept cold in the fridge so that's kind of cold money or you could have hot money which is for example if you're a day trader or if you're in exchange processing lots of withdrawals and deposits in a hot wallet um and i think the the the the reason why this this temperature of money uh metaphor is useful in the context of ultrasound money is that really there's there's three big consequences of eip1559 and the merge and they each affect a different state of water so there's one key innovation that improves the kind of liquid money as it were there's one which improves the characteristics of the solid money and one that improves the characteristics of of gas money and one of the interesting things i guess is that as you say ethereum is this this unique asset it's a triple point asset in the sense that in addition to being this this this uh money in this narrow band you know between zero degrees celsius and 100 degrees celsius it's capable of breaking boundaries which were not previously broken so it can break down the the zero degree and kind of freeze itself but it can also break down the 100 degree kind of threshold and and vaporize so that you know that's the analogy of of um having gas and literally vaporizing it just like you would vaporize gasoline when you consume it it leaves the system uh into the ether um so yeah um looking forward to kind of explain what are these these three key changes to the to the cash flows right so in the previous episode we had the energy metaphor right we had energy in the form of electric energy um going through the various components and the reason why i chose the electricity metaphor is because i wanted to focus on the components right there was these three components there was the battery that was the engine and there was a solar panel but here i really want to focus on on the asset and on the cash flows and as you said i think this this episode is all about um modeling the cash flows and understanding how big they are and and how they circulate and what are the consequences maybe for total supply what are the consequences in terms of cell pressure et cetera et cetera so justin let's hash out this uh this temperature metaphor just a little bit more so we have um ether as a capital asset we have ether as a store of value and we have ether as a transformable consumable asset what how do these map on to the three phases of uh matter right so the maybe the easiest one to understand is the the solid state right so when you have ether and you you lock it you're essentially freezing it because you're really reducing the the velocity of money you're putting it in in deep freeze and one one great example of this is staking in the context of the beacon chain right it um when you want to on stake there's a defrosting period if you will a following period right a foreign period exactly thank you um and you know we're also seeing this in the context of defy where right with where you have the notion of total value locked like the locked at the l kind of suggests that there's some some freezing going on you know it it's it's a spectrum like different um d5 applications might have different temperatures so for example um you know uni swap might be you know somewhere maybe close to the freezing point or you know just past the freezing point in the sense that the efer in in uni swap technically can be removed with a single transaction and actually if you want to sell erc20 for if you you can do that immediately but what we've what we've observed kind of on a on a holistic standpoint is that um the the collateral is is sticky right so we did have things like the vampire attack uh with with sushi swap where liquidity would go from one place to another but it still stayed within the realm of dexes or the realm of defy if you look at you know total value locked on on d5 polls it just goes up up only um and we also talk about the metaphor of maker dow right so like ether is collateral inside of maker dao and in theory you know ether and maker dao is also just one transaction away from becoming liquid on the secondary markets but as a when we look at a systems level perspective maker dao has three over three billion dollars worth of dye preventing that ether from becoming thought right so that ether and maker dao is stuck behind a three billion dollar die supply that is keeping that ether being used as a cold store of value it's frozen in its place right and so in the ether in maker doubt we would be frozen ether very cold ether right not liquid not available to the secondary market and definitely not being burned because it's not being used as transaction money it's just cold ether frozen right yeah that's exactly right i mean if you place your e4s collateral and you take a die loan for example to buy a car or to buy a house right your income is going to allow you to gradually repay that loan but you know it might take a decade for you to repay your your make a loan um so if we're painting the holistic picture here right so we're almost looking at this whole spectrum of like temperature mapping to ether the asset and on the far left side of the spectrum what we're talking about is um ether for if we're thinking of ether as like say water it's below zero degrees celsius so it is frozen but there are degrees of how frozen it can be and i'm guessing that you might say uh justin that like that the far side the coldest ether can actually get is when it's staked right that is like sort of it's not it's it's not slushy it's not in this in between area it's like deep freeze very cold locked inside of the staking contract and maybe um ether locked in d5 might be a little right to that so it might be like yeah negative 10 degrees celsius or so and getting close to the to the to the to the thawing point something like that so actually you can go even more extreme than than staking so you could for example artificially put some sort of of time lock on your if you could say i'm i'm going to lock my e for 10 years i'm going to create a smart contract that does that they're kind of artificial and no one really does it but inferior you could do it but there's something that does happen naturally and that's the process of losing coins or accidentally sending them um you know to the zero address so that's kind of zero degrees kelvin you know you it's like maximum um you know um negative temperature and um it's it's interesting because it's you you've taken money and you've made it so cold that you've denatured money it's no longer money right it's technically it's a balance somewhere but it's no longer money it's denatured because it you can't move it anymore it's frozen um forever and you could say the same thing for example for the the parity um multisig wallet so there's this very famous bug where there's basically over half a million if which is provably at zero degrees kelvin and yeah it's it's basically no longer money and the interesting thing is that when you go at the opposite end of the spectrum you have a very very similar behavior because on the on the hot side of things on the boiling temperatures you're basically destroying if you're vaporizing it um and removing it from the supply so you kind of have this the spectrum and it turns out that on on each extremes you have very similar behaviors you're basically improving the monetary qualities of ether right because on the on the cold side of things you're kind of taking liquidity like literally liquid liquidity and you're you're kind of freezing it and slowing it down and on the other hand you're kind of vaporizing it and and having it leave the the supply and this is kind of a geeky kind of math analogy but you know i study mathematics so i'll share it so when you do projective geometry you know you have you have a line that goes negative infinity you know all the way to on on that side and that side and you introduce this to one point called the point at infinity where basically these two lines meet at the point of infinity so you can kind of make think of it as a circle and kind of the from a monetary um standpoint the the two extremes are are really um the same place and the interesting thing about um ethereum is that you can think of it as a machine to take this liquid money and push it to the extremes on the one hand you're incentivizing this liquid money to become frozen and on the other hand you have this other mechanism where you're incentivizing this liquid money to vaporize and so these are two very strong kind of scarcity engines that will suck out all the liquidity uh in its liquid state and um and by vaporize uh what you're talking about is essentially literally being burnt through eip-1559 that's that's it becoming vaporized right yeah so this is what i mean by vaporized [Laughter] brought his own sound effects that was the sound of ether being vaporized in eip1559 okay so go ahead justin yeah post eip1559 every time you make a transaction you should imagine this sound uh in your head and that's one of three sound effects that we have on on standby and i want to make sure the listeners are are up to speed with why we're talking about this temperature metaphor because we're about to go into excel sheets and and perhaps talk less about metaphors and talk more about numbers but the metaphor is really really useful in to hold in our brains as we model this thing out both as a model with numbers but also a model for understanding these these things and i think what we just finished on right there is a fantastic through line we have me i'm picturing like a a cylinder like a test tube cylinder and we have the hot water at the top and we have the frozen water at the bottom and then the liquid water in the middle right and that composes like the ethereum system as a whole right boiling water up up at the top which is the ether being used as transaction fees uh and then some of that being vaporized and leaving the system and then also we have ether being deep in deep uh deep freeze state you know in cryo at the very very bottom which is east lost and defy and eats being staked and the met of the the through line here is that currently in ethereum we have a very very liquid center and it and there's not that much boiling off the top and there's not that much frozen at the bottom but that's what is all about to change when we introduce eip1559 which really starts to turn on the boiler at the top and a lot of ethers being vaporized up at the top and we are also introducing staking which is freezing a lot of ether at the bottom of the cylinder by incentivizing ether to be locked locked in the staking contract and then there's also something to talk about with being locked in defy that's like the slushy ether the half half melted half knot but what's really changing is that this liquid center where there is a what uh justin you've called a fire hose of water being being added into the system which is ether issuance from proof of work is actually going to be constricted into perhaps just a much more modest garden hose and that liquid center is actually going to become much smaller in relationship to what is being boiled off the top and what is being frozen down at the bottom and so this temperature frame of reference is we're going to come back to this throughout the rest of this episode as we talk about some of these numbers more explicit numbers as we model out ultrasound money um justin you want to add anything to that yeah so i kind of want to highlight the three cash flows that are i think important for this this discussion the first cash flow you mentioned it is issuance so issuance is you have just new liquidity that comes out of the sky and right now it's a huge amount of issuance it's like as you said it's this fire hose of of liquidity and you know the market has to bear with it is like this huge amount of cell pressure it's costly to run proof of work you know one of the big innovations of proof of stake is what i called economic efficiency in the in the previous protocol where we're reducing by let's say 10x the cost of of consensus so that's cash flow number one issuance cash flow number two is related to this this warm side this hot side of the spectrum the burning it's its supply right so we have a new mechanism to reduce supply and this is kind of where you know ultrasound money meme came from right because we have deflation um [Music] but you know really the the ultrasound money is a very holistic meme you know with strong fundamentals with many pillars you know this deflation aspect is you know just one of them uh one which is easy to communicate in this kind of catchphrase you know if if bitcoin sound money then if is ultrasound money um so that's cash flow number two supply cash flow number one was issuance now um cash flow number three is basically the if as collateral and like how much if will be drawn out from this liquid center and kind of frozen and basically what we have here is um when when we have the merge the the transaction fees will be in two parts one of it one part will be burnt we've already talked about this but another part which is the tip is not burnt and that goes directly to the validators and so that will go that will increase the the staking apr and and that's basically going to increase the power of the freezer right we're gonna go from minus five degrees to minus ten degrees or i guess you know the the apr could be like the the the degrees that you're targeting so we're gonna set it let's say at minus 25 degrees right so that's a 25 apr and it's gonna be so cold that is going to like freeze like a lot of the neighboring uh liquidity um so yeah these are the the three cash flows that we could highlight one by one before we get uh to all of that so can we talk about the the part that we haven't talked about in depth uh very much which is sort of the this liquid piece right in the middle so we talked about the free side that is steak teeth frozen eath ethan collateral we talked about the burn side that is it being vaporized by eip 1559 and of course uh we use that analogy of new liquidity is coming into the system via issuance right now and right now there's a lot of issuance like 4.2 percent or something issuance annualized per year is coming into this this squishy middle part there's not a lot staked and there's nothing being burnt so we don't have the engine and we don't have the the deep freezer let's talk about this this middle portion because um that's mostly what we mean when when uh we talk about money right it's it's kind of liquid it can be used as a store of value it could be used as a medium of exchange it can be used as a unit of account it can actually be spent is there anything more we need to talk about in this in this liquid phase or do we just need to hear the sound effect justin you tell us yeah i think the sound effect is very important so let's go ahead this is the phase yes so we have a hundred million each roughly which is in this liquid phase um you know if we remove the the three million so four million now in in the deposit contract and and uh the ether locked in in indeed five so we have this 100 million pool which is which is slashing and as you said you know ether is used as as money is used as money in the context of nfts is used as money in the context of of trading it's a unit of liquidity right on uni swap like 95 percent of the of the volume is this is is eve pairs um it's you know and one of the interesting things is that um [Music] you know the this this traditional um power of being money is what bitcoin has explored right so you can think of of bitcoin as exploring this this range from from 0 to 100 and with ethereum we can really you know push the limits uh um as i mentioned but um yeah the within this this this liquid phase you know we have all all the various use cases for ethereum but we have this this kind of uh ex internality this this this externality i guess which is that that the issuance is this this this necessary evil that we have to deal with and it's flooding us and we're drowning in liquidity at the moment and this this issuance is is representing a huge amount of cell pressure you know we're talking tens of millions of dollars every day and so one of the things that uh one of one of the things for which we have a spreadsheet is is looking at the cell pressure and and how much it will be reduced and we're talking billions of dollars of relief from this the cell pressure okay guys so that's the metaphor going into the models and just quick recap and we'll do it with sounds so right now justin you said there's about a hundred million or so of the total supply of eth and i don't know the total supply of top of my head 115 million 150 yes okay let's say 115 million total supply of eth right now 100 million is liquid what does that sound like our 100 million each liquid the vast majority of it the bulk now we're starting to get some eath that's frozen it's frozen in the staking contract i'm going to say 6 million or so frozen in the staking contract we also have some eth frozen in d5 4 million uh frozen in the eat staking contract justin's correcting me we have some eth and defy as well what does that sound like [Applause] so you still imagine like the the water becoming ice and i'm not imagining that i'm also imagining my childhood in the uh in in the cold winters of canada just when i hear that all right so and and we have not yet fired up the furnaces we have not yet started to burn eath but remind us again what's that going to sound like when we start burning sizzle sizzling 15 vip 1559. okay all right so that is the setup guys um let's dive into the numbers and there are four models that you've put out recently and i think maybe justin you could give us some context on why you created these these models and and how you came up with them but uh for for those that are that are watching and listening to this i'm going to quick quickly go over them at a high level um one we're going to look at the eth peak supply model and you're claiming that eath peak supply could be 120 million no more than 121 million each ever created where 120 million 120 million yes i keep saying it's the bitcoiner in me justin 120 million it could be peak supply right now at 115 so we're gonna get into that model that's model one model two is the road actually going backward in time going back in terms of supply the road back to 100 million because again we're going to start we're going to start burning eth and we might be able to reduce over the next decade 20 percent of the total supply of eth what's that burning sound again justin gotta hear it gotta hear that burn nice going from vaporizing from 120 million uh to 100 million that's model two we'll get into model three is we'll get into the net buy pressure so david was talking about we have issuance of about 4.2 percent that is feeding this this fat middle there's a hundred million supply eth with four percent issuance or so per year that is getting great greatly restricted so we're going to talk about the implications of uh cell pressure reduced in ether on ethereum by as much as 90 that's model three and the last model we're going to talk about is the incentive to for individuals and for people who own eth to freeze their eat and that is a staking apy that is getting massively increased to possibly 25 we'll talk about how that's even possible because it's not coming from issuance it's coming from transaction fees and this is the first time i've actually seen transaction fees added to the revenue cash flows that stakers receive so we're going to go through those four models before we do justin is there anything else like why did you come up with these these models in the first place these up for us right um i mean we we've had you know these these big structural changes with eip1559 coming and the merge coming but i wanted to to to quantify things and i think the the big story really of of the the last few months is that we have one kind of mega cash flow which is the transaction fees and that's the the root of of everything really um because it unlocks you know the high apr when you're staking it unlocks the the the burn um and you know i i i just wanted to to see okay what what what were the numbers because no one was talking about it so you know one one number that i was i was personally very surprised by was the 25 staking apr and you know we can talk about the consequences um there i guess um you know in terms of the of the supply i um you know in my original um like little graphic for which introduced ultrasound money um i had this this projected kind of cap very conservative cap at 2 to the 27 and you know i just like powers of two because you don't have to bike shed too much you know like 2 to 28 was clearly too high 2 to 26 was clearly too low like 2 to 2 to 27 it was the right kind of binary order of magnitude but people were kind of confused like why did he choose to do 27 it's not a good meme number it's a bit too geeky so it's like okay let's try and refine this you know to the closest million and it turns out we can we can refine it to the closest 10 million um and you know um like the spreadsheet kind of suggests that we will we will never hit 120 million um we'll be able to peak under it um and then basically once we have the merge the the total supply can can go down um and then like the reason why i created this this other spreadsheet like the road back down to 100 million eve is is because 100 million is a kind of a nice meme number um and i was wondering okay is it is it actually feasible for us to start at 120 and then go back down to 100 million and the answer is yes you know it might take a decade it might take two decades but it is definitely possible to have the total supply go back down to 100 and 100 million kind of has a bit of historical significance because uh vitalik at some point you know had this this reddit post where you know he was making projections around the difficulty bombing he said you know it's possible we'll we'll never hit a hundred million and then you know we crossed a hundred million and then all the all the bitcoin maxies were like haha you know you have no supply cap infinite supply blah blah well it's possible this kind of like the revenge of the 100 million where we're going back to 100 million and then the other thing that i actually there was a very the very first spreadsheet that i created was around the the it was actually in preparation for our previous podcast um so the the cell pressure right in the previous podcast i said that eip1559 and the merge combined is is going to be the equivalent in terms of reducing cell pressure of both the deposit contract and grayscale combined so 7.2 million if annually right so it's uh it's it's like a huge amount of of relief in terms of cell pressure that we're going to have from these two kind of economic innovations sci-fi economics the the eip1559 and the merge okay let's let's dive into it now then justin um this of course is the meme brought to life with with numbers with an actual model a projection of supply and the economic implications what would happen let's go to the first model which is a spreadsheet that people will find in the show notes of course if you're watching on youtube you'll find this in the show notes on youtube this is a spreadsheet you put together for a model of ethpeak supply and the claim in this spreadsheet is pretty simple there may be never there may never be more than 120 million eth in existence ever again it's back to this diagram we might hit a point where we go ultrasound uh we grow each supply and then it might bend back downward and that point might be 120 million can you explain some of the variables behind this scenario and why 120 million is is kind of it's an estimate of course but it's almost a conservative estimate as well get into this for us absolutely so you know the the way that you predict supply is is quite easy like you you look at the supply today and then you um you basically add the daily supply and there's there's various things that will influence the the sorry the daily issuance i mean that will influence the daily issue and so right now the daily issuance is is composed of of two two things number one is the proof of work issuance which is about thirteen thousand six hundred it's actually a little bit below that so i've put thirteen thousand five hundred and fifty and then we have the the daily proof of stake issuance which is i think around eight hundred eve per day but um i put a thousand if there in the in the best guess because that's going to be the the average between now and and emerge and then there's um there's these key key dates that are um right so the key key date number one is when will eip1559 be activated because from that point onwards um there's going to be a huge relief in cell pressure because um part of the of the fees which would normally go to the miners and be converted into electricity and electricity bills and sold you know it's like a forcing forcefully sold economically is forcefully sold will now instead be burnt and and not sold um so right now the current plan um that was announced a few days ago by by tim and and and and and the whole crew is um 14th of july 2021 um but of course you know we could slip you know we've slept many times and so you know the my conservat like my conservative um you know date for eip1559 is is the 14th of august 2021 and the reason why i've put it there is because we actually have to hard fork and the reason we have to hard fork is because there's this difficulty bomb which will stretch the the block times and so it's a necessity and you know um at this point in time the devs have extremely high confidence that you know eip159 will go in this in this four coming up in in london so just in the variables that really drive the difference between what you're calling the best guess the more leaning conservative guests and the conservative guests are the activation date for eip 1559 which is targeted for july but could stretch into august possibly maybe likely not later um also the merge date so that's the date at which proof of work goes away and proof of stake becomes the consensus engine for the entirety of ethereum the proof of work issuance um that's going to not really an assumption that's pretty like static that's you know definitely baked in daily average pos proof of stake issuance that could vary some but that feels pretty pretty secure as an assumption as well um this other one average daily fee burns so um there there's kind of a range on that on the conservative side looks like there's an average fee burn of about 3 000 per day eat per day and on the best guest side it's about 6 000. what are we burning per day right now is it closer to 6 000 well right now without burning excuse me not burning theory right i met in transaction fees yes right so the the 100 day and 30 day and even seven day moving average are 12 000 if per day okay and then the 365 day moving average which is like the really conservative one which spans a very long stretch of time is at uh 7.5 uh thousand eve per day but you know as i as i see it you know the the total amount of transaction fees per day is one of these metrics which is quite volatile but directionally it's it's up only um so um you know let's say ten thousand each per day with over seventy percent or let's say sixty percent um fee burn then that that that's how you would arrive at this at the six um six thousand each per day like the conservative one three thousand each per day i i just don't see how it could go below three thousand per day given that we have you know ten thousand each per day in transaction fees and there's no way you know the the the feedback will be thirty percent and then so justin based on these assumptions we get a best guess case where we have about 118 call it million eth in total supply uh max total supply right because at at this point in time it's going to start bending down and we're going to start burning more than we're issuing right that's the best guess side of things if you were a bit more conservative we get to a number that's closer to 120 million eath as the max supply absolutely yeah and the lean conservative is 119 million so yeah i'm expecting we'll peak between 118 million and 120 million and as you said from the point of the merge until kind of the foreseeable future we will deflate very likely every single day the issuance this sorry the supply will go down and down and down and the reason is that proof of stake is so damn efficient right like you need very very little issuance to to run the the proof of stake and so like even a moderate amount of transaction fees will will more than compensate for for the insurance justice it's your belief that after eip1559 and the merge that there's no way that we are not burning more ether than we are issuing you have you seem like you have complete confidence in that yeah i'm going to say 99 confidence that at the point of the merge we're going down and i have high confidence let's say 95 confidence that for the years to come you know let's say 10 years we're going to be going down pretty much every single day and this is a massive um narrative buster because i think a lot of people have heard the narrative that eats supply is infinite right that um it has no cap right what's the difference between those narratives and what you're what you're showing in the model because i think people even hearing this are so used to hearing the narrative being told that like eth is supply is infinite eth has no no no cap whatsoever uh eth will continue to issue more and more into the future what's the difference between those narratives and what and and the model here because i think people are still who are hearing this might still have a hard time um i guess rationalizing the the difference here because this is not the narrative that is in mainstream like few know about this i like i'm not sure how many people have actually worked through the numbers and and and um have a model like this in their mind but not it has to be not very many so can you talk about that right um so right at any given point in time the eave supply is finite and there's always been a constraint on issuance right at genesis it started at five e per block and we've gotten nothing you know we've always respected that that constraint you know we've we've gone down you know to three ether block and two e for block but you know we've always been constrained from day one now um the the claim that if has no cap is actually technically correct and the reason is that in theory if there was no fee burn and purely just issuance from proof of stake we would just grow every single year now it turns out that um with proof of stake you can cap you can you can you can have a approvable cap which which is um under a million if you know we the the plan right now is to basically um cap the rewards beyond um two you know 33 and a half million if so beyond that point there won't be any more supply and that represents roughly a one million if issuance maximum per year but in practice what's likely going to happen is that we're going to be burning significantly more than 1 million if per year at least for the foreseeable future and so in practice not only are we going to have a finite supply which is a de facto capped it's not in it's not in theory capital it's de facto capped but it's it's even better than a supply cap it's a decreasing cap and this is where the the ultrasound the ultra comes in i think we get to what we get to do with this narrative where you know many bitcoin maxies will come and say that ether has no supply cap but now with proof of stake and eip1559 we get to say well there's no supply floor like it could just keep on going down like it could go in the opposite direction and there's nothing to stop it from going it's equally true isn't it yeah there's no supply flow fantastic yes all right well let's go let's go to the second model here so the first claim was there may never be more than a hundred and twenty one hundred and twenty million right 120 million each and this is the model that kind of shows it um the second claim is i think equally interesting but is is also part of the first claim in that the supply might be going down and it might go down as low as 100 million in a relatively short period of time so walk us through the model where we get to 100 million each supply a decrease of like you know uh 20 million from 120 million in 12 years time right so i was asking myself can we reach this mean number of a hundred million if in supply and basically there's three key you know parameters or assumptions that you need to set the first one is how much if is being staked and here you can take kind of the the maximally conservative um approach which is to say we're going to have the 33.5 million eve which is the maximum amount of eve um of in terms of of issuing rewards the second assumption is the the daily uh evm fees and in the long term right so right now we're roughly order of magnitude with 10 000 if per day in transaction fees now i mentioned you know there's good reasons to believe that um the fees total fees is up only by the way when i say total fees i don't mean the gas price right i mean the gas price multiplied by the number of transactions so you know we can have our cake and eat it too because we can have low gas price and lots of transactions with scalability and have this this high daily evm fees and then there's this third parameter which um assumption which will be removed once we have eip1559 which is what is the fee burn percentage right we're doing 10 thousand eve per day roughly how much of that is burnt is it seventy percent seven thousand each per day is it more is it less um and it turns out that it it doesn't really matter too much the ballpark is is correct if it's if it's slightly more it's it's good because we're we're deflating faster we're reducing supply um if it's slightly less then that's also good because it means a higher staking apr um for for the for the validators uh which you know means more um more if that gets frozen so either way we win um kind of the the the really important number i guess is this the the daily evm fees long term and so like if we plug in the numbers you know you're welcome to plug in your own numbers but my best guess was we're going to have 30 million eve state long term we're going to have at least 10 000 eve per day and we're going to have a feedback percentage of roughly 70 and that gives us about 12 12 years to kind of go down from 120 million if down back down to 100 million so basically to vaporize 20 million each if it will take 12 years this this best guess of 10 000 east being burned per day that's actually where we currently are in in right now in evm fees and so not only is that what you're saying your best guess is but like we've actually already checked that box in theory according to current ethereum gas demand is that right that is correct um i mean the the gas market as i said can be quite volatile you know it depends on on things like um you know what is the activity happening on ethereum it depends on what the volatility is of the market it also depends on on competitors you know maybe some new blockchain project comes out out there which is so much better than ethereum and all your users migrate away there's many different factors that will influence the gas market do you know what i find funny is even the critics of ethereum at this point a point of critique is never that um eth block space demand will go down that's never a point of criticism at this point in ethereum's life cycle it was maybe 2016 2017 no one will use d5 no one will use smart contracts ethereum is a solution in search of a problem it's not anymore in fact their criticisms are the the opposite gas fees are too high and that's why uh ethereum will will lose in the long run is is kind of a narrative playing out so even the critics you know don't don't claim that uh block block space demand is going down even even they think uh eath gas demand is go is going up but what what this would mean in your best guess case where we are reducing total supply by 20 million over 12 years that's an annual supply rate decrease of negative 1.4 percent right so right now we're issuing 4.2 percent uh if this best guess turns out to be true what you're saying just is we'd have an annualized decrease of 1.4 in supply am i reading that correctly yeah that's about right so every year the supply would decrease by 1.4 percent roughly even the most conservative can we just maybe walk through through that even the most conservative side of things where fee perce fee burn percentage is is lower daily evm fees are about half of what we're doing right now and there's a lot of heath staked and locked up even that we're still burning eth absolutely we're still deflationary even in like this super conservative scenario we're still burning um exactly right that's crazy okay all right so that's the the second model is the road to 100 million each supply and you can see how that works out fork these put your own variables in put your own estimates in these are all available in the show notes if you'd like to view them and fork them and play with them this next model i think is really interesting you said you prepared this model um you know after you were thinking through the ultrasound money podcast this is a model called net cell pressure reduction and the way i think about this model is right now we've got cell pressure coming from issuance and coming from transaction fees of about 8.1 million each per year and what you're saying is that that pipe is going to be reduced by a lot it's going to be reduced post eip 1559 post merge to about 950 k per year each per year i think that's if you take the daily and you sort of annualize that so that's like an 88 reduction so another way to say this is i think this model is claiming that there's about to be a cell pressure reduction of about 88 can you talk through this model with us right so this goes back to you know proof of work being extremely inefficient economically um and so here um we we need to look at at several things number one we need to look at what is the issuance of proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake and um you know proof-of-work is fairly stable it's 13.6 000 um or 13.5 um a thousand eve per day and then for the proof of stake issuance i'm i'm assuring let's say um so this by the way this this was um at merge right um right now we have about 4 million eve staked and i'm kind of assuming let's say 20 million eaves steak which is very conservative like there's no way i don't think we'll be at 20 million eve at the point of the match but let's assume conservatively that we're at 20 million eavesdate then the daily proof of stake issuance will be 2.1 000 eve now one of the interesting one of the things you need to look at is the profit margin of proof of work and proof of stake for proof of work you have a very small profit margin because almost all the eve you have to you're forced to sell economically to buy the hardware to buy the electricity so let's say that you have a a 10 um profit margin but actually after tax right you have this this income tax after which is about fifty percent the ten percent becomes five percent so basically ninety five percent of the eve that you receive you're forced to sell now in proof of stake you have a very different scenario where you don't have the electricity cost you don't have the hardware cost you only have the taxes so your profit margin is 50 and you're only forced to sell the other 50 and actually on this point i kind of want to correct one of the things that i said in my previous podcast i said in my previous in the previous episode that proof of stake is not distributive right i was we were basically claiming that if all the rewards are crew to this to the validators to the stickers but that's actually not correct because roughly half of your if that you receive as a validator you're going to have to pay an income tax and most jurisdiction you know income tax is around 50 and so you have this this natural cell pressure um which is a a distribution mechanism um for for proof of stake anyway you plug in all the numbers inc and you also include um the the fee burn and you go from 22 a thousand if per day in cell pressure which is an insane amount of cell pressure we're talking um let's see um 2.5 k if that's you know that's about 50 million dollars per day which is insane of cell pressure and we're going to reduce that down by roughly 10x to 5 million each per day which is much more reasonable and so when you when you when you annualize this um it turns out that the the cell pressure uh reduction is the equivalent of the deposit contract which is around four million if and grayscale holding the 3.2 million if combined but that's not like a one-time reduction in cell pressure it's every single year we're gonna have you know the equivalent of 7.2 million if that is not sold on the market so you can if you want you can think of it as buy pressure 7.2 million eve per year of buy pressure is insanely cool and so just to reiterate like re removing cell pressure is the same thing and at the end result of things as adding in new buy pressure is basically two sides of the same coin and what justin drake is saying is that by removing the cell pressure of proof of work issuance and then also also removing the cell pressure of evm fees fees paid to the validator miners what we are able to get out of that is the equivalent of both grayscale and the deposit contract every single year and so this is a recyclable mechanism we get we get to generate an equivalent amount of buy pressure that grayscale puts in and also an equivalent amount of deposit demand that the beacon chain staking contract also puts in and we get to have this this year and next year and next year and next year and until until we until we perhaps even break through that 100 million like ether supply floor you know there's no floor for ether supply i guess uh going back to um the original analogy that that we were talking about uh david you you mentioned sort of this this fire hose right that is is feeding the center with the liquid portion of youth and it's just feeding it more and more eath every year about 8.1 million eath supply per year um and that's being reduced by a massive amount so that's being reduced to about 950k eth per year so there's just like a an 80 to 90 percent reduction we're moving from a fire hose as you said to a garden hose of liquidity that is that is filling that that center part in the states of matter that that liquid part of eth um and to to extrapolate on that as well right like not only do we go from just a fire hose of ether issuance flooding this like metaphor of this like cylinder of various temperature and where this middle part is just getting injected with just uh liquidity like ether selling pressure but on top of that we have the top part of this metaphorical cylinder which is now burning ether right it's vaporizing ether and so that with what is being liquid is being vaporized by eip1559 and we also have um and so and so the liquidity is being uh dried up that way and then also we have on the flip side of things we have this incentive to stake your ether and so while this middle this middle section of lukewarm ether it's very quickly getting vaporized or getting staked and while it's also not getting resupplied by a bunch of new proof of work issuance it's only getting resupplied by a very small trickle of proof of stake issuance and this reminds me this turns my my my brain to some sort of like kind of stock to flow analysis where uh the the center part is the new issuance and it's becoming very very low and a lot of that the total e supply is either getting burnt or staked right which is the stock and so there's very little ether supply that's that's accessible in liquid which is actually a security mechanism to ethereum because not having too much ether on the secondary markets is a way to protect ethereum from would-be attackers because there's not that much ether available to them to purchase on the secondary markets and attack um justin did i say anything that tripped you up or or did you like did you like that that was amazing that was that was fantastic and one thing i mentioned is that in the stock to flow flow becomes negative right because we have more and so that kind of something for the bitcoin is to wrap around uh in them in their current model right massive amount of net cell um pressure is uh reduced uh this is this is crazy so what are we talking about a factor of of 10 or so of efficiency that cell price reduction what's going to happen like when that happens when eip 1559 comes around when the merge happens all of this net cell pressure is produced by 80 90 percent like what happens i wonder what could happen i guess we'll find out justin we've got one last model to um to go through and then we're going to talk about a few other things but before we do bankless nation we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com gemini is the world's

just about to ask you how you get to a staking apr of 25 under your best guess scenario can you walk us through some of the variables here right so we have three key variables here variable number one is how much if will they be staked when we merge because this 25 percent is at the point of merge right it will be it will get armed away as more if comes in and stakes but what i'm expecting roughly six million if staked when we merge and the reason is because we're at four million right now coinbase is going to add another million and then you know we're gonna have maybe another million trickle through um and what what's happening is that right the the apy is is gradually reducing right so right now we're at roughly you know 7.8 percent um apr um but with six million if we're only at six point eight uh percent apr so the incentives are you know going down as more if stakes comes in okay second assumption is what are the daily evm fees at merge and i put 10k you know as i mentioned we're above 10k on the on the seven-day moving average on the 30-day moving average on the 100 day moving average we're roughly at you know 12 12 k so that that seems you know relatively uh safe but you know anything could could happen i guess and then there's the fee burn percentage which is one of the things i will be interesting to see when eip159 comes in uh in a couple in a few months but yeah i i put it at 70 um and you know i guess you know one way to to try and estimate it is to to look at uh the the the slow gas price right so the the the the base fee is meant to to represent kind of the sustained um demand for the basal level of demand yeah the basal level thank you and so you can use that and then you can just divide out um so yeah you can just put take that that gas price multiply it by 15 million gas which is the current gas limit and then the divided out by the the total if received in fees uh in in the blocks and that will there will be one way to to estimate a lower bound on on the feedback but of course it could be slightly greater than that because the the slow gas price might be too conservative and so when people were previously discussing like the yields from from staking they would they would really point out just issuance and they didn't really people forgot to include the tip and people forgot to include mev minor extract maximum extractable value right and so when people are seeing this 25 percent apy they're the and maybe they're getting like sticker shock almost of like how high like no one thought that staking rewards would be this high because everyone forgot to integrate really high gas fees and really high congestion right uh and so that that is it has been my takeaway is that like people not only did we not really understand the large implications of reducing issuance and burning fees but we also didn't understand the net effect of mev maximum extractable value rewards being paid to each stakers and eat stakers alone but this isn't this isn't mev is it david this is just fee it doesn't include mev so mev is a very broad term and it includes various things um one of the things that it includes is the what i call the native fee which is the the fee that's that's paid by specifying a gas price in the transaction but mev is broader in the sense that there's different ways that you can get paid for example flashbots what they have is a a bundle mechanism where it's basically a whether they have a smart con they provide a a gas price of of zero gray and instead you have a side channel payment and this side channel payment happens in the contract which pays the block proposer which right now is the miner so i guess what i'm saying is like i think um what you're saying david was is absolutely true but what i'm saying is i think justin's model only includes the protocol specific fee revenue as part of mev so if you wanted to include all mev it would be even more than this is that correct justin that is correct um but flashbots have this um dashboard which is currently in beta and i got the privilege to see it and from my understanding is that the the incremental mev which is paid in these bundles is only about five percent additional so it's right now at least it's relatively small but you know things could change and you know this this daily evm fees which is you know right now around 10k that could go down but you're right you need to take into account the possible increase in the the fees that are paid through flashbars because those will go directly this is pure tip um that goes directly to the validators there's no nothing is burnt really in the in the flashbots uh fees earlier in the episode justin you talked about how like the staking ether is so cold that it freezes the ether proximate to it and i think this is the time to revisit that metaphor can you can you walk us through that metaphor and how this has to do with his 25 apy right so 25 is clearly you know insane and crazy um and it's not going to last long it's going to be a a temporary thing and so what's going to happen is that more if is going to come in and and stake and so the question the very natural question you might ask is how much if is going to come in and stick and one weight and get frozen exactly and one way to uh to answer this is using a model and what you could include as a parameter in your model is what is the the fair cost of money of ife you know what is the opportunity cost of of staking ether and as opposed to doing something else with your your ether and then the other thing you need to um model is what is the the cost of staking other than the opportunity cost so there's various other costs so for example there's the the compute and bandwidth cost but there's also the risk that you might get slashed there's some sort of bug there's also the the risk that you go offline and you accumulate these these offline penalties my my personal estimate for for the the cost of of staking is roughly one percent okay um i might be overestimated i might be underestimated that's for you to put in whatever you think is appropriate and for the cost of money of the opportunity cost i would put it roughly at five percent so let's say a six percent you know fair um staking apr anything over six percent will get orb of the way now if you go back to the second spreadsheet the road to 100 million eve you'll see that even when you have 30 million eve staked in the in this best guess column number e the the staking apr is actually above six percent so if if i'm correct you know that that six percent is kind of the the fair apr that towards which uh the market will converge then where we're going to see tens of millions you know on the order of 30 million if staked so if this road 200 million comes true you know we're going to have roughly a hundred million eve 30 million of it is going to be in deep cryogenic cold storage we're going to have some amount locked in d5 i don't know like right now it's 11 million eve but you know that's been growing extremely fast maybe it could be 20 million 30 million 50 million we don't know um and then the rest which is going to be probably like a minority is going to be this liquid uh if which will be you know available to be sold on exchanges and used to fuel kind of the this high velocity uh ethereum economy so returning again to the uh this the cylinder of ether varying temperatures metaphor we have we have very little new ether being added the liquid new ether being added to the middle and where we've gone from where we are now with four million ether locked in the staking contract that staking that ether is so cold because it's receiving such a high apy from fees and and issuance that that 4 million ether is so cold that it's going to freeze perhaps up to 30 million more total total ether right and then we already have 11 million ether locks in d5 perhaps like that doubles over the next year to two to 20 million all of a sudden we have 50 million ether frozen right either in d5 or in the staking contract and that's all but half a decent not not half but um 40 of the total supply of ether is frozen right meanwhile we have on the flip side of things eip15555 not eip1559 burning off a lot of that excess vaporware of water vapor and then we have only a small modest garden hose of of liquidity being trickled in via new proof-of-stake issuance and so that that is the complete fina fina final like model of this like ether cylinder of varying temperatures that is exactly right so you've summarized it perfectly and that is how we model ladies and gentlemen ultra sound money wow wow guys all right so that's that's how you got to those numbers justin uh there may never be more than 120 million eth we might over the next 10 years decrease that to 100 million eth cell pressure is going to get massively reduced 80 to 90 percent with the efficiency of proof-of-stake and then staking apy at the start of the merge could be as high as 25 percent and then it will decrease from there as more ether is getting cryogenically frozen uh that's what these models are showing us justin let's maybe end with um this how soon could all of this happen i think crypto is the the crypto markets and just you know cryptic crypto natives in general are very used to living these like bull bust cycles and like these almost like these four year kind of repeating cycles and a lot of this maybe stems from bitcoin being a dominant the dominant asset and there is a uh happening every four years where bitcoin supply gets this gets cut in half uh so every four years we sort of anticipate something new is going to happen a changing of the cycles but i think that eip 1559 and the merge are going to happen much more quickly at an accelerated rate and maybe at a rate that you know the crypto industry uh is not typically used to so how soon could all of this happen i know we talked about it a little bit but there's this concept being floated around of the accelerated merge what is this how likely are we to hit the the merge date and also the eip 1559 date of july right so let me talk about the the accelerated merge and and what it means basically it it means that we try to merge as soon as possible but we have a proof of a mvp minimal viable product we remove all the bells and whistles that could slow down the merge so we remove withdrawals from the beacon chain back to the evm that that can wait you know a few more months for what we call the post merge cleanup we don't enable transfers internally to the beacon chain so if you want to transfer some funds from one validator to another well you have to wait a little bit more until the post merge cleanup because we really want to focus on this minimal merge and we don't do fancy stuff like statelessness so statelessness is kind of a sustainability security feature right we have um we have this this massive state and with statelessness the validators don't need to store the state which is very nice but at merge we're going to be asking the eve to validators to run a full node a full e4 node with all all the states um and like in terms of of of timelines we've really tried to accelerate things and that's for several reasons um one reason as you can see is that the the the cash flows are so large the amounts of money are so extreme that um one this is bad for the environment right because we're we're just pumping so much carbon in in in the atmosphere to to pay for the electricity bills you know on the order of 50 million dollars per day the other thing is that it's bad for the holders the ape holders right we're getting we have this this fire hose of issuance which is just drowning us in liquidity which is putting a huge amount of cell pressure um also we have miners that have you know issued some some threats of violence right they've um they've said okay let's try and and and show that we're strong and powerful that we can control the network by uh you know amassing 51 50 of all the the hash rate in a single pool um and you know honestly i think the merge at this point is is kind of overdue right like we're we're six years in right like the the the concept of proof of stake has been there even before the genesis of ethereum that was part of the roadmap from day you know minus a hundred um and and really it's it's it's overdue i mean i think this this the fact that it took us six years really shows how difficult it is to to change ethereum and how you know robust and decentralized and how how much due diligence we put in and how how we want to do things properly as opposed to doing things fast um but you know the the beacon chain is now running with over 10 billion dollars like there's a lot at stake it's been running essentially fine since genesis and i think if we were to merge let's say in in december the beacon chain would be a one-year-old um so you know we'd have a lot of value at stake for a long period of time that's quite a bit of of you know stress testing uh before we um before we merge so if you go to the the the eve peak supply spreadsheets i actually have the best case lean conservative and conservative scenarios so my my best guess is that we're gonna emerge the 1st of december 2021. and now the reason i picked this date is because it's the first anniversary of the beacon chain which was launched uh on the 1st of december 20 2020. um but of course you know i i kind of lean optimistic in general so maybe you know like people are like generally in the team there's this i'd say there's this rough consensus at this point that we want to merge as soon as possible and that 2021 is a good development target but it's not you know an ultimatum it's not um something that we must deliver we really want to focus on on security first and foremost because we don't want to put the whole ethereum economy hundreds of billions of dollars on the beacon chain which is which is not secure and we don't we don't want to risk all this value so if we have to we will delay but because the merge is so minimal it's so simple from a technical perspective um as far as they know no one believes that the merge would come after q1 2022 and so what that's why i put my conservative timeline at the 31st of march 2022 for the match and justin this would be that accelerated merge and then of course cleanup would need to occur afterwards correct correct yep okay and then the eip 1559 date um that feels like it's pretty pretty strong pretty set july 14th is looking like the very likely date but your conservative guess on that was august 2021 right so you know there's extremely high confidence from the person leading this effort that eip1559 will be part of london like 99 plus confidence it's happening all the implementations are there we have the test nets it's it's it's all ready you know the eip has been accepted um like the real question is timing and but we're talking about weeks that's the uncertainty period and as i mentioned we have this difficulty bomb which is a forcing function so we we have to hard fork and we will hard fork with eip-1559 the question is just are we going to half walk in july august and potentially in the extreme case early september but no later than september 2021. so back to the acceleration that i was talking about when i when i asked this question i don't think the crypto market is used to this amount of um issuance supply chain change in such an accelerated period of time first of all the amounts are massive right going from like four percent to negative one percent like and then also the the the timeline is greatly accelerated we're talking about nine months maybe 12 months uh under the the more conservative scenario so um i think that the the the crypto market crypto investors crypto people in general are going to have to get their heads wrapped around this accelerated timeline and the ramifications and implications of what you just laid out and you know thanks for putting the models together for us i think david's got uh one last piece he wants to cover and uh then we'll let you go justin and and ryan you can uh stop showing your screen just to finish these things off um and justin i want to finish off with again another metaphor or kind of like uh vantage point for viewing ethereum and moving forward and we've you've talked about uh mocks when it comes to ultrasound money like if if we're at mach 1 ether is supersonic and we are actually burning eat more ether than we are issuing but mox can go up like we can hit mach 2 which is twice the speed of sound or or what but what does that mean for ether the asset if if ether the asset hits mach 2 what does that mean does that mean is that actually an explicit thing yeah so mac one means that the fee burn exactly matches the um the issuance so we've we we it's like as if we had a cap right the the the supply would would not increase it would be very similar economics to bitcoin um and we'd be like sound money if we reach mach 1. but if we reach mach 2 what that means is that the amount that we're burning is twice as much than the amount that we're issuing now by the way this is long-term mach 1 mac2 max 3. if we were to look right now in the present day it's more like mach 10 and the reason it's so high is because there's very few there's relatively little if that's being staked only four million if and so the the proof of stake issuance is quite a bit lower so this this little diagram is actually assuming 20 million if which is a far cry from the current for four million if um so you know i tried to to be conservative but you know as you can see you know the 365 day moving average is at 6.5 seven point five thousand uh if per day and and the the the three hundred day and the one hundred day moving average i have mac four which is twelve thousand each per day so this these these data points at the top there they're like acting like magnets right for the 365 day a moving average so we can expect that this moving average will keep on going up cross back three and possibly even cross mark four i i think this metaphor will do a really good job of kind of explaining the differences between um the bitcoin strategy versus the ethereum strategy because with with bitcoin we have the habitings right is every four years it's programmed into the into the protocol it's a very ceremonious time for bitcoiners it's like it's just like the time of the happening if it's the time for all bitcoiners get to come and celebrate the the happening of the supply making its way to the secondary market but with ethereum i think we could have our own mocks like and we get to have mach 2 mach 3 mach 4 and the difference is that with bitcoin it's programmed into the protocol regardless of whether bitcoin is ready for it or not it is getting cut in half no matter what regardless of whether the economics stand up and and bitcoin is very much hoping that because of the happening it makes the economic stand up but for better or for worse the happening has happened is happening with mocks we you with ethereum and going from mach 1 to mach 2 mach 3 it's not programmed it's not guaranteed ethereum has to earn it ethereum has to but viably leveraging the the just a native economy that's built on top of ethereum if it gets from mach 1 to mach 2 and then mach 2 to mach 3 it's because it earned it it's because it made the economics work out like that and so rather than having it programmed and imposed upon the system uh the marketing or going from mach 1 to mock tube knock 3 gets to be a new a ceremonious time for ethereum people when we don't know it's coming or not and when we finally hit like mach 17 or whatever and we finally we get to rejoice in this new marketing marketing well i need we need to figure out a better meme for this but a new mock level where we uh we get to be pat ourselves on the back we like you we earned this like we we got this done like it came to us rather than it being imposed upon the protocol ethereum was ready to reach this new speed of of ultrasound money that's and that's my takeaway that i i think is a nice structured position absolutely and i think this um this kind of shows the potential of the the ultrasound money meme like really the whole thing started as as a joke right it was super sonic money from from fatalic um and then it was upgraded from joke to meme with ultrasound ultrasound one word um and i i think you know we're moving towards ultra sound money with a space in between as becoming reality becoming fundamentals and as you say these fundamentals are gonna age like fine wine right because if this this up only thesis is correct in terms of the the total uh transactions views per day this this theme is just going to keep on maturing and maturing and maturing um and actually if you want to um facilitate the the maturing process um not only can you participate of course on ethereum and be part of the economy and pay these transaction fees but um this is a small plug i'm i'm looking for a a website designer back-end and front-end to help with the website ultrasound.money right so i think there's a lot of potential there to show like really nice graphics of you know the daily burn and what mac level we're at and etc etc wow that is a very prestigious position uh i think whoever ends up landing the uh that job to help build out that website that would be a pretty cool job to land for sure justin thank you so much for spending time with us this is number three and um you know wow like you've just uh given a give given us so much in in terms of understanding what's happening with the crypto economics of uh this system we call ethereum and we just really appreciate you spending the time to do this thank you so much for having me it was great fun bankless listeners in the show notes there will be some action items for you and one of those is to review these models the models that we went through with justin super important play with them yourselves uh if you want to adjust the assumptions go do that give us your feedback also listen to the ultrasound money episode again i've had a lot of bankless listeners tell us that they they've had to listen to it not once but twice or you know sometimes three four times to fully digest and understand that episode i think that's a a key precursor episode to this one and i'll just say that i think this is the most important thing happening in crypto right now and it doesn't since the beginning in my opinion yeah but like especially right now because it's going to happen over the next nine to 12 months it's going to happen so quickly and ethereum is the second largest crypto network uh maybe moving into the first largest as a result of all of this and people need to understand eth's monetary policy each issuance schedule what's happening with eth 2.0 the fee burn the implications of that the merge the reduction of supply implications of that and so we're trying to bring that information out to them this is alpha this is understanding this is where ethereum is going so um thanks for tuning in thanks for tuning with us as always risks and disclaimers of course eath is risky crypto is risky so are these d5 systems
