welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero it's gonna be something a little different i'm speaking to marin altman uh and she is the person that uh pays attention to astrology to predicts the crypto markets uh and so uh this is definitely off the beaten path for typical bankless content and so listeners might need to put on their skeptics hat but either way i think there are interesting things to pull out of this episode regardless of whether you believe in the relationship between the positions of the planets and the relationship of how our earth progresses uh and so marin is a background in philosophy but also in order to do what she does has to be extremely multi-disciplinary so it's not just astrology it's relating astrology to many many things and i'm always a huge fan in the way that crypto is so multi-disciplinary in order to understand crypto you need to understand biology you need to understand psychology computer science history economics uh human anthropology is super relevant um but i've never really thought uh to include astrology um and i don't think most people do and i think most people definitely discount astrology almost completely um but if you want some entert some entertainment and just to open your mind and explore new subjects marin has produced a huge brand around herself for being the person that can somehow make really good calls from really far away whether you think that is just luck of the draw and just sheer happenstance or whether you think that this is actually something real uh is an entertaining show either way uh and so i hope you guys enjoy this fantastic conversation with marin altman right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you're

in europe um traveling around what about you uh kind of wondering where this conversation goes i don't think our two communities cross pollinate too much uh so i actually want to start at the very beginning for the people that who don't know who marin is who is marin i am an astrologer and i mainly track financial markets specifically crypto okay so uh there's there's a varying degree of skepticism about astrology uh and so the the first time i i heard you uh you saw you on my radar you were doing the astrology thing but like relating it to like [ __ ] coin prices right i think maybe like the first one was like ship token uh and so uh what is is there a conversation to have about like the degree of facetiousness about astrology or like do you are you 100 like on board with the whole astrology thing oh i've been tracking this throughout my life i have been observing the correlation i've been more focused on world events and markets than personality because if i can objectively predict a world event especially price action which is very verifiable right or wrong um that's much more credible than me anecdotally saying that someone acts a certain way you know that can be [ __ ] that can be that can be manipulated any certain way so um the only facetiousness is me just creating a meme out of myself i i'm kind of astounded sometimes when people don't get when i'm joking and when i'm not but i get that i'm using such weird words that i can't expect everyone to understand um i'm either dead serious or i'm completely meaning myself but the act of what i'm doing in its totality is like dead serious yeah okay and and so you were doing this before crypto right you were integrating astrology and money and finance before you found crypto so i'd been growing up obsessed with astrology and when i was a teenager i started applying it to world events because i found that much more interesting and when i got to college and switched from acting to philosophy in order to do that better i was doing more political cycles uh empires i've always been like people who know me personally know this i've been obsessed with war and combat throughout my life so when i could apply astrology to predicting that and tracking that that's when things really took off for me especially looking at uh the us like u.s war statistics are talking about that and i really blew up when i predicted the 2020 sequence of events in politics for the us leading up to and following the election and early 2020 when i was graduating from nyu and i was like i need to open a bank account learn how to manage my own money i um found some issues in the banking system that just seemed inefficient like i found it incredibly stupid inefficient luckily i had no prior knowledge of anything financially no one had ever taught me anything i studied philosophy so when i found the issues i found crypto and that was the first entry into finance i have no traditional finance background i have no traditional financial astrology background i i don't know any i i still just say don't know that much about traditional finance uh only early crypto can you do walk us through a little like out loud thinking process about like what goes into the finding the the predictions finding the connections between astrology and financial markets or the other things that relate yeah so at any given moment the planets in the sky are in a certain position they're all moving at different speeds they're all moving in different orbits and in the software i have it shows that and the planets therefore are always making different angles to one another and these angles tend to represent either easy or difficult world events and the planet themselves symbolize certain themes in the world so you'll combine ex-planet with y planet in a certain degree in very much first order logic to make an if this than that statement and if you're using multiple charts as in the chart of the given sky and those planetary aspects to something that was born whether it be a person or bitcoin and its genesis block because we were all born at a snapshot of the planets and we can see how our life is going if we apply the current planets and those geometric aspects to uh something that was born so if you do that to bitcoin you can predict if this aspect to if x aspect to like why planet and bitcoin's chart then number go up go down it's the same process as if this is happening to the chart of the u.s then this looks like this kind of world event in this area of the life because there's sectors in the sky that represent certain things and it's a ton of basically data collection over time that is refined into certain alignments represent certain world events and it's the judgment of the astrologer to contextualize that with what the world is going through right now so anyone with basic knowledge of astrology can tell you this angle with these planets means bad or good it takes awareness of the world and contextual possibilities to put that into perspective for how it can apply to the market the world someone's life um and that's where my knowledge of wanting to learn about crypto came in handy because it was an area i was actually passionate about learning about it didn't take me forcing myself to look at people's charts which i stopped doing once crypto blood because i'm not as interested in people's personalities or their lives as i am financial markets which i think are just more objectively gratifying to predict and look at yeah i think crypto fits really really well here because crypto offers a unique vantage point for viewing the whole entire world so there's a conversation to be had there but before before we get to that point uh there's gonna be a decent number of listeners who just listen to that and they're like that's a bunch of magic uh and and i'm sure you get this all the time so like what's your response to people who think that like okay this is just like this is just magic this isn't real what do you say to this yeah firstly i invite in all skepticism we do not get anywhere with blindly believing things i would rather have someone be extremely confused extremely skeptical and i find that more respectable than buying it i think that that is a much more um i find that a much better reaction than like oh magic oh cool like i don't take that seriously that's not the kind of uh conversation i want to have we're looking at correlation here so there are different seasons obviously in the world therefore if we're simply zooming out looking at other things happening on a repeated basis um i'm in no way claiming causation in fact i will like stand out from possibly maybe more woo or magical inclined people who study this who will say things like this is happening because of mercury retrograde this is happening uh because mars is in this angle i am very specific with my language i never use causal language unless i'm literally making a joke and like but i don't even do that anymore because then people get confused so in no way am i ever claiming causation and so when people try to strawman me and say oh so you're saying that jupiter's making no i never said make i never said pause i'm saying in correlation with i say signal i say indicates i say suggests so when people say things like it was not the planets it was this black swan of it i'm like exactly the planets were informing us that this was going to happen and if someone doesn't buy the correlation then by no means am i offended by no means am i going to try to convince them i think that it's important to go in with a clean slate of i don't really know how this works because it's not something that works it's something that is shown to us that i like to think of it as a glitch in the architecture of reality that we can look at where we're getting a sneak peek into a point of view that we wouldn't normally have i i think there's a certain amount of humility that comes from being the player in the game and recognizing that not the creator of the game not that this is it's not a religion it's nothing religious at all it's more of a perspective um that i'm practicing but i invite in all skepticism i show people this is how i get there i everything i do like my scripts for my videos is written in literal first order logic like if this then that uh this negates this this is more important than this and because of that um i think if anyone does disagree it would be more on the level of i don't agree with your interpretation um the disagreement i don't think is as much when it's correlation it's hard to disagree with like that conclusion because someone can say i just don't feel comfortable with my own ability to determine if this is a correlation but i invite enough skepticism and i think when it's done from a perspective without um straw manning or from the get-go getting some ad hominem argument then i invite it what about the critique or the criticism that like there's just two sets of data here there's like the world events the crypto markets the the movements of the nation states all these all these big things and then there's the data set of all the planets and their relationships with each other and there's so much data on both of these two data sets that like inevitably you'll find a way to like map them together to produce some correlation what about this critique yeah i completely agree with that and that's why i don't talk about things that i am not specifically focused on the context of because sometimes i'll predict a world event and i'll have someone comment oh this is happening in the philippines right now i'm like i'm looking at the chart of the us don't give me credit for that that's not what i'm looking at um i think tracking crypto markets with certain assets and world events for things like nations and specific areas of life with that is much more verifiable and if someone gives me credit for claiming that i don't know i'm looking at the us chart and i'm like oh this looks like terrible financially involving a female leader i wonder what's happening and someone tells me oh in like some african country that this happened with this female leader and the currency did this i'm like i i wasn't speaking to that that actually happened a few months ago when something i spoke to was around i talked about um maybe it was a year ago but i talked about it looking like biden was gonna have to step down for a period of time like there was a a planetary retrograde that i'm like look he's not like leaving office but it looks like he's stepping down intermittently uh and kamala harris looks like she's gonna be stepping up uh he was getting a colonoscopy and had to because he was under anesthesia say that he was putting her in control so i yeah so like that kind of thing happened where it was strange and i did not have the context for that i didn't know that that could happen but it definitely looked i was like he looks like he's going away for a little bit that's kind of strange where i completely agree with that and that's the kind of thing that i want people to grow me on i want them to say but this didn't happen like worldwide um i stick to areas that i'm literally looking at so the chart of bitcoin if it did not happen to bitcoin if it happened i don't know some other thing then i don't get credit for that this is amazing uh so one of the the reasons why i was picked to bring you on the show is because there's been a number of uh other people who have made these similar comments of just like yo i don't get the voodoo magic that maren's up to but her track record is like off the charts uh and then i saw a prediction from you forever ago that predicted may 9th and i think you said something along the lines of do what you will with that uh and then may 9th came and went and that was the collapse of the terror ecosystem so like uh can you talk about just how you kind of won hearts and minds by via just actual predictions that came true yeah i think not not wavering because i can see that this has worked i was much this has worked like people initially told me oh you're just in a bull market that's why it's like no i made more money over the summer because i actually just i'm like better at shorting it's just more fun it's more red i'm better at that i think continuously putting things out and um i i don't feel like i i don't take things seriously enough not to be completely like i predict this if i'm wrong crucify me like i've been wrong before i've said things that just did not they happen in a different way and i'm like oh so i got this wrong and this happened um i i don't have any hesitation and putting myself out there because i would rather have um i would rather have tried it and failed miserably than played scared and run away from people judging me or coming to doubt me at first so i think by continuously showing up developing a track record and being very deliberate about saying this is correlation not causation i'm not someone that claims any magical abilities in fact i'm pretty like grounded like i say i'm like a human computer um i i don't i don't do i don't i can't even remember tarot card meetings i don't do tarot cards or anything like that really i take the memes you could call me crypto witch you can ask you know when moon when i'm like i'm rarely looking at the moon i'm usually looking at the other planets i i invite that uh i think that just my unwavering consistency and being more scared of not making an impact than what people think at a given moment has kept has kept people um engaged even if at first they're like the hell is she doing uh so do you leverage your own portfolio when you when you look towards the stars and the planets to make predictions like do you actually put your own money on the line always like that's a hundred million percent yeah wow uh how's how's your track record with your own money given that i started trading i i started learning how to trade late 2020 started trading early 2021 and then my block i was hacked and all my eth was taken it wasn't that much at the time but at the time i was like this is all my money oh my god and i had to make it all back like i had to learn um it's been what i've done over the past two year and a half now and it's been like astounding i mean the opportunities that i've gotten to do with helping my family and i think not only with tracking astrology i'm used to for like i i guess like i mean i'm i'm 23 so i i haven't been technically doing this for decades but i've been looking i guess you could say for decades whatever i've been looking at planetary symbols and cycles and lining them up for so long that looking at a candlestick chart and learning those patterns it's all pattern recognition that fell into place really really quickly for me i don't care if the number's going up or down i l i i i will like be kind of cool to people and be like i i don't see why you're upset like there's no need to be upset number go down showing the strength in the dollar is a it's a better asset right now like all the bitcoin usd chart is saying is the dollar is a stronger asset right now there's no good bad um because of that like i do put my money where my mouth is and there's no hesitation and i um i haven't traded as much over the past year i've just simply stuck to doing more on the building side and doing that but i still when i get an entry i'll document it i put it on my telegram channel and i'll just be like oh i've stopped out oh [ __ ] but i'm pretty open about like how i like to go risk on and i will be more risk on end of this month how how do you decide what is the asset pair to trade like do do the planets tell you this so with bitcoin being the context for basically the entire crypto market everything else being bitcoin on leverage for the most part i'm really only tracking bitcoin and eth in the way that both of them are astrologically composed a lot of eth's placements are exactly 180 degrees opposite uh bitcoins meaning that in a 360 degree wheel if something is making a certain angle with bitcoin it'll make the same angle with ethereum so there's rarely that much difference between the two and you're telling me bitcoin and ether are highly correlated yeah yeah which is funny because in seeing that i i am seeing that i thought that that was interesting however there's some very specific things that are really only triggered for bitcoin or eighth and usually i can determine whether it's news related um because when i'm looking at astrology that's fundamentals it's not necessarily exact price it's not exact price i have to execute the trade to talk about that that i am i'm only looking at bitcoin in east generally i have like the chart of solana luna avax but i don't think that i get a high return on my investment of time if i'm looking at that i would rather just look to bitcoin if i miss a random announcement about something i don't even care i'm not gonna beat myself up i've gotten people to be like yo i'm launching this can you look at the chart i'm like no it doesn't [ __ ] matter like look at context first just like how if the traditional markets are nuking bitcoins probably going to respond in some sort of way uh so i just look at what's the founding like principle going on here and uh it it's easier too because i have the astrology memorized of bitcoin or east so i can keep it in mind more actively right and there's a resolution problem here right like the planets aren't gonna let you know what the market action of this one you know 10 million dollar market cap [ __ ] coin are doing that's that's too refined so uh maybe even bitcoin and ether are too specific and so we're really looking at the crypto industry as a whole more than specific specific assets inside of it is that right i would say that with astrology i like to say that it's a mirror for reality or the clock on the wall that's telling you it's 3pm it's not making at 3 pm that if something is substantial enough in taking up space in world events that the astrology of whatever you're using as the birth chart will be relevant but if i'm like looking at a [ __ ] coin chart and i can see that it looks good in this way bad in this way um i'm not going to take that to be direct price action because price action is probably going to follow bitcoin but i could see different things in the chart that could just be like the company level i've told people flat out if they ask about their company and they really want to know i can tell them more so this looks like a success in this way or not a success in this way and it looks better during the market at this time but um the most direct path to understanding what's going on in the market will be what's the underlying fundamental asset that's most in charge here it's going to be bitcoin and eve amazing amazing uh so you you have a background in philosophy a degree in philosophy and you've been looking at just world events and the machinations of the universe as it relates to our planet over a long period of time and i think that's always an intimately awesome conversation when we turn into the crypto space because the crypto space always seems to be just microcosms or like the speed running of things that have already happened in the world like there's always the the line that crypto is uh speed running the the history of money and finance uh but also if you're into human organizational structures there's also the same line that you know uh crypto speed running the the systems of human organization that we've already been through so like we have the empires of old and we have like the newer crypto economic layers on top of it and it's the same old patterns over and over and over again and so i would imagine when you found the crypto rabbit hole it felt like a bunch of candy for you uh just because like there's so there's it's so rich here there's so many things to discuss can you can you talk about that part of your life yeah i think that the volatility not only in price action but also just in the general happenings in crypto gave me much more to predict much more stakes and like i'm someone who didn't shy away from talking about politics talking about these things in a way that in no way really was like my own beliefs like i'll be like i'll talk about them but not predict it's not a prediction like objectively this is happening here um it was just objective uh i like that it was very objective because with the person it apparently hurts people's feelings to say this looks [ __ ] terrible like this is never really going to be an amazing time of your life right now like this looks horrendous people get i don't know i talk about myself with that but apparently other people will be like this is not whatever uh thankfully i've never said that because i've never seen anything uh i've never i've just never seen anything that horrible but in an asset chart i can be blatant i can say this looks horrendous i can say for months the first two weeks of may looks horrendous and people are like oh fun like we're going 100 okay okay trade on that all right i think that with crypto was an area that i was already like english with my own interest very interested in because i have no attention span um there's a certain amount of innovation that is not personal going on there i am not anonymous obviously myself but i appreciated the trustlessness and the anonymity because i didn't have to be concerned with people and identities i could just see was being built so the more like computerized aspect of me enjoyed that and the emergence of things that i had studied like i my focus in philosophy was ethics and then metaphysics and even with ethics i found that it's a lot of applying logic into human decisions and what will minimize pain and maximize just good will so that consideration outlines a lot of crypto like how do we make this most efficient most parsimonious and less able to be exploited or detrimental that it was like that but without the the tears or whatever that can sometimes get intermingled with evaluating ethics when in a lot of ways it's evaluating what's the most precise path to logically minimizing issues and that's constantly a thing whether you're building or you're trading is how do i do this most efficiently yeah so do you consider yourself like a passive bystander of the crypto industry or do you also have some sort of like interest in like steering it as well i wouldn't say that i'm a passive bystander in like anything besides i don't i i don't yeah i can't think of a single thing as opposed to like an observer of the event rather than someone who's trying to like you know lead the horse for example yeah um i don't like to comment or try to make decisions on behalf of things i don't understand so for example with the luna fiasco like going on right now i don't understand the theories of citadel doing this that borrowing i openly i'm like i need to sit down and i'm not even going to try to try to understand it through a 4chan meme that being thrown around so on those kinds of things that i feel like are outside of the weirdly specific niche neuronic pathways i have towards certain pattern analysis and that kind of thing i don't i don't want to make any kind of um i don't want to make an appeal to my own authority on things i don't feel confident in so um certain kinds of trading it by like things that are very high level like equities oh hell no like i'm just no authority in that but i don't think i'm taking a bystander or a journalistic approach i think that i am trying to actively engage and in particular open this space up to a generation that i understand i don't have an attention span um they're very gigabrain high level things here that i just smile and nod about because i'm very simple i i don't develop i don't code not that i can't look at something and kind of understand where it's going but that's not where i go i think if anything i would want to continuously increase my reach and my impact as i grow my expertise as well as respect when i can just joke and be like i don't [ __ ] know what's being talked about here i don't know what happened with luna i just know price go down i don't understand what's happening so uh what's the the marion community like uh uh like every single there's a bunch of communities in in the world of crypto every every single token has a community and and some people have their own communities is there like a cult following of of marin and i use cole endearingly by the way yeah yeah there's a very polarized following i would say um the crypto i mean i would say it's fairly supportive people ask me like do you face misogyny i was like i don't think so it's just me i i feel pretty well supported i have i've throughout my time gone from getting offended at every comment i mean i had such a thin skin uh it really really for the first i mean it happened so quickly that it wasn't really crypto it was more just people will make things up to try to take people down who are successful and i just it was really really difficult and now i don't really read comments often because i'm just like what am i going to learn from this either someone saying i love you not useful someone's saying you know this because you're being flown out by whales no i'm not do you see me in my vlogs i'm alone like this is just ridiculous i don't get anything from that so also for the listeners the people that have the time to draft up the comments are generally the people that also just have this some sort of like negative complex about them like we've definitely seen the same behavior at bankless yes and if you look at what they're saying if they're on twitter if you look what they're saying it's always they target like three people and the only thing they have to say is like that you're a fraud like you're doing this then you're like okay whatever so i'd say my quote following is pretty polarized because i do have a lot of that like i just i and i at first i didn't and now i do get it that um young successful girl outspoken is not like well if that makes sense no like i don't i don't apologize i don't say lol or haha at the end of my statements that is going that's and i've had people say that made me so angry at first and i didn't really get that i don't really get jealous i'm just like everyone do their thing very happy i mind my own business i get why there is a large following that um absolutely hates my guts and i've even had bigger accounts call me like a scammer and people are like how like she just does something how she's gamer they're like for existing i've seen that thrown around like okay whatever i've seen people try to add up the letters in my name in jamaitria and be like this says uh this is a man that that's and they think i'm like a bot i'm a russian bot so the other half i think are pretty cool people that mind their own business they're really weird and a lot of them will say something like yo i um i i trade or i work like equities or i do um private equity for this like i really like your calls you're pretty cool just wanted to drop in and when i meet people in real life everyone is super chill everyone is super i guess down to earth um so i don't think i have that out there of a following but i have a very very polarized following and i've always been like what am i going to run into one of my haters but then you learn that usually people doing that would come up to you and smile in real life anyway yeah 100 of the time oh my gosh yeah even the even like the people that have come and left like terrible comments on on the bankless youtube sometimes when i just like reply and i go hey hey thanks man uh they always end up saying oh sorry for that really bad comment so yeah and then also in real life everyone is always much more lovely yeah yeah perpetually yeah yeah i've had some funny situations where someone will see me at a conference which is usually where the like the mass people will obviously meet me um weirdly enough i was today i was touring i'm in poland and i toured the concentration camp that my grandmother escaped from and someone recognized me in the gift store and it was the most absurd thing i've ever ever felt i was like this is surreal so insane um but yeah always when people who met me in real life it's been great and then sometimes they'll be like uh you block me on twitter and i'm like i don't care and then that's like the only thing that's your problem yeah because you got to do something i don't block out of nowhere and sometimes i don't remember and i don't i don't remember but that's the only time when it's been like other people try to make it awkward and i'm just i don't have time to make things awkward i just move on right yeah you have to grow some sort of just like hard skin confidence to exist long term as a as a public figure in this space very quickly like you will yeah very quickly ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode

your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrarum or boba networks yeah so you're you're uh close to a lot of like the trading communities in in the crypto space and are there any like traders who just like are frustrated by your performance and be like what the hell is she doing she's beating me and at my own game and not even playing the same game yeah to be honest i've really only gotten positive responses i the very small minority are people who i'd say are like angered or have a negative reaction when things happen i whenever my calls do come through i mean it's just like a flood in my dms of a lot of people that um do trade i'd say to a higher level than i do like i just trade support resistance i just i don't know a lot of the terms that they use or like the strategies or i don't take those things into account so people i respect often do reach out and i can't respond to the amount of messages i tend to get from people that i probably respect i openly can't even open my dms most of the time um it's a lot of people just asking questions you know saying things do you think this i can't even open it but there definitely is a huge amount of people that i am shocked and i respect a lot that do reach out when these things happen and they're like what the [ __ ] and i'm like i told you i told you risk off early may but uh usually it's a pretty it's a pretty supportive response so with some of your predictions are are they generally all about the same time frames or like are there like short time frames medium time frames long time frames uh well and this is to lead into some predictions i'm going to ask for you to make but first this one just like is it or like next couple weeks next couple months next couple years like what's going on yeah since planets have different orbits for example mercury spends usually three weeks in a sign jupiter spends a few months goes back to a different sign in a total of one year in a sign there are different periods and cycles within cycles and also the planetary aspects that happen between planets geometrically depending on the planets involved can last different speeds so the moon moves very quickly it's two and a half days in a sign so if i see something like a new or a full moon that's going to be like a one day range of a pivot up or down that i'm looking for versus jupiter and a sign it's going to be a couple months where i'm like market looks better or worse than it was over the past two months so there's there's a huge range okay so this uh relates to like things always go in cycles time is not linear time goes in circles uh and like like it corks to corkscrews through the future right like spins around in circles and then and then there's orbits around those right and so like the the moon orbits around the earth the earth orbits around the sun the sun orbits around something larger uh and and that is also the same pattern that is found in cryptocharts as in like we have the four-year cycles and then we have like the the 80-year business cycles and then you have like the [ __ ] coins that orbit around the bitcoin uh and so like it's their structure here is all the same is this what is this what you're tapping into here yeah in a similar way i am tracking both very short term things like oh this day for doge looks interestingly great elon tweets something like that i can also look at wow there's a few months here that look much better than the previous few months and then i can zoom in for what are the planets that move faster doing within that time for the more specified dates so very similar to things that stick around versus longer term things like the having cycle amazing okay so what do we got coming up for us what's uh what month are we in right now it's may what's coming up for may and june and then what's coming up for the rest of 2022 so we have two days from filming this two days until a lunar eclipse and it looks absolutely horrendous like it's just it looks but however with the eclipse season lasted from april 30th with the first eclipse until may 15th with this eclipse so there's a two-week period that's eclipse season um that period was like the complete caution caution caution watch out specifically may 10th to 15th and that was the period that this luna thing happened and it's interesting that luna would have this happen under a lunar eclipse and um yeah just that was strange because i wasn't looking at luna's astrology i was i didn't know it i i've never been in the luna ecosystem frankly i just only have the bandwidth to focus on so much so i looked at it and was like well this looks like a turning point may 10th to 15th this looks this looks pretty horrendous i think that um the eclipse being i guess in a day and a half now technically that could have been the major major correction that was going into it i don't trust the market until the 16th onward when because a lunar eclipse is always a full moon and if you look at the moon cycle on trading v you can see that full moons tend to be pivots to the upside we are jumping into full moons and then we pivot up after i am more optimistic for a recovery for the last two weeks of may and i do want to qualify that with in no way does that mean like golden bull run over the summer that i do think restabilizes from may until the end of october that's about the range when i'm like okay it looks like there's a bit of a re-stabilization and no by no means do we have the liquidity do we have the market conditions the world climate for anything like 2020 when every 18 year old is putting their 1500 stimulus check into doge like that's in no way what i'm seeing i think that people have to um have a reality check around prices and just simply that number values will be likely lower over the next few months because of the lack of liquidity crazy inflowing and the priorities of retail to uh invest in the food that's inflating rather than put their excess money into bitcoin so over the next few months over the summer i do anticipate that things will restabilize and get better from where they are not all-time high nothing nothing like that um end of year november december it looked look pretty difficult um again but end of may recovery yeah um i don't fear number going down like i've said like i don't know i practice stoicism i'm just like never go up never go down i literally don't care i'm gonna respond in any way but um caution because it does look like uh down and a beer okay okay so if we're trying to time out the length of this bear market uh the last the first bear market i went through the 2018 to 2021 that lasted two years there were a number of times where like the whole industry got bullish as like uh bitcoin approached 10k ether started to break through 300 and we're like oh guys it's on but then and then it just broke down every time every single time yeah so like is there any indication as to how long we're going to be stuck in this bear market yeah i think that 2023 has some extremely like spring 2023 april may has some very strange astrology that i've been talking about um when i made it i made a predictions video in summer 2021 about this eclipse cycle that is 2022 into spring 2023 and when this cycle repeated 18 years ago and 18 years ago before that it dealt with uh geopolitical redrawing of borders and that seems to be happening i was talking about the soviet union actually and then again now there could be some uh things redrawn in like ukraine russia depending on how that goes it also tended to be collapses of certain currencies in finance and the things being redeveloped in the banking system like crashes into okay then we have this new form of currency new form of banking um there's some other things as well like uh terrorism hostage crises some strange ones that tend to repeat during the cycle but i think it makes sense for in about a year for something geopolitical to catalyze crypto in a way that i i don't know if this makes sense with uh i don't know if this makes sense but the way it pieces together is for now no one really cares that some random country wherever put bitcoin as legal tender whatever but if there's a reason for countries to start massively needing to accumulate it um in the way that i see both independence free speech this other cycle going on really accelerating as well as having to crash and reconstruct a financial system i mean there could be a strange world theme where whether it's central bank digital currencies then making bitcoin an alternative because people don't want to be under the manipulation of that or it's there's some sort of geopolitical war uh financial crisis payment rails blocked it literally is just the most feasible option i do think 2023 looks better um i don't know if that is considered a bull run because i don't know what price people consider it a bull run is it bull run the second we pivot up is a bull run when we get out of this range at like 45k i do think that's a cop out for some people who are like i don't know if we're in a bull or a bear like it depends how you caught like no we've been in like a bear market since december i'd say december was when there was a pretty severe dump and we've been there since then so i don't i don't i'm not copping out with that but i am not um i'm not looking at anything overly optimistic this year uh i think anyone with like a decent geopolitical just understanding can be like yeah even if things get better doesn't look that great for this year 2023 is when i'm seeing some like i said just like weird shocking things that i think are reinventions of the banking system on a more massive scale and possibly possibly the scarcity of bitcoin becoming uh like a fight to obtain that on a more geopolitical sense the there's a frequent line that we use on bank list that uh the 2020s decade is going to be a chaotic decade is there anything in the stars that that would also agree with this oh yeah the start of 2020 had an alignment that when i had repeated throughout history very sparingly i mean every like few hundred years with some kind of massive like amount of destruction and death and i didn't have the word pandemic to say because i never lived through them but i was like looks like a lot of people are just like chaos like infrastructure people just done um that was the beginning of the decade and i'd say that that was the most catastrophic alignment that i'd ever seen um it's a pretty intense decade specifically this week closer into the end of it because the alignments that had repeated some during the 1860s combined with some during the 1940s due for the u.s specifically do look like civil tensions rise like i've i've been saying that for a while that anyone in the us can kind of see this happening we live in two different universes depending on red state blue state people that don't want any part of it there's huge amount of civil tensions rising and so i think that the end of the decade will be um in the way that ray dalio talks a lot about the instability of a currency leading to the instability of a population and then the downfall of an empire we're going through something right now that uh demonstrates that instability of currency and banking in the us and followed by the alignments that were very similar to civil war world war ii in many ways which nowadays wouldn't play out in the same way there's not gonna be like bayonets in the street like that's not gonna happen um does look like things escalate towards the end of the century end of the decade for um particularly when i'm looking at u.s astrology like that there's a meme and we're in the intersection of the us going down in china coming up and we're at like this three-quarter almost complacency bounce point i'm like yeah i can see that too yeah see this is this is why i find this like so oddly like compelling first off like in order to be able to do this this art uh like you it's very multi-disciplinary right you have to understand history you have to understand global current events like you even have to understand like computer science and human anthropology to some degree uh and like what ray dalio in his book he talks about cycles and he talks about the machinations of the earth and so like i i don't understand the the the causation between these two things but you've stated that neither do you uh and so like the it's like one of those things where like i don't know why but there's like it's there's something in alignment here yeah i think the way that i'm just presenting it without fluff or without saying anything outside of my like ontological pay grade like do not ask me about why this is happening do not ask me about what it means i think meaning is not something that can be attributed to like objective events it's something that we create i can go on and on about there's no meaning or purpose i can never talk about anything besides like hammers nails whatever um it doesn't like astrology provides no meaning it provides context and that depresses people i don't know i think it's just obvious with what we're looking at here doesn't mean anything more that it means which is context i think the the presentation of what i'm looking at very simply both confuses astounds alarms people and is more compelling than me either dumbing it down whitewashing it into something pop culturey or a meme and uh my money is where my mouth is and i when i am more actively training i show it so uh and also there are people who have done what i've done over centuries but none of them wear all red and do tick tocks and are usually in random hotel rooms all over the world so there's a there's some fun in that yeah there's definitely some mystique sure um what's uh what's for so what's the future of merit like what are you working on is there a project that you're that you're working on right now like behind the scenes or what do you do what do you do in addition to trading yeah i since the start of my trading and things happening i knew i wanted to do something where i put this on chain and allowed more people to have this data get access to it and understand it but you don't know what you don't know so i didn't really rush building this in fact i could tell that with the market euphoria i don't want to build during this like i'd rather build when people are i don't know down no one wants to do anything so i'm building a project called ask trace and it's taking what i do with planetary cycles and an api of that planetary data combining with the price feed and the algorithm of just my first order logic and creating a trading vault based on it so that's the first major thing is pretty transparently being like okay planetary data this is what we're doing with like if this and that statements to execute the trade and creating a vault with it and that same algorithm will power the non-trading dapps that the kids want so like daily horoscopes dating basically putting the astrological data on chain and creating things with it and it's been in the works for a while i just it's just me like i i don't know people think i'm much uh i don't i don't i people assume a lot of things but i'm like no this is just me how does one how do i learn solidity no don't learn solidity like don't do that like okay fine um can i just start creating no no you have to set up a legal entity i'm like jesus christ so doing that over the past few months and as of a few day three days ago we like uh we raised the first round so we're in that process now but um i have been in poland like meeting the developers that are building this and talking with their team and hanging out in their office so building something that is an astrology oracle so good you can trade with it it's the tagline i unintentionally came up with and it's been pretty fun so far amazing this is gonna be so much fun to say nothing okay so coming from the perspective that this is just random random noise which i'm not which is not necessarily my perspective although i'm not ready to to buy into it yet but like coming from coming from that perspective having like this on chain with this performance transparent i think is going to be a super awesome benchmark to compare the whole rest of the industry to yeah yeah i was talking with a good friend who used to used to work at bridgewater and he is like like you're beating the ten percent and it's not just on holding an asset like i've chosen no winners it's kind of nice that i have a control variable upholding of literal terrible performance i chose no winners i got in i am a top signal that's why i always if i'm hearing about it i'm not early to this so putting that into something that can take my error out of it of trade execution or of uh mis saying the moon is in a mercury or 90 degrees into 40 degrees like i've done that before many times where i just human error comes in and seeing that if if it fails it fails miserably but i did it i tried it and i don't i don't have no fear of this uh not working because if it doesn't work first i'm going to look at okay where is it not working like is it the algorithm behind it is it the astrology what's happening because it's worked for me on a pretty basic level i'm really excited for just more people to get to see this uh i'm i am looking forward to building this in a time when i think there's going to be less noise when there's just less euphoria going on distracting like i just had my head down and people have been like raising in these conditions i'm like saying that you're gonna wait for better conditions to raise like [ __ ] [ __ ] like no no no no no we're doing this now we're gonna have this ready for whenever things recover and uh people are more willing to look at things that are more fun even though i've said repeatedly like this is not a fun game vibe this is like chain link walked so we could run with some weird [ __ ] here with astrology oracles and um i'm really looking forward to it as well like put this all on chain make all the data available so we can see what venus sign has the highest net worth and whoever wants to put their birth data on chain can be like oh during this period of my life i had the highest net worth and now it's goblin town i'm very much looking forward to like people who inevitably pitched me on a bajillion things about like their trading performance i'm like we'll have you beat marin yeah yeah and we'll have the option for if you want to counter trade me be my guest like be my guest and join the counter trading thing uh because sometimes i'm wrong so you could make some money but i don't think you'll be entirely profitable so you said you've already raised money how much money have you raised 500k 500k okay five yeah i'm not raising that much uh yeah it actually yeah it is it's in yeah i mean i all my wallets are docks so it's there um but yeah i'm intentionally very conservative valuations very conservative raise all i'm paying our devs like we don't we need a marketing budget so yeah and uh i just i learned a lot about this process doing it myself like just talking to people telling other people them being like you can't say that where i was like okay like i learned uh legally you can only do certain things but yeah we just raised like the pre-seed round in two hours so that was yeah now we're doing more amazing amazing uh so in the event that this this event does or this fund does just like take off and outperform everyone especially as crypto becomes more and more adopted are you prepared for like the amount of just hate and flack you're gonna get from beating everyone i would say yes because i went through a very very difficult 2021 just with the amount of uh just amount of what i went through that i i'm bulletproof like come for me that actually actually come for me um and also with this on chain and the just the transparency of everything like fundraising of my own wallet that i i do everything and i'm like you can see it here like feel free to look there's nothing that i can possibly regret or not want to show and i think the hate will come from a place of being me me being really proud of what i built and not being afraid of that um and my priority right now is how do we just make this algorithm strong how do we how do we develop something that is uh resilient that can integrate the machine learning that we want and all the other things i'm just gonna have my head down and keep building and i'd like to think of both the love and that he as literal noise like literally doesn't help me either way i don't take anything to heart um but luckily i feel like i went through like a insane just like battle forever i mean if you i can't google myself online i'll throw up i literally it's so insane and i just sit there sometimes and my friends are like did you see this reddit thread did you see this for champion i'm like don't send it to me do not send it to me dude i don't want to know it's insane um i think i have a pretty high tolerance now amazing amazing well in addition to and separate from all the all of this trading in astrology what else do you think about what else captures your attention i work pretty non-stop so in a certain way if i'm doing yeah because i love what i do i love um people ask me how do you put out so much content i'm like actually i would put out more if i didn't have to add captions and text and the hashtags or whatever the hell i have to add so i can say a lot more i don't shut up i think that if you're in a zone of genius and alignment and enjoy what you do there's no there's no uh ending or cap to the amount of value you can provide to the world so if i'm not um trading which i don't over trade if i don't have an entry and exit a clear plan i don't do it i think of pretty much everything like a battle plan because i do find it fascinating to study combat in different ways i think that it's been kind of my form of studying i don't know buddhism i was a yoga teacher in college i see a lot of parallels between stoicism the uh leaders in the military sense during that time and other people i admire and just the rigidity the strictness the um commitment and the discernment that they exercise with everything and the like intention behind it and i don't enter a trade i don't do anything without a reason why i'm entering what i hope to get out of it an exit plan of things don't go according to me in a way that i can sleep at night even though i don't like to hold positions open while i sleep because i don't want to wake up and be like oh i need to check it i would rather miss a profit um i think that when i'm not yeah when i'm not trading which isn't that too often necessarily i'm filming tick tocks i'm scripting tick tocks i am um on a plane trying to schedule my week ahead because i'm pretty rigid about wake up at six meditate work out do your most difficult tasks in the morning i'm in bed by like 9 10 usually i i stick to a pretty strict i love it but i stick to that pretty strictly so what i'm known for and what i'm doing people watch my youtube videos because i genuinely like to bring a camera everywhere because my life is absurd i mean when i mean absurd like there's just nothing that is it's incredibly strange i like to document it it's very fun i do not i'm already wearing all random in tattoos everyone's gonna see me out on the street anyway i might as well be saying something uh not seeming like who the hell is this strange person in the things like this big but take whatever i am filming a lot um i'm making content researching content and not usually causing a scene but other people causing a scene because i'm filming vlogging out in public or on a plane and there's turbulence and i'm freaking out i'm like i have to get this on video so that's how i live my life well the crypto industry never fails to produce some very interesting corners and i definitely see that in that corner with what you're building over there uh is there a name is there a name for what you're building ashtrays asterix s tricks how do you spell that ass trace a-s-t-r-a-c-e it's a combination of a few words but yeah strace amazing all right well if there are links out there we will get them into the show notes mary yeah thank you for coming on lair zero thank you may i ask what your sign is oh i'm a sagittarius okay interesting oh no what rabbit hole did i just open up i was just curious i mean i'm not gonna be able to tell or at least i mean we all have so many different placements in our chart but that's cool i mean it's a fire sign so um i'm an earth sign i'm many are assigned so i'm i'm more boring you're more exciting but you know i don't know how you get you that you are boring out of this no i mean i i like i'm an 85 year old monk in the body of a like 23 year olds uh child size person yeah so yeah tick tock it's another insane world but um it's made me resilient like crypto the most volatile space i could work in so i'm happy to have shared that with people that maybe you're not on tick tock maybe you're just in crypto like the hell is she i hope that that clarified some things as to why i am so cringe this is fantastic awesome thank you
