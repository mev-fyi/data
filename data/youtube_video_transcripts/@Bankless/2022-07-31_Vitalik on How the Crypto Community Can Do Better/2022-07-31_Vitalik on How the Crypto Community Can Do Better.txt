i feel like my advice is the same as my advice has always been which is like elevate uh meaningful stuff there's just all of these projects like even you know the erc 4337 team right they don't have a token they don't have a glamorous marketing department they're doing stuff that like i think could be revolutionary that i think could uh you know greatly improve the state of wallet safety people like that deserve some love people who are activists in random countries for whom crypto actually is a lifeline to avoid being d platforms people like that are part of the community better social media platforms where the goal isn't just like hey you know this thing's going to be magically better because it has a token but like have some interesting perspective about like you know what in particular makes twitter unproductive and toxic to the extent that it is and how to replace that with like some positive mechanics there's just all of these different corners of ethereum land that are doing interesting stuff sometimes they need funding sometimes i think they just need kind of attention they need moral support so the more that we can do to help them i think the better
