welcome back to this nation to the ecc experience i hope you enjoyed that conversation with vitalik uh talking with metallica in real life it's always it's always a treat it's always a treat uh coming up next we got kane warwick and kane he's always just so articulate and so clear-headed uh and i already teased the part where we talk about uh his tussle over crypto twitter with suzu obviously that's part of the show but kane gave me this very fantastic presentation of his idea for how bull markets progress uh and it's with this idea of a scoreboard where first we had the scoreboard or of the ico mania like how many millions of dollars can your ico raise then the next mania was the defy summer mania and that metric that scoreboard was how much tvl can you get deposited in your contracts and he makes makes a claim that the next coming bull market is going to be a bull market in fees how much fees can your protocol earn and we are currently witnessing perhaps the beginning stages of a fee revolution going in the app player on ethereum you to swap generating more fees than the ethereum protocol itself which is insane synthetics not too far along and this definitely fits within the bank's vision of fees are fundamentals and in order to have a fundamental alternative financial system that it needs to have fees because that's how companies protocols tokens operate is they generate and capture economic value so i'm super aligned in this thesis that we drop with kane and overall just he's always such a a kick to uh to uh have a conversation with we tell the story of the last ecc uh and how i got coveted and kane was the last person i saw last year uh while we were getting our coveted tests and mine came back negative turns out it was actually should have been positive uh and that's a fun story there but quickly we're going to speed run the sponsors that make the show possible one of the big themes of each cc week was the launch of the zk evm three different teams all launched their test net and while everyone is trying to claim who was first we can confidently say that zk sync has been focused on the zk evm for the longest the golden endgame of the zk evm has been the vision of zk sync since the beginning and during each cc week they launched their 100 days to mainnet plan which is now already down to 93 days so if you're gonna join the zk evm wars make sure you post about it on lens the first decentralized social networking graph in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto but on lens we say not your keys not your content own your own social media handle choose your own algorithm and mint your profile using the secret code word in the show notes and something that's likely going to be talked about on lens is of course the ethereum merge and the merge is why you should be staking your eth with rocket pool it's a decentralized ethereum validator network where you deposit eth and get your reth in return and then you can take that reth into d5 and if you run a node you can let other people deposit their ether into your node and you earn 15 of their staking commission as payment for your node operating services and then maybe you want to take your r eath over to arbitrary for all of your d fry things arbitrary is where you have to be with over 35 000 contracts deployed and one million unique addresses arbitram is leading the way into the age of rollups you know how i know those numbers because i watched arbitrary's talk at ecc which you should definitely also watch but not before you're done watching this video first but in order to get your money over to arbitrum so you can buy your read natively then you should use juno because juno is the fastest bridge from your checking account to an ethereum layer two a checking account to an ethereum layer two is absolutely crazy and it just takes minutes juno is your cryptochecking account for the crypto era but when you're doing all of these things make sure that it's on a privacyfirst browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web3 wallet and it puts the user first the web3 way i hope you use all of these sponsors on your quest for going bankless and now i bring you my in-person conversation with kane warwick what's up kate how's it going yeah good good dude yeah second year at ucc yeah back in the hot seat yeah i'm i'm honored for you for taking the risk and coming and talking to me again i know right i was a little bit worried but i feel like i've had covered enough times now that i'm probably yeah i'm probably uh um out of the out of danger i think how many times have you had it um i've had it twice yeah um so yeah i've had it i've had it three times yeah but i also i got uh a double dose of the booster so okay oh four shots you've had four shots i had two shots and then instead of getting the regular booster dose i got a full booster dose long story yeah it was so much worse than coped yeah way worse than covert i've heard the boosters bad for the for the context here kane was the last person that i saw at last ecc we were both in the pharmacy getting our rapid tests uh and you know chatting up like recapping uh recapping ecc 2021 uh and then i fly back home and then start having cobia symptoms and turns out i tested positive recovery and kane was the last person i had ever seen but you told me that you're a negative one i was hanging out you're like i've got a negative test yeah they let me fly home yeah yeah so yeah i was actually on a call with someone and they're like uh david from bankless just uh tweeted that he's got copen and i was like no he doesn't and they're like uh i just saw him tweet it like he does i'm like i saw his test he doesn't have it and then i was like oh no this is not good no it turns out turns out but i didn't actually get it from you that time i avoided it i i assume i've passed on kobe at least as far as i can tell to zero people yeah even though i've gotten it three times that's impressive um okay so you were here at ucc last year i was uh we're also at ecc this year right now compare contrast how does it feel different how does it feel the same you know crazily enough i feel like it's more vibrant this time like you'd think macro you know bear market all that stuff i don't think that people were quite ready july of last year to travel and so i think there's a lot of people especially u.s people that didn't come last year that are here this year so it feels like you've got a wider range of the community this time and yeah i mean people people seem pretty upbeat um like even at you know permissionless uh what was two months ago now um i feel like there was a bit of fear in the air and we hadn't quite like worked out what was gonna happen i feel like the markets kind of shed that fear and we're like okay it's not great but like we'll survive right it's it's kind of funny i was joking before uh flying out here is like well if we had come out here at 1100 ether people things would have been depressed but if also if we had come to ecc at 1500 where we are now and it hadn't fallen down to 11 first people also would have been depressed yeah but now since we went down to 11 and now it's like 15. oh we're in the green it's not great i know i know yeah price action has a way of doing that too certainly yeah certainly uh yeah i've also noticed that the variety of projects is much more uh there's so many more chains so many more layer twos to talk about yeah uh cosmos has a big a big appearance here but they always have a big appearance at ecc uh what are some of the themes that you've been picking up on so far well i think we are now at a point where i look you know i'm always trying to meme stuff into existence right so i'll show my memes but like i think we're at a point where um the the l2 narrative has the room to breathe that it needs i think the alter one thesis that was playing out so well for everyone for so long really kind of you know suffocated uh the the you know roll-up centric feature of ethereum and like all of that stuff it was really hard to get momentum around that um i think you know in the same way that positive price action can be beneficial negative price action can you know take the win out of the sales of some of these things that maybe were not as sustainable as they appeared um on the surface um you know especially when entire ecosystems implode um that doesn't help the all-tel one thesis uh you know too much either and so i do really feel like people are taking uh l2's you know arbitrarium optimism um obviously there's a ton of like zero knowledge stuff that's you know been talked about this week they're really taking it much more seriously and and the thing that i've been you know kind of hoping for which is this resurgence in interest in ethereum the ecosystem not l1 but like the scaling ecosystem all of the l2s was it would happen and i think we're seeing that you know the first kind of glimmers of that happening yeah there's been a lot of adoption specifically of synthetics in the last couple months and i definitely want to talk about that but but first i want to i want to double down on the alt layer one thesis and i'll play doubles advocate here is it fair to like lump luna the thing the algo stable coin ponzi scheme in with like the other alt layer ones i feel like if i was somebody if i was like anatoly or emin from avalanche i'd be like dude that's not fair like we're not a we're not an algo stable coin ponzi scheme sure i mean you know i i guess my uh my response to that would be that you know all's fair in love and war right so if you want to use means against us you have to be prepared for the you know memes of production to be uh turn against you as well and like yes on one on one level uh that is true but i think so much of the like memetic power over the last 18 months for all tell ones has been price action sure right so when one of them blows up and you go oh wait maybe these things aren't invincible especially when you know the price action has been negative for a lot of the all-tail ones as it has for everything right but like it doesn't really matter if d5 tokens are going down if the thesis was that like cosmos or avalanche is going to surpass ethereum and then you know everyone who's kind of you know betting on that thesis gets wrecked it just has a you know it's going to have an impact on that and people's you know conviction in that theory to keep going on this train of thought uh i i've said it a few times uh that at least one alt layer one will make it through this bear market and that would probably be pretty bullish for them because like when you talk about a lot of these uh all-ear ones were driven by price reflexivity right adoption because numbers going up yeah uh you know things that only are sustainable in the bull market and now now during the bear market though the tide is going out we're returning back to fundamentals things are moving up the market cap stack to the d-risk ecosystem all of a sudden we're interested in the layer two thesis because there seems to be a much more rational fundamentals case to argue these things yeah but also at the same time if if these all layer ones can make it through the bear market would that make you more bullish on the multi-chain absolutely not no no absolutely not and and you know i think they will all make it through because they're all extremely well capitalized right you know they were able to uh build significant war chests through that ridiculous run right that happened you know for the last 18 months for the all-tail ones like that was the i would say probably singular you know price meme right it was like this alter one thesis playing out and you know taking on ethereum and ethereum being too slow and you know too expensive and all of that stuff in you know that caught a lot of the eth maxis myself included by surprise you know we all got a little bit side side swiped by that um but surviving the bear market i mean you know this is going to be even more controversial eos survived the last bear market no one gives a about them right um you know so just surviving i think is not sufficient i think it's going to be um much much harder to sustain an ecosystem the the ones that survive with an ecosystem intact like just surviving as a project is not enough keeping the ecosystems that they've got these nascent ecosystems alive and thriving if if they were able to do that through the bear market then i'm impressed then i would say that's a pretty bullish sign for those networks okay so there's a spectrum here of multi-chain multi-layer one to multi-layer two all on one chain where would you say you land in this spectrum um on the outside of the edge of the spectrum i've like fallen off the other side 110 into the multiplier falling off the edge of the spectrum yeah definitely yeah um and you know my reasoning uh behind that is that you know ethereum while l1 as an execution layer is not viable anymore right and even you know the thing that i worry about one of the things i worry about is people being lulled into a false sense of security that l1 is making a comeback like l1 cannot make a comeback we need to shut that down right we need ethereum l1 ethereum one it's not your home yeah sorry when i say oh i mean the theory exactly like the dow right yeah so like the l1 you know thing is like not a thing anymore right like we need to move on we need to go and we need to deploy regardless of what your uh you know scaling solution of choice is whether it's dockware or stocknet or arbitram or optimism we need everyone to you know really commit to bringing liquidity onto this l2 layer right which will be composed of multiple networks at this point i think that's that's the way it's going to play out um you know it'll be interesting to see whether any of them dominate um but i think that's just a critical thing that we need to kind of see is is you know this uh this kind of scaling of ethereum as a state layer right as opposed to an execution layer that we have to we have to get that right a bit of the narrative around layer twos is that their execution has been slower than what would have been desired yes uh and we're starting to see some signs of life uh you know optimism and arbitrary are generating albeit small but growing fee revenue for the layer one you know proof of use yeah uh we're seeing like new projects deploy onto a few of these layer twos natively yeah the synthetics ecosystem is generating a boatload of fees uh so i'm wondering do you do you give how much credence do you give to the criticism that the layer two ecosystem has lagged more than it should have and uh do you see how where do you see that trajectory going from here i i think you gotta you have to measure it on a few different uh sort of dimensions right um one is like how usable is any of uh you know any of the different l2s as an ecosystem right like for composability um you know for liquidity uh all of the things that your users care about right and the reality is that they're all much further behind than i think we would have hoped that they would be um i feel like defy summer lulled us all into this sense that like liquidity was super easy to move you know and like vampire attacks and all that sort of stuff but all of that kind of played out on the same network i think the the added degree of difficulty of migrating liquidity from one network to another especially off l1 to l2 has been much harder and so when you look at the state of optimism today let's say and you look at you know the liquidity for like an eighth trade on chain on you know wherever uni swap or or wherever you're trading um it feels like back in early 2020 on l1 right so we're you know a couple years behind where the state of you know where l1 is in terms of arbitrage bots and you know and liquidity and like all of the things that you want to see but it is catching up and and i think it will catch up faster than it took to build it the first time on l1 um but it's just going to take a bit more time than i think we hoped i think synthetics is actually a great just canary for the whole story of ethereum scaling where synthetics and a few other tokens really drove uh the whole entire ecosystem out of the 2018 to 2020 bear market uh and you could see that in some of the fees that the protocol was collecting some of the volume volumes of susd and just like the users like it was like the beloved defy app of 2020 and then we hit defy summer and like the whole thing ground to a halt because of the fees on on layer one we're just like too restrictive yeah and like that in my mind uh that's kind of when like synthetic stops growing it's like when the fees came yeah and then now in the but the whole plan and like i think you and the synthetics team were really tapped into this uh layer two specifically on optimism thesis light years ahead of the rest of the ecosystem so like early commit committed to the optimism uh ecosystems earlier than anyone else that i can remember deployed on optimism you guys were on their test net uh and now optimism you know the tokens out there synthetics is fully like i don't know fully fledged on optimism but definitely lively pretty much pretty much as of like yep today you know ssd is now fungible across you know and transferable across networks so pretty much it's done beautiful yeah and and now like the the synthetics fees are like bigger than bitcoins on like on on a daily basis it's usually bigger than bitcoin which is awkward for the bitcoin max because that's a difference yeah so would you say that you feel vindicated uh by this the strategy the scaling strategy that you like put into motion years ago i look i do i think there are things that uh i'm happy with and there are things that i'm probably less happy with um i do feel like uh we were kind of forced into that uh move by the fact that synthetics being very complex was very expensive and we had pressure from users super early on you know a unisop trade might have been like a dollar fifty or whatever in like the you know uh single digit way days right we were like 15 so we were always kind of like an order of magnitude more expensive than like any transfer or unisop transfer or whatever we just weren't very gas efficient and i think that just meant that it forced our hand to react sooner um and then once we saw the uni-pig demo um that was like it for us right we were like okay you know we were kind of sitting around like this is the thing we need to do this this is what we've been waiting for we thought that scaling was going to happen you know through eth2 right you know vitalik promised me back in cancun it was coming in a few months here you know a a long time ago um and so i think everyone was kind of uh stuck in this mindset of like let's just wait for e2 to come and solve these problems right um and then we just were like no no this is we need to do this um that said while it was the right decision i think the amount of time that it took and you know everyone's always too optimistic no pun intended about these things um and i think we could have done better both as the synthetics community and even as like the the kind of deep ethereum community of supporting polygon i think we're a little bit too ideologically pure about that and we're like no it's a side chain like whatever um and now you know look at the investment they're putting into zero knowledge roll-ups and so there's things that we could have done better there's things that i'm happy we did um and you know but at the end of the day i think you just get you survive and you get to the point where you now have done the thing that you wanted to do and you build from there and that's where we are so one of the interesting parts of the interesting stories of the 2021 bull market was that uh the twitter fight between you and suzu yeah he he was like making fun of you for like uh selling synthetics but i don't think that was totally true and then you were making fun of him for whatever reasons uh basically it was just like crypto twitter ogs like going after each other yeah uh and then and then we find out later that three hours capital is basically borrowed all their money and then leveraged long and then and then went to zero after having that fight with suzu how how do you feel now look you know i try not to dance on people's graves because you never know when you're gonna be the one who's in the grave right so um you know i really haven't spoken about it publicly too much um i think you know i go back to that tweet um that's kind of started all of it right which was not a subtweet of anyone in particular right it was a build up of frustration that i'd had where i felt like there were a lot of people who could have chosen to support ethereum ethereum did so well for them and they chose to go down this kind of dark path at least in my perspective right and you know i mean i was on uh the podcast with sbf right and and you know he has his own view of like no i'm gonna go do the thing that's gonna be you know uh the solution that i want right i'm gonna go and support the solution that i wanna see in the world okay cool but i think that some of the capital allocators just went down this dark path of of you know trying to chase gains as opposed to reinforcing this kind of nascent ecosystem in ethereum that still needed a lot of help we were not there yet right like we're still not there yet we still need everyone to kind of you know come and work together um and that tweet was about that it was like this ecosystem has given you so much and you kind of just turned around and went and supported you know other d5 ecosystems you know other l1 all of these alternative competitors or whatever purely driven by profit that's it because you could get a cheaper price in this feed round and you knew that it was gonna pump and you just let it happen right um and i think that that mindset and i i believe in markets i believe that speculation is a very powerful driver of behavior and so i'm not saying that people should not be driven by incentives and and that we should you know forego markets or something like that right but i think if you throw all of that out right and you don't have any kind of core ideological belief about what we're doing and how powerful this technology is and and you just lose sight of that you can go to a bad place right and we've seen that now play out you know there's a lot of people have been revealed to to be doing things that you know maybe we're not not ideal certainly yeah would you chalk it up to just like bull market goggles though somewhat um but but i think the underlying behavior of like just this kind of constant chasing and people uh you know i tweeted at one point like you know spf is way smarter than me right if that guy tells you to go and buy a token like you probably should right he'll say it's not financial advice but i'm saying it is right and like if he says look i think this thing is going to work right um who am i to say it's not going to right and so when i looked at you know something like solana um and like i talked to anatoly i'd like talk to you know people and i was like this is a potentially a genuine competitor right but i chose to not participate in those ecosystems because i was concerned that it would blind me because i'm human and i'm fallible and we all are and if you have a heavy bag of something confirmation bias is  dangerous right and it's so easy to be like oh that's okay it doesn't matter if you know the network switches off every couple of weeks like you know and you start to become an apologist and it just goes down this very dangerous path right and so i think that is ultimately what it what it came down to for me is that i was like ethereum is the ecosystem that allowed me to do what i have done um you know the idea that i would i would you know a bit even in the early days when it was really really hard to get cut through and you know maker was so dominant and you know haven struggled to kind of get mindshare or whatever and we did you know like flirt with this idea of multi-chain multichaining going to eos or whatever we ultimately looked at it on the merits and said this is not going to work and we shut it down before we even got there but you know we we learned that lesson pretty early on and from that point forward i think myself the synthetics community has just gone all in on ethereum and that's been the the strategy we've enacted okay so we're in we're in this bear market whether whether 1500 feels like a bear market too i'll let the listener decide yeah uh but we got we got the merge ahead of us merge soon um i don't really think we can count on the merge pulling the entire ecosystem out of a bear market the the theme we've been running with a bank list is it's not a bear market it's a build market but if we want to get out of the bear we have to build our way out of it yes so as an ecosystem what do we need to do in the next 18 months to have our next bull market so i think if you look back historically like what are the metrics right like what are the things that people measure um in the ico period it was capital raising right like there was a thing called token data it just tracked every you know ico every day to see who could raise the most money and that was the game that people were playing right and it was like how much money can you raise it like what ridiculous valuation or whatever people forget and like eos raised four billion dollars now whether you believe they did it or not sure when people in the last cycle were like we've gone crazy people are raising a four billion dollar valuation i would say i'm sorry but four billion dollar evaluation is not as insane as someone raising four billion dollars right right like telegram raised 2.2 billion it wasn't a 2.2 billion dollar valuation that was the capital that came in right so icos took the idea of like capital formation and just like blew it into insanity right and but we played the game and there was a you know scoreboard and everyone tracked it and you know i think haven came like 87th or something like that on the scoreboard that's pretty good yeah it was not too bad we were top 100 i think for for quite a while um you know and then we got a much better scoreboard still not a great one which was d5 pulse sure pre-defy summer we were like wait a second what is it the thing what's the heuristic that people are using to like figure this stuff out and it was who is putting money into these contracts that's the only like who's got skin in the game right if i'm putting money into a contract on some level that's a signal that i think you know contract good exactly right and so if enough people do then you get some kind of signal that it's it's valuable right and we all thought it out curve and uni swap and maker and us and you know rv and compound and you know the compound and ave really heavily boiled all right it was like fighting to the death right um but we had this game and we all played it and we were trying to like work out like how do you optimize for this thing right like how do you attract as much capital as possible and i think it pushed us forward but ultimately that was not sustainable what we've seen emerge now is crypto fees and i think in my mind crypto fees is the next scoreboard and the fact that there are multiple d5 protocols beating bitcoin is a very powerful meme right like basically if we like if we get to a point where the top 10 protocols in terms of like revenue generation whether they're distributing to token holders or not but who is paying to use the thing if all of those things are d5 protocols and ethereum that's a very powerful representation of what is actually going on here right um and so i do think that that is going to be the game that we play over the next six months and it's the closest thing to like fundamentals we've ever had certainly certainly i think uh there's this growing appetite of fixing defy tokens uh and i mean i think the actual recipe for that is relatively simple other than fixing governance which is very hard well we'll excuse that part for another podcast but just like growing fees and turning on the fee switch yep this is a bull market yeah yeah and you know like there are protocols out there who have been rightly subsidizing and and you know creating kind of uneconomic incentives right for people to use them for years now right um multiple protocols right um and not paying users what they potentially should have are not charging users and consumers of the protocol what they should be paying right and that's fine in an early stage right just like a startup you know you offer discounts or free things or referral bonuses or whatever you need to do to bootstrap growth and we've been doing that in the form of tokens in the form of no fees low fees whatever scheme you want to come up with but ultimately if we cannot get this ecosystem to a point where people are paying for the services that they consume and that the services are profitable in producing those services based on the fees that they're consuming then this is all nonsense right it has to be sustainable and i think if we can get that meme going to the point where we say okay we've gone up and down up and down and we finally come up again and we're coming up because we've got to sustainability where this ecosystem works people pay it's a you know it's a genuine functional system i think that is the type of thing that would attract the attention of people in the larger world that we've never you know we've attracted speculators i don't think we've attracted people who have fundamental evaluation methodologies i think we can definitely allude to the fact that ether the asset has attracted those types of people for sure because of the fees for sure and so we can probably extend that same idea if you go further down and you're like wait there's you know let's call it 10 protocols right they're all charging fees the fees are being paid to the people who are producing the service and the users are paying the right amount of money to use the service that would be an amazing place for us to get to we're not there yet but it feels like it's that goal is inside well kane i can promise you that i'm going to steal everything that you just said and turn into an article amazing i love it cool because yeah i haven't been uh producing as many articles as i would like although we didn't get into governance and i'm writing something on governance right now because i think the state of governance is something we need to fix in this bear market wait i'm also writing a piece on government okay well we'll you'll probably beat me too yeah we're gonna get there first we'll absolutely get there first i'm not the fastest writer these days but i'll do my best awesome kane thank you for joining me at pcc yeah thank you so much [Music]
