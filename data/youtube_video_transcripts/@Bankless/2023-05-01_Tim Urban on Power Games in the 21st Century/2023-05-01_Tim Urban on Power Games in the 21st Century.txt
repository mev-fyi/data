we are a survival species we are a bunch of survivors and that doesn't mean that it hasn't been horrible tragedies and genocides and awful things in the past and it also we have never faced full kinds of existential threat but I do think that Humanity has a knack for surviving and that if we get scared enough I think maybe reason we'll Prevail out of pure fear and out of pure Survivor instinct welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless Society is off track we all feel it what's wrong how do we fix it without throwing out all the good parts we have Tim Urban on the podcast today who wrote an excellent book subtitled a self-help guide on how to solve society's problems we're going to talk about a few of those problems today and uh Tim's answer on how to solve them number one we talk about the power games versus the liberal games that's one takeaway from today's episode number two we talk about the importance of liberalism to crypto protocols number three we talk about how to find out whether your crypto tribe is a low rung Echo chamber or a high mind idea lab hint you want the second number four we talk about why we must actually solve this problem in order to survive as a society and you know I asked them if AI is going to come kill us towards the end because that's the new thing that I always ask apparently we do that now we do that now ever since that episode that shall not be named David uh from your perspective why is this episode with Tim Urban so significant and just to make it abundantly clear and Tim will also do this liberalism not liberals versus conservative conservatives liberalism as classic liberal Western values the thing that you've heard me and Ryan talk about on the podcasts uh here and there through and through but consistently from day one Western Democratic liberal values uh we are starting this podcast exploring that idea head on and why if we are talking about the the layer zero of society the layer zero of our governing systems of our blockchains why they must be rooted in critical thinking and what Tim calls idea Labs instead of echo Chambers and so this episode is really how to fix Society at the root level uh and also talking about all the symptoms in which society is going astray and I think really the important thing the and really the the through line of this episode is there are problems in society that are clashing you got the left and the right and they're fighting you got you know political tribe one political tribe two and they're fighting and in the crypto world you have all these other tribes and they're also fighting and the thing is they're all playing the same strategy They're all playing the same game they're competing inside of the same Arena using the same tool sets to compete and sometimes this competition is good sometimes if this uh competition this competition can be productive and Progressive and two high-rung people of different tribes can come in debate and move Society forward or two low rung thinkers can come together and clash and move Society backwards and so whether or whether we're discussing this outside of the sphere of crypto or inside of this fear of crypto it's still the same game and so hopefully we can guide you through how these parallels exist no matter where we are and why solving this problem at the root level can create a Utopia FRS as soon as we do figure out how to solve that problem yeah and I really think these lowercase L liberal values are at the core of crypto crypto is almost an instantiation of these values in the digital world and so David I'm super excited to talk to you about that in the debrief episode which is our episode that we record right after the episode it is included for all bankless citizens so if

introduce our next guest Tim Urban is a blogger he's a writer he's an illustrator extraordinaire a most famous for his weight but why blog which is a fantastic blog he started back in 2013 covers a range of topics almost as diverse well probably more diverse than bankless actually uh from AI to political philosophy to like whatever Tim is interested in science technology human behavior and he recently wrote this book that we want the bankless community to learn a little bit about it's called what's our problem a self-help book for societies this is a fantastic book that Dave and I read recently and I think provides a road map an interesting set of Parallels for the crypto Community as well Tim welcome to bankless how you doing I'm doing pretty well thank you for having me it's great to have you so I I just want to kick off and start with this question which is a common observation I think everyone sort of sees whether like wherever you are in the United States whatever country you live it seems like everybody is mad at each other all of the time Tim and I want to ask you why why does it why does it seem like everyone is always angry these days well um one reason is that people are more angry at each other than they used to be for lots of reasons we could discuss social media tribal Media stuff like that but I think an even bigger reason is that the anger that there is is loud the hand prominent and broadcast over lots of channels and we we are in contact with that anger all the time which makes it feel like there's even more of it than there is people who aren't angry with each other um are not often screaming it from the hilltops about how not angry they are uh while people who are are gonna much more likely to do that so I think it's a combo of those two things Tim we want to explore in this podcast uh a concept that we have talked about on Bank lists a number of times but not yet actually dove into head first uh and that is the topic of uh liberalism uh and I think uh understanding liberalism will be able to uh create a stack of understanding a stack of knowledge that will actually get back to that original question why can't we talk to each other anymore and we've we've talked about liberalism and Western liberal values on the podcast but we've never actually taken the time to um approach that subject head-on so I'm wondering if you can help guide us through that conversation uh and start starting there because we've never we've never actually defined liberalism this podcast so maybe we can start there and we'll build back up to talk about some of these uh the web the way that social media influences our our thinking and our mental models for things but I want to start start at the very deep down of how humans created um this Foundation that we have for ourselves called called liberalism so first if you could help us to find what is liberalism and why why is it good if we could start there if you don't mind yeah well so first of all this is lowercase L liberalism which is different than how it's used in the US which means which means you know politically left um that's not what I'm talking about here um and that's why I don't like that we use that term it's such a important important term of its own um um so lowercase L liberalism is it's it's you know it wasn't invented by the US in the 1700s it was you know it it the principles from it go back to the uh the ancient Greeks and um uh and lots of different places and and Societies in between have grappled with the concepts within it but the modern liberal democracies have kind of taken the latest crack yet at this concept and what it is is that you know if you think about there's a spectrum of um you know how people can be governed just uh you know uh with freedom As the metric on on one side if everyone has total freedom right there's no rules that's you know Anarchy um and on the total other end you have totalitarian dictatorship um where there's no Freedom at all and there's no individual rights at all you know whatever the dictator says is what happens and that's what you're limited to and the dictator dies and his son takes over now that Sun's rules that's the new rules and that's what everyone will be living under um now Anarchy often turns into the other side of the spectrum because then that you know you then you have Warlords and you know people who are the scariest on their block kind of are suddenly writing rules and then the scariest among the scariest kind of take over and there's a gang that kind of takes control of everything and now you have a dictatorship right so we have a lot of human history that's kind of um going back and forth between chaos and then order but you know the order can be very uh you know oppressive and um and and and what what what is lost in both cases is kind of um Freedom um Freedom you know freedom and Security in that freedom so liberalism is kind of a compromise um between rules and individual rights individual freedom it's a freedom it's not it's not it's not uh complete Freedom um There Are Rules there are laws if you violate them you can end up in jail forever um and so uh they're a very hard serious rules but they're Broad and wide and they basically create a big wide fence around an area or I like to think of it as a big house and the walls of the house they are rules and they are rules that you can't break you can't murder someone you can't steal um Etc but um but within the house within those big broad walls pretty much be left on left to your own and then so so the idea is that there are it's that you know this is emerges from philosophers like John Locke who said I actually don't think that the state of nature um that human nature is necessarily like so chaotic that it needs hardcore rules I think actually if you just build some basic rules and keep people keep the you know the most aggressive Among Us from kind of bullying conquering everything actually things can work pretty much okay on their own and so um so you have for example instead of saying um instead of saying we have um we're going to enforce equality of outcome right which is you know someone might say that someone might say that that's equality but it's it's such uh it's such totalitarian version of equality that you end up with very little freedom and uh and so that that would be that you know whatever you're doing you're gonna end up with the same so liberalism says let's go for equality of opportunity so we want to try to do what we can to level the playing field or at least you know allow for Upward mobility and things like that but beyond that kind of you're on your own you know that's why even the Constitution says the pursuit of happiness um in liberalism you know you're not entitled to happiness you're entitled but Everyone's entitled to pursue it and to to try to go for it you know and so this is where free markets emerge from right you have um instead of uh you have you have the idea of free markets but they are there are regulations right you still can't uh you can't commit fraud and you can't um steal and you can't um have you know monopolies that okay so there are rules again these wide walls but beyond that go to town build the products you want as long as they pass the basic tests you can you can you know let let the people guide their own path and you can say the same with ideas rather than a guiding scripture or guiding you know you know the Bible or some other guiding thing that's going to be these this is the way of the land this is how what we believe here it says that we we want a free Marketplace of ideas so you can't you know yeah you can't uh you know some speech you can't have perjury you can't do libel you can't you know incite violence again you have these broad rules but beyond that um freedom of religion freedom of speech so it's this it's this very kind of nuanced concept um and it it really values the individual and it says basically the government is there to serve the individuals to keep to to have a monopoly on violence but it can only be used to kind of keep these broad rules in place and um and that beyond that the individuals will run the show and they will vote for who they want and they will start the businesses they want and they will promote the ideas and start the movements they want and let the people kind of guide their own path that's the core idea and it seems kind of I bet what a lot of Americans are people in Western democracies might be saying you know yeah duh right this is just that's how things are but that's not it's actually interesting because it's not that's not um an obvious thing that that's something that is an artificial invention we made that up that's not the it's very different than the than kind of the the you know the Natural Way um which is the most powerful people make the rules for everyone else this is a very specific kind of pretty complex and nuanced um form of government that we have developed pretty recently and we're all living inside this house that is not a house that used to exist and it's been built by humans and it doesn't stand up by its own you know it stands up if it's just the who the people who are actually in the country are the ones who are defending those basic principles and who are enforcing the rules and um and so um yeah it's it's it's something that um we are we're all we grew up in we think where we think is normal but it's actually not it's pretty awesome I think it reminds me Tim of another topic we explore a lot on uh encrypta which is the the topic of money which is a social coordination technology that almost no one thinks about we just sort of take for granted oh yeah it's but like when you think about it when you stop and you think about it too long you're like wait this who invented money what exit and wait you have this like this point system that you use to allocate labor and resources and figure out who can buy what in society and everyone just believes in it and so it kind of works and you're like yeah that's how that's what it is and that like no one ever actually thinks about it and I feel the same way about about liberalism when you when you pause and you think about it it reminds me of the book from Yuval Harare which we quote so often on on Bank list a book called sapiens where he talks about Humanity's great superpower is these shared myths that we can Pro that we propagate basically and liberalism is this great shared myth and I want to contrast it with something that you were saying towards the end which is um you call it in your book uh the liberal games right which is uh in contrast to the power games and I think you're alluding to to something here Tim which is like the state of nature this is a John uh law concept as well is very much like power games like in nature violence as the settlement layer for getting things done and that's the way it has been that's the way kind of the state of nature is and liberalism is almost this um this veneer that we put over top of it so here's this graphic and by the way you're your book Tim goes through all of these fantastic Graphics that just help um really sink mental model type Concepts but you have two circles here you have the liberal games and we've got liberal laws and liberal Norms on the top and that is an overcoating of on top of this other deeper in the stack system called the power games can you tell us about the power games versus the liberal games and what you're trying to get across here yeah so I mean the power games is pretty straightforward right it's the it's it's it's the rule in nature you know if you go watch uh David Attenborough special there's no uh laws there's nothing fair about nature it is a very simple rule everyone can do whatever they want if they have the power to do so so if a bear wants to eat a bunny uh the bear can uh can do that if he can catch the bunny if he has the power to catch the bunny he can eat the bunny doesn't matter if the bunny has a family if the bunny had other plans does it's irrelevant because the bear had the power to catch him end of story if the bunny and all the other bunnies uh have are too fast they have the power to get away they can and the bear might starve to death and that's just how that goes right and so that's that's the law of Nature and the power games it's Whoever has the power to do what they want can do what they want and everyone else is kind of you know they're screwed that's also been lots of human societies um that those who have power usually violence um or maybe they have you know the power of um of that you know everyone believes they have a direct line to God so whatever they say goes they found a different way to have power because everyone's scared of the going to hell um whatever it is if you find a way to have have the power to do what you want you get to do what you want and if you don't have power um you better hope that the people who do are nice and Believe In fairness because if they don't you're screwed and they can go and they can take your wife and say that's my wife now and I kidnap your you know and make your you know take your children and say they're slaves now I mean and that's the most unfair thing we can imagine because we grew up in a place where fairness matters right individual rights are sacred doesn't matter who you are or who you were born to or your age or your gender or your race you have rights um that's at least the principle here it's not always been kept perfectly but it's the thing we believe we believe is right but that's not real I mean out in the in in outside of this house that we live in where things are things are supposed to be fair um there is no such thing as fairness right it's just unfairness happens constantly so the reason I have it as a two-part puzzle is because you've got liberal laws right so that is you know the Constitution and the the kind of pretty complex set of laws that we have here and so that is one piece of the puzzle but the thing is the thing is interesting about if you have a totalitarian dictatorship you can have you know if you're in Hitler's Germany you don't really need you know you just need the very intense set of rules and laws dictated by the the fuhrer and the military is going to enforce them and the police and um and that that's really what you need you can just use the Iron Fist but if you're going liberalism doesn't have an iron fist that's a very light Touch fist and it has again it's very broad walls and actually uh it's it's not you can totally violate the liberal games and start playing the power games inside of the house if people will let you so you can you know I call that legal cheating when you're kind of um when when uh uh you know or to put it this way like you you the the laws are Go part of the way and then these Norms go the rest of the way you know Norms in government about how government you know uh this kind of unspoken rules about how government functions and you know Thomas Jefferson has a quote where he says something like you know more important than the than than every single specific rule is followed to the T in Senate is that there's a Unwritten rules and understanding between people about how things are supposed to go the Norms um and so when you see you know like something's endlessly filibustering you know it's like yes that's legal but it's also um I call it legal cheating because it's kind of actually breaking the um breaking the kind of uh Unwritten handshake that that you're supposed to Liberal democracy yeah the basic social contract um and you can you know you can you can see that a lot if you notice like um the times when things aren't going very well in Liberal democracy it's often because they had they do have a soft spot where uh you know people who want to break the Norms they can get away with it you know it can kind of if you if you try to play the power games in a liberal democracy you can often get away with a lot unless the the place is functioning well in which case the people in it are supposed to stand up for the liberal uh liberal norms and actually uh say no that's not how we do things here and push back on it So when you say the the uh these liberal laws these liberal values are light touch what that means I think is for all these people who live in this house have a lot of flexibility and that's the beauty of these this liberal code base that we have in this modern world is that these things aren't are these are things are supposed to enforce themselves because the society that operates on top of them understand them to be good which leaves a lot of Tolerance a lot of flexibility a lot of Freedom by nature of what these laws are for people to walk around this house and in good times that just works because the social contract manifests and but what you're saying is that there's also the bad scenario here which is that since there's tolerance since there's flexibility here people can start to violate the social contract and uh and start to live a life in ways that are just uh misaligned with the purpose of of a liberal Foundation is that is that a way to interpret this yes yeah so so yeah so here's here's one example right so here's a liberal law is the First Amendment right the First Amendment says amongst other things it says the you know Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech in other words the government cannot put you in jail for saying the wrong thing including criticism of the government or criticism of anyone else or you know screaming out racial slurs on the street corner you know what then it's it's ugly but it's legal um but to actually have free speech to have an open and thriving Marketplace of ideas which is the point which right which is the you need more than just that so you need that of course if you don't have the First Amendment forget about it and the countries that don't have a good you know equivalent of the First Amendment obviously there's a lot of things that will get you and you know the government will arrest you for saying but to have true freedom of speech you also need that liberal Norms puzzle piece and what is that which is the culture of freedom of speech the culture of of that free speech is something that we value here so an example could be if there's a movement that says we're not going to we're going to any time there's a a debate or a talk or some kind of event where a certain set of ideas that we don't like are being said we're going to show up and we're going to shout as loud as we can until and drown out the ideas uh or we're actually going to kind of block the doorway we're going to make it very scary to enter the event and very difficult and then we're going to scream the whole time in the in the Event Hall so that no one can hear right that's legal right you are not going to go to jail for that um it is legal you know to scream at the top of your lungs during kind of an outdoor event just say but it is total violation of liberal Norms right so it is um it is what I would call legal legal cheating instead of what you're supposed to do in the liberal games is say I don't like those ideas I think they're bad I think they're dangerous so I am going to held my own event or I'm going to try to debate that person I'm gonna hold my own event I'm gonna write my own op-ed uh explaining why those ideas are so bad point by point and I'm going to persuade people I'm going to persuade people that they're wrong and I'm right and I'm going to create a movement that is so powerful and so persuasive that that person won't have no one will even want to show up to their talks anymore or might weigh fewer and they won't have much power because no one will believe them anymore because I've exposed them or or you know what I hate those ideas I'm just going to check out I'm not going to go to that talk I'm not going to go to that event I just want to even hear it okay that's all fine um that's what the persuasion it's a battle of persuasion in the power games what you would say is um well I don't know if I can win the Battle of persuasion so instead I'll go there much kind of easier thing which is I will use I'll scream Brute Force to make sure no one can hear the ideas I will shut down that idea from ever being said so rather than try to persuade people it's wrong I will make sure no one even hears that idea in the first place it's a it's total power games mentality but as long as you're not you know actually physically hurting them the law is not can't do anything it's like in a totalitarian dictatorship that valued Free Speech they might actually say anyone who shouts down speakers is going to be arrested but we can't do that here we have too much Freedom here for that the government is not actually powerful enough to even step in they're not allowed to step in that is amongst us to work out so the way that we would have to you know the the way that Free Speech would Prosper is that people who do that would be socially shunned and socially criticized and people would say you know you're a bully and you know we're you know and and you know we don't want to be friends with more because you're the kind of person that screams and shouts down talks and we're gonna mock you and we can you know that is the that is the country standing up for itself saying no that's not how we do things here and you need that or else it'll be the people who shout the loudest you know get to determine what's being said none of this violates the law the legal piece is still fine the First Amendment hasn't ever been violated here but free speech has been totally curtailed and so there's a lot of examples like this where there always will be groups that are trying to within the logs no one wants to get arrested right and that's a huge deterrent within the law violate the liberal Norm parts of it things in order to kind of use play the power games and and coerce their way instead of put persuade use coercion to get what they want and the the that sign of a healthy liberal democracy isn't that those people don't exist because they will always exist the sign of a healthy liberal democracy is that that that when that happens the immune system kind of the liberal immune system kicks in and and people roundly criticize them and make it unpop so unpopular to do that that you know you social pressure to make it stop and when I think when we see groups that are using coercion and kind of power games tactics to get what they want and it's working that's a sign that something's something's not right I think your point here Tim is that the protection for the first amendment is not just in the Constitution it's not in our set of laws like that's part of it but that's only like half of it or one portion of it the other portion is actual the actual social enforcement of that value that Norm enforcement it's interesting because we see the same thing with crypto right so take something like Bitcoin we have a 21 million hard cap in the total amount of Bitcoin Supply that is written in sort of the Constitution and the code of Bitcoin right and but in order for that to be maintained the community the social norms actually have to value that because if the entire Community decides to run a different set of code right that doesn't value the 21 million that maybe puts in a one percent per year inflation rate and they choose to kind of fork they choose to devalue 21 million hardcap as their priority they can totally do it which is which is so funny because there is this this myth in crypto that like uh you know hard caps and immutability is 100 maintained by code and that's not true in the same way the First Amendment isn't 100 maintained by the Constitution okay it's maintained by the Constitution plus the social contract and Norms that actually carry out and enforce it it's the parallels here are are quite striking I want to make another Point here uh too Tim because this is a um another image like another uh illustration that that you put in your book um which is this idea of different levels um of I guess civilization maybe you call this or human coordination on what you call this pyramid but at the bottom we have level one which is modernity science reason objective truth that is the definition of modernity we have level level two which is what we've been talking about which is liberalism that is the next uh Stack Up free markets Free Speech individualism quality of opportunity and then we have level three which is where all of the other things are kind of built on top of liberalism which is built on modernity and level three is norms and policies and laws and institutions I guess a few things that are striking I want you to maybe explain this to us uh in a little bit more detail like why why does liberalism sit on top of modernity and why do the norms and policies and laws sit on top of liberalism but one broad point I want to make is like this is relatively new social software that humans are running like for most of human existence and you have this really cool chart at the beginning of of your book that shows like like of the 200 000 years of human existence we are just in like just like the final we're in in sort of the late stages Liberty hasn't been around for very long at all and this is completely new software on the human time scale that we're running modernity even liberalism and and institutions and laws and policies and Norms around that so this is relatively new social software but explain this pyramid to us what is the idea that you're trying to convey foreign yeah um I think it's useful to help understand um the difference between different political movements um and because right now we have this kind of constrained um you know we have these terms you know something can be left or far left or it can be far right or whatever and um I think we you know we can we can Define that a little better and so um so yeah so so first of all modernity yeah that is something that is new people forget that in the scheme of things it's a few hundred years old this concept that science that that there is an object there exists one objective truth and that's science and reason are methods that we can use to discover it and to get closer to understanding what it is um before in the pre-modern era um there were you know the different religions each with their own kind of there were different denominations of Truth so each religion would have their sacred scripture and that was truth and uh that you know and and what was so cool about um this idea of objective truth in science um is that it was that that no matter who you were no matter what religion you believed in no matter where you lived in the world or what language you spoke you could all contribute to the global project of you know using science and building science to um collaborate across generations and across countries uh to just to work together towards discovering an objective truth that's something we take for granted today but that's pretty that's a pretty new thing and of course that um that notion and the spread of it was is what why we can do to thank our you know thank that for all what we know now about medicine about you know um the the about space and about uh you know uh plate tectonics and just everything we've learned um that that really has come from this Global project that was born in you know modernity most of you know that's what accelerated this process um but anyway uh so there are movements right so we talked about the liberal house and within that house um in a place like the US you've got people on the left the right and the center right and you've got uh and so these are all people by being in the house what I mean by that is that they all like liberalism they all like the liberal house um they think the Constitution is good uh it's that the progressives in the house the people on the left are more likely to look at The house's flaws and say well what's where are we not keeping our promises uh our liberal promises in the Constitution so Martin Luther King for example he talked about um you know that the constitution is supposed to be a promissory note but that the country has written black Americans a bad check um um and that uh and that so basically he was saying the problem isn't liberalism the problem is that that black Americans haven't been uh receiving the full benefits of liberalism the liberal house that's a that's a a flaw in the liberal house right it's a glitch in the software it needs to be repaired we need to fix it that's where the Civil Rights Movement was about let's let's expose this through Civil Disobedience and and through persuasion let's expose this flaw that this way that we are violating our own Constitution and let's fix it right the goal was more liberalism meanwhile you also have you know conservatives in the house and they're more likely rather than look at the ways the houses flawed to look at the ways that it's good and that the ways that Progressive ideas and Progressive ideas for change are might erode the support beams in the house so their goal is to stand up for the kind of in a lot of cases the status quo or even how things used to be and say inevitably some things are eroding in the house uh and they're that's what they look for um where where are our Val you know where do we not have the right values that we used to have and and um but they also there's they have the same goal the Constitution should be upheld and that the liberal house is good right and people in the center are going to have you know a little bit of both are going to be more moderate all of those people are pro house okay and that's an important thing to it's an important thing to distinguish now there are also movements right now that are outside the house with wrecking balls these are movements who believe they're much more revolutionary um so what people call wokeness right I call it social justice fundamentalism which is fundamentally different than liberal social justice which is the Martin Luther King style that I just described social justice fundamentalism is my term for you know my you know less kind of cultural culture War baggage Laden term than wokeness um but what there but it is fundamentally different in that it's outside the house with a wrecking ball and it's it's it's it stems from and this is by the way all Marxist and and neo-marxist and all of its descendants you know all these movements they have what they have in common is they say no no everyone in the house you're missing the big point the house itself is rotten to the core liberalism is bad it's a it's something that sounds good but it's just the power games in Disguise it never inevitably entrenches the power of the powerful uh and and and entrenches the oppression of the oppression and and this what you supposedly call free markets is actually you know this exploitative system to oppress um to keep people oppressed people down right and keeping and inevitably Fosters inequality blah blah blah right so that that's again it's I don't happen to agree with that but it's a totally valid philosophical point and so if I believe that I would be out there with them with the Wrecking Ball it's not that they're bad it's that they believe that we are you know in the house are missing the big Point here zoom out and see that the house is bad and we need to get rid of it and so if you know if uh that a lot of the actual Scholars of social justice fundamentalism they say stuff like you cannot dismantle so a we want to dismantle what they would call the Masters house right they believe that it is you know uh the Master's house and like you know to use a slave term and they say you cannot just dis dismantle it with the Master's tools so that's specific that means not only do we not like liberalism but we also don't like the the tools that liberalism values Free Speech all of that we don't like that so that's is why they would say that you can't just use free speech and you know free markets to defeat to actually dismantle this house you need to shut down free speech so there's this mentality that my opponent's speech is actually dangerous and needs to be de-platformed right so instead of persuasion we're going to actually use coercion to try to de-platform which again if I hated the liberal house and thought it was bad I also would say screw the tools of it I don't believe in liberalism or the liberal tools and you'll see less emphasis on individuality there you'll see much more things like uh you know you'll see the you know kind of treating groups as monolithic groups so you have like the black community is a term right which is not a term that would be used in the liberal house so much because it's that kind of diminishes the individual uh in favor of these big kind of Monolithic groups and that's so that's very Marxist these big monolithic groups of the oppressed and the powerful in the U.S social justice fundamentalism is a brand of that that uses um that would use um uh race and gender and things like that as opposed to like the working class and the um you know the ruling class but it's the same concept it's out outside the house with a wrecking ball so they it's more revolutionary and it wants to not just if the first group in the house liberals left right and Center they say level one and two of this pyramid they're great we want more of them but we need to use we need to change the Norman's policies laws institutions we need to they're arguing about level three what what do we what can we do on level three to to better uphold levels one and two Marxist ideologies like social justice fundamentalism they say no no we need to go and actually overhaul level two also but the thing about social justice fundamentalism that's different from a lot of other Marxist ideologies they go a step further because most marxists actually would still say level one is good they actually they believe in science and objective truth they just think that liberalism is the as a as a misguided system of government social justice fundamentalism merges uh you kind of in the neo-marxist mentality with um post-modernism so post-modernism is a you know set of philosophies uh that emerged in this you know 60s 70s and 80s a lot of them in Europe and France and came over to the U.S and this is you know this goes a step further and says actually even what we're calling modernity you know science and objective truth all of that is actually just a meta-narrative and it's a meta-narrative through which oppression flows and that actually we need to up they actually would say we need to reject that too we need to reject this concept so you'll often hear kind of in you know woke Scholars and they'll say stuff like there is no such thing as an objective truth they say stuff like my truth right you're and that lived experience is the only way to understand um certain truths and it almost goes back to the concept of different denominations of truth from the past is that you know uh Black Americans are women or lgbtq people um they have a lens they actually have access to different denominations of truth that other people can't see right this is a very post-modern and actually a very pre-modern concept so it's an it's an explicit rejection of this idea of modernity and so social justice fundamentalism combines this post-modern this Marxist ideology that wants to get rid of level two with the postmodern ideology which actually wants to go a step further and get rid of level one as well full overhaul of the pyramid so when I when you think of what's you know what's the definition of radical to me the more radical the more revolutionary the deeper in this pyramid you want to your progressivism goes so a liberal Progressive is is Progressive about level up level three they want to change stuff on level three but they become very conservative about levels one and two a Marxist is Progressive about levels three and two right they want to overhaul both but they they're conservative about level one and then social justice fundamentalism uh wants to actually they're they're Progressive about all three levels and so the more the deeper you wanted your progressivism goes before it hits a wall of conservatism that's the more radical I think it's a great metric for how Radical Something can be so I just think it's a useful once I started thinking it this way I just clarified a lot and again none of this I happen to disagree with social justice fundamentalism and Marxism but that none of this is to insult those things I think it's I think a lot of people who believe those things would look at this and agree with me that yes they do want to overhaul levels level two or maybe even level one and I just think it'd help us it can help us understand what we're even arguing about and I think one of the issues is that right now it's confusing and a lot of people who are very much liberal social justice you know Martin Luther King style people who value liberalism they think that wokeness is part of their kind of tribe they think that it's maybe very extreme you know but it's that it's it's still kind of fighting for the same thing but it's actually it's it's fundamentally the opposite instead of being pro house it's empty house right that's as big a difference as you can get and so I think people who are pro house actually should reject uh the wokeness and its ideology um and people who are who who believe in that they should they should agree that they're empty house or else they're actually kind of they're they're in the wrong place I think that's why this was so useful to me Tim is it it helped me kind of map because like I think uh most people uh that you talk to just on the street will sort of agree with the title of your book like there is a problem with Society I think we all kind of feel that right and you know this uh stacking of levels indicates like how deep you want to go in the stack or you think we need to go in the stack in order to like fix the problems of society and uh you can map this onto kind of the the different social political movements as you just did right I also kind of mapped this onto crypto and you know some people talk about crypto being sort of a a revolution and being kind of a radical movement it's actually not that radical if you look at it from the stack model because crypto is very much on the stack sits above the stack of liberalism it is a level three sort of social technology in that crypto we we look at this free markets it's crypto free market definitely that's the thing it is a free market right Free Speech censorship resistance okay that is liberalism individualism property rights digital property rights that's individualism a quality of opportunity if you pay the fee to get your block across and and transacted in the network it gets across doesn't matter who you are it doesn't care about race gender geography you just have to have an internet connection so it has some equality of opportunity here where it really seeks to kind of shake up the world is the top level level three institutions and and laws right crypto crypto has some critiques with you know how central banks and banks are kind of managed in gen General thinks we can have a better liberal digital property right system so it was even useful for me to kind of map that that model of the world onto crypto and sort of see things differently uh so thank you for this it's really interesting yeah no I mean it's a great way to and that's it's a great way to put it is that you know crypto is um it's it's trying to it's only trying to revolutionize level three it actually it it if anything it's it it deeply is it's deeply liberal right it it is um it is something that I bet you know I I bet often the people who are super into crypto are also very passionate lowercase L liberals um and if anything it's kind of like one of the best expressions of lowercase L liberalism um this concept of you know it's it's it's trying to uh it's it's it's a very kind of pure form of those ideals I think it is and that's what that's why we wanted to do this podcast so much Tim is because because I feel like we haven't talked enough as a as a crypto Community about the values that actually undergird the system and in many ways like the crypto movement is much less radical than some of the other social political movements going on in the space because what we're just trying to say is we're trying to take these liberal values and instantiate that in the digital and I actually think that the nation-state Constitutional apparatus hasn't done that quite effectively like we have these analog types of Rights but how do you actually own unconfiscatable property in the digital world on the internet right well like I don't know does Facebook does Twitter sort of own my feed like am I just a surf on their feudal lands or can I actually own something and crypto provides almost like a to us anyway a liberal alternative for digital rights and digital property is very much aligned that's why we wanted to go deeper in this cut and why your mental models were so helpful for me when I kind of went through them is because I'm taking this and I'm like applying it to this new frontier into the digital and uh you know when you stack it up like the crypto movement isn't actually that radical it's just taking like 1700s constitutional type ideas and extrapolating that forward into the into the digital before we move too far forward into this conversation I want to make sure that we actually touch on some of the moments in crypto's recent cycle where it actually got pretty damn radical uh and it with that that pyramid Ryan that you were just showing there were moments in like a Tim you I I think the frequent conversation Foundation that you have on non-crypto podcasts are going to be things that are about uh like the woke left versus the extreme right and that's kind of just like in the more mainstream uh understanding for how to to interpret this conversation uh and in crypto we have we have different parties we have different factions and they appear very different the patterns are the same although they're the the the more larger mainstream gargantuan factions that exist in the web 2 world ours are much are um there's many more of them they're a lot smaller in the crypto world but they operate on the same code and they play with the same strategies and that's why this is so interesting is is when we got into the height of the 2021 bull market there was this one tribe you call it call it the um the Frog Army there's also the terra lunex terra lunatics with the Terra Luna blockchain and Ryan and I actually got into fights with these people with these monolithic like entities and they actually started to transcend down that stack further than just the top of the pyramid most of crypto agrees with a whole like liberal uh freedom of speech all that kind of stuff that that you and Ryan were talking about but there were these some tribes that played uh the power games the that operated outside of the rules of the house and they would come into our YouTube chats when we were live streaming and just absolutely span the chat against any silencing all forms of dissent and they would just make sure that anyone that had any dissenting opinion didn't have a platform to stand on and so we're watching some of these power strategies operate both like outside of the crypto world and also inside of the crypto world as well and it's just interesting to see these these different tribes these different communities no matter where they exist be it inside of crypto or outside of crypto kind of play by the same Playbook no matter what uh and the Playbook is is so elegantly like documented in your book uh and so the this pyramid I think is and and just to really answer the question to the bankless listeners like why why are these people talking about this liberalism concept on a crypto podcast is the answer is because like some parts of these crypto tribes all we all want to re-architect society because we think that the institutions are failing us some crypto tribes want to go real deep most crypto tribes only want to stay at the surface uh and I think this is really the important point that bankless listeners should really pay attention to is that we all want to re-architect society moving forward with different institutions and the level at which your tribe in particular whichever one you identify with injects itself into that pyramid that we were just looking at is really important to understand and so uh uh Tim I just wanted to kind of like leave that to you because go for it yeah yeah it just because I think like it the pyramid is almost like the the biggest Point here and so if there are people who are both kind of I don't know really gung-ho about crypto but one of them wants to use crypto to overhaul level two or to violate level two and someone else is passionately wants to preserve and enhance level two it's important to realize that you the person you know the the the the the the the liberal who wants to use crypto to make things more liberal has a lot more in common and a lot more common goals with people who hate crypto but they're passionate liberals then people who also their fellow crypto people who specifically want to use crypto to undermine level two because it's like think of backup zoom out what's this all for right what are we all actually doing here crypto is an end in itself it's a means for a lot of different things and and so if if you're you know if one of the main reasons that you like crypto is because you think it makes Mark you know enhances free markets and individualism and freedom and and it actually is um it makes it it's the best version of the house and and someone else is out there with a wrecking ball you know he's saying we can use crypto to knock down their house you guys are there's nothing to do with each other right you have nothing you're much more you know that that is you you're you have to push back against that a lot more than you have to push back against fellow liberals who think crypto is bad right I mean it's just because that's the bigger picture yeah that's exactly right Tim you know and I I want to maybe address um some people are kind of questioning this idea of lowercase out liberalism again could you steal man the argument though against liberalism so for instance this idea you sort of alluded to it briefly that liberalism is just another entrenched power structure right A lot of people right now are um looking at capitalism and you know just Millennials for example people kind of they can't afford a house the economy is not so good right now um it seems like wealth inequality has exacerbated to a degree that it's just like non-recoverable for younger generations and so they're seeing capitalism they're seeing the free markets that we're all talking about in crypto and liberal values and they're saying this is just another unequal power structure they see a quality of opportunity and um you know they view that as worse than kind of the idea of maybe equity and they see free speech and they look at that and they say well this just enables hate propaganda and they see these Concepts like individualism that a liberal holds a deer and they contrast that with like what about the power and and the value of the collective um are you sure that liberalism because this your book is is kind of like lays out the models but then I think the conclusion it also makes the case for why liberalism is really important for the United States in general and for for many countries but can you still man the argument against liberalism before we move on from this topic yeah I mean definitely um I don't think liberalism is perfect to just to to approach each thing you said here one by one like free speech I feel very strongly about that I'm very pro-liberal there I I think it's very it's it's pretty hard for me to steal man the case against it because the what people have to realize is that sure free speech allows bad ideas to be spoken right and sometimes to be to persuade people but the only alternative the only alternative to free speech is someone you know is is basically some ideas are not allowed to be said and some ideas are now who decides ask 10 Americans even 10 people around the world as 10 Americans what are the good ideas that should be spoken and which ideas are dangerous they're going to have 10 different answers so what ends up happening is the people with the most power the most cultural power or if it's if the First Amendment goes away the people with the biggest guns they get to decide what's true and what's good and everyone else has to kind of abide by that and that's just a it's not fair it's not right it's not free but B it's also not it's not wise it's um it's there's no humility there the premise is that I know I already know what the good and right ideas are so I know which ones should be silenced the people who said dangerous ideas shouldn't be platformed the Assumption there is that I already know everything I need to know I know what's so dangerous and I know it's not um but I would use the example of you know for interracial marriage 96 of people thought it was immoral in 1959 pretty recent 1959 four percent of people thought it was okay it was 96 of people weren't bad people right they weren't racist bad people it's that that's just what we all thought that's what almost everyone thought and almost everyone you know would have thought interracial marriage is not moral today the number is 94 are think it's fine and six percent think it's immoral right so that is the entire country has changed its mind but if you went back to 1959 and said you know what certain people we're going to let you decide we no dangerous ideas will be aired anymore you decide which ones almost everyone well one of the dangerous ideas on their list would have been interracial marriage is good so no one would have been able to speak that same with gay rights gay rights would have been a no-go in 1959 almost everyone would have said well that we definitely don't want to be spoken we don't want kids hearing about gay rights right that's that's sodomy it's whatever and today I think we're pretty happy that uh Free Speech prevailed because we were wrong and so the the the kind of underlying assumption from people today think you know free speech allows dangerous ideas to flourish is this idea that well all the people in the past they had bad ideas but today it's all clear we figured it out people in 50 years will not look back on us and say wow they were really morally wrong about a bunch of things or just in their knowledge was off but actually they'll say that no they had it right of course that's not true right so so free speech I I almost refused to still man the case against it because I just think that uh the only alternative is is is powerful people censoring everyone else um and of course usually with the powerful people end up deciding as offensive is uh any challenge to their own power any de criticism of themselves now the other things I think free markets capitalism there's a very strong steel man arguments against those of course I mean you know you could argue um that that you know unchecked capitalism is going to kill us all because it's going to lead to you know AI arms races and stuff like this right weapons arm racism um uh and of course it it it inevitably creates vast inequality which is almost always the sign of a crumbling Society is a inequality spikes uh goes to Crazy extremes and then the society crumbles so um I think unmoored capitalism is a very bad idea I think that these it should definitely come it should be a continually evolving dance between freedom and regulation um the free markets uh I think we already have a lot of that I don't think you know any any educated liberal knows that we don't have pure free markets and pure capitalism right we have a lot of rules against Monopoly and a lot of other things um so I think those rules are good and I totally agree that you know inequality to us to a a crazy extent is not good and that we should be doing things to try to curb this and you know within again as a liberal I I don't really think we should do too much I don't we we don't want to very quickly have a lose our ability to be productive and everything and also it's important to remember that the worst people the worst off people today the people who are in the bottom 20 um they are living way better than than the best buff people in the in the 1700s in a lot of ways at least with with their access to medicine and and food and shelter usually and they have heat in the winter you know most people even people in the US who are in the bottom 20 they have a lot of their basic needs met that's incredible Revolution and so and then the the median American is living like an absolute King compared to people of the past so I do think that's you know inherently again if you think about Alternatives if you say inequality at all is bad what you're also saying is that freedom is bad because inherently just different people have different talents different motivations even people who are equally talented equally motivated one wants to go into this profession which makes a certain kind of money and this one goes into a different one so inequality is inevitable if you have freedom at all right and and so I I think that it's hard to argue that we should have no inequality because then you end up with a totalitarian Communist dictatorship which I don't think is a good idea I think that's going to lead to mass poverty uh and you're going to crush our productivity and it's going to be unfair and you're going to end up in a bad situation but I um I definitely think that unchecked you know unchecked free markets and capitalism uh is is not the right way at all um and um so I I definitely feel like that's that's something and then and just in general the idea that like liberalism itself um um is I I I I would totally agree that uh I I would never say that liberalism is the end-all and be-all system I'm sure it can be improved upon I'm sure there are better systems I just can't think of any I can't I haven't seen any right if someone can come to me and say look at this Society in the past uh you know that thrive for a long time that was productive that was fair that had Equal justice before the you know the people were equal under the law and that that was that that the quality of life was better I'm all ears right I'm totally open to uh the fact that our current system is is definitely flawed in lots of ways I mean it's definitely corrupt in lots of ways people take advantage of it I think that democracy the voting system is definitely not perfect and so I think there's all kinds of flaws it's just that it seems like the best cracked yet um and that uh and that there's a that a lot of the work we can do is to just make to make the house better I think that the part of it is that we're not living in the best version of this house look at again look at the history of you know race in America right I mean black Americans have had far from a fair ride in what's supposed to be a fair country um and women too right has been you know the women couldn't even vote until recently so it's um I think it's very uh I think it's it's it's there's two things to separate one is you know are we complaining about the flaws in the system which I I'm right I'm right there with you right let's let's fix the flaws and and and and and let's get rid of corruption and let's keep attacking that or are we arguing against the system as a whole right so that means you're not just arguing for more regulation in capitalism or free markets you're arguing for the end of free markets and um uh yeah maybe I'm not doing a great job of still Manning it but I I I I think that um it's you know and look I I think that there is the best Stillman I can give is that there are always inherently going to be some stuff that we're all missing and that um I I feel if I went a thousand years in the future I would expect that we're in some kind of government that's very weird and surprising to me and that has been a major Improvement upon liberalism so the general concept that this is not the necessarily the best possible system sure absolutely it's just that I'm I I don't I haven't heard many great Alternatives from people learning about crypto is hard

which is with Ryan questions like why are we all fighting why why are we all angry with each other all the time and I want to actually pull in some of the the graphics that you uh Illustrated I'm assuming yourself um but first uh I want to just like re-emphasize the the the many polarities that we find in the crypto world we have all these different tribes right you have the the bitcoiners which tend to be these decently conservative Austrian economic zealots and then you got the Assyrian yeah Austrian economics yeah oh oh yeah hard money as opposed to Keynesian uh each each different crypto tribe has their own flavor right you got the ethereans you got the salon ends uh then you even have like Sub sub communities built on top of other communities so inside of the ethereum community you have the arbonauts of the arbitrim protocol and that's a layer two scaling technology on ethereum same thing with the Optimus another layer two scaling protocol ethereum then you have like the small brains which is an nft Community built on top of the Arboretum Community built on top of the ethereum community and so like some of these multi uh polarity communities operate in conflict with each other me and Ryan were birthed into the crypto space fighting with the bitcoiners as part of the ethereum tribe lately I've been picking some fights with the Solana people other communities cooperate with each other uh you have the arbitrum built on top uh you have the the small brains on the arbitrum on the ethereum tech stack and these tend to cooperate pretty well with each other and the reason why I want to like lay up all of the all these different um images here is to to or these uh the this part of the conversation is to start to get into some of uh uh your illustrations here and you you use two different illustrations that I'm showing at once which is uh the higher mind and the Primitive mind and the point I'm going to try and make here is that all communities have members of both they have community members that operate with just the Primitive Minds call them the Cyber Hornets for the bitcoiners and then the higher Minds you call them like the thought leaders like Nick Carter of the Bitcoin tribe comes to mind for me uh and you have this idea of a ladder where you have this part of your you everyone has their primitive mind everyone has their higher mind and the idea is like the more that we can operate with our higher mind the better that things are and then I've also taken uh the same idea of a ladder and overlaid it with a political Compass which I'm sure you're familiar with but the idea is that there's this 3D political landscape you got authoritarians versus Libertarians the right versus the left and in the crypto world we have like a similar landscape of tribes uh sometimes maybe you can actually map them onto the political Compass but the point is is that there's like this nebulous set of tribes that are spread over this landscape in the crypto world and each and every single one operate with like this primitive mind versus higher mind and so I'm hoping that the bankless listener can approach this next part of this conversation identifying with whatever tribe that they come from but but Tim you've identified these archetypes this primitive mind and this higher mind that I think all communities have and I'm wondering if you can walk us through this mental model to understand how to think about these tribes that we all identify with in the crypto space and maybe identify the fact that one particular tribe that we are in might be operating with a primitive mind whereas others might be operating with a higher mind if you could just walk us through that part of the conversation sure yeah so this is I love that you did this because a lot of people point out like well there's already two Dimensions right we have the political compass and what I would say to that is when I say the what you think axis right the horizontal axis Left Right Center um that's is it basically shorthand for just it's it's it is a it's the it's the realm of what you think now if we could always expand that into two dimensions of its own like you did below right and that and I and I think that all of that still qualifies though for the what you think axis so there's lots of Realms of what you think and we can discuss and there's lots of different nuances to it and I'm sure within crypto you like you just described it's not just a single axis right there's all these different camps and there's different camps within the camps and that to me still though we can for for this discussion we can still oversimplify it to all within the realm of what you think right what you know what your stances are now what I like to do here is add a vertical second uh another accessing if you already have two then this is a third one but either way it's a separate access entirely from all of that which is this what I would call like a how you think access it's my ladder here and the idea is that there's like two different kind of broad you know you know ways of thinking and when I when I talk about the you know higher mind um it is kind of the ideal kind of grown-up way of thinking so when when you're higher mind uh is kind of doing the thinking um you are basically just looking for truth and you're not attached to your ideas you're not attached you know you don't identify with them um you are simply um you're trying to get closer to the truth you're trying to be less wrong and so you inherently have some a lot of humility because you know that people are often wrong and you've been wrong a lot in the past and you're very open to disagreement and to challenges um to your ideas because you see that as you know if my idea is a little machine that I've built well a challenger is kicking my machine now I'm not going to take that personally if my idea is as strong as I think it is they're going to hurt their foot my machine's gonna hold up strong and I'm gonna say see I just got a little bit more confident because I saw you tried to do this and it didn't work but if they kicked the machine and something falls off and it breaks in other words they challenge my argument and they put out a point out of flaw and I realize man that was a good point I'm not going to get offended or angry I'm going to say thank you basically oh wow you just showed me that I thought I was right about something I'm not and so you're going to be very very open to changing your mind right this is all very basic it sounds so obvious of course if you're looking for truth you would be open to someone telling you pointing out flaws in your ideas you would be open to changing your mind you would have humility about them and you wouldn't identify with your ideas because the only identity is just you as the truth Seeker that's it right you know the actual thing you believe to be the truth isn't part of you that's just something that you're trying to understand so that's ideal right but of course we don't always think with that part of our brain so there's this other part that primitive mind which actually you know really does you know in fmri studies on people having certain views challenged versus others really does map on to different parts of our brain it maps onto parts of our brain that are you know a very emotional the amygdala the limbic system and other parts of the limbic system the fight or flight parts of our brain the survival parts of our brain and also to this thing called the default mode Network which is the part that looks internally that's introspective that Associates with our own identity and so when you're thinking with this part of your brain um there's certain ideas that your primitive mind is going to associate with your identity and is going to basically cling on to and and spend all of its energy rather than trying to find the truth just trying to be right trying to prove that they're right trying to continue to believe with conviction the things that they believe and trying to prove anyone else wrong and when that part of your brain is active we have a totally different relationship with ideas again we think we're going for the truth but we're very delusional when our primitive mind is thinking we're not really doing that we're full of you know what does confirmation bias confirmation bias is the Invisible Hand of the Primitive mind in your head which is trying to instead as you're sitting there thinking you're looking for truth the Primitive mind is pushing your search in a way that will end up just where it wants it to go so I'm trying to figure out what's true up look where I found out I confirmed my beliefs lo and behold right and that's what will always happen because there's a couple that that part of our brain gets again it Associates certain ideas with our identity and it it becomes indistinguishable so my belief in you know one of those camps you said or my belief that that you know left-wing politics is the best or whatever it is that is part of who I am right you know or the the the the Bible is true that's part of who I am and the Primitive mind has a hard time distinguishing between your identity and your physical body which is why when you have your PR your sacred beliefs challenge you will the the fight or flight parts of your brain will literally light up and you will um you will not just think the people who are saying they were automatically wrong because that's forgiven but you'll actually think they're bad people you'll hate them and that's very quickly turns into very kind of Base primitive tribalism good old tribalism which is that and very quickly you start to want to be friends with the people who share that because and then the group themselves becomes this Echo chamber where they group will collab do kind of collaborative low rung thinking and if you will be kicked out of the group if you if you say that the group is wrong about the sacred beliefs the whole group sits there and just talks about how right they are and they dehumanize the other people so it's the US versus their mentality and all real thinking all truth finding all humility it all is out the window and so I had the ladder because it's not just one or these the other brain thinking a lot of times these are both fighting kind of for the controls in our head you have some part of you that really just wants to find the truth and then another part that really just wants to be right and so it's kind of a tug of war which is what I have with that rope in those drawings on the right but I think what you're describing with the different camps this is an important access to add on to it because you can actually not just say look at all those camps you mentioned you know okay you can map them out in what they think but then you can also say which of these camps or which of these voices is you know deep down there willing to change their mind and they're actually just trying to figure out what's true and they attack ideas they don't attack people and they don't get offended or angry um when someone says they're wrong and which are doing it the Primitive mind way and they attack people you know they will actually try to punish people for saying the wrong thing and they and they are and you know a sign of a a someone thinking with their primitive mind is you know there's nothing you could say or show them no piece of evidence that would make them say you know what I guess I'm wrong about that I need to rethink that so it's important to just it's nice once you have that in your head you can start to notice this axis alongside all the what you think axes of the world anyone who's just been through the last crypto bull market knows that these things are very emotional experiences uh especially when there's a lot of money to be made there's a lot of wealth that's on the line and you know when we say money and wealth like think scarce resources which is the same thing that uh the people of the the political sphere the the Trad play physical sphere are also fighting over everyone is ultimately fighting over scarce resources and inside of a crypto bull market it just happens inside of like two years it happens in a very short Consolidated uh experiment if you will and so when we have all of these tribes running through this this moment in time in which there's a lot of money to be made but everyone kind of knows that there's no again it's only going to be good for like two years a lot of scarcity mentality and the sympathetic nervous system gets like Turned Up To the Max and so that's where a lot of like this tribalism comes from in from the crypto space because it's really really easy to use your primitive mind in the crypto world and a lot harder to use your higher mind because uh it's easier to find the tribe that chance louder and it and because if you can find the bigger tribe that's chanting the the bigger chant that tribe makes money because that makes the number go up at least inside of that like short time of frame that we have this bull market uh and so we have this like this uh fight in the crypto space where we have the ogs who are by definition of the higher mind because they've made it through the cycles and then you have the new peas who are always of the Primitive mind because that is what it is to go through a crypto bull market in his first cycle is like everyone's kind of using their primitive mind the first site the first go around and it's also like why again why we wanted to have you on this podcast now obviously like why we try and do Bank lists is because the idea of going on the bankless journey is about ascending the latter it's about getting to the higher mind and learning to reflect on when you are using your primitive mind and when it's time to come to you to use the higher mind and Tim I'm wondering if you have it just any thoughts for like how to how to ascend the ladder how to identify when you are in a primitive mind State and how to actually make it easier for bankless listeners to climb up into a higher mind state do you have any thoughts or advice for us on that well I think partially is just being a like even just having this ladder as a concept in your head because no one wants to be on the low rungs right when you're on the low rungs you're delusional um you are letting kind of primitive emotions make your decisions you're completely blocked from learning new things um you will continue to make the same mistake over and over because of stubborn kind of insistence that you're right so it's not good for it's the person who suffers most from lowering thinking is the low wrong thinker and so I think you know there are signs of course when you're doing this if you can ask yourself is there anything that would make me say I'm wrong about this if the answer is no okay I think I'm like caught up in kind of like a religious fervor here I think I am caught up in like a tribal craze at this moment um and you can also say you know it is do I get and kind of irrationally angry when someone disagrees with me on this when I see something you know that that tells me you know the people who disagree with me do I hate them you know these are all signs that you are doing that thing that all humans do right it's not doesn't mean you're a bad person doesn't mean you're a dumb person everyone doesn't right and it just means oh I've slipped down on the ladder and just having that thought right there boom you're already up a few runs just having that thought because when you're really down in the ladder you don't know you're doing it you are totally lost in it and so a little bit of self-reflection can go a long way and then of course what's one you know what's the the best way to help yourself here is surround yourself with other people that value High rung thinking even if they don't use that term they just happen to be this so they're again as a group you still will sometimes slip down but if it's it's uh you will find that like it's a it's a kind of it can be like a support group if you have people that tend to not identify with ideas where the group itself likes to disagree right if the group is always agreeing on everything I think you're you've fallen into a low rung Echo chamber which is again collaborative lowering thinking a high rung Group which I would call an idea Labs kind of the opposite of an echo chamber is just a place where people attack ideas but not people it's a place where disagreeing is cool we're humility we're saying I don't know makes you seem smart not wishy-washy you're dumb um where people change their minds and where people disagree for sport uh an argument doesn't mean you're in a fight and it's yeah and when you're in an echo chamber you can see it where it's like wow everyone agrees and we're having way too much fun agreeing and talking about how bad the other people are and if I if I went and disagreed right now it would really kill the vibe in this room and and that people would like me less and maybe I wouldn't even be part of the group anymore okay so now what you're doing is you've fallen into a low run group that is going to if anything in bring out your low run thinking side it's gonna be it's um you know it's like if you're trying to recover as an alcoholic it's like surrounding yourself with going to an alcohol you know uh drinking party every night um and so um I think yeah so I think first of all just have the letter in your head and try to stay aware and notice the signs that you're doing it and then try to remind yourself that this isn't good for me then I'm gonna this is making me stupid it um and then try to surround yourself with other people that tend to be on the high rungs and kind of um keep that as a core value in the group I I think this is great advice for how to exist in a modern you know Society where we have all this low-rung thinking uh kind of junk food and you just extolled the benefits to the individual and I would say for any truth finding exercise whether like in pursuit of science or in pursuit of like a better way a better system or you're an investor you definitely want don't want to fall prey to low rung thinking because you'll be wrong much more often and if you're looking as Tim said to be less wrong then you have to pursue higher mind thinking that is the only way but let me add a little wrinkle to this a Tim because you just made the case that it's better for individuals uh to pursue High mind thinking rather than a high wrong thinking rather than lower wrong thinking however there's like this this kind of exception that I've noticed and I'm almost wondering if this kind of contributes to um the erosion of liberalism and this is this idea of like web 2 social media Technologies which actually I know you're an experienced Twitter user uh as amayas is David as are many like bankless listeners of course I gotta tell you that our media engines our media curation engines like YouTube or Twitter or Facebook or anything else actually don't reward um High wrong thinking they reward dunking if I can have the the hottest like tweet if I can enter the arena and like just dunk on my opponent doesn't even have to be true it just has to be viral it has to be interesting it has to catch on or if I'm a content creator and I want to create content guess what the Algos reward sensationalism they do not reward truth and I'm wondering your thoughts about this because if I'm an individual Tweeter or content creator or you know anything involved in in social media there's actually net benefit for me to be a low rung thinker because I'll accrue more attention I'll become more popular I'll be able to influence more people and I'm wondering if uh this is kind of a pernicious um problem that we are facing now and and maybe the reason for some erosion of liberalism what do you make of our uh web 2 curation algorithms right now and how they're affecting Society I think you're absolutely right that these algorithms and the way the incentive structure is set up encourages low rung content creation lowering mentality publicly for any individual what I would say is that when you're creating content you're putting stuff out there you're kind of creating a magnet you're turning yourself into a magnet and the magnet is going to attract people who think the way you're talking who like the way you're talking and it's going to repel people who don't so if you get out there and you start saying I'm just going to be really politically um aggressive and I'm going to just kind of be really tribal I'm going to dunk on the other side you're going to get a bunch of followers that's true but you're going to get followers who love people who dunk on the other side who are thinking that way themselves who are really tribal and you're going to repel people who are thoughtful and nuanced and who who want to find the truth and who you know and and so what happens now you've gotten a bunch of followers um doing this now what say you know but say you say that's not actually who I am right I was just trying to manipulate the algorithms and get followers now I'm going to write something nuanced I'm going to write a nuanced tweet or a poster or make a YouTube video you're going to get a ton of hate from your followers because you're going to have attracted the exact kind of people who don't like that and all the people who would have loved that they don't follow you they're long gone they they they left a long time ago because you really bored them or you repulsed them so I would say as a content creator of any kind whether it is thought leadership or in writing or in music or anything make the kind of stuff that is true to who you are because you will then attract not just followers but friends right you'll attract people who want more of that and who like that and who agree with you and maybe yeah maybe it's a slower road because it's not the algorithm isn't going to just totally help you as much um but it happens over time and now you know you're going to be encouraged to do more of that uh and and the alternative is you surround yourself by you know with uh with a bunch of people who you don't actually like or you don't really um actually you know who don't who won't appreciate the nuanced part of your brain so I would say for an individual it's a no-brainer to you know if if you are super tribal and that's who you are and that's who you like to be with your go for it then go you know go do that and and uh and and surround yourself with that but um but I would say if you're not I think it's a huge mistake to try to go for just followers because the question is which followers and you know you wanna you want that to be the right answer but yes on a macro scale I totally agree this is a problem and I wish that algorithms over time would adjust instead of just going for Pure engagement which is going to inherently then go for you know outrage and anger um would actually would actually tweak themselves a little bit and and and and maybe for in a more macro sense change the incentive structure guys there's so much here uh more to unpack and it's all included in in Tim's book which I totally recommend uh it is uh called what's our problem we'll include a link to it in the show notes but the mental we only got through half of the agenda yeah it's just like we have so much in the book but do you know uh so guys this is this is all about how you can you know think better in this uh in this society and uh how you can make sure you are a high rung thinker how you can avoid Echo Chambers Echo Chambers uh I gotta say are um they're powerful in the short run but they are long-term bearish okay if you want to accomplish something over the long run but Tim I know we we don't have too much time but I I just I really need to pick your brain on this before we leave we're just talking about algorithms and kind of web 2 and how um like you're hopeful that we can start to reward High rung thinking with our algorithms I I just heard uh Max tegmark make make some comment I think he was maybe quoting someone else that basically the web 2 algorithms were art like our test show for AI right and we've kind of failed that like we we have these algorithms that are causing all of these Ripple effects and unintended consequences and we're falling into moloch traps as as a result of this and that was just our trial run because now we have these super uh powerful algorithms that are just starting to hit the scene in the form of artificial intelligence and David and I here have been doing a series lately on AI alignment existential threats Eliezer udkowski like you know the the roster of these people talking about it I know you've had some thoughts in the past about AI alignment in general uh this is beyond the scope of your book but it seems like it's another problem that's going to affect society in the short run and then in the long run maybe we have this tail risk of existential uh destruction ahead of us as well what are your thoughts on on AI these days um are you planning to write about it more just just give us your tldr yeah no I definitely um want to write more about it I um I I I need to kind of I'm in the middle of kind of just inhaling a lot on it and hearing about what a ton of people are saying and looking at a bunch of the new tools that are out there um but I think um yeah I think that we should be scared of existential risk here um in that um you know I have in one of my posts I have a term called the human Colossus which is you know if you think about um uh you know ancient tribes you have a little you know everyone can put their knowledge into the kind of group's Consciousness and it's a little knowledge Tower that's kind of in the center of the tribe and then as people moved into the cities you know during the Agricultural Revolution and after and you have a lot more people and so the knowledge Towers get larger um and then you have the you know invention of writing and people can compare what people are saying through General through time and space and the towers get you know just you know skyscrapers and um you know and eventually it's that that Tower of knowledge and know-how and uh and and power eventually you know it turns into the industrial revolution which puts the whole thing on steroids and I think of it as this giant Colossus that have our species has created that is kind of like Godzilla tramping around and it is building building building it is making you know it is producing um and it has created a vast wealth and and it is it has made quality of life way better and it's reduced poverty and said all these great things um but it also does not have a conscience it doesn't actually have a uh a compass about where it's going it is just kind of a product of you know billions of in people's individual self-interest you know and that giant is the thing that is making AI um and it uh if we let if we let that human Colossus kind of uh now create something way smarter than itself um you um you're taking your chances right and that and again that thing doesn't really have um a moral compass it just it doesn't doesn't it's not necessarily wise right it's it's only as wise as kind of the systems that it is incentivized by and if the only system is incentivized by is pure capitalism this is talking about steel Manning you know the argument against if the only system it has is pure kind of capitalism um I I actually think that that uh that is kind of a classic Malik situation where you're going to um where you're going to you know build something that is incredibly powerful that was not created with the with wise you know with wisdom um and so we have to kind of that's why you know we have to not create this thing the way we've created all the other things you know the other things you want to create the best software let self-interest go at it and everyone will try to make the best most appealing software and V1 will be buggy and V2 will be buggy and by V10 the software is better and I will be compete with all the other v10s and um and eventually the consumers get the benefit of that we'll all end up with really great apps on our phone um that won the competition and gotten iterated improved over time AI is just so different than that you know if V1 is buggy we now have a buggy God on the planet that probably will not let us that would probably they will not let us go change in and update it because it doesn't want to be changed and updated and it's it's kind of oh we actually that's not how we wanted it to be incentivized too late this thing is now more powerful than we are and that's pretty scary and likewise you know competition well no whoever gets there first maybe they can shut down all our other efforts and so maybe it's you know the first V1 is now our God as opposed to the 10th V10 is the best app the first V1 so you know that's the worst case scenario um and I don't know if that's actually what will happen it's hard to this is all very unprecedented I think anyone who is confidently pessimistic or even or confidently optimistic um either one I think is is a I don't believe them um I think we really don't know but of course if we don't know then let's be cautious right no don't no don't make it the dumbest experiment in history to build this thing and see maybe it won't be you know actually as scary so um I think we cannot treat it like we normally do and say let's just get everyone get out there and build and innovate and you know and and we'll improve it over time we have to have some kind of other mechanism here that is kicking in so um I do hope people are listening to the AI safety people um and that we get properly scared the thing that worries me most is that I just think it's hard for people to believe something that's not in front of their eyes that they've never seen before that's totally unprecedented and um be scared of that I don't think you're scared till it's too late so I think somehow we need to spread enough fear not so much that people think it's the apocalypse but enough that people start saying um it is the only way to build AI is to do it ethically and you know to do it with a ton of um uh AI Safety Research alongside and uh and so yeah I'm not sure I'm glad I'm not in charge of this problem but um I uh it does it is a little bit concerning well yeah I mean you're you're certainly not in charge and yet we all are in charge because it's all of our our problems uh here and um I I think uh you know the title of your book like what's our problem self-help for society right um this is one of the areas we need help with and we've got a lot of low rung thinking we've got this uh abandonment maybe of liberal ideas that have driven so much much good and value in our world uh you know in and we have these existential uh threats ahead and we very much have to keep our wits about about us as a species if we're gonna like survive the next hundred years I want to ask you this as we close out Tim in spite of all of this what gives you hope why do you think we can make it on the other side how do how do we correct these things what's hopeful about the situation we're in well um a couple things give me hope I mean one we are a survival species we are a bunch of survivors and that doesn't mean that it hasn't been horrible tragedies and genocides and awful things in the past um um and it also we haven't ever faced full kinds of existential threat but I do think that Humanity has a knack for surviving and that if we get scared enough you know I think maybe reason we'll Prevail out of pure fear and out of pure Survivor um Instinct so that's that's one thing um I also believe in the liberal house I think it's a great way to produce emergent wisdom um I think that no one of us is smart enough to figure this out um and but you know and just like no one of us can figure out you know um how to build particle colliders or how to understand black holes but together with collaboration of thousands of people over time and and geography we can figure out stuff that's way above us we actually have a super intelligence kind of a super wisdom um in it that we can do we also can combine together for Mass stupidity which is why I think the reason I wrote this book is that I think it's kind of that what's our problem the the concept of um uh the liberal house working and and us being able to have high rung discourse is it is the limiting factor on everything else if we can do that it gives us the best shot to proceed wisely it can be a compass into the future if we can do this if on the other hand you know low rung thinking and tribalism gets the better of us um it's like we're we're running ahead blind like a bulldozer right off a cliff I think um so to me it's like all the other problems including AI the the foundation that need that that the the root of all of how you know whether things will go well or or not is is is this liberal house functioning well because I think it gives us our best shot and groups that are outside with the Wrecking Balls I think they're very very dangerous and I think that the concept that you know you know that that young kids aren't being taught Civics as much I think that's or isn't aren't being taught the value of free speech or how to argue or how to you know seek truth or how to be persuasive and instead they're being kind of indoctrinated to believe in a certain ideology and to silence people who disagree that is incredibly dangerous because you're training people to basically break down the house as opposed to training them to uphold it and to me in if this this house being sound and sturdy uh is gives us the best shot of getting it right I don't know if we can do it but it gives us the best shot so um I do uh I I I I I I I wouldn't say I feel confidently optimistic but I also if I had gotten to my head I think I think we can do it um but I do think that we we there are some very concerning kind of trends that need to be curved and we need to kind of yeah like you said ever it's about us as we go into this future of exploding technology in you know in God like power it gives the species um you know we need reason to kind of prevail and bankless listener if you're wondering where to start oftentimes the answer is uh to start with yourself I know after reading Tim's book um I was more conscious of the way I respond on Twitter and what the incentives are and uh you know like you could start by not being an on social media and when you when you have the opportunity to score those points and to dunk and to take the you know the low rung thinking path you can take the hiring thing thinking path um I'm not always perfect at this I do try and post Tim's book I think I've been better about it so Tim thank you so much for expressing these mental models for the bankless community and uh for societies we really appreciate you coming on today thank you for having me great combo bankless listeners the blog is wait but why go check it out we'll include a link in the show notes and then the book is what's our problem a self-help uh book for societies um gotta let you know as well of course none of this has been Financial advice it's not even societal reconstruction advice though we dabbled today you could definitely lose what you put in in crypto but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
