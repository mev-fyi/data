that live perfect all right let's go ahead and get started we are bringing bright id to meet the nation today philip and adam are two members of the bright id project and bright id is an attempt to create identity in a decentralized bottom-up manner i'm really excited about this project so philip adam welcome to the nation thanks for being here great to be here all right so where does this story start uh adam i believe you are the founder of bright id uh how does how did the genesis of bright id come about yeah the way it came about is i was i had some kind of futuristic visions of of how i thought the world should be and and things that i wanted to work towards and i realized okay if i if i want to get there i've got to you know these things these ideas are kind of far in the future i've got to work my way back towards the present and i said okay if i want to have the you know these these ideals of greater democracy more participation more equal distribution of goods um there's some things that are stopping that from happening right now and i just kept working backwards until i got to like the present okay like what is the very next step that we need to do and it actually seemed to me like you to be able to solve a lot of these problems you need to have a way to have a digital identity that's uniquely yours controlled by you and uh that can verify your uniqueness in any system so that's what i set out to do with bright id and along the way a lot of other um really cool interesting people came along and kind of hopped on board so yeah that's that's that's where we've been going for the past almost three years now so let's start with the why here and when i try and explain uh identity towards people in my in my loki my friends and family i usually go with a metaphor of like i pull out my driver's license and i say like isn't it weird that your identity expires every few years like why is that the case like identities shouldn't expire so so adam when you when you were trying to explain why identity is important or what the problem is with decentralized identity like how do you explain this thing yeah i mean isn't it also weird that you have to take your driver's license to ride in an airplane or that you have to you know take it to all these other places that have nothing to do with driving it's so yeah it's really strange um so i think one of the problems with identity is that uh we came up with these systems that you know a lot of them have been sort of haven't changed much for hundreds of years but uh as soon as we try to port them into the digital realm um the like the the social structures around them just break down and and trying to replicate that in a digital realm just doesn't work and we've had i don't know maybe 50 or so years to to even think about this i mean with the internet even less than that and so we're just uh like we're so new to this that we haven't really figured it out yet but it's so important to to bring these structures in a way that makes sense um into a digital realm and to you know in a way that can connect the whole world yeah so i'll say you know with with your license example so you go to a bar and you want to buy a drink what you need to prove to them is they are over 21 right but really you give them your name your address your height your eye color all these things they didn't need they didn't ask for um really all they need is an attestation from some entity they that they trust the dmv that you're over 21 you don't even need to know your age just that you meet the criteria so what bright id does is give the smallest possible information which is you exist once in any given system so the idea is if when you validate something with your bright id all that system knows is i've never seen this person before without any information other than that so it's like the smallest attestation and it's it's only part of what we call self-sovereign identity so there's a whole bunch of projects working on self-sovereign identity and that's awesome and i i sort of describe all of those is they're building a digital locker that can store a bunch of that destination so the dmv says yeah you can drive in with this old your college says yes you have this this major and this gpa um but there's no entity on earth right now that can provide a clean attestation that you exist once and brenda set out to do that and we hope to fit bright id into a bunch of ssi digital lockers three box global id lots of others yeah i remember in my early days of ethereum i was learning about the power of ethereum and what it can do and one of them was definitely that that bartender example where you hand them your id and then they get your your home address they get your your everything about you your height your weight like your weight which is weird uh and and even your birthday isn't necessary to inform them of the information they need to know and then it's important to appreciate this because this is about retaining privacy and retaining self-sovereignty right like controlling that the data that you leak out to the world like if you want to patronize this business you need to tell them one thing and one thing only that you are above 21 years of age not that you are 32 and 3 months or or that you live around the street which can become very risky especially in a world where uh it seems to be kind of chaotic these days and so using a decentralized identity that allows the user to give up the amount of information about themselves that they control is really important especially when we get into a world especially on ethereum that is about removing top down hierarchical systems and creating bottom up solutions right and so bright id to me is this bottom bottom-up solution to solving the identity issue and it can also remove isms so you know bright id doesn't let them know your race or your religion or your geography because for a lot of things that should not matter there's nothing matters it's a fair game it's like okay so you want to do a fair launch right we keep having these fair launches of projects right okay so they're going to wales right well with a bright id enabled fair launch you could say everyone can get 100 of these tokens they can buy them they can farm them whatever you want that's it that's a truly a fair launch yeah this whole fair launch mechanism is is fair in one definition of the use of the word fair in the sense that no one was particularly able to like front run it or get an advantage that anyone else has except for the natural advantages of the universe which is capital begets capital right and and we were just talking about this on the state of the nation with kevin owaki of gitcoin where he is super excited about being able to more fairly distribute bitcoin grants and more fairly like allocate funding based off of one person one vote rather than one dollar one vote right so i'm really excited about that so let's get into the the technicals of bright id how does it work yeah so the basics the the very first thing that you start out with is making a cryptographically signed connection between two people and uh what they're testing is that they actually made a connection that um you know both of them willingly did that and that uh that if if i'm making a connection with phillip i'm attesting to the fact that i haven't already made a bunch of connections with philip that that i'm making one connection with philip and uh so with that as the starting point then you can start to build this graph of the people that that you already know that you have trusted channels with that you have trusted connections with you start making connections with them you branch out from there and you you start to build up this graph and then that graph can be analyzed and by by looking at um uh like trusted regions and this is all anonymous by the way uh there's no uh photographs names anything like that attached to the points in the graph um but uh as the graph is analyzed you can make it make determinations about um what is the likelihood of any point in the graph of representing a unique individual in other words someone that that doesn't appear somewhere else in the graph and uh you you kind of end up with two different buckets you end up with people that have enough information about them they have enough connections to the uh to i guess known good portions of the graph and then you have uh like this bucket of unknown which is either could be a real person that that hasn't reached the the verification standard yet hasn't made enough connections or it could be a civil someone making lots of duplicate accounts and uh the idea with bright id is that a real person has an advantage over symbols because they can they can work harder and make connections with real people and um and and beat the sybils at that game whereas a civil trying to connect to honest people that are that are on the lookout for civils and trying to make honest connections are not going to be able to reach that level of verification the same way a unique human would be able to do that and so you know having this you can have this anonymous graph and yet still know whether points in the graph represent unique humans yeah i would definitely want to get into a little bit more there but first i think it's worthwhile to define what a social graph is the first time i heard it was from nick carter and it totally confused me can you define what a social graph is yeah i mean social graphs arise in a lot of different um applications it's simply when you when you socially interact with someone and uh and there's a record of that interaction then you can you can start to um you know connect the dots and say okay i you know i followed philip on twitter and he followed me um that represents a connection or you could have so that that's like a bi-directional connection you can also have um one directional connections and uh yeah there's lots of different there's lots of different potential social graphs that represent different things and so bright idea is is taking these very intentional yes i'm meant to connect to this person um i'm sort of attesting in some way that i believe that this that this is someone that that i recognize as a human being that i haven't seen before connected to before and so that type of social graph is the one that that we're building up and this goes like all the way back into hunter-gatherer type societies right like this is how humanity was constructed like we vouched for one another it's like yes i can trust that person right and this is how facebook created their social web this is how like twitter created its social webs like followers upon followers hey little guy um followers upon followers would just say like hey i'm going to vouch for you right and and so assuming we cross dunbar's number right and for those that don't know dunbar's number is like roughly 50 which is the maximum number of like humans that each person can like pay attention to and so with the advent of like social media and technology we've been able to grow social graphs to be like this massively large large networks of interconnected people but because we didn't have decentralized identity we have this issue of like bots right like fake accounts briganding accounts briganding is that how you pronounce it i hope so um just and especially with like u.s elections right around the corner like i don't think the the the time for a decentralized identity solution that is baked off of i can vouch for that person is is we need that more now than ever and it's the problem's way bigger than most people think it is right there was some study that said half of the cove news on social media was produced by bots half like that's that's crazy yeah absolutely and and so what you guys are doing is you guys are making it difficult to be a bot right and and the clever mechanism here is the there's an incentive baked right in because first off identity is useful therefore there is going to be some incentive to use decentralized identity and if you have like a number associated with you as to the likelihood of you being a really a real person that's now kind of like your credit score in a way where like you have this system of rating where people can or maybe this algorithm will determine like you know this account doesn't really have very many connections and the connections that they do have also don't have very many connections and so we're going to de-weight them on the like list of of people that we can trust to be a trustworthy a real person and that incentive is there so like so i think we're about to pull out our phones and make a connection real uh just around the corner here but the reason why like my friend like i got a roommate and i can go connect with him and then he might go get a new phone and be like hey can you also connect with this phone too and i'd be like well no because that's going to lower my trustworthiness score because i want my identity preserved too can you guys talk about that that incentive yeah yeah that's that's a key part of bright id and that's actually something that we haven't that we haven't cracked yet but that's that's going to be really important is how do you uh you know how do you promote this these social norms that allow something like bright id to succeed um it has to go through this this growth phase where you'll be connecting to people um that maybe aren't the closest people in the world but you talked about the hunter gatherer system before and i think that that's like the steady state that's that's kind of what what we're aiming for it's like there are people in the world that know you very well that you know no matter how good technology gets it creating deep fakes and things like that in the future these people you know they they've been with you your whole life and and they know that that you are that you are who you say you are and so they they can make these connections and you can start from there and uh you know you have you have these these connections with the most trustworthy people in the world and you do you and then you can use them also to in a digital realm to be a guardian of your identity and this is this is something that um ties in very readily with bright id is this idea of having a social recovery for your identity um if if uh you know if you lose your identity it's something like the social security number um that's very hard to recover from systems that are set up to do that are very difficult but with something like right idea and a social recovery it allows you uh you know you simply reconnect with a a couple of the people that that you've entrusted right you pre-designated yeah that you've and that you've entrusted to be the guardian of your unique identity and you immediately get that back you don't need to go through some weird um government hoop or something like that to do that so this is all this all like ties back together and um you know that's that's the steady state that we're going for and on the way there we have to uh you know take some um take some paths where we're making connections to people that and relying on people that maybe aren't the the closest people to us in the world but we're going to get to the point where the graph just becomes cl closer together more people are in it and we eventually reach that steady state that takes us you know that transforms this this digital realm back into that highly trustworthy you know these this is these are my people this is you know and that's what you're that's what your unique identity is based on absolutely so what what i'm assuming you guys are going to ask for from the nation is that everyone download the bright id app and make some connections right and so let's actually do that right now uh if one of you guys wants to show me your code so i can scan it so we can actually show what people what it looks like to to scan and make a connection right so yeah so here's my app i'm just going to click my code it pops up a qr i'm going to scan it once my camera focuses and there look there you are nice and i'm going to confirm that yes phillip i know you we've talked to once he confirms i get it and i can see all right here's david he's a pretty new user he's got only one connection he's only been a bright id for two hours and uh and i am also connected to that other person so cool so i i confirmed that and we are now connected so now adam should do the same all right let's do this scan a code if you could shift it over just a little bit and a little bit up there we go boom there we go there's adam cool now my social graph has improved my credit score has gone up almost so now i'm what you need to do is we don't actually care about individual users when scoring right id we do it based on groups okay because that provides way more data for the algorithms so right now i'm going to create the onboarding david group here on the phone and we're going to join it with david and adam as the two co-founders the ad the admins with me so in just a moment if you guys go back to the main screen there's a little bell up in the corner should you get a dot on it and you should accept that group invite you'll see i use an awesome picture boom i like that wow uh okay ice accepted it oh i'm in a group now nice and so you know you you happen to tell me and adam you should do that too uh you happened to tell me before that that kevin milwaukee was home maybe i've been connected to kevin yeah since we've connected to kevin we could invite him to that group as well oh nice but he's not showing up right now so we might have to do it later i might have to reconnect to kevin so this is like pods pods of people that have some sort of shared identity some meaning behind them yeah you know either or they just showed up together so yeah that's that's that's the main thing i think um especially since we're moving to um something called group connection where you can just have one person hold up a qr code and then a group setting like this everyone can scan it and automatically be joined to that group um it's just saying that these people were together in the same place um they know each other and they're they're all kind of you know attesting to to to that fact all at once and so you then you create this thing that's that's it's a group and that's very useful for this for the system that's that's analyzing the graph to say okay all these people made connections to each other at the same at the same approximate time um that's that's that's a really strong signal for the algorithm to look okay so now it's important to say you know all of this so all of this is sort of um version one of of of brand id you know it's the it's the centralized thinking version right because a group of people built it we built this thing to be fully and deeply decentralized in the truest sense of the word uh it's all open source and always has been it's controlled by a dao we can get into that later so right now our team has come up with you know 10 different algorithms for how to analyze the graph but that's not the long-term vision the long-term vision is anybody can be a node on the network and think up their own analysis run it on the same data so all the nodes come to consensus on this is the state of the graph these cryptographically secure connections really did happen i don't know if they're unique or not but they happened that's provable um but then so imagine all three of us are running nodes we can all run slightly different algorithms come up with different answers so you're in the long run your bright id verification is not a binary thing you're getting that's like the opinion of an algorithm and we imagine that the creed will rise to the top right and it'll be a cat and mouse game so people are always going when it gets really valuable to we have a verified account especially for a bot okay well then there'll be lots of incentives to try to do that the albums will keep getting better and applications can choose who do they want to listen to in regards to the analysis of the graph and they can listen to me for you or adam or a composite of all of them will run their own and if philip makes his algorithm open source then i can run it too and i can check his answers to make sure that he's being honest and if david writes an amazing algorithm and puts in a black box but it's actually better he could theoretically charge money for the answer i don't think that that's the solution that wins out but we certainly wouldn't stop it right and so okay this can become customizable and like use case specific perhaps even right like maybe there's this one general score but maybe somebody tries to make an algorithm for one more specific use case that's a little bit more niche but more relevant to some odd ends or have you guys thought about this yeah so one of the big things is there are some applications where having a having loads of symbols to be a problem but having a few doesn't matter so like let's say you know you want to create a gmail account google doesn't really care if you have two or three it's not a big deal they don't want you to have a million that's a problem so they could have a low threshold because they don't mind if some sybils get in but they really don't want to exclude anybody but then you could have you know voting for the presidential election where they really wanted to make sure it's one and they could be have hard hard rails on that or you could have we started talking about like quadratic farming um you know it's all it's all the rage so an organization can say we want to we don't care if we exclude people we're there can be a really high bar you need to go out and connect to 30 people before we let you do this quadratic farming because it's so lucrative to get your one little one acre plot to farm so everyone can have different standards for how hard it is to get in well i look forward to the first day that i can farm with my bright id id i'm looking forward to that it's going to be a race for the first farm to come and come and implement that and think of how much how much better it is that right now if you don't have a hundred thousand dollars in crypto like you get wrecked by the gas cost because other people are just out farming you and what the profits but i can't wait to see people be like no no everybody gets one acre like you can you can put a thousand dollars that's it or whatever it is right one wi-fi whatever that's awesome that's awesome oh if there's one wi-fi one wi-fi only 30 000 people will be able to participate at most well we'll write but even like in wi-fi which has like the best distribution of like anything we've seen there's still whales and wi-fi right yep no that's true it's true uh you can there's a bunch of people that have point one and we would love you'd love to be able to get them involved in things and i think what makes me so optimistic about this is that you know creating your social graph which is a valuable thing to do doesn't cost capital like this is not a capital intensive exercise it's like yield farming is capital intensive it's it's to be honest it's kind of by the rich for the rich right like the rich people get get advantages during yield farming and creating your social graph is the opposite of that it's like one human one human right like this and all humans are largely on the same setting so long as you have a strong social graph right and so there's and you can get the you can increase the value of your social graph without having to cost any money or do all that much labor yeah and we also we we haven't sort of come up with the right incentive models yet and maybe someone else will just build it on top but like you can have a game where okay you get paid for you get paid for building out the social graph you get paid you know somebody makes a uh an identity game to game and every time you make a connection that ends up validated no you get a token and that's the only way the tokens come into existence you know we and we even sort of preferred that to be built on top because you know we are we are bankless fans uh we very much believe in the protocol synthesis and we want bright id to be way down at the bottom right it's just it's just a tool anyone can go grab it if if your application would benefit from not being full of bots and have having fairness built in just go grab the bright id thing and with the git coin integration happening right now kind of everyone at the core of ethereum is going to have a reason to get bright id and there is there is some some work and hurdles involved in getting it for getting it the first time getting verified once you have it using it with a different application is scanning a qr code it literally takes three seconds i kind of think the incentive is kind of just baked into the existence right so like bitcoin has it and it's get coin finds it valuable and then maybe some yield form finds it valuable and so like all of a sudden like if you have broad id you are able to access more things and it kind of just bootstraps itself into existence are you guys thinking about this too we hope so yeah definitely yeah definitely the idea is you get your bright id and um you just yeah it opens the door to a bunch of different things and the the more applications that start using it then the the more the easier it is for the next application down the road to use it because they'll already find out oh look you know 20 percent of my users already have bright id okay this isn't as big as a hurdle as i thought it was going to be maybe give some quick shout outs to the early projects that have integrated grenadine yeah just getting started but there's some really cool stuff so so you know one you just talked to kevin so bitcoin is doing it so uh i hope all of you listening to this give to get coin because it's it's an amazing community to be part of and to be so much an ecosystem uh all the projects you give to you will get 25 more matching funds if you're ready verified uh and to clarify you just need to be ready to be verified by the end of the round um so you can give now and get right if i get verified you know a week or two later uh we've got loads of meetings set up uh where you can come and meet other people and do that process another is the one hive project so really cool building new new ecosystems and incentive systems and their native asset is called honey and there's the honey faucet and if you're verified you can go get your share of honey every day all right so every two days and it's like 40 worth of honey right now wow wow yeah y'all should go to the honey faucet um and get that uh so we've also we run a in order to run our own operations we couldn't do it on each main chain obviously right lots of reasons uh we created something called id change which is a l2 sidechain evm compatible thing it's a lot like x-guy but one of the things that's really cool about id chain is that gas is provided like ubi so regular users get a get a lifetime supply of free gas token it's called edie and you can get that for free just by having bright id in the long run an average user that'll be all they need if you're a low usage user you could sell your excess to power users that need it it's not meant to be a a lot it's never meant to be a lot of money it's a spam protection thing for the network um but just right imagine gas is free if you're just a regular person um yeah so just to be clear about that our our nodes use that um for consensus before that we were using rinkaby just like we would have been happy to use mainnet but um the costs for for just you know simply writing some extra data into transactions was going to be too much so um you know we wanted it to be on it on an actual mainnet um an iv chain seem like a cool way to do it but it's bright id is blockchain agnostic it doesn't even it doesn't like to use it doesn't even need a blockchain um it's just the nodes need a way to you know figure out uh to come to consensus about okay the these set of connections happened in this time frame that that sort of thing and and and decide on so that they can have identical copies of the graph to work on so that if i want to verify that phillips algorithm is doing what he does it is i can have the same copy of the graph and run his algorithm on it and check his answers um so we need that can that consensus is important so we need we need a way to do that um id chain is our current solution for that okay so just to reiterate like the reason why it's on a blockchain is because it's very important that there's just one copy of the truth of the grand social graph right exactly okay so making sure that like my my phone has bright id on it but it has consensus with everyone else because of a blog because of blockchain technology exactly cool yeah very cool but then but then um as far as like actually using bright id integrating with an app the app doesn't need to use blockchain at all to integrate with right so you can you know ethereum apps can totally use it but web 2 apps can use privacy right early on we used to imagine like what what people in the regular world would do this okay so there's a new coffee shop they want to get customers now they're willing to give one free cup of coffee to anyone that walks in the door right but only once because like that most coffee shops would be thrilled to get a customer for the price of a cup of coffee but they don't want someone to come and use the system right like a random coffee shop could theoretically use right id right yeah it's not even a website web model this is just a model model of of of identity that's fantastic i mean they could have like taken a copy of your like driver's license but that would be way more cumbersome than like a qr code on your phone that you already have and again we go back to the privacy issues that we had that we talked about earlier that is just absolutely fantastic so where does my ethereum address come into play or does it even at all so it it could come into play um it it's it's so uh just to give some examples of apps that are currently using ethereum addresses as identifiers um there's one called um burn signal which allows you to to burn ether to state your opinion uses quadratic voting it's pretty cool experiment in democracy um so if you go to ethereum.brightid.org you can link your your ethereum address to your bright id for the purposes of using burn signal now one of the things that we want to be careful with is we don't we want to stay away from having like a single identifier that is just links you to everything that's that's a total failure of privacy so we definitely don't want to um to default to that um so what we what we do is we allow apps to say okay what identifier do you want um and so you could tell your users you could say hey if you want to use burn signal um create a you know create a fresh ethereum address or uh create we're going to create a new unique identifier or except the new unique identifier that you create we're going to link that and that um and so that doesn't exist anywhere else doesn't tie you to anything else um and so we have this this concept of contexts or um like compartments of this is you're unique in this system you're also unique in this system you don't have to link those two systems to know that you're unique in both bright id uh verifies you in both of those um without that without that unwanted linkage that's that's really key to to maintaining that privacy fantastic guys i am so excited about the future of this uh so if you got what you guys want uh listeners of the bankless uh youtube and members of the bankless nation what should they do to help uh bright id grow oh yeah i love that um as we as we talked about git coin we're we're doing um you know the the biggest bitcoin um fund raising campaign that we've done yet for for bright id um just to get us to an even better state where where we're more portable we can integrate better with more applications um you know you in the future it's like phillip said bright id should should sync to the bottom you shouldn't have to have a bright id app it should just be you know linked into everything you use the app is not bright id yeah like right now like we call it internally we call it the mobile reference app we're just sort of showing how a system could use bright id but in the long run we hope it's built into a bunch of different wallets and whatnot yeah it's just a front end so our target is like we get enough people donating through bitcoin grants and um and some of our other campaigns and then we're able to have this uh this sdk that allows anyone to um use right id in a portable way integrate it deeply with their own systems and it just becomes kind of this really my my vision for bright id is that in in the future everyone's going to have an identity wallet right id is going to be like this sticker that shows up here in your identity wallet um and it might show up multiple times saying yes i'm unique on uh on burn signal i'm unique in honey faucet i'm unique in edie faucet twitter and facebook and linkedin yeah i'm unique in facebook so these these little stamps that uh that show that you're unique in every system that you use that's that's how i want bright id to kind of like manifest itself all right guys so you guys all i i'm assuming listeners uh listen to the state of the nation this morning with kevin milwaukee use git coin to fund a bunch of development and then use bright id and your new social graph to amplify the funds that you donate right so bright id is amplifying all funds by 25 if you get verified by the end of the bitcoin period so so that is how we bootstrap this decentralized identity from the ground up and like ryan said in his tweet that i just absolutely loved first we take back our money and then we take back our identity and it sounds like to me that bright id is going to be the way that we do that so philip adam thank you for coming on to the meet the nation and thank you for meeting the nation so awesome thanks so much
