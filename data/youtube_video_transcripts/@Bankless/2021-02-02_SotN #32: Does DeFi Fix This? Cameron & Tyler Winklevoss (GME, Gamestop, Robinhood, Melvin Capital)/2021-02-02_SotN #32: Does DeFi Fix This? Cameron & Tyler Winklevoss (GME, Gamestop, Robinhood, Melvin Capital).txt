[Music] hey guys welcome to state of the nation david we are at episode number 32. how you doing today david absolutely fantastic so much is happening every single week it seems like it's just a new week of even more stuff and last week was no exception and it looks like this week it's going to be even more crazy david we just had the winklevoss twins on and we're about to get to that conversation with them they were on cnbc last week i had to actually uh get a free trial of cnbc to see that full interview but it was straight fire they were dropping crypto truth bombs on the cnbc reporters and i'm not sure if they knew what to make of them this is going to be like the this is kind of the crypto native sequel to that interview and we're talking about of course gamestop and everything that happened as a result of the gamestop news and the price action yeah gamestop is of course one part story about a fine it's a financial story but it really it's much more than that it's it's a cultural story as well it's a populist story there's the stories there there's topics of censorship and deep platforming to be had the legacy markets are showing to be disenfranchising to people uh the people the masses whereas you know defying crypto is supposed to be this inside out every equal playing fields platform and i think people are coming to terms with that and and i think what i see cameron and tyler trying to do is trying to promote that we see elon musk coming to and adding bitcoin into his bio everyone is you know rumoring about what is elon musk up to uh there's really so many different stories to be told here so we got the winkleby on to help us tell those stories because you know they have one foot in the legacy world and one foot in crypto and they do it both a great job just being on platforms like cnbc and then also like bankless yeah absolutely and a quick disclaimer gemini is a sponsor of the show and of course the winklevoss twins co-founded gemini that is not the reason we had them on the show we brought them on the show because they are dropping straight fire about this gamestop issue if this is your first day of the nation we do it every tuesday generally it is streamed live at about two o'clock eastern on tuesdays it comes out on the podcast the next day we've got some other things going on in the bankless nation as well a jeremy alaire podcast he of course is the uh founder of circle and they are behind the usdc stablecoin really interesting conversation there and then we had brian uh and then we had brent johnson talk about the crypto milkshake theory the dollar milkshake theory rather and then we ask his thoughts on crypto that's coming up next week so lots of hot content in store for you but david we want to get to the interview fast today but before we do i want to ask you the question i always ask you at the front of these episodes what is the state of the nation this week my friend the state of the nation is assembling we are assembling okay so here's how i got this to this one we have first off the wall street bets subreddit which is like the focal point of this entire story grew by like you know 6x or 10x or something in size like people just flocked into that into that subreddit then then we have you know plenty of people talking about how this this is a bold case for specifically ethereum is specifically d5 we have soulja boy coming in and minting nfts we have elon talking even more about bitcoin talking putting bitcoin into his bio it really seems to be that this very wide diverse set part parts of the world are all coming together to like kind of focus in on crypto i don't think the wall street bets uh subreddit really is kind of privy to the crypto conversation so early they're still focused on shorting or buying gme to the moon but i think once all the dust settles people are going to really understand that like the reason why there's censorship the reason why there's you know discrepancies between how retail and hedge funds are treated as financial players in markets is because that these markets are inherently unfair and unbiased and the only way to get at get out and from under the the influence and oppression of these poorly structured markets is through defy and i think that these people are all assembling under this defy banner well assembling is an interesting word it reminds me of like that scene at the end of the end game where it's like thanos and then it starts with just like captain america and then suddenly the other marvel superheroes beam in you see black panther and spider-man and all of the rest and it's like the established uh traditional financial system is kind of like thanos and it's this diverse group from reddit online communities to to retails even politicians are joining the fray against kind of what's going on in the traditional financial system and the perceived unfairness that is happening so david that is definitely the topic for today's state of the nation and we're going to get right into that with cameron and tyler winklevoss in just a minute but before we do we want to tell you about our fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go

cameron winklevoss here they are the founders of the gemini exchange you know them as crypto advocates they are crypto visionaries for sure they were also involved in one of those social network projects back in the day but that is way less important than what we're talking about today which is crypto cameron tyler welcome back to bank list guys thanks for having us yeah thank you guys well the timing is i think particularly appropriate because i feel like the conversation that we're about to have has just hit main street in a way that it never has i just watched the interview that you guys did with with cnbc uh last week it was like i had to sign up for the free trial because they pay weld it i'm going to have to cancel that later but i was laughing the entire time because you guys were just spitting fire i don't think that the interviewers knew exactly what to do with it as you were pushing back against this establishment narrative and they kept focusing on the game stock uh stock itself the gamestop uh stock itself but is this more than about gamestop share price what is this whole thing really about yeah i think it's so much more than just a stock i really think it's ultimately about censorship and uh people controlling people right the establishment kind of controlling and i think this is kind of where um one of the interviewers kind of uh got very defensive when i sort of when i suggested that like hey people have been told like you can't go outside you can't go run your small business and now they're being told you can't trade um and you know i think people are just being tired of being told like you know you have permission to do this you don't have permission to do that and the power is is held by a very few hands whether it's a very few governors whether it's uh the robin hood trading app and the few people the big customers like a citadel leaning on them um people are sort of tired of being told what to do and i think it's a huge catalyst and eye opener for um defy ethereum bitcoin because uh they are permissionless and no one can make a phone call no one can lean on the ceo of ethereum or bitcoin because there's no such thing so it is open it's permissionless it's credibly neutral so all of these things that we keep seeing happening um uh you know aren't are not are not like the platforming and stuff can't happen there so i think people are just um they're exhausted they're tired they're fed up they're they're fighting back um and i think it's a great catalyst for um you know d5 ethereum and ultimately crypto yeah i think i think that's right i mean at its core it's it's much bigger than a stock or a ticker um it's really a protest and it's a lot of individual traders who historically have been sort of derided and spoken down to whether it's unsophisticated or quote retail or day traders or hobbyists or what have you and quite frankly the the irony of this particular situation is that they're the ones that played the better poker hand um they saw this potential gamma squeeze sitting out there in plain sight it was an airtight theory um melvin capital the hedge fund that got run over and lost something like 53 percent in the month of january the majority of which was result a result of the game time gamma squeeze was asleep at the wheel and or didn't sort of probabilistically take into account the chance that a lot of individuals on a reddit a subreddit board would coordinate a gamma squeeze but it was sort of sitting out there in plain sight and very clear what was going to happen with a smaller cap stock that was heavily shorted and to be clear it's not like melvin capital was um short selling or hedging a position the the i think that game stock was something like a 50 percent more short than outstanding float of shares so this was a really predatory type trade that was the the only goal was to completely drive gamestop into the ground it wasn't to sort of hedge risk it was to just decimate this company that's already sort of a sitting duck in the middle of a pandemic probably hasn't been able to operate many of their stores for for months or the foot traffic has been very limited i think they employ something like 15 000 people so this was this was a direct um attack to to pile drive a company and wall street bets crowd saw that behavior and took the other side and and won and and that's you know that's obviously the battleground but it's way more than that and i think to tyler's you know earlier earlier comments this is about um people saying look we're fed up and tired of needing permission to move our money to spend our money to use our money and that's really the ethos of sort of defy and permissionless finance at its core and i think um you know there is a modern money monopoly and it's been in place for for a hundred plus years and i think that's what's so fascinating about defy is is the permissionless nature and so as we sort of saw this this playing out i think it is um a huge sort of advertisement for defy and when we first got into bitcoin in 2012 i remember the cypress bailin in 2013 and it was this moment where basically the banks and cyprus became insolvent and instead of doing a bailout they did a bail in where they took a haircut of any depositor who had above 100 000 euros you just lost all of your money so let's say you had a million euros 900 000 of your euros just got taken uh by the government called a bailon and that was um a huge catalyst that sort of uh i don't think many people saw but bitcoin had its uh a really big bull run or run at that point because people uh saw firsthand what was possible and and realized that um their money isn't safe and i think the last you know the in the u.s executive order uh the i forget what number it is that fdr did in the in the 30s that basically confiscated uh you know gold holdings among citizens the problem is that we have um amnesia and people sort of forget um you go to wikipedia you can dig these things up and if you look at like the bitcoin subreddit it sort of floats around but nobody you know really remembers that or was around back then um so it takes these these moments like the gamestop moment the robin hood um where they they literally shut off one side of the market i mean if that's not manipulation i don't know what it is and and the the um excuse that hey we needed to post more collateral at our clearinghouse fine then just do fully capitalized trades or fully funded you know shut off the margin piece or shut off both sides imagine you know in the super bowl um which is going to happen i think in a week or so um if for one quarter uh you know one team said hey you can only play defense you can't score all you can do is prevent you know tom brady from scoring over the next quarter that's what happened on friday and people are just outraged by that um and i think that there needs to be a lot more answers but but really the answer is d5 at the end of the day you can go in and try and re-architect the existing system work with that establishment work with the suits or you can say wait a second we can just build all of this in a better way permissionless over in d5 let's get to work well said these are all topics we're going to dive into during our time with you guys we're going to definitely talk about the systemic risk definitely talk about whether this is defy's moment in mainstream and how defy can solve these problems you know maybe the first thing to touch on though i was very struck in the cnbc interview that the establishment really doesn't understand this wall street bets online community they just dismissed them as amateurs as greedy speculators uh they said barbarians they've been called barbarians before so this is day trading barbarians and and there's almost like this patronizing aspect when you keep here repeated on mainstream finance media this will all end in tears right yeah like as as it is it has for melvin capital well okay so like what what doesn't mainstream media and the establishment finance uh understand about these wall street bet style online communities so look i think you're absolutely right we've been gaslit by the establishment in the centralized media complex the way that they describe these um investors as you said as amateurs rookies but they're the ones who actually acted like the pros and melvin's the guys who acted like the amateur rookies right they didn't understand the gamma squeeze as much as these these rookie guys also look at the rhetoric of how they describe the behavior of the investing it's very pejorative they attacked the stock they rated this company when they talk about hedge funds actually attacking stocks and rating companies they use euphemisms like going short betting against so we're so we've been so conditioned to think the opposite of what it was actually true um so i think that's a huge problem and we all fall victim to it we've all been like indoctrinated but like it's actually opposite day what they're saying about the wall street's bets crowd is actually what they should be saying about the the the hedge fund crowd and vice versa the other thing is that like when you look at the way the system's set up um in terms of like financial sophistication the proxies that the sec rules use price out the little guy and we know um from our experiences in crypto that money is not a great indication of sophistication i guarantee you the wall street bets crowd understands cryptography hash functions how to assess um an investment in crypto a thousand times better than the folks at melvin capital or citron research or 0.72 i i would be so i wouldn't be surprised if they don't even know how to work a computer in those hedge funds right they're like just not tech shops and the wall street bets crowd are probably like e-gamers super fluent with computers um their whole lives in engineering kind of coders and so like you'd wanna you if you wanted to like bet behind someone in crypto or whatever you would do them yet because of the rules they're priced out of all of these great opportunities so retail never gets to look at uber or facebook as it's private because you have to be accredited to get into the funds that get into these companies so by the time they get it it's dumped onto them um after the ipo so the whole system is right i mean that's just one example of the little guy like demographically getting priced out because they're not sophisticated because of the size of their their wallet and and they never have the opportunity to increase the size of their wallet because they can't they don't have the permission to invest so it perpetuates the little guy staying the little guy and the big guys getting all the opportunities first so it's total and people are waking up to it and as soon as the little guy starts winning um they change the goal post or they call time out we need a break you know rain delay or something um i've never seen a hedge fund stopped in the middle of making too much money oh that hedge fund's just running away with it like george zoros is making too much money breaking the pound let's stop him um let's de-platform them from a bloomberg terminal you know like they did platform the wall street bets community from um from reddit from discord you know because of they weaponized the community guidelines you know they took some screenshots or something and said oh this is you know whatever i don't see any of the way we've been the the wall street bets community has been treated i've never seen that ever happen to an institution um a hedge fund or any any suit and i think that is what's so outrageous and we still don't know what happened no one's satisfied with the answer i've asked like all the people i can think of to ask people in crypto people in capital markets um people who just should know and nobody knows and how and like it's a week later so um you know anyway um yeah yeah and i would just add um by the way i don't think they got the platform from reddit um i think that might have been uh the channel went private but but discord definitely pulled the plug or the cord if you will uh pun intended and um i'm sure there's a lot of other folks trying to figure out how to how to unplug these guys as well i also kind of um the paternalistic sort of uh terminology like we're we're settling this to protect like the um traders and things like that and and you see a lot of the talking heads they get up and they're like well there's going to be tears at the end of this and bag holders and and who's to say that you know the wall street bets folks aren't sending a message and are fine parting ways with their capital and incinerating it in the process um i know that i've personally given to a lot of gofundme pages to help support restaurants and businesses during the pandemic i don't expect to see that money again and and it was a donation right and i'm just trying to support so who's to say these folks aren't who actually walk into gamestop and our customers aren't trying to support a business um so that a predatory capital like doesn't try and drive it into the ground uh and create a self-fulfilling prophecy how do we know that they're totally we don't know that you know we're making an assumption that they aren't totally fine um you know just supporting um right it could be their version of a gofundme page for gamestop and like i was saying earlier um many of them might even be employees of gamestop that have been furloughed during the pandemic because gamestop can't open as a business and it's a sitting dock and then so they're trying they're sitting at home they're trying to trade you know and save the company maybe they work for or patronize and actually shop at and they're told you can't do that so it's like how do you how do you win you know and i think that is like the fever pitch that's the outrage and the public support is so unanimously in favor of wall street bets except for if except for over at cnbc and the only reason that is because they they lionize and idolize the in a celebrity celebrification of um if that's even a word of these hedge fund managers because the hedge funds pay their advertising the hedge funds butter their bread um and that's why you know when they invite them on they they're like talking up to them they're looking up to them and they're they're celebrating them despite the fact that they've never innovated in their life they never created anything and these are the same folks that almost killed tesla right they almost like put the nail in the coffin for elon musk the greatest entrepreneur of our generation he's trying to save our planet with sustainable energy he's trying to get humanity to mars and these folks almost got him they they are parasites they they do they provide very very little service it's highly questionable um you know the fact that you could short um you know more than the float more than there are shares of a company is completely toxic completely destructive um and the only reason at cnbc to support it is because these folks pay their bills they you know and that's the issue and that's i think what you saw when that when john fort the the interviewer went off the rails um you know he was getting so defensive because uh i was striking a nerve you know like it's like tyler he was he he used this term he said that uh you were like almost fomenting populism is that fomenting populism what you're saying here i i think everything i i think was a fact i mean if facts are populism then then i guess so but um you know populism again it's like it feels outrageous sorry i was gonna say like but that alone feels like um uh talking down to people you know it's like oh you're the little guy you're the individuals you don't know any better let us tell you how to think let us tell you how to think about a stock and invest your money let me tell you what's good with good for you and people are tired of that you know and nobody does this better than hollywood celebrities they talk down to people they tell them how they should think what they should believe in um and that's why i love when ricky gervais hosts the globes because he just calls him out on it he's just like all right like take your award thank you god thank your agent and off like that was one of his jokes and it's like it's so true everybody's sitting at home like yes like okay stop talking down to us um and that's why um you know the ufc ratings um you know when meryl streep gets up there and it's sort of like you know it's called the arts it's not called martial arts ufc has like 10 times more ratings than the golden globes of the oscars because of the the arrogance and sort of the hubris and people are just tired of it you know i think it's a worthy conversation to talk about how much this became about something else other than the money and it immediately became about a message or a movement more than it was about you know some wall street bettors uh you know making a bunch of money right the the i've been following the wall street bets forum this weekend and there's so many like memes and just like you know cultural tidbits that came out of that community that was all about you know of course like talking about like not selling in diamond hands um and diamond hands is a is like a meme that they've generated for people that don't sell the stock because if people don't sell the stock then melvin capital continues to like burn money but like much of the conversation around people who had bought gme bought stock and became very wealthy turned to not being about the money but instead being about the message right many many people i saw were posting screenshots of them turning like ten thousand dollars into like a million ten million like some crazy amounts of numbers and they would make one of my one of the uh the famous uh one of my favorite memes out of that space was like this cartoon drawing of this girlfriend begging her boyfriend to sell so they can be millionaires but then the the boyfriend is like no it's about the message at this point no it's it's about like it's about sending melvin capital into it into the ground why do you guys think that this is turned in such a in such a uh because we also talk about the the oh wait financial crisis people talk about this is like uh just getting back for the 08 crisis why do you guys think that people were so prepared to turn this into a cultural message over a money-making opportunity well i think it's probably a lot related to the sort of the trust that's been broken and and we saw it you know in the financial crisis a lot of uh risk-taking by banks and then those same people who sort of perpetuated this crisis got uh bailouts and and uh help from the government for the most part um and nothing's really changed um and i think now sort of there's this tool where people can actually sort of get together and and send a message and i think the pandemic obviously like exacerbates everything because tensions are on you know increased and we see a lot of uh small businesses getting decimated you see sort of technology companies accruing a ton of you know uh value over the same period of time so there's this like tale of two cities um and and i think that um you know it's just it's just sort of the litter the latest manifestation of of sort of discontent and protest and i think that now uh you know there there's places where you can protest i think bitcoin is is a protest if you don't like what's happening with the fed if you don't like what the government's doing then don't buy bonds don't hold dollars go into bitcoin or go into ethereum and ethereum is you know d5 is literally re-architecting major financial services it's obviously pretty nascent and new but it can't be underestimated um or stated enough how powerful this is that you can go into uh defy post collateral and get a loan permissionlessly and there's no sort of credit check they're not going to look at who you are and and look at you know all of the things that a bank might find and try and block you from getting that loan uh and i think that um that is huge and so now sort of technology i guess is sort of meeting protest if you will in the sense that in 2008 um you know occupy wall street was sort of the protest against the financial crisis there wasn't a bitcoin bitcoin from what we can tell and what we've read came about through the backdrop and you uh the financial crisis if you look at the genesis block in 2009 um it talks about you know chancellor on the brink uh second bailout it's clearly making a reference to to the uh the crisis and so now bitcoin exists so we can go into things like bitcoin or ethereum to protest before you you really couldn't and your hands were tied and you could pretty much march you know but you couldn't actually uh vote with your capital you could really only vote with your feet or or protest and kind of do it in that in that sort of meet space forum now we can just do it really really uh easily with our wallets one thing i want to ask is is there's we still haven't finished this story right the wall street bets robin hood melvin capital story still playing out um yet there are there's more and more talk about how like it perhaps this it wasn't you know a phone call from melvin capital to like the ceo of robin hood to tell them to halt trading but it was instead about um robin hood's uh perhaps like insolvency and able to pay uh massive amounts of capital that they weren't expecting to pay and so perhaps perhaps we don't know where this story is still unfolding but there were perhaps more legitimate reasons as to why robin hood halted halted the buying yet not the selling of stocks uh specifically of the gme stock but to me that just brings up an even bigger question it's like why why do we have why why does one if one hedge fund and their over levered short position against gamestop why does that having systemic risks in uh the the economy like what's you guys take away message from there that like we actually have to start to tinker with like our ability to make and make buys and sells or else if we don't we'll collapse the economy what does that tell you about the state of things that we are in well i think the the truth is we we probably don't know um and we're still kind of learning as as things unfold here why that message uh which i think was delivered by robin hood's uh ceo on clubhouse at 10 uh 10 p.m pacific so 1 a.m eastern on a sunday or monday morning why it took days to sort of get that clarification out um you know at the worst it's just a horrible management of a crisis that literally impacts almost all of your users um you know could you have i think the trading was halted on thursday morning of last week so why not at 8 a.m say hey guys look um we've got this issue we've got to post more collateral and and these are the steps we're doing and these are why we're doing it um none of that was made clear for days um which is which is definitely a head scratcher um on one level i i think the the other point is it also doesn't it also doesn't explain like you halting the entire stock right halting only one side and it doesn't explain why they couldn't just halt margin and make it full reserve because there's no capital issues with the full reserve trade in the settlement um but and and i was just going to add the the other issues like you know they're who you know certain groups can lean on certain groups and they're there's like indirection and so maybe we will never really know what what the what the the true story is but i think it goes back to the the inherent problems with centralized system it only takes one or two phone calls to sort of put pressure on a certain group who then leans on another person that then says hey oh by the way we need three billion dollars worth of collateral like you know uh surprise um at 3 30 a.m you know on uh the night before a market open you're not going to say cameron just to just to break that down so like they probably only clear through one organization right so all it takes is a few like the head like i don't believe that citadel called them directly right they're too smart for that they and others would call the clearing organization and be like lean on these guys and because they have literally one clearing organization they they they have no choice you know to but to listen so the equivalent would be like a hedge fund calling the blockchain or the miners and being like don't push these transactions through or stop the blockchain we can't clear the bitcoin transaction to the theme transactions um that's when the name of risk and consumer protection of course yeah and in disorderly markets which mean which is code for markets we can't control or markets that are moving in a way that we that aren't that are not beneficial to us but like that's what happened right it's and that's the thing is like when you think of the blockchain that could never happen that's the beauty of it um and that is the vulnerability that this uh saga has laid bare with respect to centralized finance a few people make the decisions it's the same thing with centralized media a very few people control the media um i was having lunch with a friend and he was like yeah the media basically reports to three people rupert murdoch uh salzburger at the times and jeff bezos at the post so three people have a tremendous influence right and finance is no different like the banks even if if you if you've read the chapter in bitcoin billionaires where we go around and we're trying to place the shards in different security deposit boxes around the banks we actually had to like be very careful and low-key about our identity um because as soon as um someone and this happened a few times they're like oh winklevoss twins they'd google us they'd see we're involved in crypto or bitcoin and they would um even though they're not allowed to do this they would come up with reasons they're not allowed to ask you what are you putting in a security deposit box they're not say like is that a shard to a bitcoin private key um they're not allowed to ask you like what you're putting in there um but they would just uh mysteriously come with the reason why the box was no longer available or why we had to close a box that we had already opened because and some of these were regional banks but all of the banks because the banks are too big to fail they really kind of like report up to obviously the fed but a few of the bulge backup banks have all the power and position and bitcoin companies um in crypto companies when bitcoin became crypto with ethereum in 2013 always got our bank account shut down it is still um a big deal for gemiini which is a new york trust company that's regulated to win a bank relationship and open a bank account every time we do that it's like a big deal because we don't have that many um and and historically um that's been you know what what is for any startup to open a corporate bank account to receive fiat is pretty trivial um but that's like a huge thing if you're in the cannabis industry or are in the crypto industry and so as soon as you start seeing that and realizing that like a few people say like thumbs up thumbs down on you and it's the same thing with loans right like um i'm privileged enough to get a bank account anytime i want to qualify for a mortgage or whatever that is not the case for most people in this country definitely not in the world um and the stories are horrible right about people getting discriminated against for so many reasons the color of your skin you know whatever um and that's the beauty of d5 is the code doesn't discriminate the smart contracts don't discriminate they will take your money if you send the right amount of ether into ave or whatever um you know make or dao like no there's no person being like you you qualify we're going to an investment committee and and that's what people are waking up to is that like you can actually get access to credit like these basic financial services that b make or break whether or not you can create wealth for yourself and your family um generational wealth for yourself or your family and if you can't get a basic loan to start a business or mortgage on your house or even a place to store your your money or access to getting your money into like the financial markets which is for most people is very hard then you don't even send a chance you know if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card

protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate

order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at that's aave dot com you know what's so interesting about this and what you guys are saying because we we absolutely want to get to uh decentralized finances being part of the the solution here but it is just the i i guess the way uh fintech in particular platforms like robin hood have been positioned to us and positioned to like the millennial generation or you know gen x or even gen z democratizing finance was really how robin hood has positioned itself giving everybody the ability to go buy and sell a stock but we found out last week that that's really a lie this is not democratizing finance this is putting lipstick on a pig of an otherwise broken financial system that's not credibly neutral that's tilted in favor of the big interest and the hedge funds and that is not democratic is not for the people is completely a permission system can you talk about that a little bit more about i guess maybe the the lie or the untruth of the current apps that we use today in the in the current financial system that that we use today yeah this is go ahead karen that's definitely like the the rob right is that it's one thing if uh if a place says look we're we're just a brokerage house and we're gonna let you trade here but um it's really all of the marketing and the diff between reality and what they're actually doing i think is what really is is bothersome um so when they say hey we're a free app um trading's free it's actually not free and and when whenever you say an app is free really what that means is that you are the product the user is the product and the truth i think you guys have some experience with that right you guys would know certainly um the true customer of robin hood is citadel who buys all of the order flow and trade data of the users who trade on robinhood it's the same way social media works is it's free the users are actually the product they create all this value share all this personal data information that information is then taken and sold to the advertisers who are the true customers of that platform and that is really the key one of the key distinctions it's not about the people it's about the customer in the case of robinhood citadel in the case of social media the advertisers um and i think that is one of the sort of the big realizations and and what is also kind of fascinating is citadel in 2004 wrote a letter to the sec urging them to ban the practice of of payment for order flow basically saying look we think this is anti-competitive we think it's a huge conflict of interest between the broker and the customer we don't think it does right by the customer the the user of the platform um and then of course you fast forward today and citadel buys all the order flow from robinhood and and so there's a bit of go into a more detail as to why that is disadvantageous for the users like why why is how are the users actually being leveraged as a product in that scenario so i i'll tell you um okay so um in camera correctly if you you disagree but um payment for order flow so at robinhood the users are not trading against each other right their counterparty is actually one counterparty it's citadel robinhood doesn't charge any fees to you because they for you directly um but you you pay you get the price that citadels provides you so citadel pays robinhood a tremendous amount of money to interact with their customers and they give their customers a citadel turns around and gives the robin customers a very bad price so the diff of what citadel pays robinhood and the way they make up for it and more is they just give you a poor price when you're a buyer it's a higher price than it should be when you're a seller it's a lower price than it should be and robinhood just a month ago settled charges with the sec um that they misled customers and then actually customers were not getting um the national best bid offer best price which is a regulation that is required for broker dealers to provide for their customers so they were getting below um the the reg nms standard of what the price should have been from citadel so so they were allowing that they allow the funds to front run retail basically is what you're saying well that's that's the other issue is that not only does citadel give you a crappy price to make a ton of money on the spread of what the price actually is right they they just take that thing they have all of this information and i need to look at this a little bit closer to front run all of the order flow all the information so whatever's happening over robin hood all of a sudden informs them what's happening everywhere else in the market and they trade against that so there's tremendous unfair advantages for citadel they're just there's like if the price if the stock is let's say 10 bucks and you're trying to buy um they give it to you for 12. right so you buy two bucks higher but then they know that you're a buyer in the market they know how many buyers because there's all those people like they know how many buyers how many sellers and they can react to that at another exchange or with another brokerage house and so um this is just like highly controversial and even citadel itself thought so in 2004 we found a letter that is posted on the web sec website i tweeted this morning um it's it's like uh eight pages where they go in depth in how this is controversial unfair to the customer in 2004 and now they are they are uh they engage in this controversial behavior that even they themselves was said it was controversial that's exactly what they do today because it's so gosh darn profitable but going going back to um just sort of going back to the mission statement and and the marketing of robin hood i mean even the name robin hood right uh conjures up you know it harkens back to uh the the fairy tale of you know stealing from the rich to give the poor and that's you know they're doing the exact opposite um or or democratize trading anything but um let the people trade except for moves too much and and basically um that is i think also like it's not fintech it's really it's fin marketing um it's centralized finance with a different paint job um there's no new engine there's no better chassis it is literally a brokerage house that is mastered marketing and really bullshitting um and and they've been called out um and as tyler mentioned there there's there's um an sec enforcement um and and we'll see sort of what happens in this latest episode but it's just over and over breaches of trust oh hey we got caught red-handed we're really not about the customer we're about ourselves and building up this this uh you know uh business to then sell order flow to citadel and and the list sort of goes on and on and and it's really um at the end of the day um centralized finance with with better marketing and a um you know better paint job it should be called the sheriff of nottingham yeah um and this is one of my my issues with a lot of silicon valley companies is is or like the style of silicon valley companies is like heavy marketing right heavy growth and kind of misleading marketing you know i don't think people are feeling i believe other brokerage houses did halt some of the trading too and maybe did the same thing as robin hood um but like they weren't out there saying commission free trading we're all about the little guy this isn't about the rich getting richer um you know and and so the the double speak in the hypocrisy is a big part of it but the other issue here is that like these companies citadel included in robinhood have been fined at least multiple times but the fines are always worth it for them it's a slap on the wrist right yeah it's like a speeding ticket to a billionaire um nobody goes to jail the fines are like a small rounding error to the profits they make so any rational economic actor if they don't if they're unscrupulous and don't have ethics will happily take that trade and and that's what people are also realizing is that like that the penalties aren't large enough nobody's going to jail 08 crisis was created by the bankers the bankers always land on their feet because the bankers are the owners of the fed right the fed's like a hybrid public um private situation right the board of governors is i believe it's a you know government appointee but the banks are the stakeholders and the fed and you guys have talked about this before the canceling effect you know the money comes to them first they dump it into asset prices they quickly move it around um and and and then by the time it works its way through the economy to everybody else the wall street vets crowd they've had to suffer through and endure higher prices um and so it it perpetuates the inequality it's it's inflation for all but purchasing power for a few you know the the classic um uh you know the other recent example is wework right it's sort of masqueraded as a technology company even though shared co-working space has been around since regis created it i think in the 70s that it was obviously much more modernized at the end of the day though it was just um co-working space and you know it has all this ethos about community and and we the people or whatnot and then of course you find out the ceo was self-dealing and basically leasing buildings to himself um he trademarked the name we first you know and then sold it back to wework for six or seven million dollars uh he eventually like stepped off that when he was called out right before the ipo and at the end of the day it was sort of um a lot of smoke and mirrors and the person the people that got hammered on that would be like sort of the employee equity holders who got um smushed down when the company has to refinance the vcs will do probably fine um and they'll be okay but you have all these employees that put you know all this time into this company and and just the diff between what you say and what you do which is obviously the definition of integrity in a lot of these companies is is quite large really large and i think that's ultimately why people get so frustrated and outraged by it um and and i think that um i guess this is sort of another strength of defy and crypto is that there aren't um mouthpieces um satoshi not knowing who satoshi is is is such a strength and we're seeing that day by day satoshi will not be going on cnbc um and if vitalik you know decided to retire and go to the bahamas tomorrow ethereum will be just fine and and d5 will be just fine and that is such a big strength and even in the early days we we sort of felt that but then these things happen and you realize that um how how kind of critical that is there isn't a person or a figurehead that um that can become politicized or or or sort of d platformed or censored it's just not possible and and that is going to be a theme we're going to see more and more of and and it's what makes d5 so darn exciting okay well we're gonna get into d5 just a quick psa for bankless listeners uh guys don't buy crypto on robin hood all right just don't if you don't have the ability to withdraw your crypto to an ethereum address or a bitcoin address you don't own it they can de-list trading on your crypto just like they delisted uh buying or selling uh gamestop stock so don't do that go to a real exchange guys let's talk about this in your cnbc interview i don't think the interviewers knew what to make of this but you said that the energy from this wall street bets thing was going to be pulled into d5 you called this the beginning of the end of centralized finance you said things like on ethereum that would never happen i loved like the reaction from the from the host when you said things like that but let's talk about this is this going to be a big moment for d5 does d5 fix this and will crypto absorb some of the energy of of this movement how does it play out in your minds yeah i mean it was definitely a gamestop is i think a threshold moment um and and i don't know like defy um you know it's still a fight on sort of the turf of the original the establishment um and ultimately rather than sort of running uphill against the establishment i think a lot of people that energy pours into defy where where it sort of doesn't so much as fix it but it's no longer a problem right there is no establishment to deal with or centralized counterparties and things like that and i think it is a very um it's where it's all going i mean d5 is sort of the the end game and it's where it sort of stops um and i think a lot of this energy pours in there um because of this and there's going to be more and more examples along the way but i think this is definitely one of those moments where where people are understanding um just like when you see the money printing at some point you know your p a lot of people are going to step back and say what is these dollars actually worth and i think people are realizing that wait i don't really have full control over the equities in my brokerage account i actually don't really own these things i mean i do technically but it can be the the the uh goal posts and dependencies carpet yeah the carpet can be pulled and stuff like that so i i do think that this is this has um turned on a lot of light bulbs for people um with respect to d5 yeah and one thing um so i've gotten dm from people with questions um you know how do i move my crypto out of robin hood is there any way to move it without selling it and the answer is no as you pointed out which is super scary um because you know it's stuck and you have to convert it to cash that's actually a taxable event so if you have let's say if you have um bitcoin at gemini and it goes up you know 10 times or something and you want to move it to coinbase you can do that without having to sell into into fiat and you don't and you don't have to pay taxes if you had to sell that into cash that conversion moment um you'd have to pay taxes on those gains then re-buy back bitcoin move wire the cash out of robin hood and then re-buy bitcoin on gemini or coinbase so again it's it's a terrible experience for the user um it's it's literally everything they market is the opposite i was reading mark cuban's tweet the other day um about how the all the margin fees that robin hood gets for you when you lend a stock goes to them so there's actually like they're they're like a terrible brokerage house and the deal is terrible for people it's just snazzy marketing and the power of a simple um easy to use user interface and user experience but like everything else is like completely against the little guy um so that's just another another um there's when people start to look um under the hood they're just sort of horrified at how um how used in abuse they have been by by robin hood and even even down the fact that like they thought they were buying crypto when in reality when when uh you know they they weren't and when they tried to leave robin hood they you know it's like they they were stuck in jail and they had to like break out of jail and so it's these walled clothes gardens um you know that the platforming of discord the platforming um was a big scandalous news story you know a couple weeks ago and now it's sort of like business as usual like when goes bad like you know the establishment just turns around and deplatforms you um privacy was like this hot best button issue right with facebook cambridge analytica um and then like all of a sudden de-platforming is just like um table stakes um when things don't go the way for um these companies or the establishment or whatever and it's a really dangerous slippery soap um i saw a friend talking about um like the parlor d platforming right um and a lot of people most people are are for um the wall street bets crowd and are upset that they would get the platform maybe from discord um but that's exactly what happened to parlor you know and they were for it over there and now they're not for here and i don't know the details right of what happened but i have heard that like as much of the the violence or some of the sort of the capitol hill stuff um that i completely disagree with like violence is horrible should be condemned on any level um but that was organized as much or more on facebook and twitter as it was in parlor um so they're sort of a double standard they're sort of hypocrisy and when it suits you over here that's okay but you got to be careful because that can also be used in another situation where it doesn't suit you um and so i guess it's just a slippery slope and i think people are also wising up to that and sort of the precedent um and of course like you can't make you can't make the call to ethereum you can't make the call to bitcoin so that's the power of it and this is really waking people up i want to ask a kind of a general directional question because i i have uh just there's a bunch of different things that we can that we've talked about and we can talk about um and one of the one of the things i want to get to is like we all talk about you know ethereum fixes this d5 fixes this but you can't actually buy gamestop on ethereum right and actually interestingly the wall street bets subreddit is actually relatively anti-crypto uh we we made a post in there asking if any community members wanted to come chit chat on bank list and our post got removed because we used the word ethereum um and and like i said like you actually can't buy you can't buy stocks on ethereum that's not what ethereum does it's something else yet at the same time we have people like soulja boy minting nfts on ethereum and we have elon musk with bitcoin in his uh in his twitter and twitter bio so like things definitely seem to be moving yet also it seems all things also seem to be just kind of going in a totally different direction how do you guys i guess this is more of a 2021 what do you guys see coming question how do you guys see these different you know dynamics coming where some people are adopting ethereum ethereum but it also isn't ready to support like the massive amounts of trading activity that one would expect out of like some some you know a hedge fund in wall street beds like wait where are you guys seeing all these people come into ethereum come into defy coming to bitcoin yet also not really be like having the tools to mimic their legacy markets experience well i think um i think that there's definitely synthetic stocks already on ethereum in some form or capacity and a handful yeah i would imagine that that is going to only increase quite a bit and and obviously the the sort of defies in this this um sort of um position where you're going to get more in centralized finance in terms of like you know ability to trade there's it's an easier user experience today right you have to be kind of motivated to get into d5 and access these newer projects and things like that but that will change dramatically the same way the internet connecting the internet in the 90s was a much different prospect and experience than it is today so the on-ramps are going to become easier better uis and eventually be on par if not better so it's it's it's a very sort of new technology in space that i think that is part of it so it's not going to happen overnight and there's still going to be people who focus on ease of use and say you know i'm willing to deal with that and take the risks of a centralized platform and i can just live with the fact you're going to see many many people that will be in that camp at least today but eventually it'll all move for the same reason you know a lot of people were totally fine with aol being their internet experience for for many many years and and quite frankly some people still use aol email um but eventually it became really clear that the open internet at least at that time period was 10x better and that google offered a much better search engine and that gmail is a much better mail client um and and so forth and so it won't happen overnight but it's going to happen quicker than people probably think um and then look some people um i think in the wall street bets crowd are are really focused on sticking it to the establishment on their turf um the establishment isn't in it isn't in d5 so you can't really do that um though potentially a synthetic eventually is going to be linked to the underlying in in cfi so so there may be some interesting dynamics there but if your goal is to stick it to the man um in in c5 then that's going to be where you're going to play but i think that the majority of people really want better tools they want permissionless finance um ultimately and that's the direction they want to go in right you can you can sort of protest and keep like marching on c5 or you can just go build the next frontier um and say look we're just going to reimagine this whole space and i think that's where ultimately the motivation of most people are um they're just gonna say this is just better we're not gonna worry about this old dinosaur we're not gonna try and re uh renovate aol we're just we're just gonna go over here and build on this this new frontier so i think that's where it goes um that's that's the end game but i think in the in the near term there's going to be a lot of turf wars and and we're seeing that with silver right now um and uh so you know there's some people who say look like not so fast like let's finish the game stop protest so to speak um and so there's this division in the community on on what the right time is and where the focal point is what fascinates me about the silver squeeze or the potential is is you know it's unclear who's on like the the short side of silver and who the losers are there um i think likely there's precious metal deaths at banks that are probably short silver um and and there's other people that we probably don't know about and i'm sure there's people hedge funds that are long silver and would benefit on a silver squeeze but all of that said it's unclear necessarily and it probably there will never be like a clear winner or loser but what's fascinating is that there's likely there's a hypothesis that there's much more paper claims to silver than actual underlying physical silver and nobody really knows who has what or what claims are you know to silver and it's incredibly opaque and um and so even if a small percentage of people start buying physical silver and or paper and they force delivery where people have to actually come up with the physical silver it could be really really dramatic and we're gonna learn just how real the market is um and and what's kind of mind-blowing so i think if there is a squeeze then the next uh step will be to turn to the gold market and say how real is this you know how much paper versus physical underlying is there and in cameron isn't it um like one of the important things to explain is that a lot of people might buy like a silver futures or gold futures and they don't actually take delivery in the underlying asset they take delivery in cash or they keep rolling it so um if if a bunch of people say hey i'm actually gonna buy this paper silver paper and i'm gonna take delivery of the silver then people have to find the silver and actually deliver it and deliver the asset and cough it up and there could be they there could they could fall short of it if there's more paper than there is actually silver in the world or gold in the world then people will be sitting there waiting for the delivery and it won't happen right and and so testing the hypothesis of like how much paper is out there versus the physical underlying i think is fascinating and if it does happen there i think the next stop is gold and then um that gets has huge ramifications because any country that is sort of de-dollarized and heavy on gold or central banks that have big gold holdings um they could be in trouble right if it's proven that there's way more paper and nobody really knows and so then it ultimately goes to to crypto because blockchains actually fix this bitcoin ethereum fixes this this is just a story of insolvency left and right it's like does does melvin capital you know are they able to come up with enough gme shares to cover their shorts like no because there's 140 short interest now is there enough silver in the world to cover all of these paper contracts for silver perhaps not um what i'm seeing this left and right is like there are so there's so much financial engineering and so many contracts that need to be fulfilled on top of the underlying that there's there's a quote unquote run on the bank or instead it's a quote-unquote run-on gme or a run-on silver or a run on gold it's the the patterns here are fascinating to me right and everyone looks at krypto and says that's not real money that's not real like when the the centralized system is completely mythology and illusion nobody actually knows and we might actually find out like yeah do the do the assets and the liabilities match up with um with silver or gold or gme we know that like gme is yeah the fact that you can short more than there are shares uh is such a farce um but that's like the real financial respectable world in crypto like we know the float of bitcoin you know like there's no more no less and everyone can point to the blockchain or everyone point to the ethereum blockchain and see what ether is there and like when you send an ether it actually settles on the atomistic level like i actually get it there's never a question in my mind that's that's the power that people are uh are are understanding right now and and with with open finance of course all of this is out in the open it's completely transparent to everybody what what strikes me about this whole thing and what you're saying is basically so if folks weren't totally following what cameron and tyler were talking about is this wall street bets crowd is essentially going to the the next asset that it thinks is um underpriced or that there might be some you know hedge fund shenanigans going on and taking that out yeah this is a very healthy market forces thing and you'd think that the capitalists at cnbc would be all for market forces correcting the market and bringing more integrity to these markets because that's what the wall street bets crowd is trying to figure out and look they'll be successful if they find there's some shenanigans going on they might move from silver to gold and then eventually find their way to crypto so here's the interesting thing to me is if i am in traditional finance i'm part of the establishment i am a hedge fund i might be shaking in my boots like i might be like reevaluating all of my positions and i might be logging on to wall street bets and trying to figure out what this reddit crowd is going to come pounce on next because i could be the recipient of some of that energy and if i've got some like bad positions outstanding if i have some skeletons in the closet i'm shaking in my boots right now because i don't know if they're coming after me next which is actually pretty healthy i think this is restoring some sanity to the markets quite yeah possibly mean it's it's it's like a penetration test they're like stress testing the system and and like they're like the ultimate auditor um and i think that the the um the movement into dogecoin is really fascinating because i i see it more as a as a protest it's like as much of a protest as like um satoshi creating bitcoin in a way in the in the backdrop in the wake of the 2008 uh crisis it's like we're gonna build this other system and um going to doge is like you know what like we're tired of people telling us what money is we're tired of the the modern money monopoly and you being like you can trade here or you must use this currency and the people are saying we determine what the currency is if we think it's cigarettes or stones or shells or dogecoin well then it is you know and it's it kind of goes to the the austrian chicago school of thought of like money being emergent and what what uh you know free market forces not coercive like fiat currency and um emerging based on what the people all agree and say it is um and it's sort of like a reaction to like you told us you can't trade you tell us we have to do this no no like we make we make our own rules and there's like and and you see it everywhere it's sort of like people are realizing like wait i don't have to sit in new york la or san francisco until i retire to move to somewhere else i can actually work remote i have autonomy i have severality um you know like we're learning so much about like our freedoms and our independence you know whether it's like working remote or like what money might be and people are just reacting and i think it's all related yep no that's that's those are all i i agree with all those points and um i think that um you know fiat money has has a tremendous uh um sort of tailwind uh from the legal protections and requirements and obligations to pay your taxes in u.s dollars as a merchant to accept u.s dollars um crypto uh has none of that and so it's it's truly emergent there's no uh government authority saying you must or you need to use this in fact a lot of them are saying the exact opposite like be careful watch out don't do this it's scary and it's truly emergent in organic money in that respect and i think that that is is really fascinating and and money is ultimately in the eye of the beholder um and and so if people determine that dogecoin is is money i guess it's money you know if they believe it if enough people believe it and are willing to accept it and use it then it's then it's money and and that's one of the hardest things i think people have with you know crypto bitcoin ether is like understanding what what where's the value how do you value this thing or intrinsic value that's like another great sort of classic traditional finance uh buzzword to to try and like value something or discredit you know there but there's no there's no intrinsic value in in bitcoin or ethereum really there's no cash flow um there's no cash flow um and and and i think all of that is sort of being dispelled quickly um in short order but it is it is really interesting and and and the wall street bets um those message boards i think grew by six million people in the past week alone it's pretty pretty staggering and i guarantee you uh some of those people are are definitely hedge fund suits and people who are going in there and saying okay what what is going on here and and incorporating it into the risk models and say hey wait a second um we we better not you know over short uh a stock because you know we we could uh you know uh get on these guys radars um i mean it's one thing to to sort of hedge and and you know have a point of view it's another to sort of go 50 over the float um and that's that's the predatory you know element that that melvin engaged in that that everybody got so so worked up about guys david has called this event the starting pistol for what could be next with decentralized finance the people are certainly waking up um i don't think your message is is populist i think the cantelon effect the money printing i think that the banning gamestop from robin robin hood that fuels populism i think the people want these outlets and they shouldn't be de-platformed from their social media channels or from their financial system guys i don't think this is the first time that we're gonna have you uh on in 2021 because hopefully you'll come back because there's just so much going on it has been an absolute pleasure to have you you want to end with this i know gemini is rolling out some cool things david and i are on the waiting list for a new gemini credit card can you talk about what you have in the works with 2021 and when david and i can uh can look forward to getting that credit card in our wallets sure yeah we're really excited about that um and i think that uh it really struck a chord i mean we can sort of tell from from kind of the activity on twitter or the dms i'm getting or even just text messages from friends um people seem to be really excited about this um idea of being able to uh earn crypto when when you spend your your us dollars and really train it's almost like a transfer right and and investing while you spend um and it's it's a behavior that we all have right we're all used to swiping our cards or apple paying into or or google pay or what have you so there's like no change of behavior and it's a really easy way to start stacking sats um and and um and and or whatever crypto whether it's ethereum or or uh that gemini supports so it was really interesting and we think this is this this could be very much like a mainstream moment a way to onboard a lot more people um and kind of demystify and sort of i think one of the biggest questions we so a huge misconception is people don't understand that you can buy a fraction of these coins that's still people don't understand it's not that's how early we are yeah that's crazy yeah so um it's like berkshire hathaway when people see the class a they're like i can't buy 400 000 worth of one share at berkshire and i think a lot of people still literally uh see 30 000 bitcoin say i'll never own a bitcoin i guess i'm going to go elsewhere or ethereum at you know 1400 i can't afford that and the truth is as we know you can buy a fraction right so it allows people to sort of get in uh with little bites um and i think that that's really helpful and then the other question people have is like well when do i buy is it going to retrace is it going up down whatever of course you know um it's it's impossible to time these things even if you're professional and this is all you do all day long so it takes away that question and it just becomes like a a reoccurring buy order really and i think those two things are really powerful and they're captured with the credit card moment um and and so uh yeah we're looking forward to launching it um soon well i think my favorite feature about this is that it is uh selling dollars for i mean for me for buying ether right whenever i swipe that whenever i swipe that credit card dollars i'm selling dollars and i'm buying ether so i'm demonetizing the dollar and i'm monetizing the ether by putting the ether onto my personal balance sheet i think that's a great feature i'm looking forward to swiping that gemini credit card yeah and and the the cool thing about that is that it's a three pers up to three percent back right so you could get ether um so you go to best buy you get a flat screen tv or something but i think three percent of ether long term could easily be worth more than the tv itself and fiat so you're getting rid of your tr your cash's trash you're investing in your future your financial uh you know independence um and and that like you know little bit of ether actually has a chance to appreciate to being worth more than the purchase itself as opposed to getting airline miles would just encourage you to well hard to travel right now but encourage you to spend go somewhere and spend more or super inflationary they're super inflationary i mean in in or these gimmicky points where like it's so black box like what's the market cap they're centrally controlled amex can just print more it's the same issue with like the silver market you know we don't really know how much there's there are so these these things um you know it's it's like it's like game stop you can short more than actually exist or how many points are there what are they worth what's the exchange rate it's a total joke and it's not um you know super productive for the consumer but actually turning transforming spending into investing in your future is so much more constructive absolutely well guys if you've gotten one thing out of this it's definitely to stay tuned to what's coming with this gainstop thing this is definitely the the starting pistol and also if you are using a fintech type of uh platform beware of d platforming get going with some crypto native exchanges and crypto native tools move your funds don't buy crypto in um in places like robin hood where you don't actually own it guys thanks so much for joining us on bankless and and sharing this story we are looking forward to seeing how 2021 develops thanks so much for having us
