you've got a spectrum here right where you have like totally on chain something like what avastar's has done then you have like some centralized server and then as you kind of move towards the middle of these two extremes you have like probably an ipfs storage thing sure so i mean you know cryptokitties is a good example of you know there's a minimal amount of stuff stored on chain and there's nfts that are worse than that that have nothing stored on chain the next step would be something like what board apes launched with where they had an ipfs link to the apes and then they added um they basically you can pin the ipfs hashes to our weave now so r weave is a blockchain that claims that you're able to store something once for up to 200 years or more you pay once in store forever um so that's a form of on chain it's not as strong as like that last step which is something like autoglyphs um avastars the art and the metadata are stored 100 on the blockchain there's no external dependencies you literally as long as there's one node of ethereum running in 500 years you could go back and piece together any of those projects like completely from the smart contract
