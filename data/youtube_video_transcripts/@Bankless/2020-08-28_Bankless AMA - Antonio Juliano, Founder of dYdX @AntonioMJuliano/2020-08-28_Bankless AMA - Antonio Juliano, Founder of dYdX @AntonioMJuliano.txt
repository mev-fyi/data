three two one bankless nation welcome to our second live video ama i am joined by dydx's antonio giuliano who is the founder of dydx just hold on one minute i'm gonna mute myself on youtube i hear it i hear an echo but i'm good now antonio how are you doing welcome to the bankless nation are you ready to be put on the hot seat you ready for some ama questions sir doing well yeah i'm ready excited excited to answer everybody's questions awesome all right so i think this is actually the first time that we've had you um in front of the bank list nation in like podcast forum or anything but we've run a number of articles about dydx specifically uh some of the perpetual features and things that we want to dig into today i'm sure the community will want to dig into as well so um i'd love to start with an introduction before we do so though uh a few housekeeping items so first if you are tuning in live on periscope um head on over to the youtube channel that way we can see some of your questions as they come in and get those questions answered um this is an ama so it's interactive so if you have questions for antonio during the conversation please go ahead and post those on youtube also for the bankless nation members who are in discord you can post questions in discord as well you can also join us in zoom we will try to prioritize your questions uh first and this is probably going to go about an hour so it is 2 p.m eastern for me uh we'll probably go until 3 p.m eastern so we'll try to like throw in kind of a you know half time and uh you know 15 minutes left signals for you so you can get all your questions in so that's it as far as housekeeping antonio let's um continue with an introduction so how the heck did you find yourself in krypto sir yeah absolutely so how did i find myself in crypto i've been in crypto for a little over five years now actually pretty much my entire uh professional career i've been in crypto and the way i got into crypto was different than i'd say the way most other people got into crypto um so i started my career at coinbase i was a software engineer there and that was basically my first job right at the college and i got to coinbase very differently than how pretty much everybody else got to coinbase like most people were like super into bitcoin which was like basically all there was at the time um and that kind of naturally led them to working at coinbase but i didn't know anything about cryptocurrency um and then coinbase was just kind of one of the like 20 companies i applied to my senior year of college but i was really impressed with them really impressed with like their interview process they kind of do this like unique thing in their interview process which dydx also does which is like called a work trial so like basically uh during my senior year of college they like flew me out to san francisco and i basically just like peaced out on classes for a week um and then i like worked full-time at coinbase for my work trial and was just really excited about everybody's enthusiasm for for bitcoin and like the space and i had no idea what it was but like clearly these people were like very smart and like very passionate about it um so kind of just decided to take a leap of faith and go work with these people on this crazy thing so this was kind of like random chance of the universe right that like yeah just got interested okay yeah and what did your family think when you told them hey i'm gonna like of all of the uh companies i could join i'm gonna do the bitcoin thing what did your family think about that decision they certainly had a lot of questions i've probably explained bitcoin as probably a lot of you all have as well uh it's my family like a million times um but yeah they were definitely pretty supportive of it um i mean i think of that coinbase at that time like coinbase was like kind of a legit company like they'd raised like a good amount of money at that point so it was like okay clearly there's like something going on here we don't quite understand what's going on um but this like seems like a reasonable company so yeah go do your thing um and i guess they they were definitely supportive of it that was quite the start okay so you're you're at coinbase your first job sort of out of college uh you're getting a feel for it your first exposure to crypto it sounds like you fell down the rabbit hole there in some way and then went even deeper so so then what happened you're right when you're at coinbase yeah absolutely so i joined coinbase and just coinbase at the time had a lot of just like the absolutely best people like a lot of them in crypto at the space were like all at coinbase like during that time this was like back in 2015 or so so it was a really great place to be and it was basically just like you know i think we still do this at dydx but especially then at coinbase like we just talked about like bitcoin like literally all the time and he's like hyped up on like the price and stuff like that and like things that were going on in the space um and it really just felt like this little like i don't know like club almost where it's like we were all super excited about this thing that nobody else like even knew what it was um so we all just talked about it quite a lot and it was like you got to like listen to things like olaf like carlson wii like giving like a presentation over lunch like fred or some like you know giving a presentation on ethereum early on and then i think like the thing that really did it for me in terms of like just really selling me on the space um was ethereum uh probably like it was for again like a lot of you um but but basically at the time that was like right when ethereum was kind of coming out like the ethereum ico happens um you know the main net network was launched like during my time at coinbase and then coinbase also uh started supporting eth as their like second crypto asset after bitcoin during my time at coinbase and this was like really a big change for all of us like at coinbase at the time because like i've been saying it was basically like 100 percent like interest in bitcoin at the time and it was just like 100 clear to us that like bitcoin would be the only interesting cryptocurrency ever because like of course it like has the network effects like if there are any other cryptocurrency that we're doing something interesting like obviously why wouldn't bitcoin like just adopt the features um and then like start doing itself it itself with its like bigger network effects so it was just 100 clear to us that bitcoin was going to be the only interesting thing ever in cryptocurrency and of course we were wrong um and you know let's see we can all know what's happened since then but during this kind of like the launch of ethereum uh you know that's when i think it took all of us just a long time to like wrap our heads around like what exactly like ethereum was and just kind of this concept that like you can write these programs that execute deterministically like on a blockchain and they can be anything right like it's totally its own like smart contracting language and everything like that and i think it took me probably like six months or so to like really wrap my head around that and just had a really great opportunity to like be at the forefront of like like i said like olaf and fred like giving presentations like we've had vitalik come in really early on and like talk to us about smart contracts we had like joey krug like come in and give us like a walk through on like creating like our first smart contract all that kind of stuff um and then after i feel like i kind of wrapped my head around like ethereum and that you could just for the first time create these programs that execute on like this totally permissionless decentralized ledger it really just struck me that this is just like a paradigm change in computing like period and that's like what really like got me excited about like working in the space very cool all right so uh programmable money use cases i guess pulled you the rest of the way down the rabbit hole so antonio i want to get to the questions because this is for the bankless nation to ask you questions and i've got a first question from um jesus perez in the bankless community and he wants to know to understand the differences between perpetuals and margin trading so like when to use margin trading and when to use perpetuals specifically and you know what i think would be useful too as maybe we can use this question to to start with but is for you later to maybe describe some of the core products that dydx actually has because we have a lot of people here that are very familiar with d5 very familiar with crypto but um they haven't necessarily used some of these sorts of you know perpetual products and margin products that are pretty standard in uh in other areas of traditional finance so why don't you start with that question of when to use margin trading and when to use perpetuals what's the difference yeah absolutely i can start with that and maybe actually i'll just start with just kind of like the products that dydx offers and then just describe like you know how they work and then like when to use them so so yeah dydx basically is obviously a decentralized exchange but our main wheelhouse and what we're kind of focusing on is more advanced types of financial products so we have three well actually we have five main products on the exchange so we like support quite a lot of stuff um so first is just spot trading if that sounds fancy to you it's not it's basically just like buying and selling like you would do like on a unit swap or a zero x or like anything else you can do that on gydx2 um the other two kind of more basic things that you can do are you can lend funds very similar to like the compounds you just kind of deposit your funds on dydx they passively earn interest over time they're kind of like lentil to margin traders you can borrow funds directly to your wallet again very similar to like what you can do on a compound um so these are kind of like the three things that we support that are like relatively standard like in the d5 space like you've probably done them on other decentralized platforms but like our a real kind of like the special sauce of dydx is these more advanced financial products and those two are margin trading and then perpetual straining as you just mentioned um so kind of getting into like what each of those are in turn so margin trading all it is is trading with borrowed funds so and you basically will use that to acquire leverage on cryptocurrency and all leverages it sounds fancy but the best way to think about it is you basically just multiply your gains or losses by like a certain multiplier and you can also like take short positions on cryptocurrencies so dydx makes this like really easy to do on our margin product uh you can go basically like up to 5x long or up to 4x short um on ethereum and then die in usdc or what we support there right now um and basically what's going on behind the scenes is when you're kind of trading on the margin product you're interacting with like the landing and borrowing pools to just basically like borrow funds behind the scenes and that's how you kind of acquire the leverage so that's the first product the second product before we get to the perpetuals antonio just a quick recap so you've got spot trading and then you've got lending and borrowing and those first three were they necessary in order to build the fourth that you were talking about which is the the margin trading piece yeah yeah that's a great point actually and they basically were necessary to kind of build the other points uh maybe if i were to like take a step back and just like say how i like think about like the d5 space and then just kind of like finance in general so i really think of like d5 and then like finance in general as like a stack so it's basically like at the base layer of the stack you have things like money so things like crypto assets which like bitcoin and ethereum kind of came out first and then like the next thing in the stack is like decentralized exchanges or like lending platforms and you can't have those right without like the bottom thing which is like decentralized asset to trade so that's kind of like things like a uniswap 0x like compounds kind of fit in that like second layer of like e5 financial stack if you will and then like on top of that i really think about like more advanced types of products so things like margin trading things like derivatives trading and that can exist without like buying and selling can't exist without like lending and borrowing which you know can't exist without the assets themselves so it's like really like you kind of need the like things like lower in the stack to like to support the higher things um and that's like why we support like all of those things uh it's kind of like like you say like we basically need to support like lending and borrowing and obviously like trading itself to be able to support margin trading and that's super cool because it's not just dydx that has to build those like core pieces in order to get to margin trading and derivatives it's basically the entire defi system that's building those it's like it's no accident that one of the first d5 use cases something like maker which was a borrowing and lending platform um so that's super cool now before we leave margin and go to perpetual i want to make sure we're solid on margin right so you used um two words there you used uh one long so i went long something right and the other short so does that just basically mean if i'm longing something i am borrowing some um some asset against my collateral and i'm making a concentrated bet to amplify my gains if i'm right if it go if number goes up i get more gains right but i'm putting myself at risk is that what longing is and then maybe you could describe shorting yeah absolutely so longing is just like you make money when the price goes up shorting is just like you make more money when the price goes more money when the price goes up important exactly you make more money when the price goes up um and then yeah shorting is you make money when the price goes down potentially it's a multiplier but the reason you might want to do like margin trading or more broadly just like trading on leverage which actually you can do through the margin product and also through the perpetual product which we'll get to but just kind of like the concept of leverage or like why you might want to use it in the first place um is say you are holding a hundred dollars worth of ethereum you could you know be your hodler just kind of like keep it in your wallet you're absolutely convinced that like the price of ethereum is like going to the moon uh so like why would you not just like hold your ether in your wallet it's like that's great good for you you'll make some money if you're right and like the price of ethereum goes up but kind of the reason you might want to use leverage like on top of that um is you can make even more money as you as you just said uh if the price goes up in kind of you're right it's also important to call out that this is not free it's like you're also exposing yourself to kind of increased losses if the price if you're wrong and like the price goes down but just kind of like this example of say you have a hundred dollars worth of ethereum say you used a 5x leverage to kind of take a 5x leveraged long position on that ethereum it's basically now like your gains like if you're right are multiplied by five so say in this example you're 100 worth of ethereum the price of these doubles and now that would have been worth two hundred dollars if you had just like held it like in your account um in this kind of new leveraged world where like you basically are multiplying your gains so in like the normal case we just hold you you make 100 so you're like 2x um and then kind of the leverage case if you like would have doubled your money uh and now since you're multiplying by like the 5x leverage you make 10x gains um so it's basically like you just like multiply the gains you otherwise would have made um and kind of the exchange for that is is taking on more risk and it would have gone in reverse right so like this isn't a free lunch like if it goes down you can also 10x your losses right and and can you also comment on like the the collateral requirements and also the risk risks of liquidation absolutely so the way uh our contracts work is kind of similar to like a maker contract or like a compound contract they require on the margin side uh fully over collateralized borrows um but it's basically like you can use the ethereum that you come to the platform with like as margin so let's maybe just walk through like a really simple example of how it would work so here you are with your 100 let's say you're like one eth um and you're long you're you're hodler but you've decided that you want to use leverage uh you basically would come to the dydx platform with your one heath and you're like okay i'm super convinced that each is going to go up let's take the 5x leverage long position uh you basically top down your one each as margin deposit and then you borrow some stable coin under the hood this is all very simple actually kind of the product interface is basically just like you put in like you know i want to go like five e flat one each like leverage long at like 5x but like what's going on under the hood is you're actually borrowing some stable coin so you're borrowing say like another four eth's worth of like die or usdc and then you use those borrowed funds to buy four more eth to like put on top of that one that you put up as margin deposit so now you have kind of like 5e sitting here in your account you're borrowing you still have to repay your borrow that you borrowed in kind of the stable coin once you close your position but that's kind of inherently where the leverage comes from and what's going on under the hood and there's also a fee involved as well right and so can you talk about where the fee component fits in sure like the interest rates or yes exactly right yeah yeah so exactly uh very similar to how if you're you know taking a loan on like literally any financial platform uh you people are not just going to let you borrow money for free probably um so it's like you basically have to pay them some interest rate so now let's continue with our example so you now you're sitting here with your 5x leverage long position uh under the hood what's going on is there's five eth like in the dydx smart contracts locked in your account and then the dydx smart contracts basically also remember that you have to say pay back the like uh let's say like 2000 uh die uh that you kind of borrowed to buy like the other four eth in the first place and basically you have to pay like the longer you hold this position the more interest you'll have to pay and you'll have to pay a dynamic interest rate it's again very similar to how compound works with kind of its variable interest rates over time and interest rates just kind of vary again similar to compound uh based on like the supply and demand for the pool but there is some like interest that you'll have to pay to basically be able to hold this position the other cool thing about dydx though is in addition to paying interest on the amount that you're borrowing you're also earning interest on the amount that you have like in collateral on your position so simultaneously so since you're borrowing the die in this example let's say you're paying interest on that die with whatever the interest rate is there but you're also earning interest rate on your eth that you have like locked up as collateral so the system works very well in that regard normally like the interest rates on stable coins are higher than the interest rates you would see on each at least like historically so normally if you're taking a long position you'll be paying interest but actually it's kind of cool like if you take a short position a lot of the time you'll you'll be earning interest on the platform and kind of the platform will show you like how much interest you're earning or paying and then maybe the last piece to cover on that is what happens in the event of a margin call yeah so in the events of a margin call and this is again very similar to basically what happens on like a compound or a maker dial if you've used any of those platforms before but in the events of a margin call so let's say like in our example like you again like you have this five eth like locked here and then you're borrowing like the 2000 die um and basically what our smart contracts will enforce is that the value of this 5e always has to be greater than like the value of this 2000 die or else like you know you may have like lost the smart contract itself like may have lost money on the trade so let's say you went long sadly you were wrong like the price of eve is like going down instead of up as you had hoped um and it gets down to the point where now your 5e is worth just like a little bit more than like the 2000 die that you had borrowed so it's like kind of it's looking like it's getting to the point where like you might not be able to like cover like the losses on your position anymore what will basically happen at this point is there's weak kind of a decentralized network of liquidators on dydx that will look for these kind of under collateralized or close to like under collateralized positions on dydx and then they'll liquidate your accounts which in all liquidation means is they'll kind of basically pay back your borrow for you and they'll take some of your collateral in exchange to do that and effectively what that means from your the trader's perspective is you lost money on this trade and then your trade was like closed out before you like lost like too much money and it'll be like a small amount of capital probably that's in your accounts after you get liquid liquidated um but it's it's probably like you lost like most or almost all like of your initial deposit so that's kind of where the risk comes in that we've been talking about with margin trading it's definitely something you should understand a little bit more and kind of like think critically about the risks before you enter into um but something where it's like you can kind of increase your risk and also like increase your reward there too these mechanisms aren't new to d5 this is the same way it works on a centralized exchange or in traditional finance and then uh before we get off the topic of margin trading so i imagine we were talking about a long position there but i imagine a short position is just the same sort of mechanism but the bet is directionally different you're betting instead that uh the price of ether will go down is that correct yeah that's exactly correct okay cool all right so we've got a a good base um i think that's important you know even though we're still on kind of question one but it's really important because i think this will answer a bunch of questions and having that foundation is important um so we've gotten all the way through the first four product offerings margin now we get to the fifth where things i think get uh you know a little more interesting and maybe another layer of complexity so the fifth is perpetuals right and do perpetuals essentially sit on top of all of the other layers so you need trading you need lending and borrowing you need margin as well like a mechanism and now once you have those things you can build out perpetuals is that kind of how it works um sort of i would say in terms of like their level of complexity they're definitely like the most complex like financially complex product that we offer uh they don't actually use lending and borrowing under the hood they use basically like a separate mechanism so it's kind of like you know if we think of our stack metaphor again it's like assets like you know buy cell and then it's kind of like lending and borrowing slash margin and then like derivatives are like off to the side a little bit um but they do like like i said kind of use like more like financially sophisticated mechanisms to basically offer the product that people want to trade which i'm happy to go more into yeah so tell us what is a perpetual yeah absolutely so a perpetual contract um is a synthetic contract um and this is something that has become like really popular um in crypto itself if you've you know ever heard of or traded on bitmex this is exactly the product that's made like bitmex really popular tons of other new kind of centralized exchanges like binance has launched perpetuals ftx has launched perpetuals in the past year so kind of just motivating like you know why why did we offer perpetual stu they're basically by far the most popular trading product by volume in crypto right now like there's more volume on crypto perpetuals uh in the entire market than there is on the entire buy sell market for crypto combined and another word people use for perpetual sometimes is uh derivatives is a perpetual a type of derivative yeah basically um yeah it's kind of like derivative is like the master like class it's like a superset like perpetual it's like a type so that's that's exactly like why like you know there's a lot of volume on them in terms of like what a perpetual contract is or like how it works under the hood um in in the main like selling point of why you might want to use a perpetual contract as compared to another type of derivative is kind of in the name they're perpetual which basically means that they don't expire most types of derivatives like if you've heard of like a future or like an option or kind of more traditional types of derivatives like that expire so like if you were to buy like a normal future it would expire say at the end of the month and like you could get price exposure to eath or whatever you wanted to trade on with that but it's a little bit less useful because you can't hold it like as long as you might want to so those bitcoin features that were you know so much celebrated and that came out in 2017 right with the like by the cme basically um those expire those every every 30 days or so they just expire you can't kind of renew them you have to start from scratch again is that right yeah that's that's exactly correct um and the other reason why perpetuals are really cool and why it like makes like a lot of like new uh traders kind of use them as their first derivative product um is because they it feels like fairly similar to like trading the underlying like asset itself so let's maybe take like the bitcoin perpetual on uidx as an example um since the contract is synthetic basically what synthetic means is under the hood there the asset that you're trading does not exist within the platform so like on the dydx like bitcoin perpetual there's no actual bitcoin like involved anywhere we basically created this uh like financial contract which effectively just tracks the price of bitcoin um and without actually having bitcoin involved and the other really nice thing about perpetuals is it like i said feels like you're trading the underlying asset so the dydx bitcoin perpetual and really any perpetual contract you might trade within crypto is just set up to track the price of the underlying asset so if you're trading the dydx bitcoin perpetual uh with kind of like its underlying mechanisms are designed such that like the price tracks like the price of another asset which say could be bitcoin it's it's actually not like bad dissimilar from like uh like die or something like that which like tracks like the price of one dollar it's like instead here like we're just like creating this uh you know synthetic asset which tracks the price of like another asset which is like a bitcoin or something like that so the underlying mechanisms are different and the reason you can do that is back to that first layer that you were talking about right which is you have the money layer essentially where we might call that the the value layer the collateral layer and you're saying that collateral layer it could be bitcoin it could be ether or it also could be a stable coin like you guys use usdc right yeah that's exactly correct and in different like perpetual platforms we'll use like a different collateral so we have two types of collateral on the system right now so we have some perpetuals which are margined in usdc which just means that there's usdc collateral our east perpetual right now you can actually use like eth as collateral and also trade on the price of each which is very cool like a very like eccentric product for all your ethers out there um and but that's kind of under like how it works under the hood uh and kind of maybe if we were just to like finish out the talking about like how exactly the perpetuals work the main thing the main mechanism that perpetuals use to basically like keep their peg or like trade at the price that you want them to trade at is this mechanism called a funding rate so all a funding rate is it's basically very similar to a dynamic interest rate that's paid between like those who are along the contract and those who are short the contract so in what long the contract and short the contract means is because this asset is synthetic um it's effectively zero sum so like for every one unit of long there's like one unit of like people going short so say you go to dydx and you buy like uh one bitcoin worth of the uh duidx bitcoin perpetual you're basically trading against somebody else who's kind of taking the short side of that trade um and getting back to this funding rate or kind of what it is or like why it's like really important and important to understand if you're trading perpetuals is the funding rate is the mechanism by which the perpetual like tracks the price of bitcoin so kind of going back to the perpetual it is its own asset it can basically trade at you know like any other asset just whatever price people want to trade it at um so the question if we're like designing this derivatives contract this perpetual contract is how do we make it trade at the price of bitcoin um and basically what how the funding rate comes into that is so we know what the price of bitcoin is say it's like 10 000 and then we know what the price of the uh dydx bitcoin perpetual is trading at and where the funding rate comes in is if the perpetual is trading too low like relative to the price of bitcoin so like basically we want to move the price off right we want to get it like closer to being the price of bitcoin um then basically we want to incentivize more people to go long right like we want to incentivize them to buy to like drive the price up because when people buy price goes up um so what basically happens is then the funding rate which is just this interest which again is paid between those who are long and those who are short would basically make the people that are short pay the people that are long some interest rate to basically incentivize more people to take the long side of the trade and again like drive the price back up to like what we want it to be conversely like if the price of the perpetual is too high um we want to drive the price down right like we want it to be lower we want more people to sell and we want to incentivize more people to go short which basically means selling um so in that case the funding rate would make the people that are long pay the people that are short some kind of dynamic interest rate over time and that's basically the whole thing it's just like once you understand like this funding rate and kind of like how that's used to like effectively like stabilize like the price of the perpetual alongside like what the price of actual bitcoin is uh you really understand like for the most part like how like most of the contract works so when you're kind of trading these perpetual contracts on dydx just the important thing to note um is that there is kind of some funding rate which is you know from a trader's perspective it feels similar to like paying like some interest rate or even sometimes earning some interest rate uh like you would on margin very good all right so we got markets within markets now let's put a bow on this perpetual thing um and so we went to all of that work to construct a perpetual everything you just described why why can't we just trade bitcoin why can't we just trade eth why are we doing this why is a perpetual better than margin or a different use case let's say than the f4 great question yeah so kind of the main reasons that perpetual that a trader might want to trade a perpetual over margin it's not like strictly better like there are trade-offs to both but kind of the main reason why we've seen a lot of volume like flow into perpetuals both on dydx and also on other crypto platforms is for a couple reasons so first reason is you can trade them with much higher leverage so dydx isn't quite there yet um but if you've seen like the bitmex is like hundred x's of the world didn't finance do like 125x or something like this like silly 25x ftx did like 101x just to like fight bit max probably it's just a race at the bottom soon there's going to be 150x 120 it's just going to keep on going yeah absolutely so if like if you've seen like those like classes of like leverage that are like 100 x's of the world they're trading perpetual products and like that's how you get like through the underlying constructions you can get a lot more leverage and that's oftentimes like useful to traders i wouldn't recommend uh just like going and trading with like 100x leverage on bitmex well but like what like so what happens what happens if you're trading at 100x right does that mean like one small price in the wrong direction and you're just completely wiped yeah you have to look at the second price chart if the price goes down 0.5 percent on bitmex and you're 100 x long you get liquid data and you lose so you can't let the price go down like who does this it's a straight game yeah it's a straight gamble it's madness yeah like most of the like 100 x's stuff is a bit crazy like you you definitely shouldn't do that um and but most people don't like a couple people do it's mostly like marketing if i'm being honest like just like trying to get like the higher like leverages of the world um but like most people trade with like you know ten to like five to ten to like maybe up to 20 x leverage or so which if you have like really good understanding of like how you think the price is going to move it can make sense um so so the first is like higher leverage on our margin product right now our maximum leverage is 5x on our perpetual products our maximum leverage is 10x that's actually going to increase quite a lot once we move to our starkware integration for perpetuals which we can get into later um so the first reason is leverage um second reason you might want to do this is the the funding rates can be a lot more attractive than kind of paying like underlying interest rates on margin um so that like makes it like really you know sometimes more attractive for traders to trade perpetuals and then the third reason which is really really important especially if you're trading on d5 is because perpetuals can support synthetic assets so this basically means that like to offer like trading of bitcoin we don't need bitcoin we don't have to worry about like any of the cross chain stuff you know we could spin up like a you know whatever market we wanted to like xrp market or like you know litecoin all these types of different things um and from a technical perspective it would be very similar the only thing we need is like a price oracle that's like reporting what the price of the asset that we want to trade is so it allows exchanges to spin up like way more easily like spin up trading for new markets um and just make mark like these markets like really liquid i mean all liquid means is like if you want to make a trade there's like tons of people on the other side like willing to make the opposite trade okay all right so it basically allows you to use any store of value any money at the base layer to create anything you want okay all right so i think we got to um jesus perez's first question but but that was like a fantastic amount of like foundational knowledge i think that most a lot of people don't understand with like margin perpetuals um but that answers that question i i do have one last question on perpetuals so there is this thing that you guys recently came out with called an inverse perpetual okay what's the inverse part of perpetual and you did it's an inverse perpetual of eth i believe what does the inverse piece mean yeah that's a great question so fundamentally under the hood exactly the same thing like still has the funding rate still has like the same dynamics of like the perpetual contract the inverse thing uh basically what that means is it just like determines what type of collateral you're using um so the inverse part on the east perpetual means that you are trading the price of eth and you're also using eth as collateral this is kind of like if you've ever traded on like bitmex before you'll know that like bitmex uses like bitcoin as collateral um and you can also trade the price of bitcoin on bitmex it's a very similar idea to that but this is like the very like eth native product and like native way to do this you can come to dydx you can only have you can lever up and trade on each with this product that's running like on the ethereum blockchain like control your keys the entire time um so that's kind of why we launched our e perpetual as an inverse perpetual is we really see a lot of demand within d5 and especially krypto more broadly um for people that just hold eth and like want to say either go like leverage long ether or sometimes like leverage shorty um and this product is like a really great way to be able to do that so it's really a product for the eath holders who are you know super bowls on eath and they don't want to cash out their eat for some other yeah some other lesser money right like a fiat dirty fiat stable coin then right exactly okay all right very good all right awesome okay we we are almost uh we are over halfway done now but okay let's let me do some quick hit questions antonio uh that are coming in so one question is from the discord a bankless discord are parts of dydx still geofence if so what led to that decision yeah great question so yes um so the main thing that is geofenced is the perpetual contracts and the main thing that led to that decision in in terms of like where their geothermal customers right now and the main thing that led to that geofencing um is just certain regulations um that are basically on derivative contract within the us um and kind of our assessments of like the risk of being an exchange and kind of offering those products to you know us customers it seems like it's not within kind of like the the spectrum of risk that we're willing to take on to be able to do that maybe just really quickly taking a step back in terms of like how we think about the risk like as a decentralized exchange i'd say like from a regulatory perspective especially in the u.s like every regulator has like a different definition basically of what a decentralized exchange is and also like a different definition of how much or little being a decentralized exchange helps from a regulatory perspective and probably the the cftc which is the body that uh regulates uh derivative products in the u.s it basically like tldr like this don't take this is not legal advice but it's like kind of basically like doesn't really matter like too too much um if like certain parts are decentralized from the cftc's perspective so like that's kind of what led to that decision and that's the main regulator that you're dealing with is the cftc um rather than not the sec so much correct yeah got it so antonio is there a future version of the world where dydx is has to implement kyc onto its platform yeah it's a great question yeah not to get too much into the weeds on like the legal stuff with this too but there's kind of like like the main reason you might implement kyc is not with the cftc actually there's a different like us regulatory body that kind of controls that which is called fincen they've actually put out some really good guidance in like the past year they're one of the most proactive regulators in terms of like putting out guidance which specifically addressed decentralized exchanges and that's given us confidence to basically be able to operate without kyc i'm not going to sit here and say that like you know the regulatory regime will never evolve in a way that like makes dydx do kyc um but we really strive to be able to like very much in the ethos of like cryptocurrency just offer like trading to as many people um and without like kyc to just democratize access to our products as much as possible this took me a while to kind of figure out all of the regulatory agencies that are involved so like the spark notes and correct me if i'm wrong because you would know right more than me but sparknets are like um if you're dealing with something like a stock or a security security the sec is the group involved if you're dealing with something like a future or an option or a perpetual or synthetic it or a commodity it's the cftc right correct yeah sometimes there's overlap and then if you're dealing with anything that is like anti-money laundering patriot act type stuff this is all us by the way sorry international friends but the u.s has they've got a lot of regulatory bodies anyway that last one is that's vincent right correct those are the primary um regulators that you would probably uh come into contact with in what you're doing is there anyone else uh yeah certainly we look at like other regulatory bodies besides that even just in the u.s there's quite a lot of them let me tell you but i would say yes you're correct those are the main ones uh that we think about engage with and you know uh work with okay so another question oh from the realty side of things like i'm exposed to this a lot as a good rule of thumb if there is an investment contract it is a security and it's under the purview of the sec and all these things that are going on on dydx are not investment contracts they are not solicitations for investment uh but they are instead like products and derivatives which is why they are under fincen is that is that match your understanding antonio yeah basically and the derivatives would be the cftc but yeah vincent and like cftc are the major ones for now how about this so this is a question coming in from our discord um so that not standing you guys haven't offered perpetuals today um but is there some path for when you might be able to an eta for perpetuals in the us i think a lot of our u.s listeners are curious yeah it's a great question probably there's no eta right now if i'm being honest yeah it's definitely something that it doesn't seem like at least like within the next year or so that like we like any crypto uh company would basically be able to like offer these types of like more advanced like derivative contracts to us customers just based on the current state of the regulation i think it's definitely something where this is more like where we would take the strategy of like working with regulators like really trying to educate them on like the benefits of like d5 and kind of like how like a lot of that stuff can play into like objectives that regulators also have um so it's not like purely antagonistic i would say in terms of like d5 plus like regulation like one of the other things that regulators care a lot about um is just like the like health of markets um just like making sure that like the collateral is where the exchange says it is that kind of like uh you know everybody can have transparency and what's going on with the exchange like making sure that the collateral is there like that the operators aren't going to run away with the money well like d7d5 is like a really good fit for basically like solving some of these problems from regulators um the other thing like regulators care in the us about is like who is trading these contracts and whether we agree with it or not like who has the financial sophistication uh to basically like be from the government's perspective to be able to like trade them and i think that that's where like most of the uh kind of decision to block us customers comes in or like where a lot of the like laws come in is just due to like the cftc's objective to like make sure that like and this is a cftc's view not my view um but like make sure that like you know less financially sophisticated people however the cftc defines it like don't have access to the more sophisticated financial contracts right now in america we tend to define it as how much money do you have what's your net worth yup which is a darn shame but that is the way it is right now understand okay so another quick hit question is when dydx token everyone's doing yield farming like where's the dydx token antonia i promise you we are thinking about it um and we're thinking about it very seriously on potentially like you know a shorter like time horizon um potentially like months from now it's we have not made the decision yes or no whether we're going to actually do one we're just like really critically evaluating like how could a token be useful in dydx like what would it be used for like how can we get the more the community more involved in things like governance uh and stuff like that how can we use it to just like bootstrap growth of the community and of dydx itself so yeah we're definitely thinking about it uh no firm decisions yet um but yeah something that we are looking to make like a decision one way or another on in the next few months and yeah if we decide to do it obviously look for us to release more information at some point and you guys raise capital kind of the the vc route but what do you think of these fair launch style of projects that are cropping up these days yeah i think it's really interesting yeah i definitely think like different like funding models like make sense for different types of projects um for us the vc like route like made sense um that's not you know necessarily the best decision for for every like entrepreneur to like take like bc money it really depends like what you're trying to build um i'm yeah definitely a big fan of like a lot of the stuff that's been going on in d5 like i thought like yam was like a great example um even though like it has some security issues well like of course it's gonna have security issues but that's basically what i think a lot of stuff with like the fair launch is trying to solve like in just like allocating like capital that's like really in the communities like best interests to allocate um to some of these projects to kind of get them off the ground get them the capital that they need to to bootstrap like the community and and kind of let the community take over from there so i'm definitely a big fan all right here's a question that came in from youtube so this is on the subject of alternative infrastructure so we've got ethereum of course we know and love there's also these new whether you call them eath killers or competitors or alternate layer twos whatever you call them avalanche polka dot those sorts of things are you considering those um infrastructures to host parts of dydx and also maybe you could talk about your your starkware announcement and what that is yeah absolutely it's a great segue to that so so basically uh we in the past like month or so had done like a ton of research in terms of like scaling dydx basically what's happened for us like has happened for like literally everybody else in this space is we're just spending like a ton of money on gas as you might imagine um so and you guys pay for all that it's nice we pay for users gas when you trade on dydx one of the nice things is you don't like have to pay your own gas fees um so that's pretty nice um once you've deposited um but yeah trust me we're feeling those costs um so like yeah one of the things we wanted to solve is it's just obviously we've gone to the point where there is a lot of demand to use dydx but now we need to scale it um and uidx is never going to be like super big if it's not scalable so we looked at a lot of these like new blockchains looked at a lot of like ethereum native scaling solutions things like optimism things like ovm uh things like obviously starkware we also evaluated building our own optimistic roll-up chain which would kind of be special purpose for dydx and we really uh the reason that we kind of ended up on the starkware integration as kind of the best possible scaling solution for dydx at this time was for a couple reasons um so first like starkware like their scaling solution is live right now like it's already running in production with like a couple like other exchanges um so like there's an exchange called uh diversify which is already integrated with starkware just on the spot side but kind of our work with starkware has basically just given us a lot of confidence that we can build like this next like level of sophistication and like these margin and perpetual systems on a scalable solution with software and we're gonna have it running in production um not in like years from now but in months from now um probably like three to four months or so that we're aiming to have like this live which i think is a pretty ambitious timeline uh because we literally just started working on this with them like a couple like a month ago we've basically we've gotten to is like we finished all the research side so we know what we're going to build uh for the most part and we're actively building it right now so like all the dydx engineering team is building this a lot of the starcraft engineering team they basically have come up with like a custom scaling solution for us um starkware for those who aren't familiar um they're the leader in kind of using zero knowledge uh proofs and kind of starks to be able to scale blockchains and like the really high level like fundamental way that it works um is just like so we have we're dydx we have like a bunch of trades we want to execute right um and normally so the way it works right now is for every trade that happens on dydx like any other dex right now that just maps like one to one with a transaction that gets sent to ethereum so we have to pay like a linear amount of gas fees like if we like make 2 000 trades tomorrow we have to like pay like twice the amount of gas fees as if we've made like a thousand trades today i bet you guys are spending the like tens of thousands of dollars per month range at this point i'm just gonna laugh at that um i'm being very naive with that okay hundreds of thousands yeah oh it's a lot um but yeah that's also it's driving us in the right direction right so that's kind of like one of the emphasis they're like one of the things that's like driving us to like build like move towards the scalable solution and kind of moving on to the scalable solution so like basically what we need to do is we need to be able to support an unlimited number of trades so like how do we do that and the way like the stock where integration is going to work at a very high level is now instead of sending trades directly to the blockchain when we want to execute them we'll basically uh send them to starkware instead and then their services will basically like buffer like all the trades that we want to execute so maybe like a thousand trades or whatever in the last hour and then what they'll do is they won't send all of these thousand trades to the blockchain instead they'll use their magic which is kind of zero knowledge proofs um which sounds magical um but it basically like translates these like thousand trades down into this constant sized data object so it doesn't matter if it's a thousand trades if it's ten thousand trades if it's one trade um if this like data thing that basically proves that all of these trades happened is the same size like in megabytes or whatever um or smaller than that um but like so it's the same size and that's where like all of the scalability comes from and then you take this like little data object which is like the zero knowledge proof you like submit it to the blockchain like periodically and that's like where all the scalability comes from and kind of by our estimates this should get us like at least like 100x like reduction in gas costs wow um so that's something that we're really excited about um yeah there's also a number of other like really important benefits that we're going to be getting from the starcraft integration i can just go through really fast um so the second um is being able to support cross-margining which sounds like financially sophisticated but basically all it means right now is right now for each like perpetual on dydx they're margins separately so it's like if you put down your thousand usdc to margin your bitcoin perpetual you can't use that thousand usdc to like margin you're like link perpetual you'd have to like marginality separately okay um but one of the features that other exchanges support which is actually really important um is what's called cross margining so you basically have like one account so you have your thousand usdc and that's used to margin all of your positions at the same time so like you could take like a bitcoin position and like a link position and like it'd be collateralized by like this same account um and this is also really important for like market makers to kind of really capitally efficient uh just like support liquidity on new markets so we're going to support cross-margining with the starkware launch as well and that's also going to enable us to launch like way more markets um like probably on the order of like 20 to like 50 and then the next like 6-12 months after launch by more markets do you mean more assets more assets yeah like more trading pairs what kind of assets uh yeah something we're still trying to figure out uh we're doing a lot of experiments like we just launched the link perpetual on tuesday actually we're like probably exploring all their things like marines hopefully any marines watching yeah like things like you know wi-fi's of the world like other cross-chain assets like the big ones like xrp stuff like that um but yeah adding lots more assets that's the second improvement the third improvement is like if you've used dydx it basically feels like any other decentralized app you've used right now where it's like you make a trade and there's like some spinner on the site that like waits until your transaction gets mined which is like fine like okay we probably all understand that but like let's be honest with ourselves like trading on a centralized exchange where like your balance is updated like immediately and it like feels really snappy it's just a way better user experience and we're going to be able to support that as well in the instant trades after the start integration and then like last improvement which is also really important but it's like a little more under the hood it's like we're going to put like the oracle prices on like zero knowledge world um which will basically allow us to have way way more performant oracle price updates um than what exists on like any other like oracle solution on ethereum right now um and that's basically going to allow us to offer like a lot higher leverage at a lot lower rates to the platform okay i'm just going to summarize everything you said because this is super exciting i didn't realize this so what this all feels like to me is it's a major v2 upgrade for dydx this is not a small tweak this is like a major v2 upgrade and it's basically going to put you in terms of ux experience and like range of assets you support on par with what centralized exchanges are doing except exactly just as decentralized as you are today meaning no one has to give up their assets um there's no kyc process involved there's no black box where like a bitmex can kind of you know cheat you and trade against you and do some nefarious activity maybe maybe not who knows right um and you're going to be able to do this in like a four-month time horizon right is that what you just said yeah that's exactly what i said that's really exciting about it yet i'm excited about it now and one last question to to kind of tie this off so one big question is around composability so diversify has their starkwear um roll up right and god's unchained i think they're using starkware as well i heard that recently um can you talk to the different so you're going to use ethereum as a settlement layer not like a polka dot or avalanche but can you talk to the other rollups from your roll-up does that make sense uh yeah basically no um okay it's kind of like the one thing that like we trade off but we already kind of like trade that off on dydx because we haven't really gotten into this yet but we use like a central matching model right now which basically means that we run like a matching engine like an order book um in a centralized way but still like all of the trading is non-custodial and like settle on a blockchain so it'll be very similar to that um in terms of like the composability right now um but yeah we're not we haven't been quite as like focused on that as like a compound or like a unislop of the world like really like rmo is just trying to provide like you the traders with the best possible like trading experience like on dydx and that's what we've been like laser focused on super exciting david's chiming in he's got three questions hey david and everyone listening so we've got five minutes left with antonio we want to be we want to keep these to an hour so could we try to do as lightning round questions as we can these next five minutes go ahead david yeah two of these questions blend together really well so what is the long-term business model of dydx and is there a world where dydx gets like acquired by somebody of the likes of like coinbase or gemini or some big gargantuan in this base or are you guys going to go ahead and pioneer your your own roads here yeah it's a great question so there's kind of like two things that dydx has right now so it's like the centralized like matching like centralized company runs that like we take trading fees we make revenue and then like the second thing is this like decentralized protocol and that's kind of where we're thinking about like the token potentially coming in over time um so i think like we'll see just like these like split a little bit more like over time like yeah of course like the centralized part could be like acquired i'm not going to sit here and say that i couldn't um but like definitely the decentralized part will continue to be its own like autonomous decentralized network and then another follow-up so one thing i'm really bullish on is every single entity that has and operates its own l2 is incentivized to have its own on-ramps and like dydx especially would benefit from having its own native on-ramp have you guys thought about this you mean field on-ramp fiat on-ramp yes yeah definitely we thought about it yeah i think it's something where if we did it we would partner with like another uh like product that does kind of like a fiat on-ramp but like we want to just again make the product experience for like trading on dydx as simple as possible and i definitely think like fiat on-ramps like in the product whether that's like us totally building it or integrating with somebody else is something that's important so a question from sid um other plat projects in in d5 are these platforms right composable money legos that sort of thing um you d set d-hedge is building on synthetics are there some ways that dydax can act as a platform that's kind of an underlying primitive money lego for other things to be built on top of yeah definitely there are i'd say it's not our main focus right now um but like there are a lot of interesting things that have been built on top of dydx actually um and like dydx also supports like flash loans if you've heard of like you know that like marketing lingo before which i'm sure you have um like a lot of the like flash loan applications uh kind of go through dydxes like margin protocols right now um so that's like a good example of like how things can like be built on gydx um so definitely i think it's imp as well other price oracles um do you plan to integrate price data feed from other oracles besides what you're using right now yeah we're definitely looking into it so we have two oracle providers as of tuesday so we're using chain link for the link perp for that oracle and then we use the makerdale v2 oracles for kind of the all the other stuff um what we're basically building for the starker integration is kind of like i was saying before and the advantages of spiel uh was that we're kind of building our own like oracle solution there which will kind of work similarly and we'll integrate with like the maker dial b2 network for price oracles um but it'll basically just like feed the prices like into zero knowledge land like way faster and more accurately than they exist on ethereum so it's a bit of a hybrid solution this is all going to go through the zero knowledge land that you're talking about the starkware implementation as well very cool all right a super secret pseudo-anonymous account just asked the question is eath money antonio how do you answer [Laughter] definitely i mean we're using it as collateral well first so like you know you can trade trade on the price of each like use it as collateral like you would any other stable coin so definitely there you have it thank you for the eath perpetual by the way i think that's great for the eath bulls okay last question from me and then i think we're gonna have to wrap it up we've got two minutes left is um how could the bankless nation help you guys so you know i've i've used this term like um i mean we're on a path to become more and more bankless over time right like decentralize as much as we can it's it's a journey it's not overnight um but one of the things that uh we love to support is obviously uh decentralized exchanges doing the sorts of things that that centralized exchanges could do before kind of like i love to use the term bye bye bit mix you know like like um dydx and other bank list protocols can start to replace some of these things how can the bankless nation i guess help you do that get involved um are there other ways to get involved in your governance token if you choose to release one what can we do to help yeah absolutely i mean i think definitely the best thing you can do um is like getting the word out there um just in terms of like you know posting about it like talking to other traders or like people that you may know which could be like good users of dydx using the product yourself giving us like feedback where you constantly want to iterate and just make the product like the best possible that we can make it for you um yeah in the future if we do decide to do like governance token just like participating more and like the governance uh stuff like that um but absolutely like we think of dydx like as a product like as an exchange and we would just want to make it the best for you and everybody else um so it's really helpful as much as you're all able to like get the word out there um ask questions um that's how people learn and then just keep going about it awesome i see qaz put it well i feel like a sponge soaking up the knowledge of the ocean referring to this conversation we just had with antonio from dydx he's the founder of dydx this has been your ama bankless nation thanks for joining me one last action item for you if you want to support dydx and what it's doing try it out be careful of course you know derivatives margin training perpetuals not for the faint of heart test with small amounts of funds like you got to know what you're doing with this stuff it gets dangerous and risky quickly but if you want to try it out the best way to do that is a type in bankless dot cc slash dydx that is going to take you to the dydx homepage and also give you a 10 bankless uh special exclusive um uh discount on all dydx fees moving forward so make sure you do that and let's let's support what antonio and his team are doing thanks so much antonio for joining us yeah thanks so much for having me this was great
