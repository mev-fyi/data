you can only really generate value as an investor if you have a deeper understanding of what's Happening than anybody else like effectively Alpha in a market comes from depth of understanding if you can see the actual value of the thing and there's a disconnect between perception and reality right so if the world thinks something is worth X but it turns out to be worth 2X and there's that that's a Delta between perception and reality and so what you really have to do as an investor across all the categories that you mentioned picks and shovels if you're an early stage Equity investor um you know nfts themselves if you're more of like an art curator what you really have to do is understand the thing better than anybody else you have to have some perspective on it that says actually reality is different than perception and and that's fundamentally what you're betting on welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here to help you become more bankless yup just me on the episode today no David he's off escaping to the mountains if the AI Tech was a little bit better maybe he'd never miss an episode I could just beam him in unfortunately we're not there yet so I had to take this episode on my own uh the topic today is about bear Market bets investor conviction during the bear market and one thing I'll say at the outset is nothing tests your conviction as an investor like a bear Market in particular a crypto bear Market I think they can be particularly deep and Sinister but if you look at this from the right angle this is actually an opportunity it's an opportunity to test what you think you know to refine your thesis your ideas and to make your bets for the next leg up at a lower price point so that is the topic for today avatrol and Sanjay are long time crypto investor they're the guests in today's episode they're also VCS at Electric Capital and I ask them what ideas are they betting on during this bear Market we discussed five of the most pressing questions I think that are facing all crypto investors during this bear Market including number one L2 tokens these are Layer Two tokens our Layer Two tokens actually worth anything are they just worthless governance tokens we get into that secondly we talk about alternative layer ones will the eve Killers make a comeback this cycle or not number three we talk about what a multi-chain world really looks like well we have millions of layer twos and app chains or will there be a few Big Winners number four we talk about restaking is restaking a big deal is it over hyped will it pose an existential risk to ethereum and number five avatel explains why he thinks nfts are this Cycle's altcoins and what he actually means by that also toward the end of the episode I get a quick debate with Avital on the moneyness of ether ether the asset he disagrees with me on that I wish we had some more time for that debate but we touch it briefly perhaps in another episode we can get into it in more detail last thing I'll say before we begin episodes like this are really an opportunity to sharpen your insights as a crypto investor so you don't have to take these ideas as gospel not everything that these investors say uh will be right you of course have to wrestle with the ideas you have to test them you have to make them your own and we'll have other bear Market episodes with other perspectives so this certainly isn't the last word all right guys we're gonna get right to the episode on bear Market Bets with Avatar and Sanjay from Electric Capital but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

recent I think was put out in January I don't miss this measures all of the dev and Dev activity across crypto evicho and Sanjay welcome them bankless all right thanks Ryan nice to be here guys I'm so excited I'm excited to do this episode here and now in 2023 uh summer of 2023 when we are I I think uh most listeners would agree we are in the bear market and the reason bear markets are interesting to me is they are this fiery Crucible where our investment ideas actually get tested where we actually have an opportunity to kind of rebuild our ideas from from the ground up and place our bets accordingly so um I want to ask a few questions today I've got five teed up and then maybe some bonus questions if we get some time and I think these questions are some of the biggest most important questions that crypto investors are asking during this this bear market so I want to get your thoughts on this the thesis that you're sort of rebuilding during during the bear market and uh really get a sense for your conviction what you're convicted on does that sound okay that sounds great okay and maybe before we get into all that we can do the standard disclaimer of oh yeah go for it this is not this is not Financial advice you should not listen to anything we have say basically about anything that's great and it goes through that goes for me too all right don't listen to us about anything none of this is funny yeah no no this is financial advice and Beyond this is not advice this is not life advice don't listen it's not life advice I don't know what it is it's another category it's just a conversation hopefully you're entertaining the conversation amongst your friends yeah um and uh so so a few of the conversation starters then amongst friends and and some of these questions are I think controversial questions actually which is among the most interesting but I'm gonna tee these up the first five to to give listeners a sneak peek into where we're headed all right the first question I want to ask is about Layer Two tokens are they worthless governance tokens is the question uh second question want to get into eth will The eth Killers make a comeback alternative layer ones uh number three I want to talk about layer twos there's are we going to live in a world where there's millions of chains or just a few big Winners uh number four I want to talk about restaking is restaking I can layer all of these things is it a big deal or is it over a hyped is it an excess potential crisis for ethereum and then number five nfts man they've been down bad recently I don't know if you guys have noticed but are they dead or will they make a comeback so that's a little agenda item I've got some surprise bonus questions for you as well um why don't we start though with the big question I think part of the reason I wanted to have you both on the podcast is Sanjay you wrote fantastic blog posts about Layer Two value capture and let me just frame the question and you put it nicely at the beginning of your post the question is these Layer Two tokens worth many billions of dollars double digit billions of dollars I don't think triple digit billions of dollars are they actually worth anything right now or are they just worthless governance tokens uh I'll throw it to either one of you how do you think about this question right now um yeah so the you know to me the way I sort of think about it is it always comes back to cash flows at the end of the day um so you always have to say okay let's look at this from a fundamental perspective and where the cash flow is going to come from and I think that if you really dig deep into layer twos there are very concrete sources that they can actually generate sustainable cash flows and sustainable profits and so there is a real and happy to sort of dig deeper into this but just based on that idea alone there is a real fundamental basis for why these tokens should have values based on cash flows so there's cash flows just like a company just like any type of business these layer twos actually have a product that they're selling yeah well I I would add one thing to that too is um oh and this is how we model things internally is It ultimately cash flows because if there's no cash flow coming out of the thing then like it's it's you know what is the thing actually worth um and in finance in general or investing in general that's like the great normalizer it's like what are the cash flows coming out and what kind of discount rate do I apply to that cash flow and then I can start to normalize across things like bonds and stocks and tokens um and so I would add maybe um two or three nuances or Dimensions to this so one just because the thing has cash flow it doesn't make it a security um and I think this gets into a lot of nitty-gritty about Regulatory and um but we we firmly believe that there are ways to have cash flows coming out of these um without necessarily making them security did you hear that Gary Gensler yeah existing right now it gets into um yeah it you know it gets into sort of how we test and there's a lot we could go there but I think there are actually I I think it's important people not necessarily conflate cash flow with security those are actually two different things um second is I think what's really interesting about uh crypto is the global nature of it and so the fact that there's so much Capital all over the world that would like to be able to invest in cash flow assets or any sort of asset outside of their local Fiat regime um and and that's actually for most of the world is not possible like most of the world can't easily access U.S equities for example and so our belief is there's actually a lot of latent demand all over the world for these kinds of assets that are sort of they exist outside any singular jurisdiction like eth doesn't exist only inside the United States and that's actually what makes it so compelling too from like a Global Perspective is that there are a lot of people who otherwise would not be able to participate that can participate and I think you know kind of um back you know I think the framing that you had around conviction at the front end was really compelling and I think one of the things that we have um we personally have not lost conviction on but I think in the bull market really gets lost in the noise and tends to come back in the bear markets is that that's fundamentally what this stuff is about right it's about empowering people all over the world to participate in these open systems um and that's what's so interesting about the l2s is there are actually ways for people to participate all over the world and capture value in that in in a way that doesn't make them security but still has cash flow which I think is actually that's like one of the interesting breakthroughs by the way just on the the cash flow but not security just a brief segue here so there are other real world assets like this right so um I um let's say you have property I own a house I'm a land word well that is a cash flowing cash flow producing asset that's not security not to register that thing with the SEC there are tons of um you know categories in the real world pre-crypto that actually fit this mold of being a cash flow but not a security how come people are so hung up on this yeah well it goes to this General problem of like our regulatory Frameworks um tend to have been designed with certain use cases in mind this is why you have to be really careful with whether regulation I think I spent a lot of time on the regulatory side I think some people know this um in in conversations with um and senators and Congress people and people at the White House and and um and so on and um and a lot of good people this is you know in the ecosystem that spent a lot of time behind the scenes on this stuff and I think one of the challenges is that like you don't want to bake Technology Solutions into the regulations um and every now and then every 50 or 100 years like a new technology comes along and it sort of breaks your mental model of what's possible I think Ai and crypto are kind of are going to both face this right now because I'll give you one concrete example right like this stuff doesn't really exist inside a singular jurisdiction and that creates a whole new dimension of challenges from a regulator's perspective right like eth is is not a thing that exists only in the United States or only in Europe it exists across jurisdictionally because it lives in the cloud so anywhere there's a server this thing can exist um and and I think that creates a whole host of challenges because our entire regulatory framework has been based around the notion of a nation state with with physical Geographic boundaries and capital controls and this really starts to break a lot of that AI is similar in all sorts of ways right like should an AI pay taxes well it's kind of unclear and it's if it pays taxes like who does it pay taxes to because it can run on any server anywhere so like what does that mean right what does the question even make sense um and this happens every now and then I've talked about this in other contexts but like to me crypto like the idea of this non-jurisdictional uh coordination mechanism the last time we really had to face something like this was was with the invention of the joint stock corporation which was like 1650. it was like oh we can put money together and like take risk without it being my personal property at risk um and before that you just had the cottage industry um and so between like 1650 and 1850 we put a lot of regulations in place around how that should work and it used to basically be that only Kings could give you a charter to go start a corporation and then around 1850 we said wait a second that doesn't make any sense anybody should be able to start a corporation and so we created entirely new regulation that said oh here's what it means to register a company and that unlocked the Industrial Revolution like the reason railroads could get built is because a bunch of people could pool Capital at a scale that wasn't previously possible from one human and I actually think a lot of Crypton AI it's like the first time in 150 or 200 years that we've had to face this kind of a problem which is like it just breaks our existing model of regulation in a lot of fundamental ways and so we need to rethink it um I know that's like super high level meta but like that that to me is what makes this so interesting because the properties of this stuff are like truly internet native in a way that I don't think we've ever experienced before and that creates a whole host of challenges Downstream one of which is well how can you have a cash flow entity that a bunch of people participate in that I can track that I know exactly what my cash flow stream is going to be but it's not a security and I think that's one of the side effects of like this new technology well regulatory is going to be one of the the bonus questions there's just so much to unpack there but I'm I don't I don't know that's exactly comforting that it took us like about 200 years from the joint stock company first joint stock company to get the regulation in order I hope crypto can happen at a um way faster yeah all right we'll get to that too but okay so so um the bull case I think what what you just gave was sort of the the bookcase for maybe these Capital assets that are tokens in general right which is they're Global they're digital their cash flow producing assets that aren't security anyone with an internet connection can own one of these things so well how cool is that all right but so there's another piece here though that I want to get to is just because there is a token out there that can accrue value doesn't mean it's sort of set up to actually accrue value so this idea of um cash flows is like where does the revenue come from for a layer two um maybe you guys could give us a refresher Santa you could give us a refresher on how Roll-Ups make money today how do they actually generate Revenue uh yeah so today Roll-Ups so in the future Roll-Ups I think will generate value from sort of two different streams Mev and transaction fees um today Roll-Ups don't actually generate any revenues from Mev because the sequencers are centralized so optimism arbitrum and of course they don't want to be extractive to their users so they've decided hey we're not going to extract any Mev so they've just turned it off basically yeah as a centralized sequencer they could charge some fees for for Mev and for transaction fees but they've just set it to zero right now is that correct for Mev and then of course yes and then of course they are charging transaction fees and so that's the the primary source of Revenue today for uh for layer twos um so that's today and in the future so I think there's a so let's speak to both sides of those so for the Mev um that can be turned on in the future and I think that could be a sizable form of revenue for um for Roll-Ups and so I in the blog post I sort of put a little bit of a framing around this so there's sort of like good Mev and bad Mev and um good Emmy sort of harmful Mev is anything that's sort of harmful to the user so let's say a sandwich attack Etc um and bad Mev is yeah exactly thank you for for bringing this up and then um sort of bad Mev is a good Mev is something that actually you know helps the ecosystem so for example an Arbitrage helps keep prices consistent across different dexes and so sort of my view is that as far as Mev I think the harmful sort of Mev will ultimately um be sort of either mitigated or rebated back to users and sort of like why do I say that well one you know businesses there's something like a line I have in the post which is like typically businesses don't really gain adoption by screwing their users um that's that's like not a good strategy and so I think it's the same way with blockchains and so there's sort of incentive at every layer of this whether it's talking about wallets whether you're talking about the Roll-Ups themselves whether you're talking about shared sequencers like hey let's figure out a way to like get rid of these sandwich attacks let's figure out a way to sort of mitigate these this harmful sort of form of Mev and I think right now there's like 12 different projects that are working on trying to do this and so I think with so many people sort of working on this I I feel fairly good that we're going to figure out a way to sort of combat that okay so let's break this down a little bit for people and um and spend some more time on on kind of definitions to make sure we've got everyone with us today so um you think that the sources of revenue for Roll-Ups the way they make money are to form Mev and transaction fees and then we just went into Mev for a second um defining Mev for a second this is basically block ordering there's some value for anyone who's uh sending a transaction or doing something on chain on one of these layer twos and getting their transaction in first and it turns out that we can we can sell that value and Layer Two is indeed can in the future uh start selling that value I believe that's uh that's what you're saying here and there are two forms of not the the selling of that value but I guess the um maybe the effect of blockchain ordering maybe you can find find better words for this one is that there's harmful blockchain ordering uh so there's are you calling that harmful Mev and then there's good Mev and what you're saying sanjays is you think that the harmful Mev will actually be mitigated over time so that the layer 2 designers will effectively try to minimize that as as much as possible uh and or rebate it to users so if you're a user and metamask you're committing a transaction there's some future world where you actually receive some of the proceeds of that that transaction in the form of a rebate you get kind of your your Mev money back that's what you think will happen to harmful the good Mev you think these uh layer twos will effectively take in the form of Revenue under that Mev category is that right so far what would you add to that definition those definitions and also can you give us some examples of harmful versus good Mev um yeah so so that's exactly right I think you phrased it really well um so let me give you an example of harmful Mev is like a sandwich attack so for example you want to go and you want to buy an asset on a Dax let's say ether someone sees you're gonna uh your trade incoming they're gonna actually put in in order to to trade that asset ahead of you and then your ass your order will actually push the price up and then on the on the back of that they'll actually sell what they bought so they've just made money sort of risk-free and you as the user you've actually gotten to execute at a worse price so that's that's probably the most sort of common prominent example of of harmful Mev um and then as far as sort of good or beneficial Mev um like one example is just Arbitrage so you know if you have different dexes on a roll-up or across Roll-Ups you obviously want prices to be the same or consistent across the different um the different X's that's good for users liquidations is another example of beneficial Mev um you want uh people to get liquidated as soon as possible which helps the protocols not accrue bad debt and So the faster that can happen the better and so that's another example of beneficial mvv one good example is um sort of like how I see this playing out there's a new shared sequencer radius that has sort of come out in the last couple months and they're sort of implementing this thing where they're using encryption to actually block sort of this harmful Mev so using encryption nobody can see what your transactions are and then after sort of transactions some sort of transactions are finalized then they're actually running an auction to allow people to back run these transactions and so they're essentially blocking the front running of transactions which allow for the sandwiches Etc and they're running an auction to sort of optimize the back running of the transactions which allow for Arbitrage and um and liquidations Etc so sort of in line with sort of this framework that I've laid out so how does this Mev we'll talk about transaction fees as the other pocket of kind of Revenue in a second but just for Mev in general right now kind of you said the uh the sequencers uh are kind of centralized haven't turned the dials on so no one's actually charging for this and if in the future they could but how does this get to Value in the token if you're a token holder of something like the the arbitrum token or the optimism token or something like that um how do you experience that value One Way in the ethereum ecosystem that holders experience value is through eip1559 the burn effectively where Supply is kind of destroyed um in the world of capital assets I mentioned you know property that I might hold and I I might get a rental income from that so my asset actually generates income that I can take home almost it's not quite a dividend but it's sort of a dividend I I suppose can an arbor optimism or layer 2 token holder expect to sort of receive this as a share of income or is it burnt or is there some other mechanism at play here to actually link the token itself to this uh value creation mechanism yeah I think any of the above and I think different layer twos are going to experiment with different models so you can burn it you could give it as a dividend you could invest it in retroactive public goods which lessensibly will then increase the the value on the protocol further how I expect it to happen in practice is through some sort of like auction mechanism and so like right now you have a centralized sequencer and so it's you know it's sort of like up to the Goodwill I guess of the sequencer to sort of give that back um but I think and and how much to give back inevitably I think that once you have sort of auctions just like you know you have at the uh the proposal layer on ethereum where uh you know Builders are actually competing to for uh to get proposers to choose their block um in the same way I think you'll have uh people competing to build a block and then that value will then get um go back to the protocol and they can choose what to do uh with it what they want okay so you think Mev will be a big source of Revenue here let's talk about transaction fees which is the second kind of um the source of of Revenue of value creation value capture here so how do layer twos today charge transaction fees inside of their ecosystems I'm going to pull up um a screen just to kind of start this conversation I believe that was in your blog post this is arbitrum annualized revenue if you've never looked at kind of arbitrim from this uh perspective I encourage you this is the way that uh investors should and are looking at this this is I believe a um a set of metrics from May of this year and uh this says arbitrum annualized Revenue if you annualize our terms of Revenue in May of 2023 this isn't a bear Market mind you we get 115 million in annualized revenue revenue being the term for kind of the Top Line right so this is not necessarily profit we can talk about the costs of the the arbitrum uh you know business if that's or a capital asset if that's what we want to call it but Revenue 115 million dollars and and I believe this is from transaction fees can you explain this a little bit Sanjay yeah I mean it's very impressive um yeah essentially currently uh later to sort of break down their costs into sort of like an L1 cost so what are they paying to ethereum for essentially the data availability and then there's sort of nl2 operational cost essentially like how much are they you know you know how much is it does it cost to actually sort of like operate the chain Etc and then there's like an L2 gas fee um and so which essentially makes up the transaction fee so that that's how sort of the revenue model works today I ex and it's sort of broken down into these three chunks I think the way that the um it can be broken down in the future can sort of be different um like it doesn't actually have to you know be on a menu where here's your L1 cost here's your L2 operating cost here's your L2 fee but I think those basic components are are going to always be baked in there and um are they essentially is the way to look at this like a layer two is essentially a value-added reseller of a layer one block space is that what they're doing is they're they're basically taking like something like arbitrary optimism is basically taking the uh ethereum block space and creating another layer of of feature functionality value on top of it and then charging for that in the form of transaction fees and then also Mev is that what's going on here yeah I think that's a reasonable way to think about it I think one of like the sort of like you know mental models that I wanted to at least put out there with this is that you know I think some people think like okay eip4844 is coming block space is going to drastically reduce and so as a result of that okay yeah arboretum's revenues look great right now but that's just because L1 data fees are super expensive right now and one to L1 data fees plummet like hey arboretums revenues are gonna you know go down the toilet because you know maybe they're just making a 10 or 15 margin on top of what the L1 is charging and sort of the model that we can get into it that I at least sort of propose here is hey that's not actually true because there's actually um some block space that's actually valuable on the L2 and they don't actually have to price it at just like a fifth fixed percentage above um what the L1 block space is so as an example like if you you know getting coffee at Starbucks just because it costs Starbucks 10 cents to make it that doesn't mean you have you're paying 10 cents or 11 cents you could be paying five dollars or ten dollars for a cup of coffee and so I think it's going to essentially be sort of similar in the L2 block space I think you guys have a pretty famous uh saying right which is blockchain cell block space right um and I think it's it's similar it's very similar to L2 block space as well yeah I think a lot of people don't understand how um layer twos actually make money and how much value is created here and um I reach all I I wonder from your perspective what what this sort of looks like right so there are multiple analogs that that we could use uh yes we have said um on Bank list many times it's a mental model blockchains cell blocks that's the the thing that they do just because it's a simplification I feel like so many times on the crypto investing world gets stuck on narrative value meme value and like it's helpful to lend view this as a as almost like a company right so what what does Apple sell they sell iPhones right how do they create value well they take all of these commodity type components and they they create an incredible user experience and a phone that you can use and apps that you know uh give you value to Everyday Life they're able to charge a thousand dollars per phone right that's it's kind of amazing and so looking at these layer twos almost as um kind of like companies and they're not Securities but but maybe from the perspective of there is something that all of them are trying to sell they're trying to make their block space as valuable as possible and to uh Sanjay's point they can charge whatever they want from for that whatever the market is willing to pay and so you know that's one model of looking at it the other way to look at it though is as an emerging economy it's almost like the nation-state type model right yeah and if you know another analog we've used is is think of like a province in a in a nation or like a state in the United States the state of California and uh it is kind of it has there's a federal government that federal government in the LT world is maybe ethereum has its own currency but then there's a a state's economy the state of California you can create value it's so you're almost valuing it as emerging economy um it makes sense of this how how do you think of layer twos yeah so two thoughts on this so I think your second Point around thinking of these things as digital countries and states is exactly right that's that's very much the conclusion I've come to we wrote a paper about ethereum as a digital country a few years ago um and sort of as a little bit of a detour into that for a second you know I think that's actually what the like if you think about what the world wants uh and kind of what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine and the US flipped on uh sanctions what the world kind of realized was that the the the economy of the world international trade Commodities trade pricing all this stuff runs on US dollars but ultimately the US can shut you out of that economy if they feel like it and that's really scary right if you're turkey if you're India if you're Brazil and and so what the what the world actually wants is a US dollar denominated system because they don't necessarily want to be beholden to the Chinese government either and denominate things in CNY and you're seeing a little bit of a move towards that um and so what the world actually wants is a US dollar denominated system that the US government cannot unilaterally shut them out of that's effectively credibly neutral and sufficiently decentralized such that you can get the Bad actors but that you can't be shut down shut out unilaterally and that's effectively what ethereum is becoming and so our sort of like long-term view on this is ethereum is slowly evolving into this third space which is not the U.S space which is not the Chinese space but is this sort of credibly neutral decentralized space and I think your analogy of if that's kind of like the federal government in a sense or that's the country then l2s start to behave a little bit like States um and you know if you think about how a state like California operates and what they're able to do um in effect you know like why does California have such high taxes or why can apple charge a 30 tax it's because they have pricing power right so the general term for this of it not collapsing to the commodity price of of the compute power on the thing which is I think a thing that a lot of um technologists and economists both Miss like they think of these things as purely computational networks uh and therefore they don't have pricing power but but there are forms of pricing power that states and companies have which are really interesting right so like for example California essentially having a monopoly on useful Coastline on the west coast like all these beautiful beaches and Big Sur and it's just it's a beautiful place to live means that real estate is tremendously valuable and as a result there's this like source of income which they effectively have a monopoly on which allows them to do a lot of other things um or there's brand value right like um why do people pay for for uh you know an eight dollar cup of coffee right why do they go to Blue Bottle whatever yeah it tastes better but like part of it is the experience part of it is the brand part of it is the ethos you're holding the cup you're being seen by other people so there are these like emotional motivators um or there are network effects right and so like Silicon Valley is a network effect around Capital it's just been written about many many times um entrepreneurs will generally relocate to where they can get great capital and there's so much tribal knowledge about how to build companies in Silicon Valley that it's not a surprise that sort of that Network effect continues to perpetuate crypto being a really interesting counter example we could talk about um and if you look at the l2s they kind of have all of these right there are network effects in terms of like D5 all being on arbitrine right now um or there are technical moats right like actually building an iPhone is really hard um and so you look at something like starkware and that you might argue that that's a real technical mode there's just not that many people that can build a ZK based system or ZK sync um you look at Brand effects and and so like if all the cool kids are in one place for the nfts then like that's where all the nfts will be that's where the creators will want to be so they're going to be these different forms of pricing power that these that these networks have on top of the L1 that's going to allow them to have some spread there I think um and I actually really I hadn't heard somebody talk about it as a state on top of the federal government but I think I think that's a great analogy and I think States like California or New York or Washington DC where you have this combination of like Network effects because the industries that are there the company towns is effectively the brand value it's like if you want to do anything in government you have to be in DC like that's where the network is that's where the flow is um and that gives them pricing power and I think l2s will behave very similarly that's uh super fascinating just maybe to extend this a little bit further this line of thought because what you're saying um kind of brought some thoughts up in my mind so I think what you're saying is that layer twos are a bit more like California than they are like apple but where that I think that mental model falls apart for people is there's no way right now to invest in California tokens like how would I even do how would I invest in the California economy right yeah well if you if you had a token that represented that or some sort of asset that represented that it would probably be the value of California's tax base I guess there's another example yeah go ahead like Alaska right so you get an oil rebate so like the the state has all this oil Revenue coming in and they just refund it via VIA tax revenue back to the the citizens right yeah like I wonder if if there was some sort of a composed asset that gave you an index of all of California's property assets let's say yeah for instance and then also the s p five like the the number of public trade companies that were all based in California something like that that could almost give you a proxy for like what an investment in California would look like but we don't really have that at the at the state level or even at the nation state level so there's I guess the best proxy for investing in the United States is probably buying the s p or something yeah NASDAQ or something like that right but you sure wouldn't want to buy the dollar um but so so maybe that's what we're saying you guys are saying these L2 tokens are they're effectively they're an investment in this emerging Network State let's call it and just like if if you live in California and they're not providing the services it's not worth the network effects aren't worth it you can defect and you can move to Texas for example well all of the different layer twos are competitive with one another and they have to provide the network effect the services or the population applications on top will kind of defect I think the analog kind of kind of holds so is is this making sense or you know are we stretching the metaphor too far well it's a little bit stretched and I mean it is it's one of the things that's generally tricky about technology early stage technology is like we have to reason through analogy and skiomorphically um but if you remember the original iPhone apps we're all kind of like leather and paper and it's because that's like all we were used to when it comes to touch and so we're like well if it's a flat screen let's make it look like paper and leather but that just like doesn't make any sense actually so I think it is a little bit stretched but you know I think analogs are still illustrative they can still teach you things so I do think there's a lot to that you know I think the idea that there are a network of facts the idea that there is a notion of brand there's Community there's cultural alignment and so like by choosing to live in San Francisco you're making sort of like a cultural statement about your values as much as you are physically where you choose to live um so I think a lot of those those drivers will exist in l2s as well and then I think you're pointing around you know what is the ease of switching given that all these things are evm right now on top of ethereum um and the ease of sort of moving things around I think at least in the early days um you know it's sort of like if I could effectively pick up and move to Nevada or Texas or Florida without having to uproot my entire family and like you know would I would I do that um I think a lot of people would actually consider doing that so by like lowering the like the difference I guess here with the l2s is like the switching cost is significantly lowered as the infrastructure gets better and better like I can just use optimism or arbitrum as an end user or if I as a developer can just move my code because it's all evm and it like basically works the same way everywhere then the switching costs are significantly lower than they are in the physical world so to answer this this first question and the question I think people investors are rightly asking during during the bear Market are Layer Two tokens valuable you guys are saying Hell yeah they're available they're valuable just look at the kind of the the on-chain revenue profile and in fact for those saying that like it's impossible to uh to Value different crypto assets I think um you guys are saying you can actually value this as a capital asset and forecast revenue and profit over time and plug in the numbers in Excel a spreadsheet and it'll give you the valuations is that what you're saying here that's well I want one one copy out there is I think um everybody should do their own math on this and figure out whether or not that that's actually true but the general statement I think definitely holds which is you can absolutely make an assertion here that there can be cash flow coming out of this thing there is some sort of pricing power you can figure out what your assumptions might be for that um what the costs are for running the network and and there's certainly a spreadsheet model that you could produce here that would produce like positive cash flow out to token holders over some period of time that doesn't necessarily make it a great investment that doesn't necessarily mean that people should do it it's extremely risky um but that that's roughly that's generally how we think about these things is like you know if there isn't ultimately going to be cash flow coming out of it the market in the long term will not value the thing anything yeah the only thing I'd add is they'll I think they'll be valuable but the ones that will be the most valuable are the ones that can generate sort of like a unique State um that cannot easily you cannot easily just move to another another roll up and get it so if you think of you know if you have a roll-up that's sort of like the D5 Hub let's say the New York of l2s right you can't just go to Texas or you just can't go to Chicago and sort of get that same um liquidity Etc and so any any of the Roll-Ups I can actually build this like sort of unique state that cannot easily be replicated um are going to be the most valuable well then I think that brings me to the second question that I highlighted earlier which is another question for the for the bear market right now where everyone's trying to test their their Theses forecast the future of l2s for us there there are two paths and um you know I'll uh give them to you in their most exaggerated forms that we can discussed the one side of the spectrum versus the other there could be a world where we live in with Mill millions of different chains in layer twos or there could be a world we live in where there are a few winners with kind of big Network effects right so um which of those is the most likely outcome like one is a world where we might have uh you know tons of app chains um there aren't any really gen like too many generalized chains uh I don't know if you could put some more color on that but the other is a world where there's a few big Mega chains that kind of win like D5 nft use cases they all sort of accrue to a couple of Mega chains we're sort of seeing that I think on the the main chain layer one side of things but we'll get into that discussion next so what do you think millions of l2s or a few big uh winners of each old what do you think about this yeah this is actually probably one of the things I've most changed my mind on over the last two years um you know I mistakenly assumed there would be some sort of power law the way I think the uh the l1s will have a power law where ether's really big maybe the cosmos ecosystem can be big Solana might be big and you're going to have a long tail um and I mistakenly assume that the l2s would work that way and the the sort of belief I've come to is actually they're going to be millions of l2s um there will be a relatively small number of generalized ones that are permissionless and open but what I think optimism really did by by open sourcing the op stack was they made it really easy for people to spin up their own instance of optimism while still being a part of the ecosystem uh so you look at things like bass and um and as a result I think what you're going to get is not just the truly open permissionless ones you'll get everything from that to ecosystem change so I think they're probably going to be things that are like an nft ecosystem change so to use sunjai's analogy maybe that's like the LA of ethereum um right and there will be um like the kyc uh chain where you have to kyc to get in maybe bass wants to do that with coinbase I'm not implying anything I don't have any inside information or anything but you can certainly imagine coinbase taking that killer asset that they have with 100 million kyc accounts and saying hey you can actually trade in a kyc way here and that looks like Trad five New York um and so you'll get sort of these ecosystem ones all the way out to the Other Extreme of like the only um user of that L2 is a specific application so you essentially get an app chain like the cosmo style you know like I have a game and I want to control the sequencers and I want to have those be hyper centralized to lower gas fees and I just want interoperability with ethol one and so I'm using all the same standards like the same nft standards but I actually want to control it and I I think you'll get the full spectrum there and so if you believe there could be millions of applications then then certainly all of a sudden you end up with millions of app chains well let's maybe test that assumption millions of applications what are all these applications going to be I I somewhat Wonder now I guess this is a reflection in the bear Market it felt like during the um the bull market we had we didn't have we had too many apps not enough block space right it's like blocks you know chain fees were incredibly high now it feels like we're moving towards the opposite world we have all this black block space but we don't have enough apps to actually use it are you like why do you think we're going to have all of these applications why why millions of chains How come every like how come all of these applications need their own chain um well I I think there's there's a couple of things to pull on there so you know one it is sort of more abstractly it's it's interesting when you look at the history of available computational power whether that's CPU or Ram or hard drive space whatever uh it just gets sucked up like as soon as you make it available some developer finds a way to use it this is like the infamous Bill Gates quote that like 64k of RAM is enough for everybody and you just don't need more than that and here we really said that yeah something something that I I don't forget the exactly what was but we should look it up um in the late 80s and it's um it's probably misattributed in some form I'm sure he's a very smart guy so he probably meant it in a different context or something but the observation is like you know my like how much faster are our computers today and like how much slower do they feel than the 1990s there's there's a great video that was circulating a couple weeks ago I don't know if you saw this about like Windows NT or Windows 3.1 and you look at like the boot the boot times and like how quickly apps come up and it's instant and it's like slower today even though computers are 10 million times more powerful and so there's just like this property of computational markets which is like as soon as you give developers some computational resource somebody will find way to use it and break through somehow and so you just sort of perpetually sucking up all the available capacity and so I suspect that will be the case here if I had to guess what is the initial set of use cases there I think it's probably going to be games um yeah I think often you see that in a lot of early platforms and um and you know in some sense D5 and nft are games they're actually just real world real money games being played across the entire internet rather than being played in like some executable that you run on your computer it's being played on Discord and Telegram and Twitter and in the real world at events and like that they're just games that we're playing they're social games that we're playing someone was collapsing down to the idea of like how much of real life is actually a game like yeah I don't know I just like it's all made up it's all a game that we're all playing kind of thousands thousand percent it's something simulator somewhere yeah that's a that's important stuff too but no I mean if you if you look at like PRI a lot of primate Behavior I mean this is the thing too is right like look at the world's richest man Bernard Arnold right he runs lvmh like what does that guy do that guy is basically like makes money by selling you a 300 leather item for three thousand dollars because you're playing a social game like what you're doing is converting capital capital into social capital and it turns out billions of humans want to play that game um and that's just a totally socially constructed game that that all these people need to play and hence this is the richest man in the world um but it's hard I think for a lot of Engineers and a lot of traffic like rational you know you like look at Finance analysis or economic analysis and like the center um actor and all of that is always um like a rational adult you know it's like somebody who only like behaves 100 rational and you're like but but that that that's like a disconnect with reality that's just like not how um how things work in reality and so like we're all playing games that's like 80 of life is playing games I mean that I just wanted to to hone in on that because if anyone hears a virtual listening to this and it's like well it just game so well that's kind of a small use case you're talking about like hundreds of billions just like no like expand your definition of what a game actually is if you know a game can kind of uh Encompass everything it can be all of the use cases like you know what is um buying you know property being a real estate agent in Manhattan is that is that is that a game to acquire more and more kind of uh real estate tokens I I also find that like the best training I've had for crypto is actually playing video games I've talked to many crypto investors who said something like similar it's like just playing RPG games and you know um RTS games all of these things uh as they were growing up I mean like now what do we do as crypto investors well we just try to level up and collect coins yeah okay that's true uh that's a thousand percent correct Sanjay what do you think about this this question uh millions of l2s are big winners yeah so I think to think about that question you first have to maybe like drill down into what do you get by being on sort of a general purpose Chain versus like what is the advantage of being on a specific L2 and so when you're on a general purpose chain like arbitrum optimism you get that asynchronous composability um that's like key especially for defy but there are actually like really big advantages to being on an app specific chain you lose the interoperability well not like total interoperability but you list sort of that asynchronous composability yeah well really you do get per block composabilities where you lose yeah yeah exactly flashlights yeah you retain uh interoperability yeah but but you get like a bunch of customizability um you get sort of like if you don't want your fee markets to be intertwined with the fee markets of all these other chains you get that sort of isolation and then you also get some level of protection from like what the L2 would do so like if you're an app and arbitrum for example and then arbitrum does some governance thing that you just think is like a terrible decision you're kind of stuck because you're an arbitrum now like you're you're dap on arbitrum whereas if you're sort of like this app specific chain you can actually then say Hey you know I don't really agree with this like maybe I'm going to move to optimism right um and so you get you get a lot more flexibility that way so there are these like I think clear sort of orthogonal trade-offs and I think some lend itself to like the the asynchronous composability means that there will be a set especially like defy that will be on the general purpose roll up and then there will be a lot of app specific l2s because I do think that there are um some clear advantages that so A good mix of both is sort of what I would think one pushback against the millions of chains uh idea here is that maybe there's some um ux Power law here Network effect right and I'm just looking at today's world in today's world if you're on arbitrum you want to get to polygon or optimism or something like that there's a work involved right like you go a bridge and then you're somewhere else and like the experience is different different set of applications like it very much feels like um moving like to a new neighborhood a new town um there's some friction in the US do you think all of it that gets uh abstracted away in the millions of change because it feels like it would almost have to uh the security issues the ux issues would have to be abstracted away from the user in order for millions of chains to actually work yeah I think that's a great point I think that ux today is is really tough for users but I mean already you can see sort of the buddings of how this would get abstracted away you have a lot of stuff around shared sequencers which would help increase interoperability you've seen the polygon 2.0 Vision that was laid out recently you've seen the ZK stack recently Vision by ZK sync which allows for a lot more interoperability so already I think we're getting sort of um maybe a little snippet or a little preview of how some of these things might get resolved and I think over time I do think that they will get significantly better okay but to push back on that though what those look like is a bunch of architectures for different super chains and still if I'm going to go from polygon to arbitrum do you know it feels like that could be an argument more for a world with a small number of big Winners that all kind of um make the ux very good inside of their stack but it becomes very difficult if you're moving from like a polygon you know 2.0 to an uh optimism or some other you know stack yeah well I mean I think it depends on standards right so if there are some standards that are set right across different chains and I think you could have similar interoperability across different changes as long as two chains are sort of speaking the same language um and uh you know right like that's how sort of like right now we have all these chains that are all sort of like speaking different languages I would say and if you look at sort of how the internet works right everybody's on this like sort of tcpip protocol and so I do think that there could be a world in which these sort of super chains can also interoperate with each other and the shared sequencers are sort of independent of these super chains that that's sort of just a separate concept for multiple chains that are all speaking different languages can kind of go there and sort of interoperate you know I've had a couple a couple of things a couple threads to Poland so yeah I think folks like espresso building shared sequencers I think um you know there's IBC as a bridge Tech and messaging Tech like I think a lot of the infrastructure significantly reduces the friction to sort of moving between different things and and it becomes effectively standard and so then you can sort of move assets around I think there's a lot of work to do on the user experience this is this is something we talk about a lot internally and we've we've tweeted about and written about is like this is probably the big bottleneck now um it's actually the thing like at this point if I think about you know going back to your highest order question about conviction what is the thing that I worry about the most like why won't crypto work like why will the l2s not work well with while ethereum not become this third digital country and so on and so on I think the biggest risk is actually user experience which is like so many people can get exposed to this technology because everybody has a phone there's now five billion phones in the world that if the guard rails aren't in place yet and there's too much friction and people come in and they just lose their wallet keys or like you know something bad happens that you could actually Poison the Well and so actually like being able to get to a billion people overnight is is as much a curse as a gift and so I actually think if if crypto were to not succeed like what's the bear case overall for all of this stuff just not working I think it's actually the ux burns people like it's so like like our ability to to get people to try this thing is so far ahead of our ability to build good user experiences right now that we could actually burn a lot of people and so I actually that's funny like I basically have the opposite I have like the inverse concern as you Ryan which is like I don't worry that the ux is gonna like prevent people from doing it I actually think it's like too easy to get into the into the flow of this stuff and then you can get caught and you can lose your assets and then that just burns you and then you don't want to touch this stuff and then we kind of have to cycle out an entire seven or ten years of people to like forget the pain of having lost their money because the ux was bad well okay I mean case in point is um 2022 wasn't it yeah I would argue a lot of people used a centralized lending platforms because as opposed to D5 because the ux is better it was easier to use Celsius or block fi you know than it was maybe to go get your metamask and do a bankless wallet and go use something like like Ave or a compound and so and now what's that generation they're paying for it and they some of them have left crypto with a very bad taste in their mouth as a result yeah that's right or you look at nfts and like I think fortunately nfts did not get big enough this cycle I think there's a chance that they get really big in the next cycle and they come back but my concern would be that if like it's too easy to get into the nft world and it's too easy for money to flow in there um that actually people will get burnt before we have the guardrails in place which is the other side of ux like it has to be basically it has to be easy to use this stuff but we also have to put like the safety measures in place so that people can't just lose all their money and lose the private keys and need password recovery and you need like you need to have ways for it to be um you know decentralized that the centralized guys can't just like be opaque about what they're doing and take a bunch of risk and lose all your money there's just like I actually worry about the other side of it is like if it's too easy to use a lot of people may may just get burned um so there's like there's a there's a there's a really difficult tension here like you want this stuff to be easy to use but in very particular ways and still let people protect themselves and I actually think if if this stuff becomes a little too easy to use that that people may just get burned like it I kind of I kind of like the the sort of contrary intake I have a little bit is like I kind of hope we have a long bear Market because the longer it's like like three years right we're already 18 months into it but the reason is that like if you start to your point right if you look at the quality of experiences that are being produced today like every six to 12 months like the user experiences get better and better and it gets easier and easier to use this stuff without totally burning yourself so like coinbase is MPC Mobile Wallet it's like actually pretty good um or like institutional custody is way better than it was even 18 months ago you have companies like fordify um and so I think it would give people like another 18 months or 24 months to actually make these experiences good and safe then we have a shot at not burning people and poisoning the well um so I'm I'm actually kind of like I kind of secretly hope that like that we just have this like sideways burn for like another two years so that like we can build really good experiences so that when I mean you look at Chad GPT it went zero to 100 million people basically overnight like in 30 days right and so like I'm not I'm not at all worried about whether or not people show up here because there's so many much utility and so I just want it to be like really good and easy and safe when people actually show up when we go to like as as investors selfishly I mean valuations are a bit lower than they were before right so it's a kind of nice that's nice yeah always be skeptical of anything a VC says so yeah that's fair fair point metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the best way to view your crypto portfolio from a holistic level see everything across all the trains all at once in your portfolio metamask will report the aggregate value of all the assets in your metamask wallets and even the other wallets you import too but metabask portfolio isn't just a passive portfolio viewer it is a place to do all of the money verbs that make defy so powerful you can buy swap bridge and stake your crypto assets so not only is metamask the easiest place to see your wallets in aggregate but it's also a powerful battle station for all of your D5 moves so go check out your metamask portfolio because it's waiting for you to open it up check it out at portfolio dot metamask.io introducing polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky 2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 ZK evm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves since you brought it up a virtual uh nfts and burning people are nfts dead is the question here and I think a lot of people are wondering this in the bear market and I think your answer to this is probably no because I uh snuck a look at one of your your tweets um prior to recording this episode and eventually said this nfts are this Cycle's altcoins we are seeing liquidity flee and rotate out as the excess comes to an end just as with icos the adiq belief is actually right just too early ethereum Solana layer 2's defined stable coins all came out of the excesses of the Ico boom it just took a few more years nfts are this Cycle's alt coins so I think you're saying they're not dead you're bullish uh get into that a little bit more why why are nfts um I guess maybe under hyped at this point in time or oversold yeah they and it's not a comment about any particular nft collection or anything like that it's more the concept of nfts which it goes back to this idea of if you look at lvmh you look at Nike you look at Rolex like a lot of the world is about non-fungible items right like your purse or your watch or your shoes and they're special to you because they're imbued with value because you as a human imbue emotion into these physical objects um and so if you look at just um you know like 20 years ago there were these graphs that used to circulate that was like hey here's how little time is spent on newspapers but look at all the ad dollars on newspapers and here's how much look at all this time being spent on the internet and look at how little money is being spent on online ads and you're like okay well that just has to reconcile like over the next decade that's just gonna fix itself the ad dollars are going to go where where the people are and I kind of look at digital Goods the same way just like look look at us right now it's like you don't know what pants I'm wearing you don't know what shoes I'm wearing you don't know what watch I have on to be I don't even know if you guys are wearing pants to be honestly with Sanjay Anything Goes so you know like why why would you spend 500 on shoes or a thousand dollars on shoes or you know 500 on pants like the whole like yes there's gonna be some segment of those people that appreciate the craftsmanship like that menswear guy on Twitter that somehow is like always in my feed or like that guy is going to continue to buy great clothing no matter what but a lot of people do it the bulk of people out are you do it because of the social signaling and nfts are it turns out way more effective at accomplishing that end goal so the internet the internet Flex is much more important than the real life Flex 1000 and it's not only is it more important but it's it's actually from a utilitarian perspective it's more efficient so so think about the math here right like let's say you're going to buy it a 200 000 uh Patek Grand complications and it's on your wrist how many people are going to see it on your wrist like maybe 10 000 people over the life of you having that watch are going to see it and spot it and say oh that's a 200 000 watch and so it's effectively 20 CPA like per conversion of person that sees it and now you get their social capital now it's a very particular group of people and you might want that group's approval but it's effectively 20 CPA if instead you buy and spend two hundred thousand dollars on digital items whether that's skins in fortnite or nfts on your Twitter profile pfps or whatever else a million people could see it on your Twitter profile no problem right you have one tweet that goes viral and a million people will see that tweet and they see your picture so it's effectively 20 cents an impression uh so it's literally 100x more efficient to accrue Social Capital using digital Goods versus physical goods and one of the really interesting properties with with digital markets tends to be that because of the friction being lowered so significantly relative to physical the market sizes tend to be much much larger and so you know if you look at um take Uber versus taxis right like the big knock against Uber at the series a was well if the entire taxi industry is only worth 10 billion how could you possibly be worth more than 10 billion and here we are and you have Uber and Lyft and DD and grab and like all these companies all over the world that in aggregate are worth more than 100 billion um and so my my opinion actually is that if you think lvme H and Nike and Rolex and you know these are tiffany like these are Monster brands in the offline world that actually by opening up brand and opening up luxury and opening up Social signaling digitally like that could actually be 10x bigger um and so what we now have is this like shared infrastructure to be able to do that and so like every game is going to use nfts because it's just better to use them it's just interoperable with every game now so you can recruit other people to come in every brand is going to do nft drops because it's actually 100 gross margin like Nike just minted 20 million dollars for doing like some digital art and then they did this fortnite thing where you can like see Nike Apparel in in fortnite lvmh is going to do this it's just like lower cost of production of the item and people are still willing to pay whatever they pay for it because the brand value um and you now have a direct pipe to your fans so like Nike or lvmh or Tiffany know who their biggest fans are they're most loyal fan base because they're seeing them and have a direct pipe to them they can actually talk to them directly and there's now an advertising Network that gets built on the back of that right so I can look on chain and I can figure out exactly which people are actually the super fans of Nike or the super fans of Rolex and if I want to do a collab or if I want to try to recruit those people instead of me going to Facebook and paying the ad Network to acquire another mobile app install for a game or for for a key type of customer I can just incentivize that customer I can just say hey look if you show up and you prove to me that you've spent this much money on these types of goods or that you've spent you know you bought 10 pairs of Nike Goods or you've spent a bunch of time in Roblox and you can cryptographically prove that to me I'll just give you something in my in my ecosystem I'll just give you a free digital good worth a thousand dollars and now you're actually paying the end user to come use your thing so you start playing this out and so it's not just like that it's more utilitarian as a starting point but like the interoperability and then the network that you build around everybody doing this on top of one standard and one network itself creates five to 10x more value in my opinion until like the downstream effect of this is just like all of this digital good spending I think just moves digital over the next 10 to 20 years and the beneficiary is is the whole ecosystem actually because you you can now build a network effect around all these people doing it on top of one standard you don't think we've burnt out too many people in 2022 with kind of the the ux mistakes of buying an nft I was going to moon and then the you know the company or the centralized product kind of exit scams you or the like the asset that you thought was going to go to the Moon Yeah decreases 99 in value you don't think we've burned people out now it goes it's very very in my mind I was having this conversation with a friend of mine over the weekend and that's what sparked that tweet was the realization was that's basically how icos were right if you go back to the Ico boom it was 2017 they're all these ideas like D5 is going to be awesome and you're gonna be able to do real world assets on chain and like we'll have stable coins it'll be super fast and settle quickly and like we'll have l2s and we had all these ideas and they were basically directionally correct like all the ideas were right but it really Taps into that human psychology there's this adage to make Bill Gates to sort of offset my my Bill Gates disparaging with Bill I mean yes there so we gotta set this right but you know to inflate as ego a little bit um he has this quote that's like you know people dramatically underestimate what's possible in two years or sorry dramatically overestimate what's possible in two years and dramatically underestimate what's possible in 10 years and that's kind of what happened here right like over the last two years everybody dramatically overestimated what would happen with nfts and it just it takes a decade to build a brand it takes a decade to build a real Community but I think we're going to look back in 10 years and there's going to be a some really big Winners that come out of this cycle um or even earlier you look at something like crypto punks um and and it takes 10 years to have that Lindy kick in um but I think the next wave of stuff might actually be the wave of stuff that works because it it's sort of from the ground up uses nft infrastructure in the right ways and does the right things and incentivizes the right Behavior Having learned from just this graveyard of mistakes that have been made over the last two to three years in nfts this is where the art maybe science I don't know if would you lean on more in your investing but it comes in though is because of the things that you mentioned let's say somebody's bullish on the category of nfts and what you mentioned I mean there's a hundred different uh startup ideas there and you know thousands of different assets that you could purchase and so many of them will end up in the in the graveyard because there are so many different ways this nft space could emerge so let's say I'm bullish nfts right okay so what do I go buy do I go buy the Zuki collection do I go buy an index of the top you know 25 nfts right now do I go uh invest in in picks and shovel infrastructure do I go look at um maybe this goes with you know established Brands like the Nikes of the world this comes from the established Brands leak into nft so do I look at their assets or or companies that are making like or do I do all of the above so how do you distill that I'm bullish on nfts into navigating the idea Maze of what specifically to invest in because you don't want to end up in the graveyard do you yeah so obviously not Financial advice and so kind of without saying here's what people should do or go do I think there's a meta framework for this which is you can only really generate value as an investor if you have a deeper understanding of what's Happening than anybody else like effectively Alpha in a market comes from depth of understanding if you can see the actual value of the thing and there's a disconnect between perception and reality right so if the world thinks something is worth X but it turns out to be worth 2X and there's that that's a Delta between perception and reality and so what you really have to do as an investor across all the categories that you mentioned picks and shovels if you're an early stage Equity investor um you know nfts themselves if you're more of like an art curator what you really have to do is understand the thing better than anybody else you have to have some perspective on it that says actually reality is different than perception and and that's fundamentally what you're betting on and there are a million different ways to do that like art art curators and collectors you know can be wildly successful people who um you know invest in pixel can be wildly successful people who um you know maybe you say hey I think there are certain brands that are really going to benefit from this and so like I should just go buy stock like public stock and companies and you know you looked at if you really understood AI five or seven years ago maybe just bought up a bunch of Nvidia when it was you know down big time and that's how you sort of played that market so there are a lot of different ways to do it um but I think the Crux of it is like you have to more deeply understand what's happening in some sub-sector than anybody else and and be able to identify that Delta between perception and if you don't your is better off with an index or something like this like or just or just finding the place in the world where you do have that you know like there are a lot of ways to make money right it's one of the things that we've had to learn um just as early stage investors is like or you know Stan druckenmiller um is a public market investor Warren Buffett they sort of have their own versions of this and you know I think Stan calls it a fat pitch like really the way you make money is like you find a thing where you're like I'm pretty sure I understand this better than anybody else and it's just such a good setup it's it's kind of like a uh heads I win Tales I win you know it's like no matter what happens like you're gonna do great um and there are enough such opportunities in the world that you don't have to be like fomoing into stuff it's actually like patients patience is a virtue here yeah and all investing I I'll tell you my worst fear and maybe this should be every Investor's worst fear though is is you see what you just saw let's say you see the opportunity in crypto right and then and then within that you see the opportunity in nfts and guess what you us we people listening this may be among the one percent less than one percent of people who see the opportunities uh in nfts the nft category in the world doesn't my worst fear as an investor is I see that opportunity and I make all the bad bets in that category and lose all my money or I don't make the return right so it's like you imagine nfts are big we all kind of make that prediction but then you you make a series of bad choices in the nft segment and you don't end up accruing the rewards of that you end up losing anyway is there a way to prevent that from a meta perspective as an investor I think you have to I actually think probably most people should not be looking at nfts or early stage crypto as an investment I think if you look at it as an investment like you're probably going to lose this is why like a Warren Buffett or you know Vanguard people will tell you to just buy the index because it turns out most people are not good investors um it's a really hard thing and and speaking well like if everybody were a great investor especially with really high risk highly volatile assets then everybody we everybody would be rich right like and it turns out it's really hard to make money doing these things and so actually I think most people should not be looking at this as an investment buy for the art like buy for the community buy it because it brings you Joy size those things so that like if you lose a little bit of money because you bought the art and you supported some artists that you really believe in then you don't feel bad about it you're like well the whole point was to support like I I am subscribed to like some patreons and it's like I've forgotten how much it is but it's just because they're like these people creating great content I'm just like yeah five bucks a month let me just chip in and I don't think about it right um that's I think the right lines that most most people should have on it and if somebody does want to become an investor I think it one of the things you have to learn is that discipline of like how do you size your positions appropriately how do you not take undue risk like rule number one is don't blow up um and if you if you're taking so much risk that you're going to implode then like you won't be here and that's again it's not Financial advice like I actually think most people should not be investing in this stuff I think most people should not be trying to think of it as an investment um because you're probably going to lose your money um but if you're going to go down that path size it appropriately and it goes back to this idea of like what do you like great startups and great early stage investing and great early Market intuition and I think you know nfts are very early Market it's based on some secret like you have to understand something that's true that other people haven't figured out that's true and if you don't know what that secret is then like you don't know the secret and if you don't know that Insight then you probably shouldn't be investing like the the um poker equivalent of that is like if you're if you look around the table and you don't know who the sucker is then you're the sucker right like that's the poker equivalent and so you better you better understand the market better than anybody else and have some deep Insight in order to be able to invest and make money I think the other component Ryan to your question is when do you invest in these things so you know we're sort of very early into nfts and as an individual investor you could I mean I understand it's like it's a crap shoot at this point like what's like are all these nfts gonna yeah you know am I going to pick the right nfts or not but you could wait you know a few years and then maybe what emerges is sort of like a blue chip layer of sort of nfts like if you just think about cryptos in general right like you as an investor on the sideline you can say well I'm going to invest in like Bitcoin and eth and like those can be like my Holdings and so like maybe in like three or four years the equivalent will emerge in nfts so maybe the answer is um you you just hold off for some amount of time until some sort of reliable index or this is this is also uh this is also a good observation to like if um a lot of times people really underestimate the size of the market and so if things work out the market will likely be 10x to 100x bigger than than you could have imagined and again it goes back to this idea of patience it's like buying Bitcoin in 2012 was easy holding on for 10 years was hard um right like the patience is the hard part um or a lot of times when you see a lot of activity happening like not investing is the hard part um until you really have conviction on the thing um and I suspect if this stuff works the markets are going to be much much much larger it's just like the internet nobody could have imagined you go back to the year 2000 and you're like hey in 20 years all of the world's largest companies are going to be internet companies would have been sort of Unthinkable like apple is going to be a three trillion dollar company when Steve Jobs come back comes back in the late 90s and it's like a failing Enterprise that's going to go bankrupt like these were just like Unthinkable statements right so um patience I think is like the key thing and and patients oriented towards how do you understand more deeply what's happening with the user with the business with the market than anybody else and only then should you really be thinking about investing and I think that's usually the failing like most people don't actually deeply understand the things that they're investing in um and therefore they end up losing money because they just don't deeply understand what what actually makes money in the space speaking of patience and testing conviction I think the the alternative the the non-etherium layer one Community is definitely going through that right now right this communities like Solana the cosmos token Avalanche these sorts of things that had a massive run-up and now uh some of them are kind of in existential crisis mode um down bad as we would say in crypto and this brings kind of another question I wanted to ask you guys is the future do you think there will be a contender for ethereum's uh throne in the future will The ethereum Killers make it come come back as they have in previous cycles and what about this broader question of a modular versus monolithic chains um bankless listeners will know of course um ethereum has taken the the modular route with scaling via layer twos there are other ecosystems that have taken kind of a modular route they're a little bit different maybe Cosmos is sort of one of those more modular and then there's this question of Monolithic chains of which you know Solana has maybe most famously gone in that direction so what do you think about all these questions uh alternative layer ones youth killers are we going to have you said uh that layer ones are more more of a network Effect game than layer twos are you sure about that so let's dig into this uh vichel what do you think um so okay so zooming back on modular versus um monolithic you know I think um Sanjay touched on this earlier the fundamental trade-off is do you want real-time composability or not like intra block composability and the L ones like Solana give you this property and sort of you know as soon as you start moving into l2s and you start fragmenting liquidity and execution you lose that now you retain interrupt interoperability and so there are a lot of use cases that are you know you need the interoperability but you don't need real-time composability but I think a lot of Monolithic people would argue that that real-time composability is like the one of the killer features of these blockchain architectures and so why would you give that up you should really lean into that and then the fundamental trade-off you have to make is around decentralization and so you know like the monolithic argument which I I actually do think is compelling for certain kinds of use cases is can you be sufficiently decentralized to still be decentralized and censorship resistant even at state level attack kind of um censorship resistant while retaining composability and that's like that's an interesting design exercise like can you design a blockchain that does that and I think that that's compelling because I think there are use cases that will want that set of trade-offs um and so I think it's really good from an ecosystem perspective for both of these things to exist and and the search space to include both and I think if you step back even even to like hundred thousand foot view I mean like part of the idea here right like the whole reason this space was invented um in the first place was that um centralization is not healthy and if we only end up with if we end up with only ethereum I think we have failed as a space because that's not resilient at the ecosystem level like ethereum can be resilient but what if there are like critical day Zero issues with like clients or with the evm or you know like um you know I I just I worry that if we don't have multiple approaches that we're not actually as an ecosystem being resilient and I think that um if we think of it as a non-zero thing which is like well they can both be successful they could both be 100x bigger um than they are today I think that's the right mindset on it so I'm a huge fan of everybody trying to do both of these things or like the fact that Solana doesn't do evm I think that's awesome like I think that's actually really important um to have a totally different technology tree that we're exploring to like use a use a video game term right like I think that's really really important for this space to survive and be thriving 10 years from now um and I don't think of them as like I don't think of Solana as an Heath killer I think they both coexist and they just solve different problems with different ecosystems and I think that's awesome um and so our approach has been they make different technical trade-offs applications and ecosystems will emerge that take advantage of those different trade-offs and they should both coexist um and they'll just solve different problems and they can both be they can both be ridiculously successful as ecosystems and coexist one thesis that bankless has had for for a while and I'm wondering your take on whether you agree or disagree with this actually is um that if you're a layer one you're sort of competing at the the money game basically where you want need your asset to accrue monetary premium which is basically like selling block space isn't enough if all of your alternative competitors are also selling valuable block space and creating uh Revenue that way and it also valued as a money because if your value doesn't money just the um the kind of the network Effect game the liquidity game The Economic Security game is tilted so much in your favor that you you end up winning anyway what do you think about that do you think uh layer ones are all playing for the Bitcoin ether more recently game of monetary premium or do you disagree with that yeah I disagree with that I'm curious what Sanjay thinks but yeah I disagree with that and and you know thought experiment here is like well if you look at Amazon's market cap like what percentage of Amazon's market cap is due to AWS um or what percentage of Microsoft's market cap like if Azure were Standalone business what would that be worth and I think it turns out that computational networks are extremely valuable at scale like all of Wall Street and you know all of tradfi were running on one platform um that was 100 interoperable with each other so every Bank could immediately calculate how much leverage they have and you know you could know exactly who owns Which mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and that were all in one platform that platform would be tremendously valuable now there's this actually goes back I think to the L2 question which is like what kind of pricing power does that L1 need to have on top of that platform existing in one place and I think if you think of it like a country there are real Network effects and there's real brand value and there's real you know the ability for a new application to launch and acquire a bunch of customers because the infrastructure exists there right there's accounting tools and MPC wallets and you know distribution platforms for people to find users like those things are real Network effects that create pricing power and so I think these things if they're able to be successful will be computational networks with pricing power on top of it like I don't think they collapses zero because I think Network effects give you pricing power the same way that apple or Facebook have it so I don't think you have to have you don't have to become base money like I don't think you have to compete with the US dollar I don't think you have to compete with Bitcoin um all you need is pricing power above the cost of running the network um and and that can you know that that looks a little bit more like a company right like apple has pricing power or Facebook has power because of the network effects and I think that's actually how these things will will eventually operate um and then you'll have cash flow coming off of them like I think these things will extract some premium on top of the cost of running the computation and and the cost of the block space and um that the token holders can benefit from that would you value the Bitcoin Network and the Bitcoin asset based on cash flow or do you ascribe a kind of a monetary premium to that is that like a special case yeah a special case I think the the the the reason that bitcoin's a special case is that it's it behaves a little bit more like a commodity right so it's a fixed Supply like the idea is for it to move slowly and not evolve rather than a computational network that needs to sort of evolve as a platform form to acquire keep acquiring developers like Bitcoin is ordinals is kind of an elegant hack but it's not a developer platform that's really not what Bitcoin is designed for Bitcoin is designed to be more or less static and evolve very very slowly so I think it behaves a lot more like a base money or a lot more like a like a gold or a commodity so I think you just have to value that differently but I think that's a special case like I think comparing Bitcoin against ethereum um for you know these other computational networks I think it sort of it doesn't really lean into what makes Bitcoin special and unique that's fascinating I feel like we could have an entire podcast just kind of debating that or getting into that discussion a little bit more I tend to think that the lines are a bit more blurry here between like money versus pricing power of you know Network effect and they may in at the end of the day be one in the same but um yeah it's you know it definitely maybe maybe one way to put it is like you know I think there's this very um binary approach that people have which is like either you have a monetary premium or you're going to collapse to the price to the price of the running the computational network and I think this is actually a legacy of sort of um early Bitcoin maximalism like Circa 2015 and there are some papers that were circulating around that time that people basically framed ethereum as that and they're like we're like look if you don't have monetary premium your your token will just collapse to the price of running the network because it's a computational commodity but I think there's this thing in the middle which is if you have cash flow and you have pricing power due to network effects then you don't have to be base money to get a monetary premium and you're not going to collapse to the price of of running the computational network and I think the open question is how significant is that does that mean that you get a 15 margin on top of it does that mean you can charge 2x what it cost you to run it can you you know like where on that Spectrum are you I think is the open question but I think ethereum is a great proof point for this actually I I think I agree with that like there is a spectrum of of moneyness and um memetic value and um I I do think that's more complicated to say something is competing as money or it's not as in reality probably all assets are competing is the money I mean you just think of s p 500 in stock is that competing is a store of value well it sort of is to a house my property sort of is as well um one last question for you and then we'll kind of uh draw this to a close um so restaking let's get to that really quick is it a big deal or is this overhyped we've had some panels lately about the um the existential uh I guess threat of staking and some of the ethereum researchers actually think restaking poses some existential threats in the same way that me V is but let's take those issues separately so first of all restaking is it a big deal or is it over hyped at this point and then what do you think about the existential risk to underlying blockchains that that recovery staking on top of them um yeah I mean I think I think restaking is is a big deal right because it's it's really hard to bootstrap a trust Network that's it's just one of the hardest things there is to do um and we've we've just seen that but lots of chains have difficulty doing that and so if you can take the existing Trust of ethereum and um and reuse that I think that's a big deal now I maybe have sort of a a little bit of a nuanced opinion here which is that Roll-Ups um so I I think maybe what will will play out is I think there's this sort of envisioning of like thousands of protocols maybe using these restaking layers and I think that it may not actually play out like that but I think it may be a few really big important protocols using these restaking layers so as opposed to thousands of chains being restaked it might be like 12 really important ones and so like what are the things that could really benefit from restaking um a decentralized sequencing layer a DA layer bridging so there's a few like really really core use cases and if you think about these use cases they're massive right like a scalable da layer that's a massive use case a scalable sequencer layer that can basically support you know thousands of Roll-Ups that's a huge use case so I'm sort of I'm super bullish on restaking as a means to provide decentralization decentralization Beyond ethereum to the broader ecosystem do I think it's going to um and it's going to be massively impactful do I think there's going to be thousands of protocols running on these restaking layers that I probably think will not happen and we should call out we're we're investors in eigenlayer and espresso so the premier restaking protocol and the premiere shared taking server protocol just again back to this idea of like don't listen to VCS like VCS are going to talk their book and so you know always keep that in mind well I imagine you guys are also investors at some level in ethereum which brings up the question of existential risk to ethereum for staking a virtual what do you think of of that I know you listened to the uh the recent page yeah that was great I can Drake and yeah and Tim and yeah it was really really good that was a great conversation um and SRI Ram did a great job too and I think yeah you know kind of two thoughts I agree with Sanjay you know I think it's it's really probably a handful of use cases that are really critical uh for restaking um you know there's a question of do those start to get so large that it you know if that they start to pose some sort of existential risk to ethereum like you know from that shared security across the answer is maybe I mean it's kind of like TBD I think it kind of goes back to you know people tend to think either people tend to have these sort of binary approaches to think about this stuff and I think there's like a messy middle a lot of times and so I think there's a world where restaking gets big enough that it's interesting and useful but not so big that it's essentially a threat um I also think that ecosystems tend to be pretty resilient and so I suspect if it starts to get into that kind of like existential risk territory um we'll figure it out like the ethereum ecosystem has been remarkably resilient about these kinds of existential risks and like fixing them um and so I have a lot of faith in in generally the ecosystem and the researchers and the developers and the community to sort of evolve and figure it out and so we start getting to that point I suspect there will be you know like I think um camera if it was Justin or Tim but somebody was talking about like how would the protocol need to evolve to account for this potentially and so you know that might be a solution or there may be things that um that you could do kind of at the protocol level above ethereum protocol so I think um if you look at liquid staking tokens um you know people talk about existential risk if it's all sort of going through one protocol and I think there are simple ways to mitigate that right there's multiple protocols and you move your youth between multiple protocols or you do some self-staking right I think there are ways to like mitigate that and there's enough well-informed actors kind of at that base layer that basically the right things will happen so um it feels to me like an inevitability and if we get into sort of existential territory if we if we're truly it's so successful and so useful that you get into existential territory I suspect the ecosystem will figure it out and for bankless listeners if you're you're newer here in crypto we tend to get an existential risk every six months or so that we think is going to be the downfall of ethereum or crypto in general and uh we're still here we're still here well that's that's the thing is that's why I have so much faith in the community it's just like it's turned out there's so many places where it could have died for the last six years or you know if you look at Bitcoin 12 years and it keeps going and so it's given me a lot of faith in the people the developer Community like it's just so amazing that people figure it out and solve the problems something else I think you have to understand it at a deep level in order to understand the space is that crypto is much more anti-fragile than I think the um the Layman or the person looking at it from above things I remember someone once told me that the reason they're not investing in Bitcoin is because software has bugs I'm a software engineer and so what are the chances there's going to be some bug that expands the supply of Bitcoin to like you know hundreds of millions rather than 21 million right what's interesting about this is as you dig in deeper you realize well that's actually not what secures the the Bitcoin Network it's actually a social protocol like there's a layer zero here that would just Fork that out and would continue running and so if that's a reason not to invest I think that's a mistake in reason but you see that surface level well um guys this has been so much fun I I want to close this out with um a question related to the mood in crypto right now and this is a tweet I put out and I I don't know if you agree with it or I disagree and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it but I'll give you a sense for the mood here crypto feels lost right now all right that idea crypto is lost right now and how can it find its way was the question I posed do you think crypto is lost this uh 2023 bear market and if you do how can it find its way out of each other what do you think no I think we know exactly what to do which is like l1s need to scale we need l2s to work we need like modular blockchains to work we need stable coins and defy like you know there's 120 billion dollars of stable coins and 40 billion sitting in tvl and Heath protocols that's about the 20th largest bank in the United States which is very real um you know I I tweeted a while ago that um eBay at IPO was doing about 340 million dollars of gmv uh nfts do more than that today is what gross merchandise volume so like total value of the goods that they'd sold so eBay 96 wanted ipo'd had done about 340 million and you know Bitcoin ordinals probably do more than that today in the depths of the bear Market um and so like sentiment is is very very low and so it feels it can feel bad um but when I look at the numbers it's just it's actually it's like working I mean it's amazing if you go back to 2017 there's all of this stuff that was theoretical like hey one day ethereum's gonna move to proof of stake and and you know we'll have l2s and we'll have stable coins we'll have defy and like we'll have these Brands coming in and like we might have an ETF and like all this stuff and it was all theoretical ZK you know ZK proofs will work one day and like you know all this stuff NPC will happen one day and like we'll have institutional custody and like yada yada right and like governments will be pro-crypto and all of that stuff was theoretical and basically five or six years later it's basically all true uh which just goes back to this adage of like people way overestimate what's possible in two years and they dramatically underestimate what's possible in 10 years and so like roughly halfway through that 10-year cycle we're like basically where you'd expect which is all the tech is now real and so now it's just a question of like how quickly does it get to people so I definitely feel like it's uh we're down on sentiment but like on fundamentals it's I've never been more optimistic it's just like everything that was vaporware five years ago was actually real now yeah I actually um on Twitter saw this uh videos like with Jeff Bezos and he was talking about the the 2000.com bus and it was like you know I think don't quote me in the numbers but I think it was like Amazon stock went from like 131 to six but then he was there like sitting looking at his metrics and it was like everything was up right um and it was something scratching his head yeah and it you know it's the same thing I mean he's just look at the tremendous progress that's happened in crypto like just even on the ZK side right it was like a year ago nobody thought like a ZK chains were like four years away now we have CK chains and you know we have now Frameworks for ZK interoperability and the op stack and so we just have so much um progress that's been made that um at least for me it's hard to be bearish long term people don't understand how fundamentally different this bear Market is than 2019 and 2020 where I would argue we had much more of an existential where's our stock market fit type of conversation that we have now um guys this has been a lot of fun I think we got to uh they answer this question of what you guys are convicted on by exploring these different questions and in your thesis so uh for each so um thank you so much for joining us on Bank list it's been a lot of fun thanks for having us thanks Ryan action items Free bankless Nation there's a post that we refer to in the episodes called understanding roll up value accrual written by one of our guests Sanjay also encourage you to read the Electric Capital developer report they put this out every year it's always a fantastic read the builders keep building folks that's what the the bottom line of that developer report is uh it continues to go up risks and disclaimers gotta end with this another time I need to tell you none of this has been Financial advice never is on bankless crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you
