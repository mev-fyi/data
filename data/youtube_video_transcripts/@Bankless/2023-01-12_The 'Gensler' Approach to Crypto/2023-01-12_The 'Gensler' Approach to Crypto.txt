we're not really going to get out of the current SEC Administration what we want out of the SEC do you agree with that I do agree the Gensler approach is very much let's push forward and pull everything into the existing regime rather than craft and tailor new regulations he has said that for crypto the only new rules we might need are very tailored disclosure rules it's very unlikely that if we continue to have a gensler-led sec we'll see new rules for crypto assets instead the approach is that every crypto asset in gensler's view are securities and so the exchanges broker dealers investment advisors should all register with the SEC and we should just treat everything like the existing Securities Market what do we wind up with the same security smart we have today nothing new for crypto
