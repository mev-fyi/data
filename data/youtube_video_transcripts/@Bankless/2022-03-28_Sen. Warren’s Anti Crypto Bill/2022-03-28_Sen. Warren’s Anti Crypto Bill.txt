let's talk about our friend elizabeth warren she introduced a new compliance bill for crypto that's using the russian narrative if we need to uh regulate crypto because you can use crypto to get around sanctions even though there's absolutely no evidence that that's actually happening but in addition to that the bill goes beyond russian sanctions an additional provision in the bill would authorize fincen the financial crimes enforcement enforcement network to force users to report transactions larger than ten thousand dollars if they send them outside of the united states but that also begs the question in what jurisdiction is a smart contract is that outside of the united states like it's on the internet is the internet outside of the united states this is like imagine if she put forward a bill that said basically if you keep any valuables i need to know the physical locations of all your vaults you have gold bars in your home you have jewelry like you have any gold which room which room is it in which room in your house the actual location we need an identification system for your physical vaults
