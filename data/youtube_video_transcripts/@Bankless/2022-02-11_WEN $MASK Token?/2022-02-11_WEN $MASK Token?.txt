when mask token i can probably say that it's not enough of a thing that you should be getting excited about it right now do not change your behavior because someone on the internet told you there's a map token yeah we've got ideas for tokens and you know and we've got permission to explore those ideas but our job is to keep users safe so when we endorse something it has the potential to just absolutely undermine all of our credibility you know a lot of the token ideas we have they might not be the things that people would be excited about you know i think people would be excited to just get an airdrop in their wallet unfortunately we've done okay at keeping our users private so we actually don't know who all our users are you know there are things we could do but those things become gameable as soon as people circulate they're like just use swaps a lot it's like okay well we're not trying to pick something that you can game um so you know just make responsible decisions if we choose to do any token we'll get it to you in the most responsible way possible that it be a surprise when it unexpectedly happens in the very distant future
