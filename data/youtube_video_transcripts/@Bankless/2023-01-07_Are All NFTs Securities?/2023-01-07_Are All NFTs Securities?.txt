what do you mean when you say of course nfts are securities why of course there's a test for whether or not something is a security very famous case called uh Howie established the criteria for what would constitute an investment contract the Howie test is so broad that any investment can be uh security because all the Howie test says is that something is an investment contract an investment is a security if it constitutes an investment of money in a common Enterprise with the expectation of profit to be devised that's literally any investment whatsoever so when you ask this question is it a security it's the wrong question the real question is always is it the kind of thing SEC thinks it should be regulating you need to think about how do you explain to the regulator what you're doing and how the regulator can add value to the ecosystem
