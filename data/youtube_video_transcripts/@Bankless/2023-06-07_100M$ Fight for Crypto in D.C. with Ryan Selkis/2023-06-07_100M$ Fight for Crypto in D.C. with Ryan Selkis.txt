one thing about sandbankment freed is his political under his understanding of the political system and and the political game was unparalleled within the crypto industry hmm what he did last year was very Savvy from a a political standpoint we basically need to do something but here's the thing the Silver Lining as we know that but we need to be better as an industry and you need to run a very similar Playbook but with a decentralized based of contributors and a set of honest actors that have been in the trenches for years building or the sole reason that we actually believe in this Tech and its potential to be a force for good the 100 million dollar fight for crypto in Washington DC that's what Ryan sulcus our next guest feels like we need in order to take this battle to DC and to win some questions we had for him in this episode can we actually raise 100 million dollars to fight for crypto in DC what would that even look like what would we spend this on is the US really the place we should fight I thought crypto was International why do we need money in politics to fight this fight anyway we talk about the window of opportunity to actually get this right Ryan selkis thinks we have a very narrow window in which to deploy these funds or else we lose the opportunity and then we get to Ryan's proposal for a new organization that he is creating to help win this fight in DC David this is uh the year of regulatory it's it's 2023. I feel like that's been a major theme for the year and that's why this episode is important yeah it's been the year of bad regulatory uh guidance bad regulatory oversight and Ryan sulcus wants to make it the year of good regulatory oversight uh with what he is proposing here with a digital Freedom Alliance but before we get into that conversation with Ryan I want to talk to you about asymmetrics protocol with our friends and sponsors at asymmetrics if you are familiar with pool together it's quite like that except with eth staking so what does asymmetrics do uh is is that just 4.5 to 5 East staking yield just too boring how does anywhere between zero and 999 percent sell because that is what you can get with asymmetrics uh you put your ether into asymmetrics it Stakes it into lighter with staked eth and then it distributes the yield not to you but to just one lucky winner which could be you but it probably won't but it might and if it is you you will get a lot of eth it's like six eth right now six e to the lucky winner exactly and so uh if you are just uh if you want to just really play with your uh the size of your winnings again either zero or quite a lot uh this is the place for you uh this is called a prize linked savings account so it's like a savings account except instead of slow and steady yield every once in a while you get a price uh so there is a link in the show notes to get started with asymmetrics it's banklist.cc slash asymmetrics and or you can follow them at Twitter at asymmetrics underscore eth David 100 million dollars is pretty ambitious here um but Ryan makes a great case for why we need that much what do you think of his plan I think bankless listeners who are going into this episode I think the uh imagination that they could strike is like hey you know how good SPF was was playing at playing the DC game he was he was very good at it he was a very very effective sadly he was a fraud what what if SPF was playing the game actually in line with crypto's interests that is the question that Ryan is presenting to the industry saying hey we need to do the thing that SBF was doing but for the good guys for us for our own interests it's the correct game to play and it's that we have a very small window of opportunity to play it and we need to be effective because if we lose the game unwinding that game that this game of you know playing the political fight in DC it's a one to two year long game if we lose that game it is 10 years of repair and and going backwards in order to in order to get back to where this industry needs to be so Ryan makes a very strong case that now is the time and DC is the place and so I think that's kind of the imagination I'll leave with listeners is like man what if SPF was a good guy in DC and he actually had fought for her interests how nice would that have been um Ryan's proposing that we do that um sadly a year or so late but regardless it's the right place to be I think he makes a great case for that and if you think that um doing nothing is a viable strategy I think you should listen to Ryan's case for why it's not a viable strategy how doing nothing leads to more spfs actually stepping in to DC and um representing Us in ways that we might not want to be represented so we get into all of that today a very important episode in 2023 in the current climate that we're in for

industry which is in short supply these days and he is here to propose something new for cryptos fight in Washington Ryan welcome back to bankless always good to be here guys hope you're holding up well Ron are you uh picking a fight for us a little bit uh and you know me I I feel like I mix it up with different folks on different occasions throughout the years this is year 10 for me within crypto and I would like to think that at this point my staying power and the fact that I'm still around and still have a few friends in the industry uh means that I've been picking smart fights over the years and I think that this is just the most recent smart fight that is worth fighting um down in DC and a lot of it is damage control and just resetting the narrative post FTS collapse in November um I think we took a huge hit I think DC moves slower and public sentiment Loop moves slower than crypto does so as focused as people are within the industry on moving forward on building our way out of this and getting to the next milestones and kind of next killer apps and laying the foundation for for you know all the infrastructure improvements um that have come out between you know e-scaling and all the Roll-Ups uh genes that have launched um we are still in the feeling the after effects of FTX from a public policy standpoint and we probably will be for some time um so there's a couple of ways out of that um and I think there is General uh a general lack of understanding within the crypto Community uh as to how public policy works and and in particular like how DC works and what I hope uh to do you know today is basically talk about some of those misconceptions and and potentially some of the solutions um that I do think are going to require pretty proactive engagement and not just taking a step back and saying you know oh that's fine the rest of the world will move on and the US will be left behind or you know we're just going to focus on the tax uh and we don't really need to engage with policy makers I think I think both of those are uh Incorrect and I think you've got a couple guests on from the regulatory sphere that have said as much but um even from a crypto native standpoint I would I would try to make that argument and maybe first fact from fiction in terms of what's going on and what's going to get us to the other side of this bear Market well let's start with uh the the first fact from fiction question right I think um you've basically said and you know this may be a direct quote uh Ryan Washington wants to kill crypto do you think that's hyperbole or do you think that's that's really the case like is something different about 2023 uh where Washington has taken this I'm not just going to stifle crypto I we actively want to kill it of course Washington is a complex Beast so you can't talk about every faction wanting to kill crypto maybe you're just referring to a specific contingent but tell us about that does Washington want to kill crypto I don't think everybody in the crypto industry feels that way if you're talking about Bitcoin and you're talking about the government's version of crypto um then I think there's probably some Shades of Gray right that the government doesn't necessarily want to or they won't at least overtly say that they want to to kill those upstarts uh or those um worst uh projects they might be focusing on okay how do we make sure that we prevent another situation like FTX how do we ensure we prevent another situation like Tara but for all intents and purposes the folks at matter in DC right now are in the Biden administration of the financial Regulators right um we've seen what's happened in the past few months with chokepoint 2.0 and the debanking issues that many companies have had in the industry um we've seen this personally um you know at the Missouri level and this new entity digital Freedom Alliance that um we're talking to banking partners and even for pretty plain vanilla organizations that are crypto adjacent that don't actually process transactions that don't actually touch native assets uh it's still a challenge to get through the compliance process you know for banking on the SEC side I think that that ground's been well trotted um what is a security versus a commodity versus a currency um you know chair Gensler has his knives out for the industry and that's going to impact basically every asset not named Bitcoin and he's even extended in fact and the SEC has extended to claiming that stable coins are somehow part of their purview um and then I think when you uh when you talk about the other miscellaneous Regulators you know whether you're talking about the fed and treasury they'll talk about financial stability they'll talk about National Security um we don't have a lot of friends within the Biden Administration right now that's that's just the the ground reality to your Point Washington is not along with right there are folks on both sides of the aisle there are folks on um in different Generations not just in terms of age but in terms of experience and kind of like old school new school where do they come from politically um that are very mixed on crypto and it is fairly split or at least it seems like it's fairly split between what I'd call the ones and the fives right the ones being the Elizabeth Warrens of the world the Brad Shermans of the world that just want to outright kill this and recruit their anti-crypto army then there's the fives maybe that's the you know the the Tom emmers the rokanas the the folks that are really good on um and and tempered in terms of thinking about how to regulate crypto um but the reality is that the vast majority you know 80 plus percent of Representatives in Congress are somewhere between two three and four and most of the time they're at a three because they just don't care and they kind of think that crypto is already dead so um I think much like um you I mean you guys have done a couple episodes on x-rays with AGI right like the the red the X risk with AGI is not that these like agis are evil and they they want to squash everything um it's that they just don't care like you know we're like ants um and there's like there's a little bit of that that you can analogize to in DC which is they see the five bullets like what has happened last year they think this is we have to fix this and they don't really take the time necessarily to get into the the minutia and the details many of them um and and so what may happen if we are not coordinated and highly engaged in DC the next 12 to 18 months is they're just going to steamroll over some of that nuance and ultimately create structures that are going to be untenable for the industry in the U.S for years to come um and I think we do have a very short window I think the 2024 election um is very important and I think uh the work that we do in kind of resetting the narrative and re-establishing trust and in some cases self-regulating uh or at least trying to act according to the spirit of existing consumer protection laws is really going to dictate what type of long-term outcomes we have in the U.S um we can have a global conversation that's adjacent to that but I think about the us as in the medium term a 2X Delta in crypto success you know we have the first second fourth fifth Tenth Amendment you know on our side we have um a pretty libertarian populous we've got the largest tech economy in the world we've got the largest financial markets in the world we've got the reserve currency you know if the US is hospital to crypto versus Friendly or at least common sense in its approach to crypto you're talking about a 2X in Market size one way or the other so um I think uh the risk that Washington kills crypto is not necessarily that it comes down top down evenly and says you know we're I think that might be a little bit of tinfoil hat territory but I think the reality is more likely that they just see the risks here a lot of other big problems that we need to focus on we're going to steamroll over it and then in the process we as an industry will have lost a pretty critical foothold that I think people underestimate in terms of uh the US's importance uh in the crypto economy in the medium term and basically what a hostile us would do um in having uh the potential for the market in the next five years if things go the wrong way I just want to capture that last point because this isn't just about the United States I mean some people might be listening to this and being like Ryan crypto like get out of your American bubble man like crypto is a global movement okay yeah America's uh has the problems right now but America is not the rest of the world but I think you just made the case that the U.S actually is the hill to die on at least for crypto um can you get into that a little bit more can you kind of reinforce that case what why does what happens in the United States matter globally doesn't America just get left behind in crypto Innovation moves elsewhere and and so we Soldier on why why take this fight to Washington so hard I mean I think you have to just be realistic about about where funding comes from uh around where demand has come from historically and where a good chunk of development is right now uh and then also which nations have the rule of law and kind of the existing you know societal Norms that are going to Foster innovation in an area uh like crypto um and the easiest way to do that is to look um just very simply China us Europe rest of world right do you want to be building decentralized Technologies behind the great firewall of China and do you think that that ultimately is going to be a healthy market for technologies that decentralize power that decentralized Authority and that ultimately Empower individuals um to make private transactions or own their own data or you know otherwise kind of live live as self-solverance um that's a pretty easy yes or no question I'll leave that to The Listener to decide but you know I I think that it's somewhat straightforward another quarter of the world you can break down as European uh Centric and I think Europe is actually an area that we've made some progress from a regulatory standpoint I'm not totally convinced that we're going to love all the solutions that come out of Europe if you think about what's happening with Mika right now there are restrictions on you know how much you can have in self-custed accounts they're going to be disclosure requirements they're already tremendous speech restrictions uh in the EU uh whether you're talking about you know just the drama the last week with Twitter and the disinformation uh issues that that they have um the ministry of Truth you know as it were in in the EU if you're thinking about um the uh the health of the Euro and just like the governance issues that you have in the European Union I don't think you want to put all of your eggs in that basket um and so then you're basically left with half of the global economy you know 25 of it being the US 25 rest of the world we should focus on I think Europe and the US I'm an American you guys are American so I kind of feel like the EU is run by technocrats and Mika is already fairly far along so we're just going to have to adapt to that you know kind of post-speaker world in the crypto Community um the the other half of the world and the the one quarter and one jurisdiction that we can actually control and make an impact uh is going to be the U.S and given the US's outsized dominance and financial services and Technology the rest of the world will more likely than not follow some of the U.S regulatory model and the EU regulatory model then they will kind of bootstrap their own and if they do bootstrap their own is it going to be adopted by similar countries uh or is it more likely that them going their own way like El Salvador um is a good example like are they going to create risks for themselves with the IMF with the other kind of global power structures that just dwarf them in size um and I think that's that's a a pretty hairy question that some emerging economies are going to have to wrap their heads around is you know do we want to gravitate towards the US do we want to gravitate towards the EU do we want to gravitate towards you know China like who's meta rules or are we ultimately going to think about playing by when it comes to international finance and Tech and um and I think the it will be the exception not the rule that smaller countries will go their own way um what you'll instead be left with is you know some version of the U.S crypto rules or some version of the EU crypto rules or the Chinese crypto rules will ultimately be what are what are enacted by and large and that that people follow internationally so what we need to do is we need to make sure that the US is the laissez faire of those major three markets so that it can be I think a gravity well or or you know magnet for some of these other developing economies to adopt their models um and ensure that uh that we actually have the ability to build self-custody and Advance some of these um kind of new applications that we've been working on I also want to just grab one other point it also seems like there might be just a small window of opportunity in which to do this and get it done because once legislation is in place it's very difficult to kind of roll back and we're seeing mikas in place China already has its posture on crypto which has basically been previously to ban it unless they reverse course uh and now there's the US which is still Unwritten the future is still Unwritten here but you can't imagine it going five years from now and still like the US hasn't weighed in on this crypto thing right like they're going to have to do something within the next five years so that feels like there is a maybe shrinking window of opportunity to get something done and to do it well in the US would you agree with that I think it's a very short window of opportunity sentiment is temporary laws permanent it is very difficult to get old laws off the books it's difficult to pass legislation it's arguably even more difficult to repeal or alter existing laws um and you just think about how many years we've been talking about hey we need Common Sense Frameworks in the US for for crypto um the asset class is swollen to you know over a trillion dollars in size you have hundreds over 100 billion dollars of uh Euro dollars that are digitized and traded on chain and there's no federal legislation or really anything that's close to Federal legislation right now on crypto um that is that is going to come to a head at some point and it's either going to come to a head because the executive branch will seize control and basically do everything in its power to stamp out anything that isn't overtly regulated and doesn't fit within existing you know uh regulatory Norms which is the default if as legislation doesn't happen yeah um and then there's uh bad legislation that would potentially a lot of the industry so we we really need to thread the needle here in terms of getting good um kind of narrow legislation that can eke out iterative progress um a couple of months ago I had written a letter to a number of Senators in congressmen just kind of laying out you know fact versus fiction and also you know what what do we need to see um in terms of a public policy framework that will help Advance the the industry and and America's interest in in being a dominant player within the crypto market for years to come um and and for me and and I think most others it kind of breaks down into three sub pieces of legislation and one of the problems is everybody's trying to have this you know universal theory of everything for crypto and it's an Emerging Market that's just not going to happen right now If instead we broke it into three Pieces perhaps stable coins Market structure which would basically be how do you handle exchanges and custodians and then how do you handle the assets right so three different um pieces I think we could thread the needle and we could have really positive public policy Frameworks in the US that Foster Innovation that extend the dollars dominance because you continue to ensure that the US dollar and and US dollar denominated stable coins are the reserve currency for crypto um and you make sure that you Safeguard investors uh and avoid uh blow-ups again to FTX and and many of the other issues that we saw largely International right um and so I think the highest probability legislation that that could be passed in the next couple of years would probably be around how do you regulate stable coins and how do you regulate exchanges custodians and the like and by the way this is something that you know with the dccpa the stabbing up Bozeman Bill last year there was a lot of noise around this you had the famous debate between you know Eric and uh and Sam um that bill I don't think people appreciate like you're always like a few sentences between like a really shitty piece of legislation and like something that can actually be positive positive and workable and uh the issue with the dccpa last year was uh particularly with the the reaction from the crypto Community people are looking at a draft piece of legislation that was still getting uh the fine-tooth comb and people were arguing about the words um and and trying to make sure that they were technically accurate that the spirit of what the the legislators were trying to do was consistent with the actual letter of the law that was written and and and basically um changed the the several sentences that would make a good Market structure Bill a good stable coin you know uh kind of legislation um would make it work uh without crippling defy or pushing every single crypto asset through the SEC or or something similar and um and we didn't get there for numerous reasons not the least of which was you know the the events of November and nftx's collapsed I think through cold water on on uh any forward progress that we had there but I do think that there were four pieces of that legislation there were core pieces of a couple of other pieces of legislation have been sponsored by Tom emmer um and uh and and uh chair McHenry and Maxine Waters I think have good stablecoin legislation these things aren't that far away but some of the splits that we see um it takes time energy and attention to actually close those gaps and that's what I think is working against us right now is p you know generally speaking um I think the the Democrats are okay with the status quo because they feel like uh Gary Gensler and the financial Regulators are clamping down on the industry and making sure that it can no longer do any harm um but some of the more forward-thinking legislators are trying to say we would like to actually come to a compromise here we'd like to set some clear guidelines and we would also like to ensure that we're not just delegating public policy that's going to have a long-term economic impact to one man that's temporarily heading a regulatory agency and grabbing as much power as he possibly can um so you know to come full circle one of the reasons that I'm spending more time and I'm sure we'll talk more about this yeah maybe it's a segue but one of the reasons I'm spending more time kind of formally on on public policy is how do we call attention uh to some of this overreach in a constructive way and then how do we you know Advance our own narrative so it's not just the crypto Community you know uh whining about getting regulated after all of the sins of 2022. um that's just not going to play in DC it's not going to play in Europe it's not going to play anywhere I think everybody recognizes that a Redux of 2022 in a future Market cycle is um not a scenario that Global policy makers are are you know going to allow and they will deputize anyone that they believe is going to prevent it and right now that's Sheriff Gensler that's uh chair via grunberg from the FDIC to a certain extent through choke point um and a couple of the other Regulators so our only hope right now um to actually make some forward progress between now and 2024 election is a bipartisan stable coin or Market structure bill um that solves some of these jurisdictional issues or um some changes and you know in many cases generation change in DC in in the next 2024 election so um that's a long time to wait uh by crypto standards uh to feel like we're in a holding pattern so I used to take consolation in that uh the idea that it's not it's impossible to ban crypto you only ban your citizens from uh from accessing crypto and if America was going to just shoot itself in the foot and ban crypto then so be it uh but I now I now take the perspective that uh America Banning crypto is the fight uh because if America uh if America leads by example and does great legislation and great leadership and we as the crypto industry get to advocate for ourselves inside of Capitol Hill inside of Washington then the downstream net effects of that are are significant uh if we win this fight we win 10 15 20 other fights across the globe and so I think what you're saying Ryan is that it behooves a crypto industry to make the full court press here in now inside of Washington and I think what you're also saying is like not only is the Battleground the correct Battleground to fight America but also the time is now uh this is not something that we can choose to wait on uh the vultures are circling decisions are going to be made in the next two years around those three things that you outlined Market structure stable coins and uh the nature of assets and so what you're saying is like the hey this is the this is the moment for the crypto industry to make a full court press because like you said laws tend to go one way they they get approved and then they don't get pulled back uh and so my question to you is like well okay great I think we at least part of the crypto industry would accept this and that's why we have things like coin Center and blockchain Association and all the other crypto advocacy groups in in Capitol Hill so what are what are you proposing that's different what are you coming to the table with that is unique from all the other efforts that we've already had in this crypto industry great question so I think a lot of these other organizations are doing great work um and they will be the first ones to say where there are gaps in the market today um so taking a step back and then I'll drill down into what we're doing with uh digital Freedom Alliance this new 501c4 that that we just started um in order to win over the next 18 months Hold the Line Advance some positive narratives of the industry potentially Advance some positive legislation and continue to elect more Pro crypto than week of Congress what we're going to need is around 100 million dollars of total spent right for that campaign a hundred million yeah um and I think we're probably about a third of the way funded uh to that um because if you think about the annual well I mean if you think about the annual budgets of not the organization I'm talking about I'm talking about the the top down right the top-down approach right so if you think about the operating budgets for coin center for the crypto Council for Innovation for blockchain Association um if you think about the in-house policy spend and lobbying um that's that's you know going on in some of the corporates and you just kind of tally all that effort it's probably around yeah 30 to 40 million dollars and last year you know that's not that big a difference year over year if you take out FTX right so kind of the status quo is intact so this is just to drive that point home the crypto industry spends about 30 to 40 million dollars in advocacy in Capitol Hills what you're saying collectively I I would say lash you know post infrastructure bill I think yeah we we got up to that level so last year I'd say that's about the right number I think this year is probably similar um and um the way that that breaks down ideally that 100 million you have the status quo with the trade associations and the advocacy groups that are just doing like the shoe leather lobbying right they're they're meeting with members they're trying to educate members um about what is D5 what is self-cost how does the tech work why are these things important how does this already fit in some cases into the current you know public policy framework and Regulatory framework and um it really historically has been I'd say 90 plus percent education and advocacy right and I think that's really important because you're talking about a novel Tech and you're talking about you know why should you care about this why is it important for American competitiveness why is this good for consumers um and and basically you know painting the picture of okay what does the world look like in five ten years um if we can allow these Technologies to thrive but also Safeguard consumers and individuals and uh what does it look like if we just push everything offshore which is kind of the current Direction so that's basically like education advocacy and kind of tech 101 um and when you say education advocacy you're talking about education to political leaders to Regulators this is not like educate to lawmakers specifically exactly two lawmakers two two folks in in Washington DC another problem that has emerged um that is on socket bucket of what the trade associations or groups like Queen Center will do is litigation finance and this is essentially just like holding the line and challenging some of the ovaries that we've seen from the financial Regulators right you can probably put another 10 to 15 million dollars in that bucket but some of the cases like Ripple's own case are orders of magnitude more expensive than that but there's probably about you know half dozen to a dozen cases you know all of which are going to cost you know probably on average about a million dollars because they're smaller scale um just to actually hold the line and and check the overreach of some of these regulators and and you know basically call balls instructor or or try to avoid negative precedence just because people aren't paying attention right so a good example would be the walking case with with coinbase and all the uh briefs that you saw from uh friendly entities and and from some of the pro bono work that came in from different groups to uh actually challenge some of the claims that The Regulators were making in that case so that it didn't create poor precedent and push us further in the direction of okay this is Tech that should you know be treated as you know Securities issuance technology and everything should kind of fall in the sec's bucket right this is just like the trench warfare of Court battles the tornado cash versus uh ofac uh cases come to mind as well exactly so I'd say collectively this is probably like half the battle the other half is is camping Finance which I'll talk about in a minute but of that you call it 50 million there is I think one really important Gap in the market which is in messaging message testing paid advertisements you know just general um campaigning for crypto and changing our negatives from like nine to one in the mainstream Media or in DC maybe to three to one or two to one right so just getting more of the pro crypto voices out there um muting some of the most outrageous you know flood inducing claims that we we see on a day-to-day basis about how you know crypto is used for uh all these illicit activities or you know only people have only lost their shirts with this Tech um it's not really good for anything it hasn't really hit you know any you know mainstream scale um we need to counter some of those narratives and have actually uh poll like yeah polling data and and message testing that is going to help Advance our narrative with those right audiences and then just saturate them with it part of it is storytelling like research driven Pro crypto messaging that we've first researched and then broadcast to the right people exactly and it's it's you know talking points uh for kind of mainstream media surrogates it's actually just understanding like what language works with policy makers whether they're a one or a four whether they're Democrat or Republican and um and and making sure that we stick to some type of campaign message right you always hear political campaigns talk about staying on message uh an advocacy organization like digital Freedom Alliance which is this is all we're going to be doing is messaging coordination Grassroots engagement and helping tell the story of crypto and then saturate um DC with that story everything that we're doing right now has to be about staying on message as uh if you think about crypto as like the candidate right the crypto campaign needs to stay on message and we need to talk about American competitiveness we need to talk about tech Innovation and what that has done for our economy you know long term we need to talk about the threats to the dollar and to our International dominance of financial services if we push this technology offshore um and and you know kind of three to five kind of bulleted messages that are going to resonate on both sides of the aisle and we're actually going to be able to make a positive impact um and we also need to turn this into a campaign issue so out of the the messaging uh focused advocacy groups I'd say we're lacking that right now um in terms of like a single group that's going to coordinate you know shouting to the megaphone and and really kind of nailing messages that work um coin Center does a great job of this with a very narrow set of issues so privacy software developer rights the um the case for Bitcoin and and you know generally are following uh a pretty disciplined approach towards protecting constitutional rights of of crypto users in the U.S I think about coin Center almost like the Night's Watch right to use the Game of Thrones comparison right they're at the wall defending some of the big constitutional issues where any encroachment of over that line is breaking some law or some norm and they're the first line of defense in terms of calling that out and actually actively fighting that in in the courts we don't really have an organization right now that's focused on like the fight for King's Landing which is really like the muck of of DC and and the the political campaigning that I think is required um to make anti-crypto policy politically damaging for our biggest opponents or their allies and to make pro-crypto advocacy something that is going to be rewarded at The Ballot Box right so there's on one side of the wall a messaging campaign that goes around that um and then on the other side we're talking about actual hard money that's going to go into electing pro-crypto politicians so out of that 100 Million Dollar General campaign that um that we're talking about about 50 million is going to messaging advocacy lobbying litigation Finance where you're just you're you're fighting and you're making the case for crypto with the existing incumbents the other half has to do with a electoral politics right so how do we advance more pro-crypto candidates through primaries how do we elect more pro-crypto Dems more pro-crypto Republicans in both chambers of Congress and then ultimately how do you um make the crypto voting block very loud so that it will be perceived as politically damaging to be on the wrong side of this issue uh if you're uh if you're Elizabeth Warren or one or for both allies that's where I think Super Pacs and and Pac funding comes in which is the direct contributions that are being made to campaigns or the indirect contributions that are going to um different groups that are generally aligned for or against a political candidate in a race and that ultimately you know kind of is responsible for the TV ads the print ads and and you know every dollar that's going into fighting in the trenches and some of these swing States or some of these you know key key districts or key races um that uh that you know are going to be within you know Five Points uh come come November 2024. learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the

super tapped into the world of politics and and lobbying and fighting on Capitol Hill but I feel like everything that you said is more or less like a known science to the outside of the crypto industry I think maybe inside the crypto industry we're like like uh it doesn't matter if a global movement will get there eventually don't worry about the the milieu of of Capitol Hill fights um but we've already passed that part in the conversation where we've established that now is the time in Washington DC is the place um but this this is like a known science right we're not inventing anything new here this is what other Industries do uh I think perhaps what you're suggesting is like oh we're doing a great job and more narrow uh efforts to to fight the fight for crypto but I think you're just saying hey let's uh let's zoom out let's get bigger and let's be more strategic with how we advocate for our industry and copy the the strategies that other Industries have employed for the for decades is that is that a fair um summary one thing about sandbankment freed is his political under his understanding of the political system and and the political game was unparalleled within the crypto industry hmm what he did last year was very Savvy from a political standpoint we basically need to do something but here's the thing the Silver Lining as we know that but we need to be better as an industry and you need to run a very similar Playbook but with a decentralized based of contributors and a set of honest actors that have been in the trenches for years building or the sole reason that we actually believe in this Tech and it's potential to be a force forget who Could That Be who Could That Be Ryan okay so SBF totally got it right well we got we got we got three of them on the call so well okay well I I don't know that's that's ambitious for me I I but like okay SPF was playing the right game and he was maybe one of the first people in crypto to actually start playing that game and by the way people who didn't understand this game like zoom out and they look at oh my God how fast how far he got so fast right it's like amazing what you can do if you play the game and you play it well and and you're saying that we need better honest good actors rather than sending our worst to DC SPF a literal fraudster we need to send the right people to DC we need to have good leadership here also we need to keep it decentralized and accountable as well but that is the exact the game that he played we need to play a similar game that's what you're saying I think so I mean he had he had all of the wrongs to that campaign but we can't do it the same way that that he went about it obviously right I mean I think the crypto brand is uh pretty tarnished from a lot of folks that are not True Believers of the tech within DC you know he gave money to so many people and he put so many people um in a bad place politically or he made them look silly or you know he the the one rule I think uh we should learn as an industry is don't embarrass your friends um in DC and he he just was a nuclear bomb that went off uh in DC based on the amount of time that he's spending there with members with staff compares to everybody well he he but we think about it as like he embarrassed us which is true but he also embarrassed a lot of folks in DC and I think LED folks that we were making progress with to clam up um and and so part of part of the job that we need to do as an ecosystem and again going back to the messaging is we need to advance some of the true narratives of crypto not the woke chivalrous or whatever he called them you know when he thought he was off the Record basically him just blowing smoke um to to key members and in both parties when he was meeting with them um but we need to actually narrow in on like what are the true bipartisan messages that we just need to focus on and like show the impact of and just browbeat the DC establishment into understanding over the course of the next 18 months um and I think the The Narrative development there is very often understated because we have a decentralized community so okay who is going to elect like one spoken representative for this entire like decentralized Community um you know why why would we play the DC game when we can just opt out and build in all these different Pockets let Ripple fight their case let coinbase fight their cases let whoever kind of you know kind of you know fights their individual battles and we'll just engage in trench warfare from all these different points of the industry the the reality is that we have some overarching messages as a community that whether you're a stablecoin issue or whether you're a Bitcoin maximalist whether you're Die Hard ethereum fan like these kind of core um truths I think are things that we can rally around and that we can win a lot of Swing voters in DC over right so the proliferation of stable coins being number one the kind of individual economic empowerments um of you know previously disenfranchised or you know underbanked or creative classes like those are pretty powerful narratives because you're talking about positively impacting the livelihoods of uh you know different different individuals um in in different uh up and coming parts of the economy and you're talking about American competitors uh competitiveness long term um and then the last is just the rule of law right so I think we lost some of the moral High Ground when it comes to use cases and the case for crypto and like this is going to change the world last year just because that's what happens when you go from a bull to a bear cycle the one thing that we really have right now is the Constitution the rule of law on our side and some of the overreach that we've seen from the regulatory state is so egregious that we just need to be able to wrap those stories uh in a tight narrative and actually uh saturate DC with some of these stories and help people understand even what the issue is that we're fighting against because a lot of I think a lot of members and a lot of their staffs just don't understand what's going on with debanking what's going on with um the sec's you know kind of double speak when it comes to regulation and the fact that it essentially amounts to a shadow ban in the industry so if we can focus on kind of the three Pro crypto you know kind of positive messages and then the three combating kind of opposition narrative uh you know kind of counter messages that's I think all we can do to hold the line for the next 18 months and then give the folks that are at the trade associations that are actually actively lobbying in DC and that um are going to be running campaigns give them the air cover to operate and you know kind of help move the incumbents and some of the newcomers to Congress in the right direction this this marketing piece I think is going to be important not just from like a single entity but um hopefully some of the research that we put out is going to help folks like you is going to help folks when they're meeting with members this can help folks when they're on mainstream media Outlets uh triangulate on the things that they know have a 30-point net favorable uh rating when it comes to talking points right so maybe we don't want to say hey anyone in the world should be able to use crypto regardless of whether though that they're they're on the sanctions list like that's not a smart narrative right sure I love some of the Libertarians in the industry not a smart narrative but if you want to talk about the dollars dominance um and the benefits of a US dollar denominated stablecoin versus the you know Chinese digital Yuan from a competitive competitiveness standpoint or from a us cbdc um from a surveillance standpoint you know that's a pretty good narrative to Rally around and say you know they're pretty Common Sense Solutions here we're this close you know tell your members that you would like to see stablecoin legislation tell your members you'd like to see more construction structure you know regulation so that we can feel safe and secure when we're using coinbase or Kraken or gemini or another U.S regulated entity if we get it right this could be very powerful this is the reason you know DC listened to SBF and not someone uh like Eric Voorhees even though we wish he would listen to and Eric Voorhees sometimes you have to kind of massage the message here and so I want to make sure that the people hear the punch line because this is so important so you and the digital Freedom Alliance the DFA this is a new organization that you're helping to form are raising between 100 million dollars or above to 125 million dollars I believe that's kind of the range that feels like a lot of money maybe but I don't know how it compares to other organizations doing this you're raising that in order to put this structure in place and do things that the coin centers and the blockchain associations aren't doing they're they're kind of Manning the wall they're the Night's Watch but there's all sorts of political activity that we need to have that we need to coordinate around if we actually want to win during this very narrow window of opportunity so what do you what do you call this thing Ryan is this like a is this like a pack is this like a Super PAC uh and by the way are we trying to influence lawmakers here are we are we doing kind of the pack game of like you know we're running commercials to uh voters and we're talking about like the virtues of crypto and and we have kind of talking points around that like so uh anyway I want to make sure you kind of nail the point of what you're actually doing because this is beyond talk this is not you just standing up here getting on the bankless podcast and saying hey guys we need to do more stuff you're actually organizing it you got that you got the outlet so what are you going to do with 100 million dollars I'm not going to do anything with 100 million dollars so the digital Freedom Alliance is going to raise probably about five to ten of that right and and our ability to um actually execute against the roadmap that we have on the messaging side we can do a lot with 5 million or so uh and then it scales up from there and basically the the variance is how much uh messaging and how many you know kind of paid campaigns are we able to run um and how many different kind of areas are we able to move swing voters in DC and and kind of move sentiment and kind of mainstream media Outlets um it's it's just it's a marketing machine right dollars in equals you know some outcome on the other side of that from a brand and a favorable standpoint the 100 to 125 million I think is what it costs to run like this multi multi-faceted campaign so DFA I think is on one side of the wall one of the missing ingredients uh maybe the missing ingredient from an education advocacy standpoint coin Center and DFA are kind of like yin and yang I'd say coin Center is very focused on the Constitutional issues whereas we want to focus on the messaging issues that are actually going to change public sentiments and DC sentiments all the other trade associations are responsible for lobbying and thinking about what are legislative what are let us legislative solutions that are going to work that are going to get some bipartisan support and then potentially get enacted into law they're also the ones that are engaging directly with with Regulators through rule making and helping them understand how crypto can fit into existing you know regulatory structures in the meantime before we have clear legislative guidance the other 50 of that so the other 50 plus you know 75 million that's where the pack and the Super PAC funding come in and that's the Electoral Finance side of this equation um what I have said is I want to spend time on this only because I've already spent time on this the last two years basically ever since the infrastructure bill as you know I've been more outspoken I've spent more time with these policy groups and so I know the executives and their policy teams uh pretty well what I'm trying to wake other Executives and investors up to in the industry is the need to make this investment and to basically like two to three x the investment that we currently have which is the first comment that we made about 30 to 40 million and where we need to be which is closer to 125 million a good chunk of that is going to come on the political giving side actually supporting financially the Pro crypto members of Congress that have been very good on the issues they've dug deep we want them to be holding pen on new legislation because they just understand it technically and we have faith that they're going to get the balance right engaging in primaries is going to be the work of some of the super Pacs and some of the other electoral politics focused organizations that we have and um the goal there is to basically look at if it's a swing District who's going to be the better candidate in the general election if it's a 40-point democratic District who's going to be the best Democrat that we can get through that primary if it's a 40-point republican District same thing who's the best Republican we can get through that primary on these issues and that's just a ground game that I think is not something that can be developed in-house of any of the crypto companies but we do have some good political operatives that are running those pack and Super PAC operations that can help us um both recruit and then elect uh great like Pro crypto voices as as generation change in Congress takes hold just to give you an example last cycle we elected out of the open primaries that one of the industries primary super Pacs was focused on um we went basically 17 for 18 in terms of pro-crypto candidates you know there's 430 some members of Congress so to actually move the needle you're going to need to do that every two years for the next decade and then you you ultimately win over time just by having a more educated um digital native base of members that is going to handle I think a good chunk of our long-term uh challenges but in the meantime we have to make sure that we get some pretty important districts um and some pretty important Senate seats swinging in the right direction because if we have blockers at important committee chairs um or important you know kind of senior members of either the senate or congress that are going to slow down any legislative proposals that come across their desk just because they are so far in the one category that they're you know they're not salvageable um for for our intents um then we need to you know figure out if if there are candidates that are better suited for um for us as an industry you know how do we how do we help support them um and by and large I think the strategy to date has been support incumbents work with incumbents in their staffs educate incumbents in their staffs educate The Regulators and and you know tell the right story and the areas that we've Fallen flat are in actually financially supporting them and then arming them with data and research that can that can kind of help them make the case uh as they're going out and they're and they're stopping for for this is one of the key key problems with their campaigns um last thing I'll say on this point is um the reason that this 100 million dollar number is so important again it's not to put you know kind of money in our organization I think we're probably five to ten of that on the 50 education advocacy societal along with all the other existing groups that we have but I think a problem that uh many Executives and investors in the industry make is they don't want to play an electoral politics for whatever reason right they either think that it's not a good use of time good use of money they don't want to feel like they're getting you know it just it feels untoward uh to to a good chunk of the community especially the libertarian strain that got into crypto particularly to opt out of politics and I understand that but if we don't get over that then what you have is a situation where all of those groups whether it's digital Freedom Alliance it's coin center it's um it's a blockchain Association at CCI they're going into a meeting and they're having a really good session with members and their staffs and those members and staff come out all rah-rah and then they look at their watch and say well I have to go meet with the the bankers Association because I have a fundraising lunch yep and so you know you're basically throwing an alley-oop but then there's there's there's there's no follow-through guys I mean this is what we've done in crypto I mean this is what they say in DC it's true if you're not at the table you're on the menu and crypto kind of sat back and we basically let somebody who is more ambitious represent our industry in DC and that person's name is SBF and look what he did and so if we don't fill that vacuum with something like it's not unfortunately I wish this was the case it's not an option to just pull out of the game and not play you have you have to play the game you're forced to play this game so if we we're in a position where we're forced to play the game let's do it well we can maintain our ethics we can maintain our values we got to play this game well so okay now and also if you do it right you don't have to do it in the future yes yes and it's much more expensive to do the cleanup work as we're seeing his post SPF one one thing just to make this like super tangible because I know 100 million is a big number it sounds like it's kind of out of left field but there is some science behind it but if we want to just do like back a napkin um what is the return on that investment if you will right I think about this as an insurance policy right because if you're not at the table you're on the menu and Regulatory risk is probably the greatest risk that we have as an industry right now in the US right um it's going to be hard to Envision another kind of Boom cycle in the US where crypto is thriving here under the current construct that we have in the current situation that we're in with the SEC um and it's jurisdictional issues the FDIC and kind of banking right Regulators it's hard to see a catalyst there so I go back to the very first thing that I said which is this is important because I think a pro crypto us is a 2X in market cap right that's the quick and dirty right like I think everything thrives the infrastructure the use cases the consumer adoption and then yes the price of some of these assets but if you think that there's a 10 chance that that hundred million dollars will move the needle for a pro crypto US versus a more hostile us after 2024. that's the only thousand X there is in the market right it's the only thousand extra Arizona Market 10 expected value of a trillion dollars a hundred billion dollars 100 billion is a thousand times more than 100 million right it's you're saying it's good for our bags if we are interested in financial upside we would fight this fight if we are primarily interested in number go up this is a high value opportunity here here is the issue that I think we're confronting this year I think it's good for everybody this year and I think last year it was good for Sam yeah that was what so many of us were kind of fighting behind the scenes in these smoke-filled rooms or whatever other you know people levied at me um people don't smoke in those rooms anymore yeah for for trying to you know according some of these conversations what we were trying to do is we were trying to slow down Sam uh who is running kind of unilaterally and and and trying to just advocate for his his own um efforts and we are trying to make sure that there was a good group of folks that were actually engaged with the policy makers that were writing some of these bills and that were at the table and felt like you know all of these diverse interests in the industry were well represented um that ultimately you know maybe it was moving the right direction maybe not but it fell apart because FTX fell apart and so now we're kind of back to square one where can we get the honest brokers in the industry the people that have been here for years the people that didn't just pump and dump on their followers the folks that actually believe that triple entry accounting to be as boring as that is right like but triple entry accounting is such a profound technical innovation in an era of declining institutional trust that this is worth protecting at all costs right and and and I think that has to be um at least a quarter if not half of the focus for any serious executive or investor in the industry right now because the the cost of getting it wrong long term is so damaging and and just stunts our potential um to such an extraordinary degree that um we just can't afford to risk it so um I think uh I've been enthused by my conversations with other founders with with other investors but it's a tough market right it's tough to make this pitch in a declining Market um and it's tough to feel like we're trying to like squeeze blood from a stone but I think the stakes are high the time is now and if we can get through the other side of this bear market and we can have these hard conversations now and move the needle and be the like the very best that we are from a narrative um and from an Ethics perspective uh then I think we can get through the other side of this and and you'll see a much stronger vibernica system emerge on the other side both in the U.S and then internationally as other uh markets draft off of us really quick Ryan just to throw some quick questions at you what are the just like the near-term next steps like what's happening in the next week month two months to get the DFA up and running the digital Freedom Alliance and also through a throw a question at the end for this how much harder is this now that SBF was playing this Playbook a year or two ahead of us and then blew that strategy up and now we have to like do that same strategy but now there's like the the shadow of SBF and Capitol Hill like how much harder is this now as a result of that so I'll throw those two questions at you well I mean I I think step one is you know the same strategy but the complete opposite right so you know we're not trying to do this you know behind the scenes you know I'm putting bullseye on my forehead and and you know coming and and talking to you guys and and being pre-vocal about what we're working on so um it's it's hidden in plain sight but I I think the reason that we should be a little bit more transparent is that's what the industry is based on and that's ultimately the only way that we're going to get to the other side of of this FTX drama remember that court case is coming up so we're gonna have a whole other cycle where like that is going to be top of mind for folks and if we don't have a very strong uh counter narrative that includes just a massive uh slug of entrepreneurs that are you know ready to be like you know articulate uh really powerful surrogates for the industry that can tell some of these positive stories that can tell you know uh policy makers the way that they are approaching the industry is in good faith and in the right way and in keeping with some of our existing laws in Norm um then you know we're going to be able to I think get some of the results that we want but um the uh from a DFA standpoint you know we've got some world-class uh you know colleagues that I'm working with on on us on this campaign the messaging strategy the go to market the research both polling foia requests Freedom of Information requests you know opposition research and then the storytelling kind of uh Masters that are going to help you know package us in a digest that's that's going to be accessible for people that might not otherwise have time given all their competing priorities in in DC um to fully digest you know what's going on with layer twos and you know what's what's the new hot nft project like none of that really matters we have to abstract all that away and and kind of just be a focus on some of these um some of these core issues that's great I mean uh no question we need to do this work so to to summarize all this Ryan your message today is uh crypto needs to get going on this right now this is the the time is really now we're spending maybe 30 million year collectively on the crypto policy machine and we need to 3 to 4X that investment across the industry so we need to get to between 100 and 125 million you are starting this digital Freedom Alliance which is going to be a 501c4 advocacy group and what that's going to do is it's going to occupy this niche of helping to fight the fud helping to tell a story that propagates across both policy makers and mainstream and maybe that costs something like five million dollars of that 100 to 125 million dollars but that will allow us to scale and amplify the rest of the investment that we put on this space and maybe that takes the form in the future of other packs us getting more active in campaigns but we really need sort of a narrative machine in order to propagate the right messages and and honestly to coordinate on them if we don't do this by the way the next SPF comes in and makes like pumps pumps their own bags and instead of pumping the values that we want expressed across crypto so uh that is what you're here to tell us and that is the work that you're going to do in this space a particularly setting up the digital Freedom Alliance and then also uh making the call for uh us to to Triple our investment in this crypto policy space and and being a leader in the space as well not the not the only leader but a group of leaders that can push this forward did I get that right I think you nailed it I'd say you know I uh didn't abscond with customer funds so I don't have as much personal Capital to deploy at this as other folks in previous Cycles so it has to be decentralized right and and I think um if we can pass that around what I would say is an action item from from this of the episode is um you go to join dfa.org um if you want to learn more about what we're working on and then you want to find ways to get involved the first bit of fundraising that I'm doing is for that first five million will ultimately open up for public contributions in the next couple of months but if you want to subscribe for updates we've got a sub stack um they can subscribe to on the join dfa.org websites and if you're an executive in the industry and uh you or your company would like to contribute to this 100 million dollar campaign and you're just Flying Blind and you don't even know where to start what I've volunteered is that if you're ready to spend serious time and and money I will pick up the phone and try to help Orient you towards which groups need this Capital the most right so I think we need to continue funding CCI blockchain Association coin Center I can make the case for like why the digital Freedom Alliance is a really important prong of that side of the equation and then I think we also need to make sure that those that have done really well in the last couple of Cycles are funding um the pack and Super PAC efforts so that we actually make long-term and medium-term change uh in Congress that uh that is going to set us up for a long from success and not just this Perpetual firefighting we've been doing last year or so that's great Ryan we'll we'll end it there and we'll leave a link in the show notes it's been awesome to have you on thank you so much thank you for uh doing this too apparently we need it thank you guys I just want to say one last thing as we close guys we'll include a link in the show notes to join dfa.org and let me just say uh Ryan has been in this space for 10 years all right and there's a certain Lindy effect that we talk about often about protocols I think Lindy effect also applies to individuals as well people who've been through multiple Cycles without stealing anyone's funds without screwing people over like by being honest actors and I think we are um we we have swung a little bit too far on the pendulum of not trusting anybody right now in 2023 the crypto industry okay and that's understandable look what we went through in 2022 a bunch of scam artists screwing the space over no wonder we have trust issues collectively but let me say let's not air too far on the other side and and and come to the conclusion that there are no leaders and we can't trust anyone in this space there have been people that have um developed a reputation been through multiple cycles and are trying to do the right thing and I think Ryan sulcus is one of those people I'm really excited to uh just to to support join DFA and uh for the work that we're doing it's sorely needed if we don't fill the Gap year somebody else will and I'd like to see Ryan and some of the other leaders Brian Armstrong is one of them uh you know I know the folks at Kraken lots of good folks that are still here pushing this work for it so don't get disinvolved in politics okay we got to involve ourselves if if we're going to take this fight to DC and uh you know propagate the values that that we talk so much about that was my my sermon rather than disclaimers you got that but let me end with disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice it's not really political advice for just figuring this stuff out as we go guys but eth is risky so is D5 you could definitely lose what you put in we are headed west though this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] foreign [Music]
