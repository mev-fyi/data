welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended this darkwear sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless's darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this episode I'm talking to yoab Weiss who is a security Reacher at the ethereum foundation and has been leading the charge behind erc4337 which hopes to eventually turn into an EIP which will become a part of core ethereum what does erc43 g72 it enables account abstraction on the ethereum layer 1. starknet and other ZK Roll-Ups are going to be able to beat ethereum layer 1 to the punch when it comes to enabling account abstraction smart contract wallets which is good because then they can come back and teach the ethereum layer 1 about what needs to be built and how erc4337 needs to be constructed in order to have the best smart contract wallet experience possible so this is the second of two account instruction smart contract wallet related interviews the first being Modi from braavos so I hope that these two interviews can really take you from 0 to 60 about the world of smart contract wallets and how they will eventually come to dominate all of crypto starting with starknet and ZK rollups moving on to other layer twos and then eventually to the ethereum mainnet I hope you enjoyed this interview with yoav but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible cracking has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps dads can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 fees by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite DPI apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every layer too and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like Arboretum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview ignization once again we are back in Tel Aviv Israel and I'm talking to you have Weiss who taught me almost everything that I know about account instruction you have how's it going man going great thank you what brings you to uh software sessions all the way out here in Tel Aviv I actually live here oh okay so it's down the street view uh yeah so yeah like literally 20 minutes from here no no oh that's super convenient I am very jealous uh it took me 12 hours to get here um so uh what's going on as it relates to uh just starkware Stark net and what brings you here specifically like what is going on here in this conference that really interests you so I've been focused on account obstruction as you know and uh stop in a stalking it is and stocknet has this embedded in the embedded Intel chain so it's great and it's been great collaborating with them it's um so I'm here so I'm here to talk to uh to talk to people about it to help people to help people understand it to learn about it from people to talk to wallets many wallets here that are worth talking to and so this is as far as I can tell really the Stark net is really where the account extraction is actually coming into a fruition it is kind of a conversation of eips on the ethereum layer one but on Stark net it's actually being developed as teams and we have the Argent team we have the braavos team so what's it like watching a lot of this account abstraction Theory turn into practice here on starknet so um so I've been also involved in that I'm not watching it from the sidelines and uh and stock Net stock net account obstruction is actually based on the same ideas as a as erc4337 it uses the same protection the same protection the same way to the central and it is to the centralized things so uh it just it's just easier when it comes to a when you when we are uh when building a new network it's easier to build it into the network so you know we started the year we started EOS at the ELC in the form of an ELC and not an EAP because it's easier to standardize it across different networks and then stock Net stock net has been the first Network to actually put it into the to put it into the consensus but I expected the same will happen in other layer tools and over time we'll even get into ethereum but this will take time you know is there so what is the frontier of account of traction the frontier smart contract was what have you learned or what are you experiencing perhaps as a result of this conference specifically but overall on starknet like what's the new what's the new thing in the world of account abstraction so we see a different use cases the these use cases have been discussed before but now they become more they become more feasible and when it's done at the network level more more efficiently it's uh it just it really opens up the design space the design space has been there all along but now uh but now that it can be done more cheaply and efficiently with we are starting to see it really happen and uh can you just walk me again and the bankless listeners about the synergies between specifically a ZK roll-up and account instruction why why is ZK roll up such an awesome fertile ground for account abstraction I'm not sure it has to do with the fact that it's a zika roll-up uh it could be done on it could be done on another roll-up but uh the evm the evm roll ups try to stay a evm equivalent initially so it's harder to make changes in dvf on the standard and uh in the case of uh and in the case of a stalker since it's not evm to begin with it's easier to experiment you don't have to you don't have to obey any any passwords okay so yeah I want to unpack that a little bit because I think that's a good way to to learn something cool about the the world of ethereum and all the also as layer twos uh both arbitrum and optimism attempt to be evm equivalent and now if you want to be evm equivalent you have to follow like what is the evm on the ethereum layer one and the ethereum layer one is not account abstraction enabled because that's something that we're working on and so perhaps why account abstraction and smart Contra attract wallets like braavos and Argent have have built like some actually like planted their feet in the world of Stark net is that Stark net never intended to be evm equivalent they always forked off and made Cairo or just like we're evm uh perhaps not even compatible to say oh there was just a different AVM chain and that's why they've been able to kind of LeapFrog in the world of ZK of a construction is all that right yeah it's certainly made it certainly made it easier for them but I think that we'll see other layer tools the evm equivalent layer tools uh we see them as a as a further ground for a for Innovation to expect that in the future many eaps many APS will be will be experimented with I mean EAP is not in not as in elc's but actually protocol changes I think we'll see more and more experimentation on other evm networks and uh it's um it's quite likely that we'll see that we'll see optimistic roll ups also spinning up a separate roll-up to experiment with the US protocol account obstruction how are the the people that are working on Smart contract walls and account abstraction how are they leveraging you and your expertise here at the startware sessions how are you helping with them and like what are the conversations like yeah so Matt so I've been talking to them about about use cases since I've been thinking about uh about the count of suction for a few years now and I'm uh and I'm talking about how they could use the how they could use elc4337 there are some there are some limitations during validation which are absolutely required in order to be able to decentralize it so uh so sometimes it's not reveal to walk around these limitations but that's a but uh so far we haven't encountered any use case that couldn't be solved with some creativity so when I'm talking to a to all the developers I often I find myself helping to design around these constraints without sacrificing censorship resistance do you think that um because star Square seems to be uh or Stark net seems to be kind of a head in the world of account abstraction that a lot of this learnings here is going to be exported out to the rest of ethereum is that kind of how you think it might go yes I think uh I think the wallets that are being developed that are being developed for stocknet right now I'll go into a I'm going to show up on other networks as we make it as we make it more possible and that's part of the reason why it's so important to standardize it so that we have future parity because all the developers usually they don't have the resources to develop to develop many different wallets so we should try to standardize it at the chain level so that all the developers can can deploy their wallets everywhere and so yeah there are multiple wallets I've named a couple of Bravos and Argent that are using smart contract Wallets on starknet and I'm assuming because there's already a growing ecosystem on stocknet we'll actually be able to learn from their learnings and they're going to figure out what the best form factor for our abstraction is on stocknet and because just the pace of iteration on Stockton so fast that's actually how we're going to learn how to apply this to the rest of ethereum is that a fair take yes I think I think experimenting through a actual products and actually users is the best way we shouldn't do it in a vacuum so having having urgent and Bravos and others doing this is a absolutely essential essential for making it happen they're also adding use cases that they that I I've been advocating for for a long time and are really difficult to do without a protocol level changes for example a braavos is doing uh they let you sign with the from the secure Enclave of your phone which is something that we already saw in implementation back in back in Bogota one of the hackathon projects implemented this in solidity and deployed it and deploy it on an evm chain but it's really expensive to do if you don't have support for it from the network so I think that we're going to see more of these use cases and people will optimize them and we'll see them you are moving to a to other chains so I've noticed I was at the um The Hacker House my first day here and a lot of a computer people like I was watching developers uh you know Tinker around on their computers and instead of the metamask icon they have the Argent icon and they're in their top right as their extension and so do you think that actually being able to innovate at these smart contracts while a level is that going to be the thing that actually is pretty disruptive to the metamask dominance across the rest of ethereum yes I think I think the move to account obstruction is a it's an opportunity for disruption in the wallet space that could could definitely benefit from some disruption some more some more a variety of projects but I think that we'll also see metamask doing a lot of interesting things in this space is metamask going to be doing account abstraction well you should ask them you know they are here but uh but I believe that I believe that we'll see some innovation in that space for metamask as well okay well the competition is on uh you'll have what else is my competition it's not oh it's always competition's always good for the user right like we all all of these people want to have like as much mind share as possible do you think like wallets might stratify into like different use cases as in like maybe this isn't exactly right but braavos is the gaming uh smart contract ball and Arjun is the D5 smart contract wallet or does that not really make sense yeah it does make sense because uh with with account obstruction you can make the wallet as simple as you like or as complex as you like depending on the for example if you have a complex authorization needs or you need to you need to enforce certain policies then you might want a more complex wallet but as a new user you just want the simplest possible wallet where you add your phone you don't know what a private key is and you can move it and uh and you can just start using it but what's more important is that with account obstruction you'll be able to set the implementation you'll be able to to upgrade so as a new user who doesn't know anything about crypto you probably want to start with the easiest one to use but maybe as you accumulate more value in the account and now you have assets you need to protect them and you have better understanding now maybe you're going to upgrade it and you're going to upgrade in place you're not going to move your assets elsewhere you're just going to switch from a very simple wallet to one that gives you more optionality I really like the idea of a wallet a smart contract wallet can be as simple or as complex as anyone who really wants it to be but we're starting of course at the very beginning of this story because we're still so early in the world of account abstraction what are the first use cases that you think are really going to be onboarded into into these smart contract wallets so we already see things like like social recovery that the Urgent has been doing for a long time and a social recovery is often a misunderstood it doesn't necessarily mean that your friends are going to recover it for you it's uh it could be a it could be a ledger device in a bank vault that you're only going to use if you lost access and we're going to see some we're going to see some use case such as for example session Keys is something that I really like that since you can have authorization not just authentication meaning that you can add each key can be authorized to do certain things it makes sense that for example you have an nft in your you have an nft that you want to use in a game but you don't want the game you don't want the game adapt to be able to transfer it so you could have a key that only that a key that the browser keeps so you don't need to manually sign each transaction but you only but so but the key can only interact with the game and if you actually want to transfer your nfts that's a separate key and it requires manual signing so we're going to see such a such use case as well and but really the possibilities are endless I mean I can I can talk for hours about different use cases here yeah I'm sure I'm getting like this image of a smart contract wallet that really starts off as like a blank slate but you can plug more and more stuff into it is there is it logical to think of there being like a plug-in store for your smart contract wallet is that like a coherent thought yes that's something that that's we've been talking about we didn't want to push it into the same ELC but I think we will need an ELC for it to standardize the way plugins the way plugins work and then you'll be able to get the plugins the way I see the plugin should be associated with a certain authentication with certain key so this and and then the session keys are actually just a sub use case of this it's just one plugin and then you can have a plugin that allows for example performing trades if you want to implement a more efficient decks with an older book you could you could let it you could authorize you to perform a trades without you actually signing it but so and there can be there can be many such use cases and each of these I believe should be a plugin these plugins will not necessarily be written by the same person who wrote the account you know the world their wallet for example it's for example uni swap could write a plugin that helps you do things on uniswap and you could add it to any of the wallets that support the startup but this is a this requires this requires some thinking for example these wallets will all need to use a diamond storage it's an AP that uh that helps you uh helps you make sure that different contracts running in the same in the same address space don't step on each other's toes so I think that and I've been advocating it to all it telling them that they should be they should be using diamond storage from the start so that later they can use such plugins well our real wallets always be in this like browser extension form factor or do you think other like will access our wall in a different way because like to me the browser extension wall is kind of annoying is that's going to be the future or there's going to be something else in the way that we engage our smart contract wallets do you have any thoughts on this uh I think he doesn't he doesn't have to be a browser extension and I like I like having mobile apps they do a do this kind of this kind of work and I think it should be and it can be done for the browser it can be done even from a from an app running on the OPC or your Mac but uh I think but I think it's important it's important not to not to lock yourself into a mobile app for example because since I really I really hate a censorship and I think that the both the Apple both Apple and Google have a permission system where if you want to where they could eliminate it they could eliminate the wallet from their app store if they want to so I think you should have a way to recover from it and to switch to a new implementation so at the very least you should be able to do this from your browser amazing you have I know you're always like head into the world of accountants traction but what in addition to account of attraction have you been paying attention to lately sorry what in addition to account abstraction have you been paying attention to lately yeah so I'm uh so I'm a security sale chair and I've been um I've been working on other uh or other security projects and also uh and I also care a lot about a censorship resistance in ethereum in general so I'm uh so I'm thinking a lot about a PBS about about proposal business operation and about a inclusion list and the only thing is going to come to come together at some point because with account obstruction we'll also need to have inclusion list and it's much more complicated to do a in this context we won't get into all the complexities right now but it's uh so there are some there's some interplay between uh between these topics yo if uh listeners have gotten their interests peaked about the conversation that we've just had and they want to learn more where do you recommend for them to go any any resources that they might uh should be pointed to so uh we are well building a website for elc437 but it's not up yet and they can also follow me on Twitter I occasionally tweet about Twitter about some ideas we have some telegram groups where uh we have some telegram groups where there are very active discussions about account obstruction yo thank you so much I appreciate it cheers damn [Music]
