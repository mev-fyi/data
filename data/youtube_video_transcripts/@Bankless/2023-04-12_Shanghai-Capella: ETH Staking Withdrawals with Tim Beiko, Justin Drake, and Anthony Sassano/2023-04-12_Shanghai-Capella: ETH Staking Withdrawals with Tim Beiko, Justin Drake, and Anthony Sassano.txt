you know you don't have to pay any fees when your Solo's taking so already that puts you Above the Rest from a from a rational standpoint but the the other thing I want to highlight is that my prediction is that there is going to be special airdrops specifically for solo validators special day today we are hard forking teeth staking withdrawals is enabled David what is going on who do we have on yeah the Shanghai now called chappella upgrade come into ethereum coming to a blockchain near you the long-awaited withdrawals hard Fork that allows stakers to withdraw ether uh we uh hard forked into proof of stake a while ago created the beacon chain did the merge but in an abundance of caution we left out this one ability called withdrawals just to not over complicate things it's really the only reason why we didn't include withdrawals in this original merge was to not to make the merges Least Complicated as possible so fast forward to where we are now we are now enabling withdraws and so this has caused a bunch of conversations around the cryptosphere uh is this bearish is the eighth price going to dump uh is it actually this bullish and more people are going to stake as a result of this what happens to Lido what happens to Rocket people what happens to the insane supply of ether that is in coinbase there is a lot of second order consequences as a result of this merge there are 18 million ether that is locked up in the beacon chain and that becomes to be unlocked later today I believe at 9 00 PM no 6 p.m eastern time uh 6 30 p.m uh and so this uh uh episodes going live a few hours earlier than that and this is just a conversation with three guests from around the ethereum ecosystem we've got Anthony cezanno ethereum Community member and content producer also solar Staker and solo Staker tinkerer he gives his perspectives as what his role is in the ethereum ecosystem as a result of being a solo sticker and what he's doing in the four different boxes that he runs to solo stick so he's got Anthony we got Anthony we also got Justin Drake and we all know Justin Drake uh EF researcher and ether economic thought leader and then we also got Tim Baco as well who leads the all core devs calls so three diverse perspectives to all give their takes about uh this Shanghai shapella upgrade yeah and uh if we're talking about upgrades we're also talking about staking we're talking about staking reward and you know what that means David uh tell me it means we're talking about taxes that's why oh my gosh you you receive rewards and you get taxed on those rewards and if you are sweating bullets right now because it's almost mid-april and you have not filed your taxes and you're looking at this Tangled mess of transactions across a whole bunch of different wallets and blockchains and D5 and nft and you don't know what to do we got the Easy Button solution it's called crypto tax calculator these are our friends and sponsors and because you are a bankless listener they have reserved 30 off with the coupon code called Bank 30 and you can get on this and you can allow crypto tax calculators sort out your tax situation David I use this tool I've started using it this year I've been my previous attack software because this is just so awesome oh my God what are we looking at right now is this so we had this meme made and so everyone knows that I'm super resistant to taxes and so I had just doing taxes is why I pay other people to do my taxes for me but this is why crypto tax calculator is such a great tool and so I made this meme I'm not going to explain it for the audience if you're on the podcast listener it's a picture of David crying you may have seen this before and then David happy with some like wojak massaging his back from this touch there meme way makers uh anyways this is the product of crypto tax calculator in a nutshell Happy Days all we had to do was show this I didn't even need to say anything anyway get that discount guys it's Bank 30 and you can find that at crypto tax calculator dot IO or a link in the show notes uh all right if you are a bankless nation citizen there is a code a secret code for 40 off ten more percent inside the bank list Nation Discord pure Trader that pays for itself in the first month easy yeah man okay guys uh we're gonna get right into the episode um maybe a few last thoughts here as we get in so we're going through the um what's happening why is it a big deal why it's called what it's called the effect on price liquid staking and what's next for ethereum so this is a really interesting episode we hope you stay tuned for it we'll be right back with Tim and Justin and Anthony but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible Kraken has

hard Fork dates Tim welcome to the show thanks for having me also we got Justin Drake another researcher at the ethereum foundation lead of the ultrasound.money website project and also meme Justin welcome back thanks for having me too and last but not least Anthony cesano ethereum Community member also content producer solo Staker and solo Staker tinkerver we will get into what that means towards the end of the show Anthony welcome back thanks for having me on guys so guys it is a big day in ethereum history uh I think this will be the last hard Fork that is relevant to the proof of stake project but since Tim you are The Herder of cats as it relates to what it takes to make a hard Fork come to be I'm wondering if we could start with you and just kind of give us the the high level details for people who uh need to catch up to what uh chappella is from the protocol perspective what is the chappella hard fork and what does it do for ethereum and why is it significant of course yeah um so the most obvious thing that chappella brings is the introductions of withdrawals on the beacon chain so I assume anyone listening to make this knows this but uh today if you launch a validator on the beacon chain you're basically depositing your funds into a smart contract which gets read by the beacon chain activates your validator there credits your fund your fund on the beacon chain you can earn rewards uh and penalties depending on if you do good or bad job but then there's no way to actually get your funds back out on the execution layer to either you know sell your eats use it and defy anything like that um and uh since the merge uh values have been able to receive transaction fees so when they produce a block the transaction fees they get are not on the beacon chain you know this could send to any eat address so the main thing we're introducing with uh chappella this upgrade that's activating today is kind of closing the loop and allowing validators the ability to withdraw their stake and again you know for your listeners some of those validators have been have locked their Stakes since 2020 so it's been uh it's been a while um and so yeah after this upgrade they'll be able to to withdraw it there's a couple other small changes that we're introducing as well but this is really kind of the big one So within hours as soon as that hard Fork happens Tim um those listening who have staked eth will be able for the first time to withdraw that staked eth is that correct and is there some sort of cueing mechanism as well let's say there's a there's a run on the the eat staking run on the protocol yeah yeah does that put us into trouble like what you know uh tell us the mechanics of how this might work okay yeah so um and there's many many different ways to break this down so please bear with me um so there's two types of withdrawals you can think about so there's full and partial withdrawals um and the way that they work is that uh every block basically validators scan over uh the validator who's producing a block scans over the validator set and tries to find the first 16 validators for whom they can do either a full or a partial withdrawal and they they process those they add them into the block and then the next validator you know picks up for the last one let's left off scans the chain tries to find the next 16 packs them into a block and so on um so if you're a Staker and you don't want to stop staking um those partial withdrawals will basically happen automatically as long as you set uh East uh East address as a withdrawal credential and if you've been at validator for a long time you might not have done this it'll be possible to change it after the fork but this is basically what what happens every block is a validator checks find six teams validators who either are fully exited or have a balance bigger than 32 each withdraws that batch on the execution layer and it moves on um if you are a validator and you do not want to be a validator anymore you need to exit before you can get your full withdrawal process um and just like when we have new validators join we kind of want to throttle them so that the validator set can't change too quickly if there's a bunch of validators who want to leave at the same time we also throttle this process and the reason for this is is basically security where you know you could imagine if we didn't have this on both sides somebody could either hack a bunch of eth you know acquire a bunch of ease replace the entire validator set or the majority of it do some bad stuff exit and kind of not be penalized um so because we want to prevent this we we sort of slow down the flow of validators on both ends um and so this means that if you are validator today and there's a bunch of other validators who want to stop being your validator at the same time as you you need to send this exit message and then it gets processed basically in the order that nodes received them um and they'll be kind of a delay between when your message was received and when you can fully exit your funds and during that period though you you still basically earn rewards and penalties you you could still get partial withdrawals processed but um to get like your 32 East back or potentially less you know if you if you were slashed or whatnot um you need to wait until you've like cleared that queue um and I'm not quite sure Justin probably knows the exact number that we clear every block um but it's uh yeah it's a concept number for Block uh that actually well it's a concept number it depends on the total stake size so um but on the order it's less than 10 per block basically yeah yeah I am familiar that even with simple updates to ethereum there are these like edge cases that get really really complex even though simply put shanghai's withdrawals and then there's like a bunch of like rabbit holes and things to pull apart but let me summarize what I think you just said uh Tim there's this bottleneck called the withdrawal or deposit queue and that bottleneck is the same on both sides so it's equivalent and all that really does like imagine just like water sloshing back and forth between two buckets and there's like a pipe between these two things and one is steak teeth on the on the beacon chain and the rest is ether everywhere else in the world and there is a pipe between these two things that constrains how fast ether can move in either direction and it's the equivalent size and the reason why we have that constraint is that we're talking about the security of the ethereum protocol we don't want things to move too quickly we don't want to go from 18 million ether staked to 2 million ether Stakes to 25 million and ether staked really really quickly so we put in this constraint that we called the deposit and withdrawal queue and that just helps things settle and the foundation of ethereum to not churn too quickly uh yet it still is sufficiently large enough that if you want to withdraw you are going to be able to get your ether within a pretty reasonable amount of time uh Tim I don't know if you guys have done any like simulations but like what's the longest somebody would expect to wait after pressing the withdrawal button before getting their ether in the in normal circumstances like non ftxe type weird stuff I know this is almost an impossible scenario to ask you about but just like can you kind of put a time box on this thing so honestly I I don't spend my time doing simulations on this maybe Justin does um yeah but um you know I think you see with like the deposit to you like it's mostly empty most of the time um you know sometimes there's like a couple hours maybe a couple days but it's like rare that you get these massive these massive spikes um that's it you did get like you know a pretty big initial set of people wanting to be validators like at the launch of ethereum at the merge and whatnot so I wouldn't be surprised like obviously this is the first time we're gonna have withdrawals there's probably a whole set of people who want to or have to like exit their validators um so you know we'll we'll see some churn and I suspect we'll probably see some turn on both sides like we'll probably see some people who didn't want to like stake their ease until withdrawals were alive and now now can um but once we've processed that initial chunk like I you know I I don't see why there would be like a huge exit queue on a day-to-day basis except in cases when like yeah there's a massive amount of the stake that that has to exit and whether this is you know like the Kraken thing that happened or um something like that where um they represent like an on-trivial part and they all have to exit once um then obviously you'd have it you'd have a delay similarly to if you know there's a new cool liquid staking pool that shows up and people want to stick with that and they launch a bunch of new validators that they'll have a delay in getting them activated um and one thing sorry one last thing I'll add is for most people who just want to stay a validator um the scan happens I think it's every four or five days that you get your rewards after uh after this so even imagine you know you you haven't set your eth withdrawal address yet uh you set it tomorrow and like you sort of missed the first scan um you'll get it like five days later so I think on for the average validator who's just getting their partial rewards um it'll be a pretty regular process and and and there's no there's nothing that would like stand the duration of that scan significantly accept the number of validators so if we double the number of validators and you know it'll go from four or five days to like eight or ten um but that's that's what how it's bounded yeah well and uh Justin I'm wondering if you can comment on the economics of these things I think the last time I remember it was uh around 1800 validators per day that can fit through that pipe of withdrawals or deposits I don't know if that's the right number is that is that right um that sounds a bit too high I think it's uh and and if the terms it's about 50 000 or 60 000 uh youth per day now just to give you an order of magnitude uh since a proof of stake happens we've had on average twenty thousand each per day so the the activation is uh Q is definitely not not full basically round up to a hundred million dollars at the current eth price can flow between the beacon chain and the withdrawals and the withdrawals is what's being unlocked today and so today for the first time at maximum 100 million dollars of value can go from the beacon chain back into the rest of the world and that is the thing we're celebrating [Laughter] I didn't know Banks has the nominated in USD a significant portion of our listeners do and so we're doing the the big computational work on on their behalf foreign okay so where do you guys want to go next uh Justin I know that this is uh the proof of stake world is and the e-staking is is is uh something that you pay attention a lot of attention to so when we see the Shanghai the now called uh chappella upgrade like why is this so significant to you like when you is this upgrade like uh I think everyone kind of sees something different in it uh a lot of people want to talk about liquid staking derivatives a lot of people want to talk about ether cell pressure uh when you look at the chappella upgrade what do you see and and guys but as we get into that Justin can someone just I feel like I went on vacation it was called Shanghai I came back and now it's called shabella I wasn't ready for that yes what's with the name change how did how did this come about okay I feel I feel strongly about this so um okay so ethereum has like this execution layer this consensus layer you know before it emerge we were all doing your own thing uh obviously the Network's communicated but in terms of the network upgrades themselves they were pretty independent so you know we had London with 1559 uh and then on the on the beacon chain they had Altair which was their first Fork um and then we had the merge and we sort of had to specify like the set of changes on both sides of the chain right like there's some stuff that happens on the beacon chain some stuff that happened on a proof of work chain then um and so those upgrades actually have separate names as well so like this set of changes on on the proof of work chain was called Paris and uh on the on the proof chain it was called the latrix we were lucky that we could just call it the merge and move on with their with our day um but knowing that we would be in this situation we started to think okay well it's like a way we can name these things that people don't have to like follow two different names um so right now the set of changes on the consensus layer side is called capella they use stars to do those changes on the execution layer side it's called Shanghai because we use the Devcon city names in order um but then most people like don't want to know that like Shanghai and capella are the two sets of changes um and so Proto from optimism had the idea that we should just merge the names together it gets us a new name so chappella in this case and this is kind of neat because if you have a weird funky name you can know it's like an upgrade on both sides but then say that like we just changed something on the beacon chain we can just use a star if we just change something on the execution layer we can just use the Defcon city um so we can you know we can call this chappella because it's like the sum of the two upgrades and then the next one you know it'll be Cancun and the neb so we can call it then and no one has to know about Cancun or deneb um so chappella and we'll keep going from there so every time that we talk about the naming nomenclature of ethereum upgrades I just remember that nerds are taking over the world I thought it was named after Dave Chappelle and he's just like we all got any more of that eight snake right it did give us unfortunately yeah okay uh that was a fun detour thank you for for guiding us through that that one uh Tim uh Justin I'll throw the throw this back to you uh the Kaleidoscope that is the chappella upgrade uh what do you see in it right so I guess before we get into that I just want to do a couple of clarifications the first one is proof of stake yes I agree it's now functionally complete and so if we were to leave the firm as this for the rest of time it would be a functioning system uh having said that there's a bunch of security upgrades and improvements that are coming to proof of stake so we have for example Secrets uh single leader election we have single slot finality uh which reduces the time to finality we have what's called n Shrine PBS we have vdf and we have maybe a dozen also security upgrades that will eventually make a fair World War 3 resistant um and and the the second detail that I wanted to it's really a minor one is differentiating the activation and exit cues versus the deposit and withdrawal queues so really the the throttling of the validators is is at the activation and exit level um the deposit and withdrawal crew queues are basically there because the beacon chain needs to process all of these things and it's a bit of a Dos Vector if they have to process too many deposits or withdrawals at the same time now in terms of the big picture of why withdrawals is important um I think there's several aspects one of them is is of course uh liquidity you know it's a big de-risking event because so far we've mostly had early adopters come in and the way that I see it is the big picture is we're going to go from the early majority to the to the late majority so we're about halfway through I'd say uh we have 18 million you've staked and over the next two and a half years what I'm expecting is that to to to to roughly double um and if you were to to zoom out and look at the the shape of the the amount of Eve staked over time it's like surprisingly shockingly linear yeah it is a straight line up it's a straight line up and I expect that to to to continue uh the the one blip that we're going to have is basically right after the fork what's going to happen is that both the activation queue and the exit queue should be completely clogged and the reason is that the entities like Kraken and and Celsius and whatnot will be uh exiting extremely fast and on the other hand we're going to have people restaking so for example Lido will be setting up automatic deposits to restock and so these two queues which uh DQ at the exact same rate will mean that the amount of each stake will be staying constant possibly for a few weeks but then that's just a blip and then we just continue up only at least that's my that's my prediction so you think the the shape of the curve is going to be lit it's been linear you think at the moment of the uh the hard Fork that comes later today in something like uh nine hours you think it's going to be flat for a short amount of time maybe a couple days and then you think it's going to resume its linear uptrend so it's not going to go down importantly well yeah I think it's going to Plateau potentially for a few few weeks if it is possible that there's a bit of a race condition basically who can set up their infrastructure first to make automatic deposits versus Kraken doing the automatic withdrawals we've seen today if you go to rated.network um they have this new dashboard which shows you withdrawals and Kraken has already started withdrawing now my expectation is that Lido will start the automatic uh you know restaking of of issuance Beacon issuance you know very very soon and then once these two process have kicked in uh then you know we should have we should have a plateau for for a few days maybe a few weeks the other thing I was curious about Justin is um so you're anticipating like kind of like final State being like a doubling of the amount of Heath staked right now which which what what is that what does that put us at like 30 to 40 of the total eth in the network is staked something like this and if so um that I believe is a lot less than some other um Network scripto networks that have had staking for a while right so like looking at some other networks and they're they're closer to like the 60 or 70 range if that's the case why do you think eth won't ethereum won't get to like higher uh numbers of of stake teeth you know closer to 60 to 70 percent of the supply right so we actually don't want too many validators and that's for a number of reasons um one of them is that we we don't want to be unnecessarily overpaying for economic security so the way that we pay for Economic Security is with issuance and if we have enough Economic Security with let's say 30 or 40 percent of State div then then we don't want to be overpaying by unnecessarily diluting ourselves the other very important thing in my opinion is that we want to have plenty of pristine economic bandwidth so if has two macro uses one is a staking and the other one is as a collateral asset in the context of for example backing decentralized stable coins and we want to have plenty of kind of raw pristine if to be used by applications that want to consume the Best in Class collateral assets within within ethereum now there's also other technical reasons one is that we already have half a million validators which is a lot of validators and we don't want to have too much computational pressure on the The Beacon nodes so the the the the clients that are that have been built so far you know prism Lighthouse Etc you know maybe they can they can handle a million validators but do we really want them to handle 2 million validators that's maybe you know pushing things a little far especially that we want to do this upgrade called single slot finality and what does single slot finality mean it means that you get finality within a few seconds and in order to get finality we need every single validator to be making an attestation and to aggregate these attestations so we're talking about aggregating hundreds of thousands of BLS signatures in just a few seconds and this is a very challenging technical process so we actually want to be in a process in a position where we cap the number of validators and there's various ways to to to do that um one of the thing ways we could do it for example is by having a issuance curve which goes negative as soon as we get very very close to the cap that we want to what we want to get to um another idea which is not really a cap but is more of a a way to slow down the growth and is is called met burn is this idea that we do something very very similar to ap1559 that for for base views but this time we do it for Mev and that should give us a little bit of relief and remove the urgency on on on capping beautiful beautiful okay so a lot of those subjects I know are highly related towards this question that we have at the end which is what's next for ethereum staking so I think we'll perhaps return to to some of these subjects later on but Anthony I want to turn the same question to you uh thank you uh for for waiting uh the Kaleidoscope of the chappella upgrade there are so many things to talk about uh we got liquid staking derivatives we got uh solo stickers when you see this upgrade like what does it mean to you yeah I think I I agree with like pretty much everything that Tim and Justin have said and I really resonate with the view that while this is kind of a big milestone for ethereum staking it's not the final stop so to speak like for me personally I view it as like a 1.0 right and people are going to kill me for saying something like each staking 2.0 because uh we don't want to bring up the 2.0 terminology again but but I think there are as Justin said like there are other upgrades coming to proof of stake on ethereum that are going to harden the proof of stake right and make it better make it more secure and all that good stuff they're making more resilient um which means that proof of stake you know in its current form can can work and can work just fine that's why you would call it a 1.0 uh but it is not you know as complete as we can make it so to speak there are a lot of different things that we can add to it to make it a much better system which will be added you know over time especially things like as Justin mentioned single slot finality and the the secret leader election and stuff like that I actually personally think they're pretty critical that they they actually do need to be shipped and stuff like PBS as well I don't think they're nice to haves I think they're pretty much must-haves at this point so yeah that's why like withdrawals being shipped we kind of finish the 1.0 version of staking but then we move on to all of these other upgrades that could be considered like a 2.0 version of ethereum staking but like that's my own kind of take on it I don't suggest adopting that terminology for sake of not confusing everyone even more than we already have yeah does not have a good track record of not doing that yeah exactly exactly uh but in terms of of just the significance of it I I think that the biggest thing for me is showing uh well there's two probably major things it's showing the I guess like ecosystem that uh ethereum is still shipping like at a at a better Pace than it's ever done right it's still shipping major upgrades it's still executing on its roadmap and that is sending a strong signal to the rest of the ecosystem that ethereum is is evolving ethereum is is executing uh even post the merge which obviously was the biggest upgrade in ethereum's history we haven't really slowed down at all you know even uh all these um things happening in uh for for Cancun or dencoon as as Tim mentioned like erp4844 they have made amazing progress like there are devnets there are things happening uh there is and and it's slated hopefully for for later in the year or maybe you know it depends maybe early next year but with the the pace that that the um the shipping is going right now it just inspires a lot of confidence so I think that's a strong signal being sent out um and secondly just related directly to withdrawals I think it acts as has an absolutely huge de-risking event and I strongly agree that we're going to see much more each staked uh because of that and we're going to see a much healthier staking ecosystem because of that as well because now no longer are the lsds themselves limited by market forces where essentially the only way that these lsds could repeg is if the market basically repegged them and I know they're not a peg so to speak but like to make them actually kind of at fair value you couldn't do that Arbitrage with the beacon chain directly now you'll be able to do that which I think even though it may seem something that's kind of simple and gets done every day and it's not something to be excited about I think it's absolutely huge because it means that taking uh with lsds is going to be much safer much more efficient and it's going to mean that these money market Protocols are going to feel more comfortable uh with adding them as collateral making their collateral Factor kind of a higher so that people can use them to borrow more assets against them and then it opens up the whole other world of other things that are that are coming to staking such as the restaking stuff from eigenlayer distributed validated technology like all these other things that can build be built on top and around staking it makes those things possible and much more exciting so that those are the two major things that I I kind of look at uh but yeah there's a lot I mean as you said it is a kaleidoscope people have their own different views on it uh and there's always a lot to talk about uh when it comes to ethereum upgrades I know we're going to talk about price and sort of you know whether the amount of staking is going to like to how that's going to impact price and whether stick teeth is going to go up or down post merge because there's been a lot of discussion on this I could say for me personally I see withdrawals as a huge de-risk event and I have some of my own personal youth staked but I've literally been waiting for this moment for like well we have months of trust in the network uh post merge uh you know and you know David's gas on breaks right so I'm a bit more risk adverse but I don't know what what David you've been doing with with uh your eth whether how much you're staking versus not I've literally been waiting for this event and maybe for like me to start seeing some withdrawals to you to start getting more bullish on unstaking my own eth and then once it's staked if you're a long-term holder of eth why on stake is is kind of the question so I know we'll get to the kind of the the whether this is bullish or bearish for eth price and in how this impacts kind of sentiment but that's my own personal take uh I'm curious David like what what how do you see this event yeah so well for the ethereum archetype person I think the I think well I guess it almost just by proxy of the fact that the network increasing in total stake like we're at 18 of all ether staked my percent of personal ether staked has has trended upwards since the beginning of the beacon train as well I was like oh I think I'll take some of this a little bit more today uh and so like perhaps uh that's a sentiment that's shared by the entire network which is why we see it going up and to the right uh but like the this last event is the final like bridge that needs to be crossed where like the eat staking uh the idea of e-staking which I like you know pulled out my calculator back in 2018 I was like all right I need this much e-staked and I need uh the each price to be this high and then I'll have this much income to retire on they're like there's a reason that there's literally a bankless video about this from this time yeah and so this is finally the event that allows that to to come true um we are not currently at the East price that that I envisioned but we're still only 2023 is still quite quite early um Anthony I want to actually uh turn back to you because a lot of what you do at the daily gray is just to provide accurate and informed information about ethereum uh kind of a fractal off of your activity with uh ethub uh way back when which was just to fight ethereum fud and there is plenty of fun abound per usual about this particular hard Fork simply because of the nature of what it is uh all of the ether is gonna get unstaked and it's gonna go sell they'll sell the price down to zero ethereum security is going to go to zero like what's some of the biggest uh Twitter fud that you see out there that you think is totally just like ridiculous there's certainly some criticisms and critiques and bearishness about uh the the staking the withdrawal upgrade because like simply put when you add more Supply into the market like and there's more people that are able to press the sell button so like not I'm not discounting that at all there are some people who are just like fighting this whole thing left and right I'm wondering what's like the biggest piece of like Twitter drama that's worth addressing so some of the most ridiculous takes I've seen around it were from people who don't actually understand how it works at all basically they don't understand that there is a cue for staking and unstaking withdrawing and all that they don't understand that 70 of the stake is already in lsds and smaller stakers can exit you know almost at fair value a lot a lot of the time now because a lot of these lsds are not trading at a discount right they don't understand that we added more than half the existing validators uh in 2022 during you know one of the most brutal kind of like bearish periods for crypto people were still adding validators right because they still wanted to stake their Eve um and there's just like a lot of different things that fall off of that people saying oh they added a queue because they don't want people to exit too quickly so the price doesn't dump it's like I mean there are so many different considerations here for from Economic Security perspective that that Justin went through and why it kind of exists so when people say that I just laugh but I think a lot of the misunderstanding comes from the fact that people just don't understand how ethereum proof of stake Works how it differs from other proof of stake networks because a lot of the other ones pretty much you know all of them are some flavor of delegated proof of stake uh whereas ethereum is very very different doesn't have that kind of in-protocol Delegation there and that's why we have a lot of these lsds that are quite popular uh but uh the the deposit and withdrawal queue is is definitely a huge kind of uh source of confusion for a lot of people and they don't understand why it exists uh and why it's needed and they they think it's just being done as a way to like stem the bleeding or something like that which is obviously untrue uh and and I think that they they they kind of they form this bias around it as well they look they look at it and they're like oh look at all the ether's going to be unlocked and look at all the other unlocks that have happened in the past and what happens to the price of the asset well you have to contextualize this if some token has a massive VC unlock well that's going to be a very different unlock to to what ethereum is doing with we're staking withdrawals right and there is no actual kind of um uh uh what's the word I'm looking for kind of oh there's a word for an I'm saluting me right now there's there's no prior events like this that has happened before where a major Network like ethereum has enabled staking withdrawals later and there's been all this value at stake and there's nothing being like it so people can very easily form their own views on this uh just based on nothing because there's nothing to point to uh and I think that leads to as I said like people forming their biases and then uh and then reasoning about it from that with all the lack of information that they haven't got around how ethereum proof of stake works so that's why I've tried for for many months now to correct all of this but it is really really hard because as I said when people make up their mind they have their own biases they're not really open to reason about this especially when it comes to the price where they're like oh you know this is going to be really bad for the eighth price because billions of dollars is hitting the market and then you try to explain to them that's literally not what is going to happen because of all these reasons they're going to be like oh crap oh what no I already made up my mind that's not actually true it's going to be really bearish so I mean I think that's that's what kind of happened Anthony most basically I was like right after that merge I was told for months don't stake your eth from like you know floodsters because you'll never be able to unstake it withdrawals will never be enabled or if they are enabled it's up to vitalik and you might do that you know by his good graces five years away right like it's just the amount of misinformation about ethereum is um is pretty staggering particularly on this never seems to go down that's that that fun point is pretty funny and I I just noticed I didn't even mention that because it actually is so unbelievably stupid that I I think it was just about to be disproven in a few hours well and that too right but but yeah again that just goes hand in hand with people having their own biases or towards a theorem that if you already don't like ethereum then of course you're just going to not care what the relevant truth is here right you're not going to care that they're gonna it's with roles are going to be shipped especially after for years if you said the merger's never going to happen and then the merge happened and you're like internally in your brain being like oh crap what do I pivot to now in order to fight ethereum and then you've even to these next things it's just it's just a forever kind of goal post move so yeah I mean we're about to ship it uh at the end of the day what these people say is irrelevant I doubt any of the core devs or researchers give a crap about what these people say they just do the work that they want to do and they focus on what they want to focus on and and the community keeps moving forward at the end of the day so guys I think we've covered a decent amount of the low hanging fruit about the uh this conversation like what it is uh the withdrawal and deposits queue why we call it chappello when we previously called it Shanghai some of the some of the fud but there's some more nuanced conversations that I think probably a lot of listeners are are waiting for and that's really just the big question of like okay 18 million ether can now move it can be sold it can also be moved from liquid staking project to liquid staking project um more ether could be staked because of this de-risking event uh so like I think these are the three big umbrellas that that I see uh like how much is going to be sold how much is going to be reshuffled and how much more ether will come in as a result I think these are kind of the three big categories so I think that's where I want to turn to next but first I wanted to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible you know uniswap as the world's largest decks with over 1.4 trillion dollars in trading volume but it's so much more uniswap Labs builds product that lets you buy sell and use your self-custody digital Assets in a safe simple and secure way uniswap can never take control or misuse your

your assets with uniswap's new mobile wallet so go bankless with one of the most trusted names in D5 by going to uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts

to phantom.app waitlist to get access in late February Bank location we are back with the questions that you guys really want answered which is what's going to have happen to the 18 million ether that gets unlocked and so uh Justin I actually want to get your perspective on this because you have this uh mental model of like frozen liquid and boiling ether and I think that's kind of slightly uh relates to that whole idea we have a bunch of Frozen ether that's available to be thawed I got 18 million ether that's frozen in the beacon chain it's going to some of it might go through the hole and become thawed and become liquid ether that can go to defy that can go back into a different uh staking derivative project like Lido or rocket pool or some of the long tail ones um it might be sold on the secondary Market uh and so of all the destinations that ether could go do you have an opinion or or an idea as to where the the most of the ether might accrue right so just thinking in in qualitative terms I think there's two very healthy things that happen once you can for Eve one is competition so for two and a half years if you've been taking one with one service provider you've been locked in and I think that has kind of led to a little bit of staleness in terms of innovation and competition so I don't want to pick specifically on coinbase but it's an easy one to pick on they are very large operator and they charge a 25 fee and I think a lot of their users you know have joined the staking service maybe a year ago 18 months ago or even more and in crypto land 12 months of 18 months is in eternity it's uh you know maybe enough time for you to get comfortable with the concept of staking um comfortable with the fact that you know now it's it's been de-risked and you understand what's going on and so I'm hoping that there's going to be you know a move outside of you know these very large pockets of stake like coinbase towards maybe Solo solo validating because really withdrawals is a an unfair unfairly good upgrade for the solo validators because they haven't been able to access liquidity whereas projects like like Lido and coinbase you know they get a tiny upgrade so um you know as was mentioned uh you know they have a slightly stronger pack because now it can be economically arbitraged um but really the the key upgrade comes for the the the solo validators um now another interesting kind of thought experiment is in terms of of Lido and I think that there might be an opportunity for a vampire attack so basically Lido right now is huge right there's something like 31 or 32 percent of all stake teeth and so the question I have is could a competitor come in and basically set up a small contract so that you deposit staked if and then it gets automatically on stage with Lido and then restaked with the competitor and the competitor says if you do that we're not going to charge you any fees for the next X years um and so that could be kind of a very interesting Dynamic that we see shortly um maybe a few months after withdrawals are enabled is this is this a Justin Drake brain child thought experiment or is this something that you've seen out in the wild and have seen perhaps a liquid-saking derivative project actually talk about no I haven't seen anyone talk about it so I guess it's a brainchild um in the episode [Laughter] so yeah this is a huge opportunity I think for competitor to to step up and and uh and maybe provide healthy competition in in the ecosystem and Justin can you just underline that healthy competition how does that benefit eth stakers does it lower fees so you mentioned coinbase with a 25 fee I mean I guess you know implicitly that would be unsustainable if you bring more competition in the market so does it does it lower staking fee prices what are the other benefits for each stakers when you have more competition right um so one thing could be lower fees um so right now Lido charges 10 fee but maybe you know that could be reduced to six percent or seven percent I don't know uh but the other big Improvement is that it makes ethereum stronger more robust and so as an eve holder you know you want you want ethereum to be maximally successful and uh that this this competition will kind of make the value of your principle your 32 if hopefully uh grow uh because of that competition so there's almost like this this notion of activist staking where you know you will consciously make a decision to move away from the large pockets of stake teeth and and go to the to to the smaller ones now this is not only rational just from a memetic standpoint but there's also a rational from a fundamental standpoint and the reason is that within the protocol we have infrastructure which we call anti-correlation you know incentives so if there's some sort of correlated failure so for example if many validators get slashed at the same time or many validators go offline at the same time this is where the penalties really start hitting you hard because the more validators are affected around the same time the greater the penalties and so you want to try and avoid being correlated with many other validators and so for example if there's some sort of small contract bug within Lido or if there's some governance issue with with with Lido well you're going to get the maximum penalty if things go really wrong and the reason is that the the penalty for slashing at least is three times the amount that is that is takes so there's 31 percent of all ifs staked with Lido 3 times 31 uh would be you know 93 you get slash 93 in the worst case whereas if you're in a much smaller pool which only has one percent then the the worst that you can get slashed would be three percent if if that hopeful gets slashed and and I'm only that pool so it's kind of a way to buy insurance again against tail risks and people don't often you know think about these tail risks but they are there I definitely want to um focus back on that comment of uh chappella Shanghai withdrawals upgrade whichever you want you want to call it uh benefits this solo Staker the most but first uh before that I think that's where we'll kind of tie off this conversation um first I want to go back to that idea of this withdrawal uh curve uh so like like Justin said earlier it was linear he thinks it's going to be flat because because of the withdrawal slash deposit Q they're going to cancel each other out while these things settle um but I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that withdrawals will ultimately outpace deposits just because of the pent up to demand to withdraw that's built up over the last like two plus years that the beacon chain has been has been online now whether that amount uh that extra withdrawal pressure that in my opinion perhaps will exceed the deposit pressure whether that just returns into new deposits into Lido or rocket pool or some others taking uh derivative or perhaps goes into D5 or perhaps get sold I don't know uh but let's present let's put on the bear caps because it's bear season and say that like a decent amount goes to the secondary Market to it's also May or excuse me it's also April so it's also tax season uh so like perhaps there is some some cell pressure out in in the market so the Anthony I want to turn this on to you uh can you put on your I know this this hat does not fit well on you but put on your bear hat uh what's the bear case for for ether and the eat price why is the eth price going to go down this is an impossible question to ask me sir and you know that um so so you mentioned you mentioned taxes right I I think that like there are a lot of taxes that have been accrued by stakers via the consensus layer rewards obviously that they have not been able to sell those rewards to cover those taxes they could cover those taxes using other funds that they have if that's the way they're being taxed or if the tax office or the guidelines basically say that you're not taxed on that eighth until it's actually unlocked as part of the the chappella upgrade you may need to sell that and I I ran through some rough numbers on on my show a bunch of times where I basically said let's just say 30 has to be sold for for taxes right 30 of the consensus layer rewards which I believe is like 350 000 eth or something like that I don't know the exact numbers off the top of my head uh but at the same time like all that's not going to be sold at once right there are going to be people that are not going to want to sell that eighth uh they're just going to cover their taxes with other fear that they have right not everyone's going to be at a 30 percent tax rate so the numbers are very hard to get for for that kind of scenario right for the for the tax selling purposes now in in terms of the actual eat steak itself and how many people are going to sell the stake that they that they put in well I've seen many charts floating around that basically say that most stakers based on the USD value of when they actually stake their eighth are underwater now that's not going to be totally accurate either because people could have bought eth at a cheaper price and then staked it later right it's going to be it's very hard to get those accurate numbers there but that you know you look at that and you're like okay well who's gonna who's gonna sell the people underwater they might sell because they're like oh you know I need the liquidity I I need to panic out of this position um you know it's been locked for a while I want to get out now but I doubt many of those people are Solo stakers I think those people would have staked with lsds and they already have the exit liquidity available to them if they wanted to exit uh their fully staked position even if they took a haircut from selling their LSD for Ethan then selling that for for um dollars or something like that that would have been an option for for most people already so it is actually very hard for me to come up with a bearish scenario where a lot of eighth is going to be suddenly unlocked mistaking and sold on on the market uh the most bearish I can think of is really just the tax selling for the consensus layer rewards and even that I don't think is that much cell pressure given how much liquidity there is for eth as an asset already it's not like this is some random erc20 token on uni Swap this is eighth we're talking about which has a huge amount of liquidity um and a huge amount of people ready to to buy it I think for a number of different reasons so Anthony is it accurate to say and by the way when we're talking about like price we're talking about short-term Price Right obviously this you know people have forgotten this in like three months basically like withdrawals yeah the thing and so but but short term people are still curious and it seems like there are two opposing forces here there's there's the one force that's like my ether's been unlocked and I've been wanting to sell it for a long time but I haven't been able to and I'm underwater and I was panicking and now I the ether's unlocked so I can sell maybe I have to pay some taxes so that's one force over here in the cell pressure um and I guess maybe the the stake pressure over here is like isn't it great ethereum continues to ship it's incredible they just pulled off another successful uh hard Fork um and now this entire staking thing has been de-risked it's sort of the sentiment I was expressing a little bit earlier some of the long-term holders might be like now is my chance to to Really Pile in to eat staking and these two opposing forces are sort of fighting the bull in the bear case you know and like the market will decide whether each price goes up or down is that a way to think about is that how you think about it or would you add something to this no that's a good way to think about it I think and there are also a lot of other demand factors for just ether's an asset as well like if you're talking about what the price can move even in the short term based on Supply entering the market well obviously you have to consider the demand case as well and and every day we have millions of dollars of eight being used as gas fees right on the network uh so there's a demand driver as well people have to buy eth in order to use the network and then there's um if there's an investment vehicle and eat to stake so so yeah there are those opposing forces but I feel like the demand side is just stronger than the than this overall Anthony I would expect nothing less but you think the withdrawal is getting deployed is more bullish like and good for each price than bearish even in the short run well yeah because people have been saying that it's bearish for the eighth price since eighth was eleven hundred dollars and now eighth is like 1900 so and that wasn't that long ago I was like what two three months ago or something like that so like that that's why as I said it's very hard to find the bear case if you run through all the scenarios and you try to make it maybe I'm not the best person to make a bear case of course but I think that just going on the on the logic that I've I've put out there it'd be very hard for anyone to do that and you know what the people that I've seen that are the most bearish are the ones that don't actually have any arguments to back up their bearishness they just put these kind of views out there and say all this it's going to be unstaked and sold it's like okay but but why why is that going to happen oh you know uh because of this and I don't really have any reasons right so that's why I kind of say that and that's why I I try to reason about it from these first principles rather than coming to a conclusion first and then working my way back okay so I want to turn this conversation to the thing that makes the entire ethereum ecosystem tick which is the solo Staker uh and so uh we said earlier that uh the the Chappelle upgrade uh unduly benefits solo sakers the most but I feel like there's such some other conversations about uh what solo how this uh impacts the solo-saking environment and Tim I'm wondering if you could guide us through that conversation what's the significance of Chappelle as relates to solo sticking and guys let's be dude can we just Define a solo sticker so when we say solo Staker in in our world what we're saying is basically somebody who is staking runs their own validator staking their own kind of it's their ether and their validator okay so this is not rocket pool this is not Lido we would not consider base pools kind of stake it's definitely not coinbase someone who's running their own validators a solar State solo stickers that correct yeah cool I think I think that's good um yeah I think there's probably two things that like make solo sticking significantly better than it currently was um like the obvious one is just like getting the rewards uh periodically right like because what you're saying is you know you're locking that capital and and you know staking East but you're also getting sort of compensated for it and and can receive part of those rewards uh over time um and this has been like a bit true since the merge because of the transaction fees um but obviously there's a big difference between you know locking up your Ethan getting absolutely nothing out of it um versus you know locking it up and being able to actually get the funds get the funds out um and I think the other thing that's really neat with with this upgrade is you can also try it right like being a solo sticker was a pretty big ask to people uh prior to withdrawals being live because you were sort of signing up for this indefinite amount of time right some people signed up in like 2020 and you know had no idea that like April 2020 three is what they would they would be able to withdraw um whereas now it's like you know if you've been on defense you know you're not quite sure about it like I would I would probably wait until this you know this this uh straight line that Justin mentioned has gone through like this sort of flow of withdrawals and deposits has like passed but you know after that you should be able you can spit it up your validated will activate within a couple days you can try it run it and like you know keep it running if you want and if you don't want to you can shut it down and get your funds back out you know in in a couple days as well so I think there is something there where like once you've done it then you've sort of run through to flow like you know putting your funds up locking it running the validator getting your funds back out seeing that it's not actually working it was not rocket science or you know maybe you messed something up on the first try you want to try differently the second time um you can do that right um especially when it comes to things like potentially you know changing your setup changing clients and whatnot like this is something where I think solo stickers are like extremely anxious and like you know you can shut it down and get the penalty in the meantime but I think just even if it's economically worse like from just like a anxiety anxiety of managing your validator knowing you can like fully exit the thing if it was running on I don't know like guest in prism and you want to try uh like Nimbus and bezoo you can like exit that validator get your money back literally you know formats that drive like that you were using you wipe it clean and start again um so I think hopefully like we'll just see like a bit more experimentation on that front um and one thing we've been trying to do as well uh at the EF is set up like some ephemeral test net for stakers as well so like we have this new thing called ephemery where we have these test Nets that like launch and completely reset every two three days um so you can like start from scratch you know get some like genesis Ethan the test net launch your validator make sure that it works exit your funds and and run through that process because I think up to now it's felt like something where a lot of people who are less experienced or like knowledgeable about this like set it up and like somehow it works and then they never want to touch it again and they're afraid of like any mistake and and to be fair you know a mistake was costly if it means you know you get your validator slash or whatnot and then you have to wait two years for it to be exited um whereas now it's like yeah I think we you get a little bit more uh confidence like if something goes wrong you can at least get most of your funds back pretty quickly and and try and change your setup so um yeah hopefully you lead some more experimentation yeah and Tim this gave gave me kind of just like flashbacks to the first few times I set up my own uh private Keys uh and so like wrote down my private Keys loaded them up in my ledger erased my ledger loaded them up again made sure the addresses were the same deposited a small amount of ether erase my ledger again loaded up the same private keys made sure the ether was still there and that's how I got like comfortable with like yes and you were scared every single time every single time right and so Tim what you're saying is like okay we have that same pattern but now we're doing it for solo staking but we weren't able to have those people who were timid and kind of exploring the frontier because of they weren't able to withdraw they weren't able to complete the loop and so like now like once upon a time we were all doing our practicing our self custody with writing down our own private keys and now what you're saying is like people can practice their own self validation of the chain and so this is like the self custody but now for validators and now that this Loop is complete people can go one step further Beyond just self-custody and do the thing that ethereum was has always been set up to do which is apply self-custody and self-validation as closely as possible and so you're saying that now that this Loop is here people can explore one step further into this crypto economic Frontier and and feel safe doing it and if it's not for them and they just want to go store it with coinbase then they can freely withdraw but at least they were abled and enabled to do that in the first place this is what you're saying correct yeah 100 yeah yeah do you know what I feel like we need though on solo sailing is staking is for this to be like there are people who will never self-custody because setting up a ledger medevask is too difficult right and right there's a lot of people that are are able and willing to do that but there's a smaller subset of people who are able to kind of maybe run their own validator and like work through client command line and do the devops and and feel confident on that front like I might like throw up my hand as as one of those individuals as well are there any steps to make solo staking as easy or close to as easy as just running like a ledger for example because to me that's what it's going to take to actually get the big take off maybe that does not include Lido or rocket pool in your answer exactly exactly because Lido and Rocket pool are sort of the the easy button right now the question to me to see solo staking really take off is can we make solo staking maybe as easy as running as it's self-custody on a ledger do we see anything like that on the market yeah so um what one the the term that I use for for kind of unstaking and restaking is re-keying basically creating a new set of keys and this flexibility comes with various advantages because it means for example that you can improve your security setup so for example some of the you know institutions that might have like the really fancy NPC to generate the keys they have what's called remote signing where there's like a separate piece of software Hardware maybe that is air-gapped or like kind of segregated in some way or another and for solo stickers there's actually this uh this technology called sgx from Intel that can be used to basically mimic the functionality of a hardware wallet it's kind of a way to have your staking keys in a hardware wallet in such a way that you can't be slashed so the service provided is kind of anti-slashing protection and there is a company working on it full disclosure I'm an advisor um called Puffer they provide this for free as so you can just go download it and then you basically have a hardware wallet uh kind of that is the same kind of grade of security as an institution in the context of remote signing now another kind of really healthy thing with with re-keying is that um you know it might unlock certain services for for some of the operators so for example insurers uh might require that the the keying process follows certain standards and the fact that you can now re-key means that you can satisfy the requirements of the insurers and so now we could start seeing service providers provide slashing protection and they'll provide all sorts of all sorts of of insurance it refreshes Justin when you say re-keying what do you mean there what is re-keying right so when you are a validator you have a private key which is your your staking key and you use this private key to sign messages on a regular basis so every Epoch every 6.4 minutes you're gonna be signing what's called an attestation basically a vote on what you think is the current state of the chain and then every once in a while every few months roughly every six months you kind of you win a lottery and you get selected as a as a proposer and here you're gonna sign um a a block a proposal now one of the things that you don't want to happen is that this private key gets gets leaked um and I think what's happening right now is that solo validators are today kind of yoloing it without even realizing it and the reason is that they have a computer where the staking key is like essentially in hot within the the machine and if there's some sort of virus or whatever it is then they are liable to get slashed so it's kind of this unnecessary kind of psychological you know fear that you know at any point in time because you don't really have this strong protection you could be slashed so really what we need is the equivalent of a hardware wallet for staking and this thing does exist you can use sgx to provide the anti-slashing protection very cool well this has been a definitely a big moment for ethereum and it's good to see hard Forks major upgrades so close so back to back I mean it It Feels Like Only Yesterday when we were on a massive call as a community celebrating the merge and now here we are with another hard Fork so it gotta gotta conclude with this and and the show in this way what is next for ethereum so let's look Beyond chappella to the next uh portmanteau uh that that you were talking about um Tim which is the next ethereum hard fork and upgrade what is the next area of focus for core devs and the development team yeah um of course so the next big uh upgrade is called Den Kun so the nav and Cancun together um but uh and the main thing we've uh started to work on for that is eip4844 uh there's been several bankless episodes about this already but at a high level it's a scalability upgrade to ethereum which uh introduces the data availability layer which will reduce the data costs for Roll-Ups and so if you look at the transaction fees on a roll up today it's like 90 to 95 percent the cost of posting data on ethereum uh 444 will massively reduce that cost um basically because the network won't store the data forever so because we have like a bound on how long the network needs to retain that data um whereas right now the roll-up data is like stored in in the nodes forever um we can charge much less for it um so and and those savings kind of get passed on to users in the form of lower transaction fees um so this is extremely important if we want to roll up to the scale and you know the general usage of ethereum to scale so that's the main thing we're working on the other big thing I will mention um is uh changing how self-destruct Works uh so right now on ethereum if you deploy a contract you can basically delete it there's an app code called self-destruct for adapt um this is nice in that you know it allows you to delete a contract but it's kind of the one area of the EDM where we don't know how long it's going to take to execute the code that's running before we run it so you can think of like if you delete the tiny contract you know it deletes super quickly but imagine you deleted like the uniswap contractor the crypto kitties contract you know deleting all those records takes the computer way more time than did eating like a tiny contract and partially because of that um it's it's kind of incompatible with a lot of changes we want to do in the future and a lot of the changes around statelessness and and um and whatnot can't deal with this this idea that like we need to delete an arbitrary amount of data um so this is something that is used by contract developers so right now like we're looking at all the different designs that we can use to you know deactivate this in a way that like ideally does not break any existing contracts um but the if you're a smart contract Dev listening to this um it's linked in the blog post we have like a deactivation EIP just as a earth or a deprecation EIP has like you notice to people um but that's something that I think contract developers should be aware that uh likely within you know the next year or so self-destruct as it exists today will not work um the you know the idea that like the funds get sent back to the caller address will will be preserved um but like what actually happens with the contracts um and you know how possible it is to like deploy buy something and replace it with something else um that's that's going to be changing um and if we let a time maybe slip out there within the next year or so I notice you're saying yeah I've tried to be extremely conservative yeah you know so that people will be happy when then  doesn't happen in April 2024 yeah thank you it's great Tim I know uh you got it drop so feel free to to hop off if you need to but I do want to ask about Anthony and his solo Staker tinkering Anthony uh as somebody who explores the uh the frontier of solo staking what does it mean to Tinker what you're up to over there what you doing I think I have one of the weirdest spiking setups or solid staking setups out there uh for a few different reasons so I I said on Twitter recently that I'm currently running four different El CL uh kind of combos uh and it's put a lot of strain on my network and my networking devices which has caused me to Tinker a lot with with different things so the reason I'm not running for is because I have my soul my normal solar staking box which has my personal funds on it I have my rocker pool odow box which is my mini pools and uh my obviously my my role in the Odell uh I have another box which is my archive node box which I'm running for the rocketpool odor but it's a separate box altogether so that's running another combo and then I have another solo box which is my retirement fund so my entire retirement account is in eighth but I can't stake that eight with my personal funds because of some regulation so I have to have another solo sticking box for that so all this is so funny so he has his personal staking box in his retired sticky box it actually had two different boxes because of nation state regulations and like you can put them on top of each other if you wanted to yes and my and the funny thing is my retirement box is a little device called a proteus which is something um Joe from the rockapool community up uh sold so it's basically a rock 5B uh board in a nice 3D printed case um and it's a low powered device but it's running a bunch of solo validators on there that is my retirement one so it's literally sitting right in front of me I can see it right here next to my rocker pool box my solos is like as long as as long as they're separate that's apparently okay but um and yeah and they're all running off of my home network so my home network is 100 a thousand um megabits down to one gigabit down uh and 40 megabits up unfortunately the up is is pretty pretty crappy and I haven't got any way around that but it does put a lot of load on my network I'm using currently 15 terabytes a month just on my staking boxes because they're all using different El and cl combo so they're basically running their own ethereum full node essentially and I'm running an archive node as well so that put a lot of strain on and I had to replace some networking gear because some of it was leading to miss missed asset attestations on some of my boxes because they it just was overloading my network so yeah that's that's a lot of the tinkering that I've done but there's so much more but yeah it's it's been fun it's been a lot of fun but when you're running such a weird setup like I am uh yeah you run into these issues that no one really runs into and I was troubleshooting things with um actually a core Dev and it was like what's going on and it was the network the networking equipment issue because it's like you shouldn't be missing attestations you're doing nothing wrong I'm like I don't know man I don't know and it took me a while to figure it out but I figured it out in the end so that was okay yeah the the surface area that you have to be a solo Staker I think it's pretty immense these days and we've come we've come a long ways away from where we were previously bullied by the big corners for not ever being able to run you know what I which was never ever true in the first place I still think culturally we should totally honor solo stickers like I I just want to say good job Anthony like that's totally I I know it's it's it's more difficult what you're doing right now is is more difficult than just kind of staking it with some sort of a pool provider but um uh you're performing your civic duty as an ethereum above and beyond I think that should be it celebrated for sure should we put on a little Cape today Anthony today I mean I would be doing it the service to everything I believe in if I was not solo staking that's that's the way I view it right and I think Solo's take is are the Beating Heart of ethereum they are the Beating Heart of ethereum values and decentralization we didn't create the theory improved mistake the way we did to just go stake with centralized exchanges right and uh and and I've been a solo sticker since day one literally part of the Genesis of the beacon chain um you know a bunch of my validators which yeah I'm very obviously very proud of but uh my setup just for people that listened and heard how complex it was this is not a normal setup if you don't have to do that we can we can make it easier than what you just said is that what you're saying yeah it's a lot easier than that okay you can you can very setting up a solid staking box is actually very easy um oh and and actually just one other quick thing my soul is taking box while I was in Denver for Denver decided to uh basically or while the SSD that it runs on decided to just like die um and it caused my size taking box to go offline and I had no idea this was the case until I got back home um and then I got back home and I looked at it so I had to basically redo my entire setup again so I had to reinstall everything but it only took me like half an hour because there's a guide that I follow from uh his name is summer summer is on medium and there's a queen cashew guide they're very very similar you follow that and it tells you all the command to put into the command line to do it to generate everything into the and to do everything and it only took me half an hour to get back up and running with a new SSD uh it's obviously not going to be like that the first time you do it but I think there's this misconception that solo sticking is really hard when I don't think it is and as I said you can do it on very low powered Hardware my Proteus box is um I think it was like 700 US dollars or something like that around that um for the whole kit and it comes pre-loaded if you don't want a solid state but stake as part of Rocket pool it comes pre-loaded with the rockapool smart node stack so you can get started straight away so and and for solid stickers there's the avado or dap node boxes uh which you can also use so there are multiple different ways to get started and I think that there is definitely a misconception that solo staking is this really hard thing that's only reserved for the super technical people I'm not very technical the command line I'm a beginner at it I'm not I can't do the all just copy stuff to other people yeah I mean a lot of the time I just copy and paste and learn how I go and it is it is a lot of fun as well so I just I figured that was worth mentioning too well I think that's a great exploration down the world of solo stickers Justin uh yeah give us your give us your last thoughts while we sign off here yeah just to try and chill so though uh it's taking a little bit more you know you don't have to pay any fees when you're solo sticking so already that puts you Above the Rest from a from a rational standpoint but the the other thing I want to highlight is that my prediction is that there is going to be special airdrops specifically for solar varieties and the reason is that um for example eigen layer some of the services that they require is that pure Economic Security so just lots and lots of if but some other services are maybe more subtle they kind of require you know proof of humanity or they require proof of decentralization and what is happening right now this is you know information that I know internally is that like there's some people that are kind of looking at the set of metadata for validators and there's a lot of metadata you can look at deposit addresses you can look at withdrawal addresses you can look at fee recipients you can look at IP addresses you can look at correlated failures when did they go offline at the same time um you can look at so so it's a fairly simple resistant data set of like your most involved ethereum citizens exactly yes and then you can identify okay we know who Kraken is you know we know who coinbase is and we can just not give them an airdrop if the purpose of the airdrop is to airdrop to specific individuals that are running solo validators that's a cool incentive uh possible incentive hypothetical incentive to sign off on and as we always say crypto pays you to learn about crypto maybe crypto can pay you in a way to learn how to to go through the some of the more difficult steps that uh Anthony was just talking about David you want to say something yeah and if anyone just had the gut reflex of this uh benefits whales who can afford 32 eth uh and above and not the people who are fractional stakers but would desire to be a solo Staker I'm wondering if something like opal and shared secret validator uh could actually solve for something like that where four people could come together with Aether each and count as a solo Staker that technology is not here yet uh but I think it's already on the corner because that is something that Anthony I know is tinkering with it was actually one of the answer I was looking for you to get to to say but yeah so I thought I reveal everything just yet but I've been leaking the alpha on my chart that that Dave technology is is live right now on on mainnet and and uh yeah I've been tinkering with it a lot and it is definitely a solution to that uh you know people can pull their ease together you know which means there's a solo Staker team solo staking basically yeah basically yeah Squad staking oh wow are we using that are we doing that I I like staking is a good meme yeah you heard it here first guys it's been a fantastic episode thanks for guiding us through chappella you can now withdraw your eth but why would you want to no no just put it back in see if you can and then put it back in just go through the pipeline once uh anyway guys this is very exciting for ethereum we're glad you're with us on Bank list we'll include some links in the show notes to a few of the things we reviewed gotta end like this as we always do none of this has been Financial advice it wasn't tax advice either despite what Anthony was getting into a little bit earlier don't get your tax advice from bankless at all eth is risky crypto is risky so is D5 you definitely lose your what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign
