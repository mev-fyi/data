hey guys david and ryan here from bank list we got something special for you today this is a weekend podcast we don't normally release it david what do we have planned for today oh this is my favorite my favorite day when bankless releases another podcast we have another podcast coming to the bankless ecosystem this one a little bit different because it actually won't be hosted by me or ryan we are bringing in carly riley who is delivering us a nft metaverse focused podcast called overpriced jpegs and this is going to be coming out on the bankless rss feed over the next few weekends or so but it also has its own rss feed that you need to subscribe to so wherever you listen to podcasts itunes overcast wherever you do it go type in overpriced jpegs there's also a link in the show notes to go subscribe to that rss feed we'll be releasing these dual both on the bank list feed and on uh carly's own overpriced jpegs feed but at some point we will stop releasing them on the bankless feed and will only be an overpriced jpegs feed uh really excited to bring carly on board here ryan tell us tell us a little bit about how we found carly yeah so so two things i guess i want to say you know first before we talk about how how we found carly is uh you know number one i feel like the space needs this podcast okay because we are moving into a world where digital objects in the metaverse is going to become increasingly important and the mainstream still doesn't know why an nft should cost more than your house right they're still just trying to get their mind wrapped around digital scarcity so i think carly's gonna tap into all of that energy and figure this out for us and uh bring you along her journey as you've listened to david and my journey into kind of this whole crypto landscape she's going to do that for uh for nfds and for jpegs and for the metaverse and for collectibles so that's really cool but in terms of how we met carly actually funny story david you met her before i did um but i met her earlier this year i was invited to speak on andrew yang's podcast yang speaks and carly was one of the co-hosts of yang speaks and um talked about crypto during that episode and i was like blown away by the questions carly was asking me because she hadn't gone fully down the crypto rabbit hole but she had like dabbled in it at that point in time so like she was asking questions about monero and like privacy coins what did i think about wealth just like really informed questions apparently after that episode she just took a deep dive into crypto like she got killed she got pilled she would i look i can't take you know credit full credit for this of course but like i think she did start listening to some bankless episodes after that and um the community just sucked her in as it has sucked all of us in so she is fully down the crypto rabbit hole she was formerly a um a uh the financial advisor for andrew yang's campaign like played a pivotal role in helping get that campaign off the ground that grassroots movement and now she's applying these talents and skills to crypto she's all in crypto it's her full-time job now and so when we heard that um there was an opportunity to work with her from a podcast perspective like this is the type of talent i want to bet the farm on uh because i think you guys are really going to enjoy her journey the experience she has the interviews she's coming out with but david i left a hole for you to fill in when did you first meet carly yeah you hinted that uh carly was the campaign finance advisor for andrew yang well i met carly while volunteering for the andrew yang campaign in seattle right she actually didn't remember me because like she goes around the nation and meeting all the volunteers uh but i remember her and then when we were talking to her on on zoom i was like oh yeah carly we've actually uh met before at gasworks park in seattle so having these people like small world but also there's a certain amount of values that uh crypto attracts people in towards and we definitely see those values in carly and i'm really excited to see the overpriced jpegs podcast blossom into hopefully what becomes the best nft metaverse podcast that is around yeah it's going to be awesome so make sure you do what david said go subscribe to the rss feed right now it's a different rss feed than the bankless rss feed so you could type in overpriced jpegs in your podcast player or click the link in your show notes this will also be published as a video on bankless youtube for now as well so with that let's get to the podcast this is overpriced jpegs with carly riley [Music] welcome to the inaugural episode of overpriced jpegs by the bankless network my name is carly riley and this is the show where i interview the folks shaping the future of nfts and the metaverse so y'all can decide for yourselves whether or not they're just overpriced jpegs and on this very first episode i am interviewing betty nft betty is the co-creator and the community lead for the project dead fellas i really wanted to interview betty because i think of dead fellas as a project that has done very well the floor price has steadily risen over the just a few months that the project has been in existence and they have a really robust community but i wanted to better understand and evaluate for myself whether or not i thought the team behind the project really had the capacity to make this something that could last for the long term you'll find this is a continuing theme for me is what projects will really have staying power in this space so i'll leave it to you to evaluate for yourself what you think of betty and the team behind dead fellas um but i hope you get something out of it i think if you were thinking about buying a dead fella or you are new to this space and evaluating the projects that are out there this is a must listen it gives you a really good sense into who betty is and how she thinks about this space and at the very end of the episode she gives us some insight into what artists she likes and what nft projects she's buying so you might get a little alpha on the side as always please stay super safe in this space do not do not do not spend money you can't afford to lose we are in the wild west there's a lot of speculation happening and you never want to be in a position where you can't pay rent because you aped into a project that went down for whatever reason so with that warning out of the way thank you all so so much for listening and enjoy this very first episode everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get

know everyone in this space based on their discord and or twitter handle it is so nice to have you on the the show thank you so much for making the time i know your schedule is bonkers especially this week leading up to halloween yeah thanks um it's actually nice to be doing something other than um sitting in my office doing that i i'm having so much fun but i've moved my laptop to a different room for a different wow wow big walk of the day from the office to the living room love it love that yeah um well awesome well i i would love to kick off with you telling a little bit about your story and how you ended up you know managing a i guess multi-million dollar brand over the span of what i imagine is a few months so why don't you tell people a little bit about who you are and your pro your story uh yeah thank you so when you put it like that is that it's very crazy um it's been a very wild very wild journey to be on um but it started years and years ago so i've always been creative um my husband psych who is the artist on the project and the co-founder has also always been creative um he's been a digital artist forever and i've been a creative producer forever we've um we spend our whole lives focusing on making really cool innovative things um but up until now that's been in a very corporate setting so we have run um agencies we recently have shifted from the agency actually but we've spent years making animations and infographics and video games and all kinds of things um for the biggest brands in the world but it's been um basically under the radar because we it's you know when when it's for that sort of brand on that level you can't always put it on your portfolio you can't always talk about it um and it's been fun but it hasn't offered the creative freedom that this space has and up until now it's been um quite stifling i think any creative that's in that sort of work would understand that to a point you know you get reined in and when did you first learn about nfts and how um so psych we were actually in a really bad spot it's it's it's a funny thing i think that things kind of explode when you're in the worst circumstances so we have been um through a lot of different things there was uh bushfires and um that you know the pandemic and um we had suffered financially quite quite substantially because of all of those things and um at the start of the year uh psych had reconnected with his art collective that he's been in connection with for many years and working with for many many years depth core i think they're like 20 years old now say that name again depth core depth like d-e-p-t-h core yeah yeah it has some of the original digital artists in the space they're really um the ones that paved the way for the movement now i feel in many ways um and it's really cool because a lot of them are in nfts now and they did a drop recently and it's just it's really awesome to see that um happen but yeah um some of the depth core people reached out to psych and they were like hey you should get involved in nfts it's this really amazing thing and um psych immediately launched into it like no questions thought it was the best thing ever and explained it to me and for me it was like a door opening and like you know when that stereo like cliche moment where it's like oh you know like the sun shines in and the skies part yeah like the solution and i was like oh my god this is it and i got so excited i grabbed him screamed i think he was very um taken aback like what the hell why did it strike you so immediately like that because there's plenty of people in the world right who are still very skeptical of nfts what was it about you that or about you know your background or the way it was explained that was just an automatic click so for me the way i work and the way i've always worked is through a lens of wanting to innovate and wanting to build new things past what we already conceive as possible and so for nfts it's a step in that direction i feel um the decentralized aspect of it is really attractive to me i feel like the systems that we've got going um up until this point are you know only beneficial to a certain few and not conducive to a healthy future for anyone and so for me it was you know combining that combining decentralized finance combining blockchain and the empowerment of artists there was all of these different aspects that just seemed to amalgamate in this amazing technology that i was like oh my god we have access to this like we can do this did you immediately recognize the freedom piece like describing how stifled you felt in agency work for lack of better term or working for corporations did you immediately see that this was the kind of opposite of that or had the opportunity to be the opposite of that yes immediately right away because um so using seikon as an example like his work is um just amazing and he has had to create under a pseudonym forever because anyone that found him in a corporate setting would be immediately confused and put off you know unable to separate that style from what we would produce in a corporate setting so it's like you break out from that and make your own rules and there are no rules and you know you're only limited by your own imagination and how far you're willing to push your art and your tech you know the use of the tech that you um utilize to to bring that forward so for me it was just like this opportunity where we can really run like i feel so free because i'm able to utilize what i'm good at on something that i'm really passionate about and you know we're calling the shots and it's really awesome like every single meeting i know we live together so it's weird to like say it if we haven't said it already you guys are married yeah we're married married with three children so yeah it's it's weird to pose our conversations as meetings but we do have to kind of sometimes um separate our conversations into meetings um it's really invigorating because it's like is this possible we'll throw ideas around and you know he'll be like i don't know let's just try and i love it we just throw ourselves into things and see if it works and everything that we have tried so far has worked so yeah it's very very amazing and so talk me through i want to talk about the timeline here for people and and dig into sort of the project and what what you guys have been doing with it some of the experimenting you've done um when when did you launch uh we launched on friday the 13th of august it was a very intentional date so um friday the 13th obviously is the spooky day everyone knows it is that 13 people think he's unlucky it's actually not 13 um is the number of the divine feminine it represents the amount of moon cycles in the year and oh wow yeah friday is uh for freya's day it was like a day for reverence of women so um i've always really liked friday the 13th um anyway i have 13 tattooed on me we got married on the 13th and so yeah it just fit in with the theme of what we were going for um and it did really really light a fire under everyone um because it was like we really had to get things ready for for friday the 13th and you know at one point the developers came back and they were like is it okay if we push to the 14th i was like absolutely not this has been set intentionally we will not be changing anything the phases of and how much time at that point had you spent in the space like what was the what was the period of time between okay you've heard about this thing called an nft we're now launching this project on august 7th um so psych had been involved since about january and had been releasing um different things through different projects um just as himself so like he had done artwork for a few of the different crypto voxels exhibits i don't know if you heard of the 41561 and they had the rare pepe one he did all of the branding and everything for those and then um his drops with depth core i need some of his own stuff so just kind of experimenting in that and i was just lurking pretty heavily because i was nervous to engage to be quite honest like i was obsessed with it and i was on the discords and i was like you know watching people talk and like i was really in obs in observation mode for quite a long time because i felt the um the crypto bro type thing that was underlying a little bit was a bit intimidating for me i wasn't sure how it would be received um how did you feel you were received once you you sort of found your voice and started speaking out immediately amazing amazing yeah it's been really i mean that's the lesson it might seem intimidating but just go do it it's actually an incredibly loving space as far as i found it is it's welcoming and it's progressive and but again i'm conscious of saying that as you know a white woman in the space as well a white cisgendered woman because there's a lot of people that have a different experience to me because of their identities and that's fine uh for me to say that but i can't speak for everyone you know i do think part of the beauty of this space is the anonymity anonymity piece though right is that you could engage with an avatar and a pseudonym and nobody has to know parts of your identity and you can be yourself without having to be i think so those features known necessarily to you know ease your way in so to speak yeah i think so too so there was a a you know a whole kerfuffle went on a few months ago with a project that turned out to be not who they say lady squad is that what we're yeah oh we're dropping the bomb okay saying it i thought like people don't know [Laughter] it's a beautiful thing how that's turned around um but the the thing that was annoying me at the time when that happened was all of these screams for um the doxing of project leaders and i was defending the anonymity of people because it's like you know a lot of us find safety in the anonymity um there are a lot of people that might not feel safe to to be themselves in this sort of space and i think that we need to respect that yep it feels like in that case if you're putting your identity front and center as like a marketing a marketing ploy right like there was sort of a real push with fame lady squad of like we're the first fully female team or something that felt core to the messaging that's when i can understand being like okay well then you know maybe we have a right to to know if you're actually women right but but if you know aside from that i think teams absolutely have the right to to their anonymity if they want it um circling back to that moment okay friday the 13th in august you're launching your your project for context for folks who maybe don't know we should maybe say dead fellas are they zombies they're they're like they're a spooky sort of looking character so it dovetails very well with friday the 13th from the spooky thinking of it and it and it dovetails with halloween which is coming up um what was the initial mint price when when you launched it was .025 um we did that because we wanted it to be accessible again i'm conscious of using the that word because you know accessibility is very different across um different people but as far as nfts go we wanted to be a pretty um easy entry point uh so yeah and so when i looked recently the floor was i think at 0.7.6 i know we were in a little bit of a bear market right now right recently it was it was as high as an east for the floor for for dead fellas that's awesome right like that's a huge jump to make as a project in the the span of the few months essentially that you've been doing this what would you attribute that success to if you could summarize it in you know a couple words or sentences um so i feel that personally and i don't know i don't care about the floor and don't take that the wrong way i feel like as we move the value of what we bring with dead fellas is inevitable and and grows exponentially as we move forward and so it makes complete sense that the market would move with that so is what i hear you saying that you have a long term you have a long-term orientation with this project yes i feel like the space is full of this beautiful um meshing of different worlds so we've got the the people that are in here for the art we've got the people that are in here day trading um i can't focus on the day traders because it isn't something that is going to build the brand and build the sustainability and the longevity for us so the value for me is constantly building and constantly working and over time having that that gradual growth that you know the pump and dump thing is is not for me we haven't done any influence of marketing we haven't done any um paid advertising or anything like that up until obviously this point we've got times square that was that was paid guys new class yeah it costs a lot of money but it's cool um but yeah the the whole vision for us is to build a brand that is in here forever we we want to be um you know leaders in this innovative space and bringing new technology and new experiences and opportunities to our holders and keep exploring things um under the brand just to see what's possible and it's so far we're doing really amazing things and it's kind of mind-blowing and doesn't feel real still it's hard to get used to so talk to me about some of the innovations and amazing things that you've done up this point so again in the last like three months we're talking about here it moves it's not that much time in the long term and then it feels like so much can happen in this space in three months so um i have a list of some of the cool community initiatives and things that i think you've done but would love to hear from you what stands out to you is like that was innovative we're so excited we did that it worked so well or didn't work whatever i think it goes back to the start of the project the very start of the project um we didn't focus on trying to build numbers very quickly because i knew that it was going to blow up straight away so i was very careful because we wanted to avoid gas wars and all that sort of thing so we had coded games into our discord server for our community to connect on a different level and they formed relationships really quickly which is it brought value to people immediately and then we were the first ones or one of the first ones to have the pre-sale thing happen um i don't know anybody that's done a pre-sale that has completely absorbed gas fees either that's what we did we had um so you launched you had people who were on your pre-sale list so they had like a 24-hour period to mint or something without fear of gas wars and then you also said you would cover the cost of gas for them no what happened was it was uh it was it was a huge undertaking and honestly if we had time to create something better i think other projects have managed to build on that and make something that that works more efficiently for them but what we did was we just had a google form where people would put their wallet address and um you know their twitter handle and their discord uh name they they could reserve up to five um and then they would just transfer the the east without the gas or anything uh for the you know all that sort of stuff straight to us to a specific wallet and then we just went through and transferred all of the tokens directly to them we had oh wow we served i think it was 1300 tokens um initially and yeah psych had to do do that one by one uh which took so long and it and it turned into a meme as everything doesn't happen everything does yeah yeah and now that name is an nft and it's selling for 100 euthanasia yeah that was a that was the first thing and i think that everyone appreciated that because it was um you know we saved a lot of people a lot of money and gas and you know people that would not have survived gas wars managed to get in and get five and um it's really changed people's uh lives really at that point like you know we've had such a jump in value so yeah and let me ask you when you said you knew this would blow up you were like i you know i was just trying to do right by my community and and but you knew this would would be very successful how and why did you know that uh because it's just what i do i build brands and i build communities and we've done it professionally um you know on a global level for many years and so being able to do that with creative freedom um without time constraints and to our own um limitations i just knew it was going to work we as soon as we made this like i saw the design in my head i knew what i was going to call it um i know you know we knew the stories everything rolled so quickly when we started to talk about it we sat at the computer and um psych did some mock-ups and it only took us i think it was about two hours to get to the um the main you know what you see as a dead fella like the the main thing and i just knew i was like this is amazing i love this so much and i think that that is the important thing and the thing to take away is if you see something that you love and you see that there is a niche for it and no one else is doing that it's gonna work and how much was your confidence at least that in the short term it could succeed which i know is not your orientation which i love related to also having this community of fellow nft artists that you were plugged into um that was really important and i think has been a big driver in in what we've been doing and the value that we have is the focus on art psych's an artist um and it was it was the first thing we created was the art like that was the first thing and then we built everything around the art um it is important to both of us and it's something that i look for in projects i won't buy a project unless i don't like the art um we respect the i guess the industry for what it's bringing to us is because it's changing our lives we're artists i want to empower other artists like it's the whole thing people that we respect in this space um have really paved the way like people like lorona and like mark the habibi and those people and ghosts you know those people have really turned the industry into what it is and so it's like a great honor for us um to receive respect from them and to be able to work from them now like that's an amazing thing to me i get a lot of questions and i'm guessing you get even more than i do about artists who are saying hey where do i start you know i i see the opportunity in this space but i don't really understand how to capture it what is your what are your what is your advice to just starting out artists who are trying to break into this space it sounds so cliche um so i apologize but it's true you just need to be yourself and you need to do what you like what you love what you good at um you don't need to worry about sticking to what you think people will buy i think that's why people fall is trying to commercialize you're not in a commercialized space you're not commercializing yourself you're putting your artwork out there um for other people to appreciate if they appreciate it and you know many people will and i think there's another level of connection to the pieces because of the community aspect of the space so you know when you're creating those friendships engaging with people that like the same things as you you're forming that um that mutual admiration you're likely to support people that you have relationships with they're going to support you back and things snowball from there um and we're in that build space that build mode at the moment i think as a community in general an nft community in general as that grows i don't know what that's going to look like but for now it's like a little insular economy in itself like an ecosystem and i think really just yeah leveraging that for not just to sell artwork obviously because you come away with real friendships and real connection which is something i think people really want especially now after you know the state of the world at the moment it's just it seems like a very hopeful thing for a lot of people so just don't be scared and just do it i want to talk more about the ecosystem in general and and where you see dead fellas within that ecosystem because i think there are different cohorts within nfts and but before i get there i want to ask you talked about kind of lurking in these discord channels for for months and psych obviously you know doing his own form of sort of market research for a few months before actually launching something do you think that's necessary or or how would you value that or would you recommend that to somebody who's starting out and wants to jump in this space yeah i actually would and while while i think just do things when you want to do them just launch into them don't be frightened at the same time it did really benefit me because i got to learn from the space i don't think i would have had as deep an understanding of how things work and how to run my own project had i not had that time um to really just sit back and listen and learn um because at the end of the day the innovative the innovators are the people that have preceded you um and while you don't need to copy off what other people are doing because we're not we're doing our own thing at the same time there's many lessons to be learned and especially with a space that's so new um it is just having that that humble attitude like you know i do have a lot to learn and there is a lot here for me to absorb so spending time listening and learning is is always going to be beneficial i think yeah looking at the ecosystem in general do you have first of all do you pay attention at this point to other projects that are launching and the space sort of in the macro sense or are you very heads down just like i'm focused on dead fellas and building this brand and that's where your attention is where what's your balance on on that the macro and the micro i think any creator will tell you uh in the nft space that as much as you're focused on your own project uh i am very heavily into nfts um on a large scale so i will spend time um regardless of how busy i am looking for new artists going through different um you know those like shell threads people might not think that they i i actually do go through those um and i'll go through like my illustrator friends and like see who's reposting what and i searched like recently bought on open c just to have a look at what's going on i think it's very very smart to have an understanding of the market that you're working in at all times um so it would be detrimental to just completely have your head down and not not be focused on what else is going on so i want to dive in more on that and and see if you'll give us any alpha on what you're tracking or what you like but before i do i want to ask do you have mental models in your head for like where you see dead fellas in the market or hey there's pfp projects there's art projects there's like do you have anything where you kind of create categories in your head for these projects or other do you see dead fellas in a cohort i think of dead fellas and crypto geishas for some reason in my head i don't know if i learned about them at a similar time but i i think of them as sort of being a cohort is that all me or or do you have some sort of map in your head of where dead fellas lives and the market in general um yeah i think there is a spectrum of uh of the type of projects that exist in the space but i think that that is limitless because you know everyone is self-determined in their own identity of what they're putting out so you've got projects i think people put too much pressure on artists to have roadmaps you should not need a roadmap to release an nft project if what you're doing is just art and that's all you want to do because at the end of the day that's what you're doing there shouldn't be this expectation of anything else for us that is what we want to do we do want a road map we do want to um push into different industries and have dead fellas in different contexts so for us that is a focus um i see us and we're we're obvious we're put together in with projects such as um cool cats robotos and creatures that's another one that i think of for you as and it's not just the art because i think the art is uh you know of a similar vein um across all of those projects in terms of its 2d illustration um but i think the vibe of the communities are very similar as well and so it attracts similar sorts of um consumers i guess for once for better word um so yeah there is a beautiful crossover between all of those communities and that mutual respect between them is a very nice thing too so yeah it kind of feels like having houses in school you know when you're in different [Music] that's an australian thing i think i don't that's not right or hogwarts a that's a magical wizard thing as far as i don't know but yes hogwarts exactly like that sorry which house is dead fellas in in harry potter look i'm going to say slytherin guys i mean it's green i feel like i feel like that's true yeah i don't know this is this is taking a turn but i feel that slytherin if we're gonna if we're gonna delve into that i feel like slytherin uh not necessarily the bad guys i feel they're the edgy cool guys and i feel we're the edgy cool guys so i think it is important for anybody who might buy a dead fellas dead fella dead fellas to understand which house you think they belong in so i think we've gotten some critical insight here that's on juno is your new crypto enabled financial services company on juno lets you get your direct deposit paycheck paid to

apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io um would i be right in saying that the big picture goal for dead fellas and you might be like no but is to build ip right and to build a brand that crosses fashion and music and you know film or or any combination of the few or tell me if you're like no we're only focused on one thing but is that sort of roughly what you would say big picture you're you're shooting for yeah that's exactly it um and not only that we want to empower the holders to utilize their ip to explore those avenues as well so that is going to be a focus um we want you to hold dead fellas and have uh you know not just the art or the community but like experiences and opportunities so like we've developed the first thing we did basically as soon as we sold out was buy a large plot in decentraland which people were like why are you doing that why not sandbox why not this why aren't you gonna do that again we just don't we're not focused on what other people are doing we do like sandbox and we are moving into sandbox too but the point is we want kind of to investigate different areas that make sense for us so decentralized is just this amazing we've built this huge city um just for dead fellas holders it's got a club it's got it's it will have playable games in there it's got um we'll have stores and galleries and there's an eight-story mansion and just loads of cool things the first thing we've got this weekend for halloween in there is a token gated event um exhibiting all of the um collaborations that we've got going across with you know many creators in the nft space well-loved ones did i see steve aoki was going to be a guest performer yeah babes he did steve aoki yeah so we made steve aoki into a dead fella as well and he is going to be playing uh exclusively for dead fellas holders and aoki nft holders um from halloween till the i think it's the fourth uh just on a loop so like those token holders can just go in there and just party so what's the pitch to steve was he already a dead fellas fan or how did that come out come to be or when you're talking to these collabs yeah yeah their team their team knew about us and we're fans i think it's um everything that's happened so far comes from uh i'm relentless in what i do like and i know i'm good at what i do so i think that i'm able to get what i feel is the value that we bring across to people quite easily um but also people that have received that value talk to each other right so we have i'll be speaking to someone and then they'll be friends with someone else and then they'll be friends with someone else and that's just how things go it's all about networking and building relationships and i will say that the relationships that i've built so far from this are extremely valuable and i hold um very closely i'm very very grateful um to be able to to work with people i've admired for so long like we were in the discord a few weeks ago and like keith from time magazine came in onto the voice chat just to hang out yes and keith is an amazing person and i think someone that represents that bridging of um you know old industry and and media into this beautiful new innovative space and pushing and leading the way for those people to to follow um is there a uh time collaboration in the future all uh cool cats or can you share is that alpha we can know he's gonna be quiet on that one okay plead the fifth [Laughter] when you're thinking about brand building are you do you think metaverse versus physical like are you saying hey we're gonna put more chips on building a brand for the metaverse or we're gonna put more chips on building a brand for the physical no i see it as a collaboration of both a combination of both um which is why we're in new york on billboards i think that that is bringing those worlds together um and you know how you see like the poep uh treasure hunt that's going on in new york for nfc nyc that is a beautiful combination of those worlds because you you all of a sudden bringing it to the real world um so yeah i see it as both i see like fashion that you can buy from a store or an online store but then you get the nft of that of that collectible item that you you can also wear in real life and also in the metaverse i think there's so many opportunities that we haven't um explored uh along those lines that it's exciting and we're gonna focus on both at the same time and i meant to ask this earlier what is precisely the ownership licensing agreement with dead fellas holders i think this is a broader question that every project needs to answer what rights if i own a dead fellow what what can i do with it um anything you want really anything you want so it's more in the like cryptos category than yes v friends is very clearly like hey this is you own this nft representation but you can't you can't really do anything else with it yeah i think um we are in between probably v friends and and cryptos i think what gremlin has done with cryptos is genius and absolutely groundbreaking and uh we very much respect gremlin um psyches knew him before the the project and it's like um seeing that really run has been a really cool thing um i think that for us it's more we are in the overarching brand and the you know the logo and the name and and that sort of thing but uh each individual holder owns the ip to their own token to be able to utilize to like we've had people release um derivatives songs um what else their own like little nft line of of different variations of their fella but i mean the options there are also very limitless so we have had our legal team um draw up a guide on how people can use their ip so that's going to be on the website um i think this weekend actually because it's by the time it'll probably be there so if i i could take my dead fella and put it on a t-shirt and make 100 000 off of it and you would say great we love it right that like go monetize that that's the other thing that i think you see is you can monetize up to a certain level right or you know like as long as you're not making more than 50k or 100k um but y'all are like go go forth and prosper i think that uh really it only strengthens our brand you know i think the actually um punk 4156 and also david horvath have really refreshing um opinions on this and i've listened to david and punk4156 speak on this at length um in the way that derivatives and other people using your ip to create things really does strengthen a brand in ways that transcend the way that things have been done typically and it's um again that old world way of thinking and doing is is quite stifling and i think that releasing that not i'm not suggesting that all people do it because you know especially artists you are in your art like you don't have to give that to anyone to increase value to anyone else but it's a cool thing to be able to explore and something that we're quite enjoying and and you definitely are a project that i think of as having a really awesome community and you empower them as you're describing and and i'm sure that's a piece of it and you've also done a lot of you've put a lot of time into your community i think you mentioned like the survival games piece is if that was the game that you were you you had as part of launch and the billboard you know that's up in in times square and i mean you just did an art contest that i think i saw had like nearly 800 submissions like you have this really engaged and active community which is amazing and i think has obviously contributed to the success you've had so far how do you balance and do you see it as a balance i would call it short-term community engagement activities with long-term brand building so we treat them as two different streams and focus on them at the same time but um in separate ways so you know many people will start with their roadmap um and it's something that i would suggest people if you you know if you're building a roadmap don't promise the world and you know have these lofty ideas don't especially you know video games and things like that it takes so long to build something of value but something that you can bring immediately is is community for people so for us it has been important to focus on those activities because it's bringing it's brought people together and people have real relationships so while i focus on that we'll plan the community activities based on what we think will bring the most value for people socially um we'll you know we'll have flight incentives so you can win nfts and and those sorts of things um something that we did in the survival game when we first launched was if you won twice you had to give your nft your second win to someone else that was trying to win do you want to describe to folks what the survival game is briefly for for people who don't know it was a really basic um a really basic game within the discord server psych just coded it was like you put in a basic command and then you are you either die a funny death or you survive with an nft so that and the deaths were like all zombie related and and submitted by the people in the discord as well so we had a channel where people could suggest different hilarious things and um we would load them into the game and um so just i think honestly people just want to be heard and people just want to feel a part of something me included and so i'll you know those sorts of activities together do bring value as as small as they are and in comparison to you know building a a metaverse city or having steve aoki play for our holders or getting a billboard and putting our holders up on a billboard like those are big things but uh it's not day to day so bringing that day to day value is super important i think for projects and having holders that are able to access the founders to some extent is also important like people know who i am and they know what i'm like like you know they know my sense of humor and they know different things that i do in the day and the same with psych and it's important i think to have that connection because we're not a normal brand we're an nft brand which is completely new and different so leaning into doing things differently that way that's a really interesting point it was actually a question i had that you've sort of preemptively answered though i don't think i was going to get to it anyway so it's great which was i think you you are a founder who's incredibly active in your own discord and um there are plenty of other projects like that and then there are projects where where it's less like that i was curious sort of how much emphasis you placed on giving people access to the founders and it sounds like you think that's actually pretty integral to the success you've had and will have going forward i think so definitely yeah um i think that if you don't communicate communication is key in projects i think if you don't communicate things will fall apart very very quickly because people are not um they're not you there's so many people that are not used to this space that don't understand uh crypto markets so i don't understand um smart contracts or how peop you know there are people that do and there are people that don't there are young people there are people that are new to nfts so you need to really just take responsibility for your community and guide them um by having solid mods and by being available where you can um obviously with boundaries there has to be boundaries but yeah i think it's definitely been integral to what we've seen um in terms of success so looking ahead uh for dead fellas i'm sure you have a lot of that long-term brand building you know that that work stream you're working on and have a bunch on the horizon anything you can share anything coming up that that's on the brand building side that uh i can pull out of you um well we have the road map 2.0 being released on halloween um that's exciting exciting it is exciting i like that you launched on friday the 13th presumably with your initial road map and then halloween you have your second road map so we'll know whenever there's a next friday the 13th that we'll get more info i think it's next may so maybe um yeah uh we're basically just gonna now i think what we've done is we've built our foundation and we have a very strong solid foundation we have a strong community and we have been able to build out our infrastructure that we need to explore so we've got our city in decentraland we've got um you know our 3d team turning all of our dead fellas into 3d avatars like completely rigged and we have all of these things so into the next year uh we're just going to be focused on exploring those empowering our holders even more pushing into different um industries as well you know everything you can think of in terms of media so music gaming um tv everything fashion like we we we're extending into all of them in aligned ways is how big is your team right now oh i couldn't say honestly it's gone it's grown incredibly so obviously it was just me and psych at first we got a couple of mods um that we trusted very very much and have known since the time we've been in the space i think that is obviously very imperative as we know from recent events you need mods you can trust um and we've expanded as we've needed to so we've got lots of developers now on the decentral land we've got our um core developer team so king maker um and nine who were both at part of our launch and very integral to how smooth the launch was i'm very grateful to have those we've got dan petty joined us as our web design lead and that's also been fantastic he's worked at the same level as us and is an absolute legend in his own right so we've managed to grab people like that and pull them into the team uh copywriters and project managers and social media managers and you need you really do need to delegate otherwise you'll go insane yeah and as it is with even with all that i get the sense you're not sleeping much so no we're not halloween no halloween is uh yeah a big time yeah we're basically working 24 hours at the moment i will say that people often will um assume that once a launch is finished that the hard work is over it is not the hard work has starts started launch like yeah however much work you think you've done prior to launch times it by like 100. it's yeah well i think that's a that's another good piece of advice for artists who want to launch it's like please buckle up and know what you're getting into because i i i've seen that happen i know that there are times we're like all right we got it to launch and then it's like now is when all the expectations from the community begin now you have 4 000 people yelling at you on a server you've got to be careful as well because if you make all of these promises to people prior to launch and then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation where you're like oh my god i've got to deliver you know don't make those promises just build quietly and i think under promise and over deliver is a a solid way to be a good mantra okay well i know how busy you are so i don't want to take up too much more of your time but i do want to wrap with some of uh your some of the projects you are watching outside of dead fellas what what do you look for when you're scrolling through those shill feeds on twitter what are you looking for what catches your eye if you can name drop any projects you like would love to hear it but yeah it's always art first so i'll always look for art um first anything that catches my eye um i'm actually i'll go two ways so the first the first thing that i'll do is um my friends so you know like marker baby has just released um has generated her babies and i'm a huge fan of them not just because i'm friends with mark but because i i just love them um we'll link to it yeah yeah um they're they're very beautiful i'm just going to my wallet and see what i've bought recently i bought ethereals recently because i like that project too yeah yeah it's it's not something that i had noticed immediately and then bobby hundreds got me on the um on this twitter spaces with their team and they are amazing an amazing team and that is something that's an example of when you know the team and you looking you're researching the founders and you understand um you know what the whys and wheres of the project often then you'll see the value not that i didn't see the value before i just wasn't aware because i you know i hadn't seen it yet but um i think i saw ethereals dipped recently i mean a lot of these projects are so that's been on my like watch list of like oh i want to go in and buy but then gas has been so high i've been like well it's been offsetting the the dips i wanted to buy yeah i think um it's the market on on as a whole has dipped but then the the gas has been an absolute nightmare isn't it um ghosts i love ghosts i love toy faces these are not um generated projects but um you know i love them um what else obviously i love cool cats but that's not very accessible for um people just joining the space at the moment i buy a lot of one-of-ones i really enjoy uh one-of-one art so i'll i'll often buy one of ones my favorite artist at the moment is nook he's been my favorite artist for a long time um yeah do you ever have like do you ever do you have any of the frames where you like physically hang them in your house at this point or is it it's stayed in its in the digital world so we've been renting for so long and we're not allowed to hang out work up but i've had physical yeah it's a nightmare uh we'll hopefully get out of that situation um next year but um i've had lots of uh physical art sent to me through buying nfts so um flower blocks um is a really beautiful project and um he has sent me um physicals uh uu cyber uu beautiful beautiful artwork sent me um physical pieces amy woodward is an incredible photographer and uh she's send me physical pieces as well um i love lorona's boys i don't know there's loads there's loads of different things well we'll link to all the projects you mentioned so that folks can go explore and check it out i think for especially for people who are just starting to get into the space it's really helpful to hear from folks like what they're tracking and then you can go follow those artists on twitter like that's how you start to get kind of ingratiated in this world and and start to follow what's going on well following what artists are doing is definitely a very smart move yeah definitely okay last question mindy kaling i saw she she tweeted about nfts i thought you responded have you talked to mindy kaling yet do you know what you would know if i had talked to mindy kaling because i would be like three or four you would know yeah the world would know i would have tweeted about it in the most you don't even write so here's the thing i didn't realize what a fangirl i was about people until now because when people are interacting with what i've created or interacting with me directly and they're people that i have been obsessed with for years and like freaking out like speaking to reese witherspoon like i spoke to elle woods on twitter spaces it's insane yes and like [ __ ] riot like i engaged with [ __ ] riot like the [ __ ] riot that is crazy to me so being able to um interact with heroes is very cool part of this whole thing and yeah mindy if you're listening let's be friends yeah coming out with us we're really fun we talk about nfts all the time i've now asserted myself into this friendship you're establishing betty with mindy yeah yeah no i i get it well awesome well i can't wait for the day that you do get to talk to mindy and then we'll hear all about it on twitter and uh and it this was so fun i so appreciate you taking the time out during this especially busy week for you all i hope folks really learned something about dead fellas i i i think you're amazing and i will go double down on my my dead fellow's conviction and uh and yeah i i hope you have a great rest of your week we'll be watching what happens on halloween though this will probably air after that thank you so much thanks yeah it's been nice chatting
