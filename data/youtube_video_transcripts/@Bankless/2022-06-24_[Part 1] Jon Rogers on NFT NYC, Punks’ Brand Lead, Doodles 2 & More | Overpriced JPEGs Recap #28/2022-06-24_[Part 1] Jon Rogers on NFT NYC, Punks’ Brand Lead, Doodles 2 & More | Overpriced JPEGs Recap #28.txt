you here if not next year [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs we are doing our weekly recap episode today here from nftnyc and i am joined by the wonderful john rogers who i feel like at this point i mention in like every episode because he uh he is behind all of my greatest insights in this space and so he's joining me today to uh to weekly recap with me zenika could not be with us because he is sick with kovid sending lots of healthy thoughts to zenika john thank you so much for being here no thank you for having me gm and i hope seneca gets better soon and um i offered to bring him soup but he did not take me up on the offer um okay we are going to get into observations about nfc nyc stuff going on with yuga labs with doodles ape fest

nyc in a minute but uh just like macro what's happening in the market how are you feeling during the bear market john we haven't actually spoken on the podcast since everything went down yeah you know i um i i appreciate that there's a lot of people hurting out there and yeah it's so i know it's a tough time for a lot of people i i'm actually one of the if there's anything good to come out of this market it's that it's a great time to build um and so i'm excited about the opportunity that it's you know some scammy projects are disappearing some shady defy stuff is kind of getting sorted out that in the market it's doing his job there so i'm i'm excited for what's to come in the opportunity to come in fact that's one of my observations of this week is there's so many mainstream media going to nft nyc saying why are you people still here like it's over isn't it and it's like no no this we're building this is now the time and so i'm very hopeful uh i personally am not exposed to cryptocurrency very very much at all so i've not felt the pain that a lot of others have felt and i've as i said before i've never sold an nft um i don't even know how um whatever i really don't whatever i buy i hold for the long term and i have never sold an nft so i'm you know any anything that's in my collection that's gone down in value i'm not realizing because that's i'm there for the long term are you buying anything i am i'm looking i'm shopping what are you shopping for i'm shopping for a little noun right now i'm excited um i'm just waiting for the right one you know i'm waiting for the right one to come up in the auction and whenever i see the right one i lose the auction so i either need to up my my bids or um just be patient but there's a lot of them coming so what's exciting to you about little nouns you know i've i i'm interested in playing around with cc0 um nfts i own a bony um which i really love my bony that probably is going to come off very poorly but uh so i i'm interested in what you mean yeah we just didn't play around cc zero a little bit and i i just i like like this idea that it's a very long-term project every 15 minutes ish a new one is minted i'm excited about that the other ones i'm shopping for are uh aku i want to get an aquitar maybe once i pay for some tuition bills later this summer i'll be in the market for an akitar and dead fellas i've been i've talked about dead fellas quite a bit and probably time that i joined the horde yeah that's that's awesome you know you and i both everyone who listens to this podcast with any regularity knows i'm a huge aku fan a guitar fan michael johnson fan all the rest of it um well very cool i'm i'm interested by the the little noun experiment too and for folks who maybe haven't been following it i'll give the the very quick tl dr you're probably familiar with nouns every day a new generative piece goes up for auction and that will be true in perpetuity every tenth noun goes to the founding team of nouns but nouns is a cc0 project and all of the the proceeds from the noun sales goes into a treasury i talked about this with with jake brockman who's the ceo of coinfund because he was bullish on nouns and now little nouns is like a derivative project also cc0 and it's it's the nouns just smaller as the name would suggest and instead of every day and a little noun going on auction it goes on auction every 15 20 minutes or so uh oh you know it's a little bit variable only because if you bid on a little noun in the last five minutes of the auction right it extends the auction if there's bidding in the last minute and the little nouns have been going for what like point four eighth or so typically about on the lower end 0.35 on the higher end about to one eighth for either particularly notable numbers like round numbers or um if someone is minted or one is generated automatically with unique traits um that are highly desirable those are going for higher end too little nouns is supported by or you know is um has the support of the nouns community is it every tenth little noun that goes to now essentially community every ninth and tenth so one will go into the little nouns treasury and then one goes into the noun i think it's an interesting experiment in like human coordination and treasury coordination i'm a little bit skeptical especially on the little announce front just because of this the supply that'll be created in this overtime it's just hard to imagine how it how it maintains value but you know i think about it more in the long term let's say let's fast forward seven years from now and let's assume what we all hope happens which is this billion wallets on the horizon that there's just a huge growth in nft use and and and fanship um the number that's being minted won't be that large in that context in fact a couple of things we can talk about today are two different announcements about quote millions of nfts for minting one from the doodles team and one from the hypermint team and if we get to that world where we're minting collections in the millions ten thousand little nouns is not going to be anything so that's that's why i mean for the long term it's i'm gonna get one i'm not gonna get five and i'm gonna just be a part of the community and see how it goes and i think that's smart i think tracking that community is smart you know the challenges since it does go on for forever there's never there's never uh like real pressure on the secondary it would feel like because folks can obviously always buy in a new if they if they so chose right the supply is infinite from that perspective but i get earlier numbers are more prestigious or there's certain traits that people want that come earlier and you know i i get that you can uh you can game it out that way and of course this is all coming at it from just like a purely like market perspective of like is it gonna go up in value i have been very impressed i will say by how incredibly well the nouns auctions have held up in terms of still i look and they go for 60 70 eats a day even higher yeah yeah yeah it's amazing maybe it's higher now i think at the the at one point sort of at the lowest point of the market i was looking at them and they were like 60 70 and i was like gosh that's that is amazing so yeah it's beyond the reach of my wallet but um yeah and that's one of the things i guess with little nouns it's a way to participate with nouns in an authorized uh collaborative way without having to open up a wallet with ade to buy one what i appreciate about appreciate about you and and you know it's funny to hear you'd be like yeah i really have very little crypto exposure i don't even know how to sell an nft and yet you're somebody who i think is one of the savviest people in the space like you are tracking everything that's going on you're sending me articles all the time about what's happening so you're this very interesting i feel like unicorn in the space which is you bring a really sharp smart like critical insight to it without really being like your normal dj you know just how we get along neither of us are like you're entirely typical djents really i look at we've got multiple communities within the nft community and you know one of them is coming more from the cryptocurrency world they're probably the really djn og crowd that and for them a lot of nfts aren't really about the value and the value accrual it's a it's a it's an investment in some ways acting as a security and there's this crowd that i think i'm more a part of which we're coming in later we're still early adopters so it's weird to say later but coming in at this point and it's more about the art and the storytelling and i'm not looking at it and a lot of people like me are probably not looking at it as it's a financial security for as an investment yes we'd like to see whatever we buy go up in value but it doesn't mean that that's the first and primary consideration and i think the main more mainstream buyers coming in like the call the masses when they start coming in they're going to be more probably my in why camp in background than they are from the financial side of things absolutely i i interviewed robbie ferguson yesterday who's the ceo of mutablex founder co-founder of immutablex and um we were chatting and one of the things that i said is like i i do look forward to the era of nfts and this will be the mainstream era i believe where their first and foremost point is not necessarily to to make you rich you know that like you buy them because you want access to a certain thing and and maybe they subsidize the experience for that because you do own an asset that maybe has some value but it may not even be value that's higher than the price you paid for it it's more just subsidizing your your membership to a group or subsidizing your ability to watch a piece of content or play a particular game and i think i think that's um we'll end up having that that mental shift from these are speculative assets that i should make a lot of money on and maybe that some version of that will always exist but really to um these are things that are getting the access that i want and an added benefit is that i get to own a digital work that i could sell and subsidize whatever experience i got what's uh gary vaynerchuk's restaurant that's opening uh fly fish club five fly fish club yeah so token gated access to experiences like clubs or absolutely yeah i had a just uh i know where you would move on in the agenda but i um it's the last week of school here in oregon which is why i'm not in new york because i can't my my daughter's young enough that she would still never forgive me if i left her the last week of school but someday a few years from now she'll want me to get the hell out of town which case i'll say but so we had a parent's kind of dinner at one of the houses um after the last day and one of the parents works in probably the boringest industry you can possibly imagine but they're beginning to look insurance i don't want to give it up because i might actually be partnering with them and this was the point of this industry is looking at how can they use nfts as part of business operations this isn't about selling to the public but about how do they transfer and coordinate the movement of goods and information using nfts and so it's it wouldn't be the sexy kind of art focused nfts but these would be business process nfts that yeah it's leveraging smart contracts for what they do well precisely and i i think that's that that's that's a great way of putting the shift that i was describing is really like abstracting the the what we think of as nfts from smart contract technology which is fundamentally like a human coordination technology and um an understanding that there's going to be really powerful use cases for that those smart contracts that's exciting well you'll have to come back on if you formally uh work with that and tell us more details about that but i love i love hearing those kinds of things nft nyc observations i i'm excited to get yours because you're not here which may sound funny to say that i'm excited to get yours but um i'm i'm curious what it looks like from from the outside looking in so hit me yeah i'll hit you up with the first bullet point in our agenda and uh the quote that i'll put is it's raining men uh so you're on the ground is that what i'm seeing on my on crypto twitter is it's all men it's um it's it's gotten a little bit better with gender ratios in the last since after the first day but what's your perspective you're on the ground there is it really the truth or is it more diverse i feel like i've become numb to it and i've worked in in fairly male dominated industries for for years now honestly and so yes of course it's dominant men um i've been to a couple events that i'm like wow this is even even worse than kind of usual though i think on the whole it's it's better to your point like there are i i kicked off monday to um with i was at we are web 3 which was a conference like a one day mini conference with nftnyc that was hosted by meta angels and it was i believe exclusively women non-binary folks and so it was um you know that was lovely to kind of kick off the whole week with with all women essentially and and then you go from that to the main conference and like yeah it's it's very dominated by men but again i almost feel like i it's only when i see somebody call it out that i like recognize it anew because i i just have gotten so used to these these spaces being this way i saw the funniest meme i saw about it and i will say i do think it like it just also plays well it's just like easy to make jokes about it on twitter so it's not it is very true but it also is just like it falls into stereotypes of what we think about kind of tech oriented communities yeah absolutely and i always have a mixed relationship to it because there's a piece of me that sometimes worry the more we like emphasize that publicly that that it it dissuades more women from joining the space so like anytime these kinds of conversations come up i always like to emphasize like i've had a lovely experience in this space you know and and have felt really like welcome and and a part of things you know being a woman so when look it's maybe slightly said on this podcast because if a woman is listening to this podcast they're probably already in the space but i like to signal that to people because i don't want women to be like hear all the jokes but how it's all men and be like well then i'm not going to join it's like no come in the water's water's lovely uh but my favorite meme about this all was um you know those like captcha things where it's like click all the boxes i saw that like fire trucks in it there was one that was like click all the boxes with women in it if none click skip or whatever and it was just a picture of an nfc nyc effect there were no women and it was it was quite funny i saw that i think someone should make a t-shirt of that yeah again not the signal i want to send to the rest of the world but yeah it's hilarious well it's good to hear and i i do think there's a greater theme of we need to we need to keep pushing for gender and racial uh diversity in the in the community it's only going to help and grow the grow make us stronger 100 100 and like what i love like these jokes are calling it out because i think most people on the space or maybe i just have tunnel vision and i only talk to the people who i think are reasonable who all agree with this is like like agree you know and and um i don't feel like there's actually that much pushback to that um and it's i don't know i'm sure in dark corners of twitter there are but i ignore those corners well the next thing i heard a lot about on my crypto twitter feed uh from remote cross country is is anyone going to the conference are they just going to parties i literally don't think so i know so many people who canceled their speeches at the conference and you know look these conferences take a lot of work to put on so credit to to the people who do it but i do think this was not the best organized conference in the in the sense that like 1500 speakers was too many you know it felt very like what is the point of having 1500 speakers and it did feel like it was because the organizers wanted 1500 people to be tweeting about how they were speaking at nyc to like get more money to like you know like it does start to feel a little bit like this is just strategically so they can make more money and not because it's actually what's best for the conference i love nftnyc because i live here right and so it's lovely for me to like get to go home at the end of the night and and i think it's really fun because it's new york city and so there's so many cool events happening but i haven't been to the conference all of the cool events that i've observed have all been the satellite events and the parties and the the stuff that's going on sort of outside of the conference i would be truly fascinated to know how many people actually have attended a conference i don't know if you haven't seen it it was just this morning we should probably say we're recording this on thursday morning um yeah supermassive tweeted out he was at one of the conference sessions and it was an empty ballroom there's like 10 people in this large ballroom and he's like why isn't anyone at the conference and it's it's a pretty so i mean i feel bad for the speakers who you know you're speaking to an empty room i've been in that position and it just sucks um and yeah and the organizers who probably brought those people in are it's just not great so i i think there's this overall theme coming out of this year about nftna seems to figure out what it wants to be is it it's a is it the place where there's going to be all these huge parties in which case that's great and communities come together and celebrate with each other um or is it a place for learning and sharing of information and there just needs to be some adjustments and it's young that that ship has sailed they've they can't say you do keep trucking no no keep going i want to hear about the ship assailed i know there's no turning this boat around first of all it's new york city so there's always gonna be the party element to it because it's new york city and so there's there's no decision here the organizers of nft nyc are no longer driving this ship right so they they do not get to suddenly decide that nfc nyc is like the place for like learning and and studious uh commentary on the space nfc nyc is for like crazy parties and madonna headlining stuff because she wants to come to new york so the crew is mute need and they're taking over that's correct that's correct new york has done what new york does and just says like we're new york city baby the city that never sleeps and that's what this conference is yeah i really think there's no putting the genie back in the bottle so to speak that's fine it's fine you know that other events will emerge that are more about the learning and sharing of information and it might be miami or l.a or somewhere else and that's great that's fine that's uh yeah did you find uh nfcla was had that like it's hard for me to like any of these big cities that i think have like a real like nightlife culture it just feels like that becomes more appealing to folks than sitting in conference rooms and and the conference room ones are more like you know like the the ones like coordinated by the ethereum foundation like really like you know but maybe i'm wrong uh i think you're gonna have the same problem right now where the industry is it's gonna be a lot of parties um and i think punk four one five six actually had a great twitter tweet or a couple of small thread about this about in real life irl events are gonna become a bigger and more important part of the industry and i agree completely with that i just think you're going to find what are the segments that each of these events specializes in and we don't have to have let's say you're an nft big nft project you don't have to go to every event and have a party at every event and i think there's an opportunity for all right we're going to go to new york we're going to have our party and our community will know that that's where we have our big party but we're going to go to south by southwest and we're going to have a brand activation that's more about an experience than a party and that's where we do that and i think that's how it's going to evolve and i think there's a play yeah that makes sense i consensus i thought did a really fantastic job of striking a balance uh consensus in austin which i was recently at like i felt like people actually attended those panels um and permissionless folks really attended panels permissionless was was absolutely like a learning one in addition to of course parties and fun but that's more defy it's it's not so much nft's metaverse stuff though there was some of that but um but yeah consensus i thought did a good job and really had some people showed up for for the concept cons conference side of things yeah the other thing i kept moving on the other thing that i got out of my feed and kind of the my network of friends and and contacts was um this is i think really interesting about the space is that um just about every hollywood studio streamer and broadcaster has reps on the ground in l.a in new york they're certainly in la um but they're on the ground in new york they're stealthily going around going to going to the parties hopefully the conference too and they're beginning to take this much more seriously to the point that they're sending development folks and so the word i heard from my network was it was like a reunion of you know of an la development meeting that you're at a you're at an event and all of a sudden there's the guy from disney and there's the guy from warner brothers is over there and uh and there's the woman from universal so what are they looking for in your opinion i think they're looking for a couple things first of all just knowledge about the space what is the community what is this emerging world of potential storytelling coming out of out of nfts and in web3 i also think they're looking for contacts of good you know who are the right people to talk to who are the right people or the wrong people to avoid um to just trying to find contacts too and do you think they're keeping their eye on on different intellectual properties absolutely and and absolutely like should we partner with these and create stories out of these wow you know one thing and i i guess we should flag uh john was the head of franchise for disney for many years and worked at lucasfilms and if you haven't heard my previous episodes with him you should go check them out and you can get a better sense of his background so he knows this world very very well um one thing that i've heard now a number of times from various project founders women and weapons we talked about this at consensus when i interviewed them like michael johnson in many ways suggest said this with aku and he does have a movie in development but these nft projects these big ones seem to be able to get meetings with any of these studios and and and senior people but where things start to fall apart is when they say yeah like 50 800 unique holders you know they go through the spiel they're like we've raised we've made this much money we have a hundred thousand followers across our socials and the execs are like excited and then they're like cool like how many people hold your nft and it's like five thousand and that's like that's on the high end you know and these development folks are like womp uh is that check out for you yeah i can understand where that's coming from they're what they're going to be looking for if they're going to acquire the rights to project x to make it into a potential movie or streaming series is that they want to see a built-in fan base so we think go back to harry potter when that was just the blockbuster publishing series and warner brothers acquired the rights to that what they were acquiring was beyond more than just the books they were acquiring that fan base and so i think having how big is that fan base and how active are they is going to be a very big consideration um what i would counsel to the studio development teams is this is a emerging space it's brand new you're not going to see 5 million fans that are going to come in the door with this project it's more about developing the project as an original ip you've got a head start with what's been created so far and so it's going to be a little bit tougher launching this brand in this potential franchise because it's going to be more akin to doing it from scratch but you're doing it with a whole new element of engagement that hasn't been possible before and a whole new way to produce materials and to support that it's never been available before which gives it a push in the favor of doing the project well i will be very excited to see out of this era which ones really do develop into long-term ipa i know you have some some bets on what some of those will be uh maybe we'll talk about that but um it'll it'll also be interesting i think there's this untested theory to me which is if you have a blockbuster film on your hands that's that was born out of nft ip then those underlying nfts should do quite well like i'm looking at just like from a price perspective for example but we don't really know like i really believe that aku and akutar like there will be a really well done film that will have mainstream appreciation and that the mainstream will adopt and come to know and love the aku akutar character or you know aku character let's say like i i i just think it has that magic um what does that mean will happen to the nft like in theory it goes up but i don't really know do you have thoughts on that yeah i mean it's all theoretical of course not but i do agree i think in theory that should increase the value of those nfts um it should make my more desirable because all of a sudden your fan base let's just say aku has a fan base of 10 000 nft owners i think it's bigger than that 15 000 let's just say 15 000 nft owners do you think it's that big i don't think it's that big it's let's say sent 10 000 so they have 10 000 nft owners um maybe fans like myself who do not own one but like the project and follow the project um so say triple that so let's say you're at 30 000 fans um all of a sudden say you make a movie or a streaming series and it's a hit your number of fans is going up by millions and so theoretically the at least even a tiny portion of that of those millions of fans if they want one of the nfts what the origin of the story then yeah they should theoretically go up demand should rise but there is a distinction i think between good content good media good movies and then content media movies that inspire wild fandoms like they're there are properties that lend themselves to really cult followings where the fans take feel a sense of ownership almost over the property star wars obviously being like the quintessential example of that and then movies where like that's a solid film critics liked it people liked it but it doesn't develop like a just just crazy fandom around avatar good example of that you know biggest movie of all time i believe it's still the biggest movie of all time and not adjusted for inflation and it never really developed a fandom around it um great movie just never quite had a fan base that certainly not like star wars ever had or harry potter has yeah yeah where the lore just captures people and wraps them into some world but we you i mentioned um avatar avatar avatar uh james cameron avatar yeah yes wow i think because avatar also then is like your avatar can be your profile picture and we're talking about guitars and i just had one of those moments again i've been drinking all week where i'm like what does is avatar the name of the movie that you just mentioned yes of course blue blue characters and avatar um i mentioned it a couple weeks ago i think when i was talking speaking with zenika because you had mentioned that as like being an example of something you see you're worried is happening in the the nft space today is avatar came out it was a 3d movie it did incredibly well because it was shot for 3d it was like made for this and then hollywood was like all right we're going to try and capitalize on this 3d movement make a ton of 3d movies but not shoot them for 3d so they're going to be kind of like crappy knockoff 3d movies and then you burn the audience off of 3d where they're like well then their impression for 3d starts to be that it's kind of a negative experience because they didn't actually do it well or invest the proper resources in it and that you see hollywood doing something similar with nfts by doing these like cheap partnerships where they like just offer a cheap nft for some movie property yeah i'll refund that for a second so the the analogy here is that to do a 3d movie there are two two two methods there's the shoot it in 3d release it in 3d that's like avatar was done it's expensive it's a little bit more complicated when you're actually in the production process um it uses processes in post-production that aren't quite the standards or the norms so it's harder to do but the consumer experience the audience experience is better the other way to do it is just to post convert it so you have someone sitting and essentially pulling elements out in post that make them 3d and you're charging a premium for the experience and what happened was they burned the audience they charged premium prices for a lesser product and the audience rejected it and there are people like katzenberg in the in the industry screaming bloody murder like stop doing this you're killing this golden goose why are you doing this and sure enough two three years later 3d was pretty all effectively dead so what's happening in the nft space my worry is is that we're seeing some projects and these are more of the studio projects licensed nft collections that you launch one it didn't work and rather than adjusting and learning and reconfiguring to try to figure out what went wrong the next one comes along and the approach with licensing is all right it's a t-shirt we're going to have a t-shirt brand this year and we'll do it again next year and in nfts it's even if nft licensing it's not that you can't just you can't just bring brand x back next year as a new nft drop because it failed this year like you've burned that brand for a number of years and that's what i see happening with some of these licensed properties is that they're not just taking a pause and reconfiguring and learning from the mistakes it's just repeating what had been done before and my worry is the burning consumers because these are bringing in new wallets and these are new consumers in our space people that we want and my worry is that they're going to burn these wallets these people are going to get a bad experience they're going to and they're going to walk away and say that was a ripoff and then we're not going to get them back is the answer for these brands to just wait a little bit until this space has played out a bit more they have themselves a better understanding of what they could be doing here what this really looks like how this could be a multi-medium yeah i had a you know type type i had a call last week with the quote head of metaverse for one of the big five studios in la and one of the studios that i think is guilty of of this process and and uh my advice was take a pause just stop what you're doing take a pause figure out what's going wrong because you're burning your did they listen to that they have a leadership team they have to report to and they have a marketing team that wants to do this and they have a development team that wants to do that so the answer is it's too soon to know if it's going to happen but um they're still doing it as of this moment well thanks for doing this the good work trying to make it i i want these to succeed we need these to succeed we we these are new a lot of these are new consumers we want them in the space and we need these projects to work but if they're just going to burn their brands this way these are the gold this is the crown jewel ip of some of these studios

friends well this this maybe uh segways us into in certain ways i'll i'll make the connection to the um the crypto punks news and noah davis moving from christie's two folks may know him from christie's and um to becoming the brand lead for crypto punks and something you highlighted to me is is both noah and and then also uh whoever it was from from yugo labs garga i guess who who tweeted something and basically said like hey we're not going to ruin crypto punks we understand it's cultural significance we're not going to do like basically shitty licensed lunchbox kind of deals now this is a little bit different because the you know they're this is licensing going the other way this is starting with an nft and then not like licensing it for like a lunchbox company versus you know starting with a yeah yeah web 2 property and licensing it into nfts but um but touching on a very similar premise of like treating these properties seriously and not doing like cheap happy meal esque deals as to to borrow a phrase that i've heard you used before so um yeah talk a little bit about your reaction to this news about noah and uh yeah i think yes first of all bringing in a full-time brand lead um on punks i think is a great move um punks now you could argue whether punks ever should have been sold from um uh matt and john at larva labs to to yuga i know there's some people who have mixed opinions of that but they're at yuga now and i think being part of yugo they should have a brand lead that really is looking out for the bunks pugs are different than apes right punks are different than me bits they need a brand lead that respects and understands the unique community culture and characteristics of that brand so that's a great move i applaud them for that for that move the tweet that garga put out noah put out about shitty lunchboxes and tv shows i did not like i felt that was a little i felt that was a disingenuous no it's the right approach but it's the wrong way to message that because it's on one hand you're saying that that's crap why would we ever do that and that's enough in the context of punk's brand i understand but the way they put it out there felt like you're doing it over here on the left with the your brands over here but you're gonna not do it on the right so it felt like they were ignoring what they're actually doing on the other side of their business like because board apes have lunch boxes and tv shows and development and books and development and it's like you kind of i felt like they kicked their their one brand down with that message then that's interesting so let me read the exact tweet from garga for example garga said what noah will bring for will be bringing to the table is for him to share much like us he has no vision of punks includes rushed brand deals shitty tv shows or licensed lunchboxes i see your point i don't think i interpret it that way because i think you're like punks and apes and punks and me but like they are different you know and and apes can go and and people can create lunchbox brands i i sort of editorialized when i said shitty lunchbox or whatever like they said shitty tv shows so i think leaving open the possibility that there maybe will be tv shows they just won't be shitty ones no i think i think you need to look at noah's tweet because noah put it the other way around he put shitty tv shows no that's what that's what that's what um that's what garga said as well shitty tv shows um like there won't be that i don't know it doesn't bug me i i understand the spirit of what they're trying to get at and um you know i was thinking about this and then i think bringing somebody in from the fine art world is is a great move right because it shows hey we see crypto punks as fine art and then i was like you know does picasso need a brand lead like what even is is is noah going to do day to day you know if that's what they're the play what they've promised in the announcement which is to come is the opening of the rights around punks so i think that's what the brand lead is really thinking through and going to be managing because what that means to me is there's going to be restricted rights because if you don't want lunch boxes then you're going to have to have restricted commercial rights but some of the punk owners want those rights so they're finding i'm sure they're looking for that balance of what gives our community rights that they would like and make them happy but at the same time protect the unique position that punks are in yes so this makes sense this is like crypt punks are our fine art in many ways and you don't see in even in the fine art one of one worlds of nfts for example you don't see the kind of permissive rights terms that you see among the pfp world because they just don't lend themselves to that in the same way so this that makes sense to me if noah is being brought on to really meaningfully think through what are the terms and conditions here where we can give holders rights but we can make sure we're protecting the integrity of the brains as really like a historical artistic relic that needs to be uh you know like a museum like you know properly sort of maintained or like a historical home or something you know like preserved by some sort of foundation i can also see two other roles for noaa one being of the community lead so being the person it's almost like here's my it's like the maitre d at a fine restaurant in new york like here's here's my secret business card with my secret number and you can call me anytime i kind of see it like that kind of a service which also fits very nicely with his background from christie's um the other part of this is there are going to be punk meetups in punk parties and i suspect he'll be coordinating and leading all of those efforts of kind of bringing this community the global community together love it yeah it totally checks out i mean when i think about what sotheby's has done you know they launched a meta of stuff these metaverse and i think one of the things that sotheby's is excited about when it comes to nfts and this technology is creating communities for their art holders in ways that they hadn't previously been able to do like now if you hold the batiste i don't know whatever insert fancy art here you can tell that i'm not isn't that a good one like you know they can they yeah whatever you know insert fancy painting that i can't afford here they can connect those art lovers and those collectors from around the world on their platforms and i know they're seeing nfts and like their their sotheby's metaverse as a way to do that and so [Music] yeah so noah really coming on to to to facilitate those kinds of just communities around people who love this same fine art it makes makes a lot of sense i mean he said you know he's like i'm going to be at nftnyc i'll be at the brunch come up to me i i will have basically open office hours to talk to any punk there's a funny picture actually of noah i saw on twitter of him at this brunch he was obviously giving a speech to the crew and he was standing up on one of the dining room tables at the restaurant [Laughter] you can't take the web 3 out of the the art collection exactly even if they're a fine art collection so overall good news for punks i think uh for the long i think it's for the brand long term and clearly the market agreed because the the price of punks pumped pretty pretty tremendously after that which which leads us to the insider trading accusations of course once again again you had this surge of buying punks right before this announcement came out you and i were talking about this a little bit before earlier today like there are clearly some people who got lucky who saw punks had hit like a 45 eighth floor or whatever and were like this is obviously a price at which to buy punks and then it seems like there were clearly a number of buyers who also just knew that yeah and a few of these buyers have come out and said i had no inside information i just was just the right time the right price but you look at the numbers and it's pretty damning sales volume increased 780 percent on a dollar basis the day from the day before in the trend before the announcement the number of unique transactions went up 619 percent from 16 to a to 115 in one day and the number of unique buyers went up from 16 to 72 in one day so clearly there was people clearly it was coming it's it's not illegal um it is shady as hell it is not the kind of presence that hugo wants out there and the fact it's happened twice actually i looked at my notes last time um i was on your show on your podcast was on the previous insider trading scandal from yuga so i seem to be coming on whenever there's an insider trading scandal at yugo but there's there's there's could be a fire here right there's smoke there's fire there's just a raging out of control problem and yuga has to get on top of it like i won't even though it's outside of my wallet right now if i if i was in that category of buyer i wouldn't touch yuga anything yuga does with a 10-foot pole until they get control of this it's out of control it's unacceptable i feel i feel quite strongly about that it should be a really easy i can see no and it's an easy solve right like it's like hey noah here's an nda hey anybody who works at yuga anybody who touches this deal here's here's a a thing you sign like you can't tell people this like we this is not a hard problem to get a freaking hold of right another thing that comes around is when this happens is there's a thing called the public ledger this is on a public ledger you might have not we all have an anonymous wallet today but there are people who are tracking that wallet and they will see when it moves and they will eventually might be a few years but it will get tracked back to a person it's it's not the reputation you want to have it's not a way for yoga to build what is probably the premier brand in the space right now it's it's it's shitty it's frankly it's just shitty and it needs to stop yeah i agree i think it's icky i feel maybe quite not quite as strongly as you do but i i'm i your general sentiment i think it's icky i think it's such a bad look you are like the trying to be the premier brand like what are you doing you know like keep a lock on things be professional folks can't trade on information that they have that because you're their buddy and i don't know i don't know how this is playing out right but but what it feels like is like they have friends and they're all sitting around getting brunch someday and they mention noah's coming on and they're like oh it's a good time to buy punks huh and people go and buy a bunch of punks like that's what it feels like and it's very like old boys clubby it feels you know i know again i don't know maybe women were benefiting from this but if i had to put money on the situation i bet most of people who who have reaped this reward or dudes and um yeah and if it happens is they have investors like you know the animoke is an investor in apecoin so they have investors that will know this is coming and it gets passed around in those investors communities and yeah it's until there's some regulation around it it's just going to keep happening but yuga as a leader needs to stand up and make a statement about it and just bring it get control of the situation in their house we're we're getting close to rapping here only because i have a uh it's nfc nyc you know so i got i got people to see places to be let's try and move through these these last couple of topics really quick i mean doodles it's almost a shame we waited the songs for doodles i shouldn't have ranted as long as i did about something previously doodles just they just have yet to misstep i feel like as a project it's it's kind of freaking unbelievable they just go from when to when they uh are you know kind of leaking out news about doodles too lots of announcements out about this they they their ceo was there but julian hogwin is that i believe yeah hogwin yeah he former president of billboard gave a really like we're a professional brand presentation to uh to holders this week yeah in fact i would encourage anyone to look up on twitter someone took some screen grabs or pictures of his uh julian's speech and it the screen grabs of the slides of the content just seems spot on like it it's professional it's well done clearly he's bringing and i which the team is bringing some professionalism to the project and if i were to say there was any big winner coming out of nft nyc this year it's doodles they just they knocked it out of the park i'm blown away with what so why do you say that what else what else would you say there they had an announcement video that was very well produced extremely well produced it's an animated video we'll link to all these things by the way the video the the the tweet that he referenced earlier with images of the their presentation the um what they announced which is doodles 2 which is the next i guess called the next new collection around the doodles brand so they announced that they announced a partnership with pharrell to become the chief brand officer of of the doodles which is amazing that feels huge pharrell is some one of those i mean again talk about knocking it out of the park i think pharrell and i don't know what brand chief brand officer looks like for doodles but pharrell sits in that amazing category of somebody who is obviously culturally feels like he's in the pocket of culture and can drive culture in in amazing ways and clearly has a track record of driving culture and is is business savvy and and smart and just like and feels like he fits the doodle's brand for some reason you know like this this whole thing just feels totally right it's how i thought about uh kith and the invisible friends uh partnership which i talked about on this show that i really like like that just fit to me for some reason this just fits um again i'm not a doodle holder so i just like pump the doodles back because i really just think i think they do it so well older either they're one of the only projects i would say that's about this too by the way like you go we were i guess we haven't talked about you this i guess we talked about the punk stuff but you know you got um a lot of respect for it but they don't i think they've locked in to more things than i think they get credit for things that they've kind of locked into and doodles for me feels like i feel like they're building it there's drivers at the helm of that thing who are so freaking savvy and and this gets to maybe are slightly more like traditional leanings which is i think doodles there's a lot of these projects and part of the luck thing maybe feels like that are or maybe a little bit too degen in their leanings and so it's hard to see how that translates to a 10-year 20 or 30-year like gen multi-generational brand that survives some of this stuff some of the cco you and i feel this way about or things where you're like without like a really central visionary leaders driving things forward and making sure that there's a lid kept on things like some of these brands feel like they can kind of get out of control um and doodles just feels like they strike this really right balance of being so community oriented but having leaders who are driving a vision and and maintaining real in a good way control of their in fact on that twitter thread that had some of the slides that were picked someone's captured from the presentation there's a slide about their intent to grow the brand with content and storytelling and i suggest people look that slide up because it it tells you there's a there's a plan in place i think there's probably more announcements to come with creative partnerships um so i think that's kind of something we'll hear later in the year and uh the other thing is that with with doodles 2 and they mentioned millions quote millions of nfts and i don't know what the details are i'm really curious to learn more about are they going to build like a layer two they're certainly not gonna do that on ethereum on layer one so i'm curious are they building like sort of a dedicated app on layer two which actually be a layer three or kind of how are they gonna do that and millions has me wondering what they have up there up their sleeves like millions of doodle nfts is going to be interesting what those use cases are going to be yeah the millions of nft's comment i think really is um speaks to what we were getting at earlier right which is that these projects who have had these conversations and are thinking really strategically are aware that they need to massively grow their engaged audience to really build what they want to build this is what i'm hearing from women in weapons i poopy really alluded to it when i interviewed him dead fellas i think is aware of this and and that's what they're trying to achieve i do think mechanically how this is going to work is fascinating um there were some people who i was seeing some some stuff on twitter about like maybe they're not going to use ethereum maybe they're going to use flow um i wouldn't love that for a variety of reasons um i understand flow is like good for you know mainstream users but i really think the network effects are accruing on ethereum and that's the place to be and layer twos are really the answer is increasingly the conclusion i'm coming to uh jordan seemed to say in a twitter space jordan castro poopy was like i strongly prefer the settlement layer to be ethereum so i think he's aware i mean jordan was pretty involved in cryptokitties and dapper labs he worked for dapper labs and that of course built flow so they have relationships there but um but i i do think jordan is really savvy about this stuff and seems to want to stay on ethereum so that does seem to suggest a layer two or even a layer three which folks may not be fully aware of what's happening on that side but you can listen to my conversation with robbie ferguson that'll be coming out because i talk about larry yeah i'm a big believer in letter threes by the way i think that's the way forward um i agree it's it's the modular blockchain concept of just we can sharding and and just layers create this dynamism for for these decentralized foreign ethereum because the decentralization is i think a big piece of of this working i'm rushing here at the end because i it turns out i'm blowing off a meeting that i did not realize i was supposed to be in at the moment and uh we have more john you and i that we want to talk about so i think we probably do a two-parter for this episode and we wrap right now so that i can go manage my currently entirely mismanaged life nft nyc you have kicked my butt i am dropping balls and i i hate to do that but we will be back to talk about hypermint and and some of these other a little bit more into you some yuga stuff we didn't get to get to and um otherwise i hope folks are having a great week if you're here at nftnyc i hope you've had a great time and john thank you you're welcome thanks for having me and i'm looking forward to part two [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode please go ahead and hit subscribe it helps me out
