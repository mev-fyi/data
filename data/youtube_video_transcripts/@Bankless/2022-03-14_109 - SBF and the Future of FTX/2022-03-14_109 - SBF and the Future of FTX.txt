i think that's something that i've gotten a lot more excited about in crypto over time um is the the opportunity to use it to have to have impact on the world welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david excellent episode today with sbf sam bankman freed bankless listeners a few things to listen for as we go through this episode number one we cover how sam built a 30 billion crypto exchange in less than three years simply incredible number two what ftx will actually look like in the future is vision for things number three what the x uh fdx super bowl ad did for crypto what it did for fdx as well interesting story there uh number four and finally is sam on team defy or does he plan to position ftx as a competitor david really cool episode today what did you think yeah i think uh people in the crypto twitter sphere will think that this episode is gonna be spicy just because uh it would appear at least at the cursory level that f ftx and the bankless thesis are kind of misaligned uh but i think once you get spf and both ryan and i into the same room all of those things kind of disappear and i really enjoyed this conversation with sam and kind of just getting to peek under the hood is really what motivates him uh to build such gargantuan institutions in the world of crypto and how we are actually aligned on some of our fundamental principles about how uh there are these islands of centralization or pockets of centralization that decentralized crypto rails can allow the navigation between uh which i think is just another uh interpretation of the defy mullet and so i think we definitely align there as well as some other things and in addition to talking about the ftx ad uh we also asked sam's opinion on the coinbase ad uh and you know it was more than just a conversation of two ads it was more about just like what did each ad do for the industry as a whole uh so just a small snippet of topics that we talked about in this podcast guys the reason we're having these conversations with the big crypto exchanges of the world uh we think of them as the the banks of the future the crypto banks of the futures because these are people who are shaping like it or not they are shaping the industry and brian armstrong we had that conversation in october november of last year go back and listen to that one for for another uh now we have sbf i think we'll have cz from binance on a time we really want to understand their their takes on the world and their value systems and so we definitely get into that with sbf why is he here does he care about decentralization is he worried that the crypto exchanges of the world uh might lead to a more centralized future and and become the same thing that we're leaving these are questions we asked sbf today and why you should tune into this is because people like spf are helping to shape the future it's important that we hear what he has to say and know how he thinks guys we are going to get right to the conversation but before we do we want to tell you about these fantastic tools for going bankless from the following sponsors the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3

sam bankmanfredor sbf as most of you know him he's the founder and ceo of ftx fdx has got to be the fastest growing crypto currency exchange in the world at least uh it feels that way he also manages assets through alameda research which is a quant trading firm that he founded in 2017 always a busy guy a brilliant trader now he's the leader of one of the world's largest crypto exchanges so he's definitely someone to pay attention to and uh sbf it's great to have you on bankless welcome my friend thanks for having me uh we heard you recently celebrated your 30th birthday so uh also happy birthday thank you thank you i'm glad uh you you you're choosing to spend some time early in your 30s with uh with the bankless community we're grateful for that we're excited about that but how's it feel how does it feel to be 30 yeah good how does it feel to be 30 and to have um accomplished so much in crypto you know i mean in many ways it honestly doesn't feel that that different than 29. um but uh you know it's um it's been a wild few years and i think it's been particularly interesting just sort of seeing um you know the difference between uh you know what uh what what sort of like a standard trajectory is and then what what happens if you really sort of you know put your feet on the gas pedal a little bit and um and sort of don't assume that anything is impossible until proven otherwise well that it feels like you've had your your foot on the gas pedal uh ever since you joined crypto and that's actually actually where we want to start the story here uh with you sbf is um you somehow manage i was looking back at when ftx was was founded and it was uh 2019 may 2019 less than three years ago which is incredible you are now a top three crypto exchange and you've built all of this in the last three years how did you do it like is it what going back to what you just said is just you haven't uh taken your foot off the gas pedal but like how how is this even possible yeah i mean you know that's a piece of it but it's not all of it and um you know i think other things that that really contributed to this i mean one of them is just like taking a step back and and saying all right like um uh what you know what's the right thing to build in the first place like where is there a real need and you know sort of a combination of like there's a lot of demand and not enough supply of some product um and you know i think we felt like the exchange space was one of those spaces you know it's a place where there would um they really are one of the core pieces of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem um and you know the exchange of circuit 2018 they just weren't that good and i think we sort of looked at that and like all right there's a big opportunity here to really jump in and um uh and that that if we do like you know and if we build a really great product um you know we we could pretty quickly become a pretty big big piece of the space if so if everything goes goes exactly right and and i think that like yeah choosing the right place to come in was one piece of it and then you know and it's you know feel a little silly saying this but like building a great product it's a thing that i feel like a lot of people legitimately sort of fail to emphasize nearly enough and uh but but but obviously it's incredibly important sam you made bill the creation of ftx just look easy from like the outside in at the cursory level glance it just kind of looks like ftx just just uh was built out and manifested basically perfectly according to plan and i remember coming being a person coming into the class of 2017 crypto watching people uh comment on the rise of binance and how binance was this underdog exchange that penetrated into a market that seemed completely saturated and seemed unpenetrable and that was in 2017 2018 and then ftx did it even more so in in 2019 was it as easy as it looked from the outside yeah it was yes and no there are a lot of details i mean there's just a lot of specific things to get right and a lot of sort of deep dives into those and you know understanding everything from you know licensing regulatory compliance to customer support how to manage a team that's growing payments you know fiat integrations like there's a bunch of pieces of it but i think what i would say is like none of these pieces have felt sort of insurmountable and so i think there is a sense in which like it was at least close at least close to sort of like straightforward of a high-level pathway available as it looked like if you executed really well and um you know the devil's in the details there but i do think that there was just a straightforward opportunity tell us what you saw when you saw that opportunity is ftx successful because it capitalized on a specific niche or what did fdx do well that other exchanges left on the table yeah i think that like there's a lot of different pieces of this and i do think a lot of this traces back in the end to like sort of you know we we we tried hard and built a good product and weirdly enough that sort of set us apart from a number of other products in the space um but uh but but more specifically like margin malls are one of these right like you know anytime you have futures or derivatives or leverage you have to figure out like you know how do you liquidate people how do you margin call and those were just like absolute shows in 2018 for most exchanges they're losing a million dollars a day tapping incompetent margin models they just like let people put on a position with way too much leverage you know not nearly enough collateral and then wait to march and call for too long and by the time they got around to it it was too late and um you know obsession was already underwater and then they'd you know claw that back from wilford made money that week and that that's not a good system um and so one piece of it was just cleaning that up a lot and thinking about look like how do the p you know what first of all like how do people do this in the rest of the world and and what are the right models for this what's the right way to think about this so you know i i think that that was like that was one piece of this um and uh and that that's something that we really focused on a lot you know another piece of this was um you know thinking about what like you know i guess cross-margining maybe i should add as well surf another interesting piece of that um you know which is basically how instead of having a ton of different completely independent margin um you know for for each different product on the exchange which becomes a mess really quickly um just having you know one wallet where you deposit whatever you want um so that was sort of another important piece of this um you know other things i guess like um you know thinking about like how can we help um you know build a product that like just like works the way people are expecting it to and i think especially on whenever something goes weird or wrong like whenever whatever wacky things happen is always when you know everything breaks and and customers get frustrated what happens when there's a fork what you do with the futures on the underlying what happens if there are network halts um you know and what happens if teachers start going to a really big discount and having a plan for those cases that sort of like was reasonable and fair to people was was sort of another thing we thought about you know and then i think the last thing that i'll say is on the regulatory side and this has become an increasingly big deal over time you know we've been thinking about you know from from from sort of like you know first principles almost like what is the right um you know what's the right way to think about the regulation for a crypto exchange and i think there's a really really hard problem at this point but it's not an unsolvable one and i think the world is to some extent divided up between people who have sort of like you know are trying half-heartedly on this people who have given up people like it's there's a lot of messes here um but but i think that like this is a thing on which you can figure out what the right thing to do is and do it if you try hard enough and that's another thing that we've really been been emphasizing a lot so i think i know those were like some things that i guess we did differently than you know many of our competitors but um uh but i think a lot of this was just like trying to have consistently good execution across the board well you guys have certainly had that and that you know i can't help but wonder as we look back through the other exchange of founders throughout history is like ev every two to three years a new exchange seems to come along so we had brian armstrong launch you know coinbase with his co-founders 2012 uh the winklevoss twins 2014 with gemini and then he had 2017 was cz in binance 2019 was ftx and which you just launched sbf so it feels like we're due for another um you know crypto exchange founder do you think that there's someone out there who could uh come and give you guys a run for your money is this just the the trajectory of things or do you think things have solidified you have the big players now and that's that's all there's going to be for the foreseeable future i don't expect there to be another traditional crypto exchange coming out anytime soon which is going to become a big player i think that like there's a lot of appetites a few years ago for new players in the space i just don't think there's nearly as much appetite now um that being said um i think there are going to be new players in the space which are sort of tangential to i think you know looking at players like paypal right which are they're not crypto exchanges but there are mass retail products that are starting to integrate crypto as a front end and i think we're going to see more and more people like that start to dip their toes in the space um and uh and play plately some role in it sam i want to zoom all the way back out and get down to some of the basic questions in here uh everyone who comes into crypto i think comes into crypto for their own specific reasons and so i want to pick your brain as to why you're in crypto so when when you look at crypto why are you here like why did you start alameda why did you start ftx what about this industry interests you yeah well it's you know as for why i got here in the first place um i you know originally i was trading and i i just saw arbitrage opportunities you know i looked around at the space and there was you know there are billions of dollars a day of volume trading globally in crypto and um that's a lot of volume uh and the the the threads were just absolutely ludicrous given that you saw one percent spreads all over the place occasionally five or ten percent spreads and so obviously got involved just trading doing arbitrage on those um and i think when i got involved i basically had no idea why crypto would be useful for the world i just sort of thought look there's a thing you can trade these numbers you know i'm used to seeing tickers trading up prices and um and and that was sort of how i initially thought of it and i think it wasn't until i've been in the crypto ecosystem for a while that i started to understand why it existed in the first place um and i think a big piece of this is thinking about like well like what's the alternative and what what's it what's it replacing what's it doing in the world you know it's one thing you can do is be a payments fee uh you know vehicle method whatever you want to call it and you know as i got more involved in the crypto ecosystem um i started to have to among other things like send money to and from exchanges um you know just because like i was trading on them right so i had to like wire money to coinbase and and as i was doing arbitrage as i was like just trying to make money doing crypto arbs not nothing sort of more complicated that it weirdly kind of quickly became clear that the hardest part of that job um was actually going to be the fiat part that that was gonna be harder to like send the wire transfers necessary in order to trade crypto than it was gonna be to do the actual crypto trading and and that was sort of the point at which i started to think like oh wow that's that's pretty weird like that shouldn't be the hard part of what i'm doing right now that should just be an afterthought but it was the hard part and it started getting me thinking like boy there's there's something wrong with that system right if like i'm trying to trade crypto and fiat is still the hardest part of that and you know we're spending probably five man hours in banks physically branches banks like sitting there talking to tellers and stuff in order to do the wires that we need we were you know a three-month-old startup with like 12 people so that was like a big part of the task and um and i think it's like a really compelling example to me of like you know something here is just not working smoothly what was it that wasn't working smoothly to you that you identified is it was it kind of the existing banking system would would you say or was this just an opportunity in crypto that you felt like uh was unfulfilled and needed some fulfilling it's an interesting question and i think there's a little bit of both frankly um i don't think it was only one or the other um and i do think that like um you know both the existing systems like like part of this was just like banks were not excited to support cryptocurrencies right and they weren't excited to support crypto companies and you know that meant that it was pretty uh pretty messy um so that was definitely a piece of this but i think another piece of this frankly um was that uh you know they were even when we started looking outside just the raw crypto ecosystem it still seemed like a mess and you know it was a mess even when we were trying to do payroll like that was not nearly as easy as it should have been um and and to be clear that that is not something that should be super hard like you know this is that that should be like just about the easiest thing um that you know that you can do um you know everything that we tried to do uh in fiat was difficult and you know if you tried to cross border it got so much harder um anytime you try and send from one country to another sort of optimistically it would cost you a percent and it would take like two days that was like the best case scenario and you had to get pretty lucky for that to happen there's often like this um i i guess this list of reasons that people join crypto right and i think this is um distilled down probably it's too reductionist but it is still distilled down to these three things money you're either here for the money you're here for the tech or you're here for the movement you know the values of the thing uh read a recent forbes article with you sbf and uh a few quotes from that i'm interested in your thoughts on uh i'll read them now beg mcfreed is no crypto evangelist he's a mercenary dedicated to making as much money as possible he doesn't really care how solely he so he can give it away he doesn't really know to whom or when we'll get to that giving it away part in a little bit uh the writer goes on asked if he would abandon krypto if he thought he could pile up more money doing something else say trading orange juice futures he doesn't even pause i would yeah can you talk about that a little bit more i thought that was a really illuminating part of the article and i'm curious if that kind of you know explains a little bit why you're here i think what you've described so far about your journey in crypto is like the entrepreneur's journey it's like i saw a problem in the market that wasn't getting fixed and so i decided all of like i could do a better job of fixing it and there was this massive market opportunity so i'm here to fix it right maybe that's not quite the money reason why you're in crypto it's sort of like you saw a need and sort of the entrepreneur's reason you're in crypto but i'm wondering if if that um if that is true if you could if you saw a need in the orange juice futures market and there was a big market opportunity there could you have been there instead is there anything particular about crypto's value system that compels you or is it really about the entrepreneur's journey and kind of the the money side of the equation you know it's complicated and i mean certainly at the beginning right when i was first getting involved there's nothing crypto specific about what i was again i don't really know what crypto was even um and so i think certainly from you know at the beginning absolutely could have ended up in a different place um and you know i think today like if i see you know a good opportunity somewhere i want to be you know able to take advantage of that you know whatever space that's in and so that's that's definitely true as well now i will also say that like um it was you know i think i there are really great things to be doing in crypto that i'm really excited about and i'm not super tempted to be uh giving those up and i think that's true from sort of a monetization perspective but i also think that that's just true from you know the sort of impact that i can have on the world perspective and i think that's something that i've gotten a lot more excited about in crypto over time um is the the opportunity to use it to have to have impact on the world and i think that like um i that again i don't think that's something that i was like super attentive to when i first got involved in the space i think that's something which you know much more has sort of come over time for me as i've explored things more um but but i do think that i feel pretty compelled by um uh by its use case now in a way that that wasn't obvious to me at the beginning um and that i want to see through and and and i think this is from the perspective of like this intermediate financial markets i think it's from the perspective of you know allowing international monetary transfers to work reasonably um and a bunch of other things sam there's this term that i've learned recently that i've been using more and more because it seems to describes uh the reasons as to why so many people feel compelled to join crypto regardless and that that term is uh being nerd sniped as in crypto has just like this insane amount of surface area of problems to be solved uh and while perhaps you didn't come into crypto uh because of the ethos alignment you just came in here because there was this arbitrage opportunity and then there was this problem that you discovered crypto eventually pulls in all people that are obsessed with like problems or puzzles and like they like to solve these puzzles because it's they're fun puzzles to solve inside the crypto industry does this uh resonate with you at all is this a reflection of what you got in here for it absolutely does and i do think that like um you know that that a big part of this is like um i that like the more i've been here the more opportunity that i've seen um to find something really impactful to do in this space and uh and i think i didn't appreciate all of that when i was sort of like first looking at it a long time ago um but i but i i i think it's huge there's this common trope in crypto where you like you come for the money and you stay for the tech is that kind of the trajectory that that you've seen yourself on is like oh first there was arbitrage then i found discovered i could build this this business but then you just recently alluded to there's more and more use cases that you can see crypto helping create more and more real world impact uh is this kind of the trajectory that you've seen yourself on yeah i think that sounds about right and what are those use cases what are those like high impact things that have really uh captivated your attention yeah so i think one piece of this is like you know every time that we pay for something in the states you know we're sort of like by default believing something like um three percent um to various fees along the way which is a lot to be paying um that that survey is one piece of this you know a second piece of this is um i you know whenever we uh you know send money overseas and we're losing you know optimistically five percent sometimes 20 um on on spreads there um that's you know horribly inefficient and and and a lot of what's going on is like you know how can you how how does a payment work right now like if if you know one person wants to pay another what does that mean what's it entail and i think part of the answer here is like well that payment only works if there are uh two people who both respect the same payment method right like they both agree on what it means um for that payment to happen um but in order for that to happen um you know what what you have to have you you ought to have um a situation where like there is some payment method if you're talking overseas which is well it's probably not run by a country because it's cross-border um it's probably not run by a company i don't think we end up with like one company having sort of the proprietary payment method for the whole world um you need a third option and i think blockchain is one of the first times that we've found a another way to do you know let's have lunch right to have some ledger that you reconcile between two parties and so i think that's that's super compelling i think that when we do so there's payments internationally there's payments domestically um i think you look at holding assets especially i mean ukraine right now i think is a great example of this right like right now there's huge amounts of cryptocurrency based donations going to ukraine because how else are you going to get funds there easily um and and i think if you're in ukraine right a lot of people are thinking hard about like what should they be storing their assets in where you know where do they feel confident that it's going to be you know uh stable and so i think like that's another side of this and um uh and so i think all of those are like various reasons that like um uh that that we're starting to see more and more um uh you know usage of it um and uh and i think those are those are just some of them you know that's just there's the tip of it and i think you can just sort of keep going here and keep finding like more and more reasons why you know existing payment messages don't work in a lot of cases um and and purple presents a really compelling you know alternative to that how much um does decentralization matter in all of that sbf do you think in in general the crypto community um do you think decentralization is overrated or underrated in the crypto community i think that's a good question so i guess i'll say here's a vision for decentralization which i feel like moderately compelled by um as like you know my current best guess for the way to do it which is basically that you have like a bunch of centralized islands you know whether they're centralized exchanges whether whatever they are um which are then connected um to each other by decentralized rails right and so you have like and that's sort of like in some sense what we have right now right where there's like there are all these exchanges and each one of them is centralized but you can withdraw your assets from them to your own self-custody wall or to another exchange you're accounted another exchange you can decentralize blockchain rails my guess is that like that's roughly how we're going to see things building out and and it means that you can have the efficiency of a centralized entity performing some operation but the exit strategy of being able to go to a decentralized platform or to self costing and a native language that each of these platforms can all talk with each other in order to communicate more to send assets between each other and that if you're building a new platform you can do that with as well now that's obviously ignoring defy which is a more fully decentralized vision of of you know a financial ecosystem and i think that can work for some things i think that when you look at things that are like not incredibly like computationally intensive um i think that d5 makes a ton of sense i think there are some balance on it right you're looking at like a few hundred milliseconds of latency at the minimum you know you're looking at some costs you're going to be massively duplicating server costs effectively um for all the validators and so for like you know things where compute or throughput or something like that is the current biggest bottleneck it's not a great fit but for things for which that's not much of bottleneck i think you can start to build them fully decentralized sam the the concept of uh getting all of humans on to the same ledger is definitely something that i i resonate with and as we're looking uh back to ftx and also the future of ftx how does ftx fit in into that model where we have international transfers just leaking value left and right we have domestic transfers uh leaking value left and right uh and then even our current state of just like commodities markets and equities markets could definitely use a glow up if you will uh so with ftx what does ftx look like in in five to ten years how what does ftx want to be when it grows up and how will it help kind of solve some of the problems that you recently listed off yeah so you know i think we see ftx is one of those centralized islands right it's it's not a decentralized entity but it interfaces with a lot of them and i think what we see it as is it's a venue where you can transact you know where you can trade and and where you can send both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies in and out easily uh and and you know i think ultimately seeing it potentially as really a full stack financial experience for you know for for people where they can access all the things that they want to access where they can access you know stocks crypto investing trading deposits withdrawals of crypto and fiat you know direct deposits um uh card payments and and everything else but that's also natively integrated into a lot of blockchain rails and so anything that you want to do um in d5 in in the rest of the crypto ecosystem you can easily get you know funds from ftx2 there you can do swaps that you need to do on ftx in order to get the right assets um and uh and that's like my sort of like sense for for where you know high level it it's going i think it's sort of a combination of like exchange you know financial exchange and um financial uh you know product and especially consumer mobile app this centralized island that you're talking about uh sam is this um is this most disruptive do you think to the big banks of the world like um you know the brokerages of the world the robin hoods maybe or like the even the goldman sachs for instance or uh is it more of a tech company is it more disruptive long term to like the you know the the metas of the world and uh and the twitters it's an interesting place i think these exchanges are in because like maybe it's one maybe it's the other maybe it's both what do you think ftx is really disrupting here it's a good question and i think like part of the question is like well what mobile neo natively digital neobank do you do 100 of your finances through today yeah the answer is none right yeah no one does i've like basically never met anyone who does i think that's a little weird frankly um we're there are places where we do see that right like there are countries where you you see move laps um being the primary way that people are transacting um storing their finances you know the us is certainly not one of them um and so i think your question of like who is that disrupting i think there's sort of a hole there right like i don't think anyone has quite built that product you know i think there's a lot of people it might be sort of probabilistically disrupting um but i don't know that anyone is quite exactly in that corner right now um you know putting that aside for a second like i i think that there's a disintermediation part of this which is important as well right which is basically when you and maybe one way to think about this is like if you want to buy raw if you want buy apple stock on robinhood right how like what what's that process look like sort of like you know market structure wise it's messy i mean you're going through like you know mobile app fifa firm ats pifa firm clearing firm custody firm exchange and then the whole thing duplicated on the other side like our traditional financial ecosystem is heavily intermediated for everyone except for like hf deeper that are going direct to exchanges um and that's a big difference as well versus i mean f6 but also just more generally the crypto ecosystem where it's sort of the ethos is everyone has direct access the exchange they have direct access to the product and it removes intermediaries that are just charging fees and removing information it seems like after after you layer on a lot of these uh products that ftx seems to have built uh and and perhaps has aspirations to build it kind of seems that ftx just turns into like this financial superstructure where we have so many different financial sectors of the world we have banking we have exchanges we have commodity like risk risk management tools and it seems like ftx is getting a little bit in getting their fingers into all of them including nfts too um so when you like it's kind of the concept just to combine as many financial products under the same umbrella as possible and just like if ever everyone else is ultimately you know there's always a joke that even like starbucks is becoming a bank right where they do their their like uh their gift cards basically they have like 100 a billion dollars in deposits and the the meme is that everything ultimately converges to a bank well bank ultimately converges to a brokerage and it goes from there and everything kind of just converges upon this one central superstructure and i think ftx is just going there even faster by leveraging crypto rails in the background which is what crypto really enables so is that kind of like the long term goal of ftx just to be this one product to to serve them all i think there's definitely a piece of that and i think that there's a few important addendums that one is doing that but putting things on blockchain rails as much as possible and being able to leverage the infrastructure that cryptocurrency and digital assets space have and so i think that you know you look at at sort of the a lot of the things that that blockchains have enabled crypto exchanges to do and trying to make that a more general structure um that's definitely one of the angles here um and and something i think long-term work we're super excited for so uh i want to talk about some of the other sectors that you know you bump up against in crypto when you have sort of a uh you know centralized island of the type you've described ftx as and you know the first contrast point is fdx and d5 right compare and contrast so like friends or competitors is ftx a friend of d5 or does it see defy as kind of a competitor that's maybe out to eat its lunch what's your take i think we think we're a friend of fife i think maybe deep i think they're competitive to us uh but but i i certainly think of of us as friends and and i think a lot of the reason is like i think that there are pros and cons that there are reasons to use one and their reasons to use um you know another and um i i i think that like you know one piece of this is looking at um uh you know it's looking at again things that are computationally intensive not a great fit to be directly on chain now they can interface with blockchain right um but like you're never gonna have the same tps on a dax as you as you do on a centralized exchange and after the same latency or fees um on the other hand i think there are a lot of things that do fit natively on chain i think that like you know dexes that are one thing which i think especially for like the consumer side um you know where where latency is a lot less important and where throughput's a lot lower um it would be totally reasonable um anything you know another side of this is social media i think that like it could make a ton of sense for social media messages to end up on chain decentralized i think it would go a long way towards sort of like breaking into the the giant sort of um moots that each social media network builds because they're not interoperable with any other one they have all this captive you know all these captive messages and user base um and um i think there's lots to be said for making social media interoperable for having users own their messages um and permission whatever platforms they want to be able to access it and i think that using a blockchain for the underlying social media rails uh could make a ton of sense from that perspective sam i'm interested in that you said um maybe defy doesn't always think ftx is is its friend i'm curious why do you think that why why is that your perception and um you know why do you think maybe part of the d5 community believes this yeah totally so i think that and to be clear i think you know i don't want to make an absolute statement about all of dpi or anything like that um but i i definitely think that there is um you know i i think that there there are some people who uh you know is eating everything um like literally everything and and so i think see it as like well anything that like does financial services is is going to be effectively competitive eventually one way or another um and and i think that's not so much my guess um i think that like you know i do think that there's like ways in which like there will be competition um but i think there's also things that are better suited to each part and that there's a lot of ways that they can just complement each other and interface nicely you know with each other but um uh but but i have to think that the sort of like will literally the whole world mentality would see anything that is you know a centralized island as potentially competitive there's definitely some uh hardcore decentralization maximalists out there who who uh who might take that uh that that approach certainly um i think most the in the bankless community at least are somewhat pragmatic about it it's sort of like we don't want uh centralized institutions what we might call banks gaining too much control of the system or we sort of revert back to the our prior system but um there's definitely a pragmatism about it because there's a ton of good that centralized islands do for the ecosystem as a whole i'm curious about this so given everything you've said so far you know ftx's strategy how you see the world uh you know d5 being more of a friend than than a competitor what does this mean about ftx's support of particular blockchains do you have any preferences right so there are some exchanges out there who might say no we're neutral right may the best one win there are others i might say maybe a binance for example they clearly they favor uh bnb chain binance chain don't they for for reasons that um anyone can guess obviously uh there are some exchanges that that haven't really like picked uh maybe some are yet to launch their own uh chains side chains i'm not sure does fdx have any preferences it has seemed in the past like ftx might have some preferences i know solana has been a chain that uh you know ftx has established many partnerships with is that one and if you do have preferences what drives those totally so i think the way i come at this is i don't have native preferences um you know we want to support as many chains as we can on on fbx and i think we do support a number of them um including supporting cross chain through a number of different chains and you know in the end i think it's a combination of what makes um sort of technological sense and where the demand is that that we respond to now that doesn't mean that like we don't have opinions on it and obviously i'm seeing everything that's happening there and and you know i do end up with like thoughts on you know what genes make more and less sense um and and you know obviously that's also going to impact you know how we prioritize things we try and come at it from the beginning from a neutral perspective though and so i think that like you know high level yeah what are things you know looking for basically basically three three criteria one is um basically how fast and cheap it is second is how much demand there is for it and the third is how decentralized or trustworthy it is and i think that you know that third thing we think is like not an issue with most chains but but maybe an issue with some um and you know from those percent you know perspective basically thinking like well okay you know what should we prioritize um in terms of onboarding chains to ftx um and uh and so anyway you know i i think that like there's obviously huge demand for ethereum i mean that that's probably always going to be the case um bitcoin is what it is and and that that that's going to be a big piece of it and then there's a ton of different attempts to have i don't know different forms of scaling solutions and and and there are lots of different framings of it and lots of different approaches to it between layer twos new layer ones roll ups and and everything else um and i you know i think my sort of thought on a lot of this is like you know we'll support a lot of them we'll see where the demand goes make sure that you know that we are giving sufficient attention to the you know um to where uh where they used to be the most demand um and uh you know i i think that we've seen that with a few of the other ones i think salon has been the most popular by far so far and i think it makes sense as one of the most you know economically efficient chains i think there's some roll ups and layer twos which are like going live soon-ish i i or or have recently gone live i think you like start where harvard trump and and a few others and i think we're excited to see what happens with those i think we've seen like avalanche matic and a few others have real uptake as well but mostly i think it's too early to know for sure and i think the law of this is gonna depend on the future development of the blockchains of their ecosystems to see which ultimately ends up sort of like with the act you know both the best product and the most demands turning away from the perspective of ftx and leaning into the perspective of sbf instead there's a tweet that's absolutely famous in in a twitter sphere that you tweeted on january 9 2021 and it was in a debate with whoever coined mamba is and you tweeted out i'll buy as much sol seoul solana's token as you have right now at three dollars sell me all you want then go off uh and that was at solana price at three dollars of which it's now at 81 so obviously that was a good tweet uh not to mention coming down off of the high of 250 at the peak of of the sol price sam what gave you the conviction to to send this tweet because it was one of those things where you had to have had conviction to send it and you have been proven absolutely right what were they what were the indications what were the signs that you knew that this was going to be a good trade yeah um totally it's you know obviously i don't know anything for sure and i was like certainly going you know going out there on a limb a little bit um but um but but but basically i i think like looking at where it was back then you know market cap wise um you know it was it was around a billion dollars or so um and i thought that you know of the change at the time it had sort of like clearly the most compelling um vision uh for um uh you know for how it was going to to scale um and uh and and you know thought that that it had like a real chance of becoming one of the top chains and you know anything but like how big would it get if it got there i think the answer is like you know 100x right was like a real possibility and i thought the odds were like way above one percent um of that and so um uh you know i think putting all those together just sort of seemed like look like this is this is an insanely low price for what i think is one of the strongest technical teams in the ecosystem and you know at that price yeah i just buy i don't know as much as there is were you surprised that the price went from three dollars to ultimately 250 dollars like at what point were you like oh my god this exceeded my expectations it definitely happened a lot faster than i thought it would and uh you know i think it was sort of like a a an optimistic case that ended up being realized and ended up being realized shockingly quickly um i don't think i was like out of the realm of possibility but i think it is definitely a lot faster than i was sort of expecting and you know i i think like i don't know exactly why why it happened um that fast but um i was uh it definitely outperformed my expectations are there any other um changes you feel similarly to about about today now sam i mean i think like people are curious because um it still seems like it's the the early stages of what we might call kind of the execution layer of these blockchains um and they're they're they're new competitors that are entering the ring you mentioned a few like avalanche and matic and there's also layer twos which haven't yet seen their season anything you're particularly bullish on from your vantage point on uh on a alternative chain front yeah i mean i think those are a lot of the chains that i want to be looking at and doing a deeper dive into and i think that like you know uh i wouldn't be shocked to see one of those come out as a real competitor i think um and uh i i think part of this is looking at what do bridges look like especially when you look at like you know starkware and arbitrum and others that are sort of like explicitly meant to be viewed as sort of like layers on top of ethereum i think this sort of like complicated piece there is always like what happens on that interface um but you know if you can get that you know if you can get that working in a really great way i think that's a real competitor and i think that would be really interesting um and then you know i think outside that i think like avalanche is one of the chains that we see is like you know they've got a really smart team and um you know been grinding away at a product a good product for a while i would not be surprised to see them um start to play a larger role in the ecosystem um and then wouldn't be surprised for there to be a change that like we're just not expecting at all um and and end up playing a big role i mean i don't think that we certainly don't feel like we know everything that's that's going to be going on you mentioned bridges a couple of times now and i'm curious if you think uh central exchange centralized exchanges like ftx play a role in the bridging process i know ftx recently announced support for arbitram which is awesome layer two so withdrawals and deposits there how does ftx see itself as a as a bridge from fiat to the more native blockchain ecosystem yeah i mean we absolutely see ourselves as a bridge in that sense and i think that you know basically what that means is building as many yet integrations as we can as many different currencies as we can that work as well as we can and then combine that together with as many blockchain integrations as we can so that you can easily convert between euros and you know erc 20 tokens between pounds and a scale token between dollars and bitcoin um and uh uh and you know basically being a central repository of liquidity um you know addition to on-ramps and off-ramps so that it's super super easy for people to just like convert between all of those uh you know without having to worry about it so that's that's really what i'm uh one of the big things i see it as and that starts to bleed into the serve payment processor side of this slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that combines the performance and ease of a centralized exchange with the openness and transparency of d5 slingshot aggregates liquidity from all of d5 in order to find the best price on thousands of crypto assets

bridge.arbitrom.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i use gemiini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my preferred crypto asset on gemiini you'll find over 50 different cryptos including many of the top defy and metaverse tokens like wi-fi and axiomfinity using gemini earn you can earn yield on your various cryptos including eight percent on the g usd stablecoin gemini is available in all 50 states and more than 50 countries worldwide so if you're looking to upgrade your crypto exchange sign up at gemiini with gemiini.com go bankless and get 15 of bitcoin after you trade 100 or more within the first 30 days that's gemini.com go bankless let's talk about maybe the second contrast point so if we've established that ftx sees itself as a friend of defy uh are you a friend of the banks are you a friend of the goldman sachses of the world uh if you're more a competitor i know earlier we were talking about how you see fdx is maybe occupying some some new white space that these institutions don't currently occupy but you know the banks are hungry they're looking they're looking to uh grow and they're looking to gain more market share do you think they go down without a fight let's talk about that and then maybe i want to talk a little bit more about regulatory but the banks themselves how does ftx win against them i mean i think that there's a big question of what role they want to play in the digital asset ecosystem and i don't think it's clear yet like i i don't think that we've seen banks really stake out what their direction is going to be you know when we talk to them why are they so slow it's so imagine that like imagine you're working so so okay what's the biggest company that you've worked at in terms of employee number of employees uh above a thousand but very 1200 or so cool so how many employees do you think like citibank has globally i think googling this right now jesus i'm gonna guess a hundred and thirty thousand god that's my guess what do you think david oh i don't i don't know but it's a large number and i'm scared of it already hundred and ten thousand oh my god what about a lot of employees right right well that's a good question right like imagine like how much you can get done with 12 people and then you're like oh wait there's like 200 000 it's hard to even imagine what that means and so that's okay so that that's one interesting piece of it another thing though is like imagine that something has to get not consensus but like general approval in in order to happen you have all these committees of like 15 members each i mean there's like tens of thousands of these committees and giant organization you got 15 people sitting around around a table and they're like all right so should we do something in crypto you know i don't know like uh trade it or give access to trading or maybe maybe make a fund or bank it or you know something like that right and then someone says well what do we think compliance is going to say about this right and i don't know someone that tells you like yeah that's a concern i don't know you know and someone else is like well do we do i understand the regulatory structure here and someone says i think it's kind of messy i'm not totally sure and and and okay so so you see you're starting into the means it's like who's gonna take the lead on this project and someone's like well i can i can try and work on it but i'm gonna need more clarity from compliance and someone's also like well yeah i don't i talked to compliance last week and they weren't they felt nervous and they didn't know either and they know and now you're like of course that to me is not going to make a decision right like they're like so far away from being able to actually like give a green light on something and everyone is nervous that someone's going to be nervous that someone is going to decide that there isn't enough clarity for them to feel comfortable moving forward with some piece of this is how this all is going to bottom out in the end right like some some long chain of nervousness and um uh and you know where does that where does that sort of end up like i i think it just ends up in action and i think that's what happens is you just get like there's so many video points and everyone is nervous and of course they're thinking look are we gonna get a billion dollar fine for this and so it's like what are you worried about getting fined for like i i don't know i want you to convince me we're not gonna get fined for this like do we get clarity from from the regulatory body she's like well they're still thinking about what what the regime looks like in some places and i'm like oh so we're not gonna get clarity that we're definitely not gonna get fined for doing something here and i was like i don't know i don't think so i don't know and and then she stalls out you know and so i think it's just sort of like a large collection of sort of like issues and concerns like that that just lead in the end to like uh uh to a mess i can't make progress on on something like this it sounds like the only type of organization that works under this like context that you've kind of laid out for us is one that doesn't uh one that asks for forgiveness not for permission and it kind of lends itself to the upstarts of the crypto world rather than the incumbents of the legacy world i think there's definitely a piece of that and you know the other thing that i'll say is like it's not i wouldn't say that it's impossible to get regulatory clarity it's just hard you have a lot of work and you have to really understand what's going on deeply and have lots of conversations with regulators and like that's something that a more nimble organization do when you look at larger organizations like it's not even just about doing that it's about doing that and then giving comfort to 200 209 999 other employees that you've done that to the extent that they should not have to themselves do that digging again and not have to duplicate that same extremely long investigation 200 000 times in order to be comfortable moving forward like that that that's a pretty tall task let's talk about that then the regulatory side because i know you've been quite busy on the regulatory front i've got a you know number of questions for you but but regulatory could also be a cudgel that um banks use on the crypto industry as well like somebody might hear what you're saying sam and say yeah but like i understand but you don't know someone from the banking sector you don't know my compliance department and the reason we have compliance is not because we want to it's because it's all of the government makes us and it's because all of this you know legislation and regulatory uh cruft has been added over the decades of the financial system's life so like you don't have to abide by those things sam and so it's easy for you to say you know compliance gets stalled by indecision but you should be forced under our same compliance and regulatory regimes and so they might use that as a as a mechanism as a choke point for the crypto industry talk about the regulatory situation in general because it feels like the crypto industry is um is in in a long series of battles right with in to establish crypto in our nation states like in particular talking about maybe maybe the us are we winning or are we losing this battle in the end does a crypto exchange just get regulated as a bank and have the same sorts of compliance departments causing hundreds of thousands of employees that the old regime had talk to us a little bit about the regulatory landscape right now yeah and i will say that some of this right when you talk about does get regulated as a bank well there's um one part of the sort of like mess comes from that but another part it comes from having a gigantic messy institution that has trouble making sort of decisive calls in general and so i think it's important to sort of like keep those you know uh you know the distinction between those clear um but you know putting that aside for a second like um uh you know i i i think that like it's uh it's less about like do you become regulated not it's more about like is there a reasonable you know path forward and and do you find it and take it and i think that like there's been a lot of cases where like um i where there is you know difficulty um and uh uh and and where like there isn't a clear path forward i think there are other cases where there is one and the biggest thing that i think that like my takeaway has been and that i found is like our goal rather than fighting about whether or not we get regulated as as something that we wouldn't want to be regulated as i think it's like we have to find a proactive way to get regulated that makes sense right we have to find a licensing regime that makes sense that fits the product that is appropriate and that can that can sort of provide for the you know customer protections that that need to be provided for um without uh you know sort of uh you know killing the the use case in the first place um you know and and i think that that is a thing which is doable i i i feel like you know cautiously optimistic about that um about that being possible and about it in practice happening but he's going to take a lot of work like a lot of hard work for us to get there it's it's not going to be something that's automatic and and so i think like that sort of is my core sense of it is you know the the longer that you try and say look we're just not part of any regulatory system the consequence of that is going to be you get stuck into a regulatory system you didn't want to get stuck into yeah our andrew yang's come the podcast and said you're there at the table or on the menu yeah i think that's what you're saying i think that's exactly right like you know just saying like yeah we're we're gonna opt out of being part of a regulatory system that's not an option and and so instead what i think we should be thinking about is like well of the realistic options in front of us which of those seems most reasonable and and likes the best fit and how do we work within you know how do we work to become a part of those in one way or another and and i think that's a big thing that we've been focusing on uh you know over the last um you know over the last year or so and you know i think we're making pretty good progress on i think we have real answers to that question um that we didn't have um at the beginning which i'm pretty excited about well sam you were recently in front of congress i believe right or some congressional panel what was that experience like what's that like just being you know talking to legislators face to face and them seeing not a shadowy super coder but like a real human being who wants to engage in a conversation it was really good and it's really constructive and i think that is a piece of it it's sort of like you know being able to say look i'm here like we're real people and we'd like to be productive we'd like to have a reasonable conversation about what the right pathways for it are for the industry you know this isn't like um i you know this isn't something where like you're never gonna have um any insight into what's going on um being there to educate being there to answer questions and being there to try and collaboratively work on like what's the real answer here right like what is something that solves for the main concerns that regulators haven't have to have and that lawmakers have to have in order to protect uh you know consumers in order to protect our financial ecosystem and i think that there are real answers to a lot of that and i think that lawmakers are really really appreciative of you know seeing straightforward like hey here's the thing we could do that i think would help you know and i think one example is out of like audits for stable points right like everyone was in favor of it and and i think that for all the sort of like you know all the worry and all of the sort of you know back and forth and and and the sort of saber outline on the worries of stable um and and i think you know some amount of perceived lack of interest from some stable coins in sort of responding to that um just having like here's a thing we can do that will like address your core problem let's do it i think reframes the conversation a lot away from being a debate between crypto and regulators and more towards being like how can we allow crypto and regulators to work constructively with each other well we we certainly are observing all the work that you're doing on the regulatory front and uh you know cheering it on and you know fantastic and if you bring the same level of execution that you brought to fdx for the last three years we're going to be in a pretty good place three years from now and that's certainly my hope okay well i want to address maybe another concern when somebody hears this who's uh skewing more towards the decentralization uh maximalist or emotionalist side of things which i gotta confess is probably myself probably david probably many members of the bankless community what we're most worried about cm is that uh an entity or a set of entities like ftx coinbase binance what if they become the new banks what if they become the new goldman sachs of the world okay and then what we've done is this process a multi-decade process of replacing the old boss for the new boss and we still don't have like the self-sovereign decentralized financial system that we've wanted and things consolidate and pretty soon you're back to paying like three percent payment fees again and governments all over the world being able to fl inflate your money supply that's what we're worried about do you think that there's any merit in that worry or how would you respond to that concern i don't think it's a crazy worry i i totally see where it's coming from and i think it's absolutely something that you know we have to watch out for as a community is that we are actually creating something more decentralized um and and more open i think that one big piece of this is um you know when when you have your finance and i think one thing that makes me optimistic there is you know when you have your finances with a traditional financial institution you don't have any control over those uh they're basically stuck there and and i think one of the big goals um you know of you know that i see here for the for the crypto ecosystem is to build a system where yes you do have decentralized islands but where you really are free to move between them where you really are free decide you want that wasn't the right one for me um i'm gonna move my assets to another one and you can just do that with the click of a button that you can do it to your own and that it that they sort of like you know startup cost or building a new one is not prohibitively high um you know for becoming a new player in the space um that you don't have these gigantic centralized moods and i think a big part of ensuring that is making sure that it's not you know we're not in a position where like you know the uh you know in order to be able to participate at all in you know the the crypto ecosystem um that uh you know that you have to um get acceptance from the existing players right like and i think we are sort of in that position right now with a lot of traditional um finance where if you want to become a part of the system right if you want to what you need you need to get accepted by the bank um you need for for banking um you know if you want to be uh an exchange you need brokers to connect you with you if you want to be a broker you need the exchanges you need the people firms to connect with you um and there's this gigantic chain of like you know breaking into this is very difficult um and even once you do it's very hard for people to switch to using your service if they're previously using a different one and i would love to you know see a system where at the very least it's people not only have choice but have the actual practical ability to change where they are to move where they are um and for new entrants to be able to get into space and and have a real second impact there and i think we should make sure as regulation um sort of rolls out here that it allows for that and that it doesn't create impenetrable much or penetrable in theory but but not in practice modes well the ability for users to permissionlessly and freely exit from systems i think it's going to become increasingly important in these 20 20 decades and i think that is how crypto will ultimately win the hearts and minds of its users of the people but also there's the battle of hearts and minds of just everyone else which brings us to a topic that we wanted to i wanted to bring up for a while which is uh the ftx super bowl ad which i think did a fantastic job of like just having a major major pr win for the entire crypto community because imagine for for those that that uh haven't watched the ad you're gonna have to go watch it on youtube but it's basically a series of inventions being made the wheel the light bulb indoor plumbing and there's always this old balding gray-haired incumbent individual who's always like nah that's never going to work and i just would love to be a fly on the wall of so many households in america in the world who have the kids of the family being all gung-ho about crypto and nfts and then the parents being like no it's just a scam and having them watch having to watch that ad together as a as a family this is i think this ad did a really good job of just putting crypto in a really positive light on perhaps the biggest stage that we have every single year which is the super bowl and so sam i'm wondering if you could just tell the listeners a little bit of the story of how that ad came to be uh like who produced it where'd the idea come from just tell us a little bit of the backstory of this yeah i mean it was i i'm a huge fan of it and super appreciative that you know evan helped put it together um it originally came um and basically we you decided that we wanted to at least hopefully probably do do a super vlog that we at least want to seriously consider doing one and um you know we sort of started brainstorming ads we didn't like immediately come up with anything we loved and we reached out to some agencies um to help many of them came back with kind of mediocre um i you know i i guess there's like one thing yeah one of the first serve this one for a super bowl but one of the first things you represented was like a graphic of like trevor lawrence like holding a football thing like ftx the cheapest way to buy crypto and it's kind of like it's okay i mean it's not like i'm not offended by it but like i feel like if you told our graphic designer it's like hey you got like 24 hours and like make it a poster that's like roughly what they would come back with you know you know and and so it sort of felt like all right that that doesn't seem super exciting or or impressive like that's you know not not sold on that one um i and you know basically went back to a bunch and said hey can you like you know do a better job maybe like how i like a great job you know like we'd love to see a great if we could i think there are some essentials like all right yeah we can do that i mean query why it didn't happen at the beginning but okay whatever um and um i i know came back with some more and eventually one of them came back to us with the you know with with the larry david idea and any students we thought were like yeah that that that's the one um and the fact that that he was really excited to do it was an important part of this for us as well you can tell when someone's excited and whether or not it just would not have been a great it wouldn't have been a great ad if he wasn't excited wait so the the ad agency came back and said hey here's this pitch for an ad larry we've already talked to larry david and larry david's on board yeah wow well that's a good ad agency does larry david hold crypto is he like uh is he into the scene here not that i know of um uh i mean he obviously you know he he he would be the expert in the end on this but i i don't i don't know him told crypto i suspect he does not um and uh which is also an interesting part of this that this is not like um it wasn't that he came back and said like oh i would just love to do a crypto ad like i've been that that's all i ever wanted you know i i think it much more was like you know i do this ad in particular and thinking like this is really cool larry david was perfectly cast for that ad like the role the role of just saying no is just like so perfect for him he's a perfect fit for it you know and and and the nice things that put him in a position where he like he'd not be endorsing crypto we didn't want him to be endorsing for that that's the whole point right right like and i think he felt like yeah that you know that that that's like me you know i'm like i'm the guy saying no to that whether or not i'm sure it's really not the right thing to do so uh were you watching the super bowl i i was actually at the super bowl oh you're at the super bowl okay so you were not seeing the ads you were not seeing the television ads unfortunately no i saw them afterwards you know on youtube well but fortunately you're at the super bowl so that's even better in the ntl i'll take it so uh what were your your thoughts on the coinbase ad i think it was really trying to accomplish a very different thing than what our ad was oh certainly and and and i think that like i mean there are a lot of ways of seeing that but it but i think one of them is like um you know if you look at like what was the impact of those ads um you know looking at sort of like between before and after the ads i think that like um coinbase had a massive massive jump in like the ranking of the app store like they said a ton of signups that day and i think that was an incredibly effective ad for getting people to sign up for coinbase um and and you know good for them um that's a reasonable thing for them to be focusing on some might say more than just a reasonable thing um it wasn't what our primary focus was like our primary focus rather than trying to get people to sign up for the platform you know our primary focus was how do we spread who we are and who the industry is as a brand in a way which is going to stick with people and and and so from that perspective you know the flip side they say that massively more registrations than we did um but we got um you know our twitter ftx officials twitter following like doubled or i think drew by 50 um over the course of that ad and coinbase is basically didn't budge and so they said like totally different impact on those two metrics um and i think that actually does a pretty decent job of summarizing like what the difference was between their their amps and i think they were both good execution for what they were going for but i think we're aiming for very different things in coinbase was i do think there's something to be said for um you know the the narrative public good of crypto that you just contributed towards with that with that ad and you know i think people in crypto are appreciative of it i sent it to family members and such and we've talked about it a couple times on bankless already but you know the the super bowl ad is kind of just the start of i feel like this renewed effort or this you know major push in 2021 of ftx uh breaking into mainstream in ways i didn't anticipate crypto would would break into last year which is like a tom brady endorsement like how do we do that and how did you guys do that um you bought up the naming rights to the ftx arena so this is where the miami heat reside i believe yep and uh you you took it from american airlines so bye-bye airlines hello crypto industry um you've also more recently i think in the last week or two just hired a head of luxury brands like there's now someone who works as a luxury brand type ambassador at ftx which is interesting this almost makes me think of like a little it's a little apple-esque of you to to go and do that but all of this feels like it's a break out of the the finance geek culture that crypto has sort of been in a little bit and breaking into mainstream um what's the unified approach to all of this is this uh a strategy of some sort yeah i mean i think the way you put it is pretty reasonable which is like look you know we like as this becomes more mainstream i think that there's gonna be a lot of areas of intersection between crypto and and culture and the rest of the world um i don't think we know what all of those are going to be right now like we're still making these up as we go and i think the world still is and and so a lot of this frankly is you know we don't know where things are going but wherever it is we want to be there we want to be ready and want to start to build those bridges before they're necessary and so i think that's an important piece of what we're aiming for here um and you know i would be surprised if there wasn't significant intersection between crypto and fashion and i think that's a lot of the reason that that you know that was an area that we wanted to get um you know i start to to put a footprint down in even though i don't know what that is going to actually look like in the end so we talked about how ftx is kind of leaning into being a financial super superstructure but is it also trying to get into culture too i think so and and again i don't want to be too specific about how because i just don't know like it's very much a uh you know we are we're making this up as we go the whole world is but um i but but but i i think that it is like there's going to be something there i think nfts are probably the most obvious play um and i think that we want fgx to be a part of of that culture i think we want the crypto industry to be a part of that culture as well and and i think that like you know to the extent that we can start to build those bridges now um i think that that can do a lot of good because it gives us more time to prepare it gives the industry more time to prepare to start building great products having great ideation before having to on on the center stage and it's always shitty when you you sort of have to like uh you know wing it or uh you know when uh when when the whole world is watching i'm curious about nfts i know you guys launched an nft platform not too long ago uh do you own any nfts yourself are you like are you personally excited about it i don't generally personally invest myself i think it's all all through like you know companies um but i and the other thing that i will say is i am completely non-visual as a person i just like i i don't i don't know i was born without that gene or something and and so you know from my perspective like i i sort of don't like i don't personally um think that i am the target audience for many of these nfts um that doesn't mean they're not cool it just means like they aren't built for me um or or maybe i'm not built for them um so you know i think i i really like sort of nfcs that have some interaction with the outside world like whether you're talking about um you know tickets whether you're talking about songs whether you're talking about um you know achievements or something like that um you know something where i i feel like it's meaningful that i have this energy or that the nfc gives me some some meaning um or represents some meaning or some object or something that those are the types that i'm personally i think like more excited for but i but i also acknowledge that i'm wrong on that point the world has you know and marx have you definitively decided i'm wrong and i'm comfortable with that can we uh talk a little bit more about something we uh we maybe alluded to at the beginning it's not it's not only crypto becoming mainstream but like crypto people are sort of becoming part of mainstream as well and uh the the story of how quickly you've accrued a significant amount of wealth is like a story that's reverberating outside of crypto circles as well because you've become one of the wealthiest under 30 individuals ever and i guess i can't say that now that you are 30. sure sbf uh happy birthday again but you've also pledged to to donate a significant amount of this wealth to charity um but you're already one of the wealthiest people in history in that in that age range 30 and under um where did all of this wealth come from so i mean we're in crypto and like we understand how quickly these sorts of things can happen was this from some of the you know 2017 type training that you did uh is it is it mainly ftx tell us about the story of going from like you know relatively i i don't know what your pre-crypto life was but more modest amount to something that's now in the in the tens of billions i mean the the biggest piece of this was um uh is is ftx and um you know i think that like it's a lot of this is tied up in how well ftx does as a as a company which obviously is also tied up to some extent um i you know around uh uh how how the industry does um i i think that like you know the uh i think there are a lot of pieces that one of which is like things are scaling in a way that the world hasn't seen things scale before um and and i think that you're seeing sort of things grow to an extent that just wasn't is much more rapid than what people are used to um uh and and the whole world is speeding up i think social media is a big piece of this the rate at which the world can decide on something can move into something new um is is a lot faster um but you know i think overall like i'm uh uh you know obviously it's it's been been cool to see and um you know really grateful for everyone and everything that helped me get there um uh it's you know i think it's been sort of shocking from the outside to see how quickly a lot of this has happened and to see it just sort of like everything snowball on dovetail i think from the inside it's been a little bit less shocking i think from the inside frankly it feels a little bit more like you know well you know you straightforwardly sort of like follow through on what seems like a promising direction and ultimately gets you to where you're going like really does feel from the inside perspective more like what's been going on um and so uh it's and it feels less magical and more sort of like you know yeah that's what we're hoping was gonna happen you know glad that it worked out um and glad that we're able to execute on it sam i want to uh take a peek into uh the person of sbf uh uh there's a general theme not not amongst everyone but generally a theme of uh sometimes people come into crypto and they have a background of like world of warcraft or starcraft or like you know real-time role-playing games uh but then there's also the the the niche of people that came into crypto because they played poker uh there's a lot of poker players in crypto uh do you have any pre-crypto hobbies that just alluded itself alluded themselves to crypto very very well you know i played games i mean i i've always liked video games i've always played them a decent amount and i certainly think that there's some tie in there um you know i i was a traitor obviously you know before this and you know really enjoyed that i think that was a really good fit for me as a person as well um and uh and so you know that was great too um and then i think the last thing is just on the donation side that you know i've always been looking for um you know how i can have the most positive impact on the world and i think a lot of that is you know flowing through where i can be giving my money to can you tell us a bit more sam about um you're giving pledge and what you're planning to give to yeah totally so you know in the end i want to i give away basically everything that that i make and um you know that that sort of comes from a number of of angles potentially um you know we're probably gonna be giving somewhere between 100 million in a billion this year um through the ftx foundation um and you know part of that is animal welfare part of that is global poverty um a big piece that is looking at what might really change the long-term vision of the future um and uh uh you know i i think that like um there are trillions of people who might live which is a lot of people it's a lot compared to how many people are alive now and so a lot of this is thinking about like what what could we do today that might actually have long-term impact that might change the lives of you know the rest of the world and sort of the direction of the rest of the world and a lot of that looks like what can we do that has sort of reliable impact um that sort of you can trace out to a long way from here um and i i don't think there's like a single obvious easy answer to that i i think it's complicated but i think that there are things that we can do i don't think it's hopeless and i think that like you know thinking about uh you know what we can do from the uh you know i think politics is one thing that that probably has like persistent impact i think that pandemics i mean we got lucky that kobe wasn't more deadly than it is we might not get that lucky next time we were not prepared for this one we're not going to be prepared for the next one unless we change something and you know i think they might get nastier over time and and so i think that that's sort of another area where we should really be focusing on on getting prepared sam as we uh as we start to wrap this up and it's been a pleasure to have you on i you gotta ask about since you're a trader of course and you still live in the world of crypto about the uh the 2022 crypto market so far because uh it's it's already felt like a year has gone by and we're only in like early march uh what is your outlook for crypto in 2022 are the good times over is this a bear market is this 2018 again there's talk of a global recession what do you think how is this going to shake out you know i don't know for sure we'll see but i think that it's been um uh it's been a weird time because on the one hand we have sort of like potential changes in monetary policy right where where we have like you know interest rates potentially starting to come up and i think that that probably is bad for crypto prices in the same way that the last two years were good for for crypto prices on the other hand we also have global conflict right i mean this sort of like story of the earth so far as in russian ukraine and well that that might be bad for equity markets i think there's a sense in which can be good for for european markets because europa can play a really important role in providing you know financial access to ukraine and i think we've already seen that playing out to some extent so far and and so i i think that there may be a bit of a recalibration there about what correlations people are actually expecting especially when we see for instance commodities diverging from uh equities which we've seen so far um this year and which is very different than what we saw the previous year so i don't think the world knows for sure how this all plays out and i've sort of like been taking what we've seen so far with a healthy dose of skepticism how do you think this plays out because you're right i you know i haven't been in crypto at a time where i've seen things do this right you commodities diverging from equities never seen a like decently sized global conflict uh it's all a very weird time and unique time how do you think it plays out i don't know but i think there's a compelling argument that that like crypto should be out performing here and and i sort of would expect it to i think it still might um and um and i think it might ease in a little bit of the move towards a more digital world if it is a bear market or the state that we're in right now um what should what should traders do anyone who's kind of seeking alpha in this type of a market how should they react i mean look i don't i won't give financial advice but i think what i'd say is you know whenever we're in more of a bear market the single most consistent thing is that like what falls off the hardest are assets where it was never clear why their price they weren't you know how they were in the first place they sort of like mean stocks the super growth assets that aren't backed by like really solid fundamentals i think those things are are things that that you know tend to not perform so well in in bear markets i i would expect to see some of that here um i think you know outside of that like um that doesn't mean i don't want to necessarily say you should sell them right because like things can recover like this isn't necessarily permanent either but i think that's definitely a pattern that i would expect to see play out and that i think we already have seen play out to some extent um you know i i think beyond that like you know basically looking at like um you know what are uh uh what are sort of you know thinking longer term with with the positions that you're taking right like not thinking like anything i do it better be good by like a billion percent by next week or it's a failure like that's not the market we're in right now you know and i think it's going to serve a dumb market to be in frankly and and there are things to be said for not being in that market um and so i i think yeah just taking a longer term view is is going to be really important for navigating it sam as uh we may be close with with this question you you already answered what you think ftx will look like in five years i'm curious what's your perspective where will crypto be five years from now if you zoom all the way out so i don't know for sure but here's the optimistic take the optimistic take is that it will be half of finance will be crypto based um and um you know both sort of like native crypto assets but also other assets will be tokenized um that social media will be starting to break in there that you know digital universes metaverses whatever you want to call them will be tied together by blockchain rails with nfts um that that everyone will have um a crypto enabled wallet um and uh and that it'll be a global phenomenon and and i think that's like that that's sort of i think the optimistic take and i think there's a real chance of that but i do think that it's dependent on us as an industry playing our cards right and that you know if we if we it up it may not happen that's great to to end on hopefully this will all be okay i'm definitely bullish going into this year but on a longer term time horizon and bankless listeners we hope you are as well sbf thank
