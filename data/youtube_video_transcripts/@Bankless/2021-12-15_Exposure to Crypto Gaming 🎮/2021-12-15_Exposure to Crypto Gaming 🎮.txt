crypto native wants to get exposure into crypto gaming what do they do because it's different do i buy a token do i buy an item do i buy digital property do i get equity exposure give us a sense there's a few different places to invest as you mentioned players will move to the place where they're going to get the most return how the token is structured in the game economy is really important and therefore for an investor you should probably read the white paper and understand exactly how the economy is structured and then on the asset value side of it i actually think some of these games are starting to realize that quickly appreciating in-game asset nfts are directly detrimental to the retention of players because they quickly become unaffordable right and so therefore like there's new mechanics around plays and men's you know releasing potentially millions of these items and trying to keep these asset prices down yeah it's really interesting i guess there's no clean answer to the question of do i do tokens do i do items and it really depends
