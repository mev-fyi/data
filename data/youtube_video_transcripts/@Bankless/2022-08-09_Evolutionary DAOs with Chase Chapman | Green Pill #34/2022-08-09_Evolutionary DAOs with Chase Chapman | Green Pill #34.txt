what up coordination today on the pod we have chase chapman who is a governance researcher at orca protocol a podcast host on the other side podcast and is just a prolific presence on twitter talking on twitter about evolutionary organisms positive sum games ways that we can build better societies with web 3 dows as cities social wear and trustware are some of the themes that we cover in this episode and we go deep on digital identity as a means of creating more positive some games in the web3 ecosystem which we view as an evolutionary organization or organism an ecosystem in which you have a simple instruction set that is evolving over time into a more complex emergent ecosystem so bitcoin solved the byzantine generals problem and created digital money from there a more complex ecosystem of the internet of money has grown out of it and we talk about this generality about simple instruction sets replicating into more emergent complex and impactful ecosystems and then leverage those thoughts about to think about how we can talk about building a better society with web3 the analogies between dals and and cities network states in nation states we also talk about social wear which is creating trust through human relationships and trustware mechanisms that create assurances through technology so a multi-vectored conversation in which we're trying to figure out how to regenerate the world using identity trustwear all of these themes and just a really great episode i think that you're really going to enjoy it i enjoyed it i'm still sort of buzzing after the conversation that i had with chase and i i hope that you're going to be buzzing too after this episode so without further ado i give you chase chapman of orca protocol the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser still lets you use any crypto wallet extension you prefer giving you the choice and flexibility for the web3 world opera lets you view and manage all of your assets across all the blockchains all at once and offers seamless multi-chain support between ethereum bitcoin polygon binance chain and other evms and layer twos but opera goes even deeper than that opera has a built-in home page for crypto natives with the opera crypto corner with price charts news feeds nft updates to make sure you are always on top of your game and it even has discord and telegram integrated natively into the browser that's crazy opera is truly building the battle station for the crypto world check out opera both on mobile with android and ios apps

hello hello i've been following your work for a long time really excited to have you on the pod and to talk about your most recent work so uh tell me about evolutionary organization yeah um so i guess a little bit of context on where evolutionary organizations came from i was at dao nyc talking with john hillis from cabin and a few other um people who are just sort of building and operating in the space and it it really started to come up this idea of gaul's law which i actually had never heard of but it's basically this principle that complex organizations can only evolve from organizations that came before them that were simpler and it really stuck with me because i think sometimes in the dow ecosystem and crypto more broadly we try to design these like incredibly complex systems whether that be to economics incentive systems whatever and when you try to do that from the start you're usually going to end up with systems that kind of suck for a variety of reasons one of the big ones is just that any sufficiently complex system makes a set of assumptions that you're basically designing for so you think people need to act in x-way and so you then create an incentive mechanism to incentivize that type of behavior and the more of those you include you just start to build this like massive system that you have no idea if it's even solving the right problems and so something that we've talked a lot about at orca is like flexibility of organizations and all that stuff and so we really started to think about how can we build these evolutionary organizations that abide by gaul's law where you sort of say we're going to evolve from a simpler system into a more complex one test our assumptions constantly and then see what works for us and that doesn't mean like ignoring all of the stuff that we've learned in the history of humankind organizing but it does mean not trying to overly engineer something when it just doesn't make sense right that's so beautiful i mean i think that it seems like it's just a recognition of reality for you so gaul's law is that complex organizations can only emerge from simpler organ ecosystems and then basically recognizing that means recognizing that we don't have perfect foresight there's going to be information that we need to acquire into the system design that we do not know at the front of it so just launch something simple and then iterate towards something more complicated and in an evolutionary sort of like epoch way do you think that it's better to have the clock speed on that evolutionary iteration uh longer clock speed or a shorter talk clock speed like are we evolving daily weekly quarterly yearly this is a fun that's a good question i think when i think about what gaul's law means in practice and how you build evolutionary organizations i think depending on what it is that you're testing you want to have different time frames for it so a good example of this that john from cabin has talked quite a bit about publicly is the evolution of their resource allocation system so they started with having people who were basically like full-time cabin or who they paid basically to say you're gonna do work here you'll figure out what that work is and then they did another version um i can't remember what exactly that version looked like i think it was um maybe it was project based and now they're on to a new version so that made sense to do over probably like six month time horizons maybe it was three months um i think when you're doing things like that where you need to test out and you have an experiment that lasts for a certain amount of time that totally makes sense um if you're doing something like communication uh styles and things like that it probably makes sense to do that faster rather than like waiting six months to see if you and i are effectively communicating so i think it really depends on what structure you're talking about and um how easy it is to change and how much data you actually want on whether or not it's working got it um yeah i i think that you're right you want to have the clock speed match this sort of market or system that you're trying to study and probably have it be as fast as possible as is possible for that that ecosystem like you're studying the bull bear cycle the super cycle you can only get data every four years but if you're studying at a much faster cycle you can you can probably cycle things faster is that fair yeah exactly and actually i think it gets into you get into a really uh something i've been thinking more about that i think is really interesting which is it's actually kind of hard sometimes to tell when you need to end the iteration of an experiment like once you have the momentum it's actually a little bit too easy to keep with that version as opposed to saying let's bookend this and try something new acknowledging yeah exactly so i think there's also something really interesting to trying to kind of define those things up front and say in three months we're going to reassess this not because it needs to be like perfect but we need to acknowledge when maybe it's time for something new yeah um it's hard for me to hear this talk and and not relate it back to my own experience building git coin over the last five years i mean we basically launched it the goal was to grow open source software and the first experiment that we sort of aimed at that product market fit was doing bounties which is like if you do x you will get y coins and building a market for that but then we realized bounties weren't all that because they were too transactional we tried to launch this mft called kudos where it was like a hallmark card i could send you a kudos and say good job um and then we launched bitcoin labs and an ad network and kernel and we landed on git coin grants as like the final thing and then even when we were there even when vitalik was blogging about bitcoin and we're like oh we have product market fit we're like oh wait it needs to be a dow and we have to rewrite the entire thing from scratch and so there was another epoch from there and the dow is entered in this cadence with the market it's an evolutionary organism where every season there is a bitcoin grants round they learn from it they do governance and then they do another one so there's like a metronome of that clock speed that's every quarter and so i i don't know it's interesting to think about that as an evolutionary organism i'm curious any comments on what i just prompted with git coin given my object level experience or do you have another example of an evolutionary organization that you've been involved in no i think that's really i think that the get coin example is really like a great illustration of of evolutionary orgs and what i think is most interesting about some of those pieces is that in any like complex system that you're trying to establish some organization within you basically have to keep poking it to see what the response is so like this is why mvps work so well in general is there a minimum amount of effort and energy you're putting into something just to get feedback from a market and i think it's that constant willingness to evolve and test and poke the system and see what it does that not only allows you to get to the point where you've worked you're working on something that's um really beneficial for the ecosystem more broadly and you get more of that feedback and you get better at it um but it also i think really allows you to understand where you sit within a system that's changing a lot so like when i whenever i think about dows one of the things that i think they are when they're done well good at is uh adapting to their environment which i think is really useful when you have an environment like crypto where like things around us are constantly changing regulatory stuff is changing the way that the public sees cryptos changing and when you have the ability to constantly poke at that environment around you and say hmm what's the current status of this environment what's working what isn't um that is where you end up with an organization that actually can deeply understand its environment without needing to have some like wild foresight that you know most people are never going to have i mean at some point i think we're talking about the difference between empirical knowledge and a priority knowledge a priori knowledge being derived from theoretical deduction so like the realm of math science uh first principles thinking and then empirical knowledge which is testing a your status against the world uh type of thing and one of the things that really springs up for me is that one of the theories that i hold high about the information age is that network systems uh work well in a world that's complex and is evolving quickly because you have edges of the network that can test and then report back to the rest of the network whereas hierarchical systems are very good at people putting people on the front line and just projecting thrust in one direction where it's already known in the state of the world so you're deriving out of that dow's should be good at adapting to their environment just basically means that they're a network system that's really good at probably both empirical knowledge and a priority knowledge depending on the clock speed there where does that land for you yeah i think so this is like a really fun distinction because i think what you what you actually want to do is find the balance between both of those things i think oftentimes in the discourse around dowse we get really caught up in this idea of like a network that's taking this like empirical approach where they are getting some sort of response and often you lack some sort of clear directionality like i think that is something that if you looked only at crypto twitter how people talk about dows you would often see dow's lack like strategic directionality basically because they're constantly just reacting to their environment or to individuals who are emerging in that environment um on the flip side you'll see people say well companies have this but they lack x y and z and so i think what becomes really like this this fun thing that you need to do in orgs like daos and i'm curious if this lands for you from the git coin perspective is say here's a container where our goal is this from first principles thinking so maybe it's um making sure that we're funding public goods for example and we'll see from getting to point a to point b what that actually looks like but like this is the direction we're going and then using more of the empirical approach to figure out how do we get there and i think like oftentimes dow shy away from defining that direction because people think that means that you're doing some sort of top-down whatever the reality is if you don't do that a network has no way to know where it's supposed to be growing directionality yeah exactly at times has lack generality or sorry direction-ness and it's just grown in all different directions like an overgrown garden so that resonates yeah yeah i mean the way i used to visualize this is it's almost like you have a treasure map and between you and the treasure is the there's a field and then there's mountains and then you have to fort a river and also then there's some bad guys you got to fight and then uh you go around the windy bend and you go to pick up the treasure chest and you realize oh wait that was just a phantom treasure chest and there's another map inside and you have to go repeat the whole process again and so just like thinking about it as an expedition almost like a dnd style thing is has been how i've maintained my sanity or lack thereof as it's been multiple iterations of figuring out how we're going forward so i know that that visual metaphor is is kind of how i view the exploration of a design space that's really not a visual thing it's like an intellectual frontier oh yeah and i think you need that because if you don't end up having that like one of the one of the elements that i think is most important when we think about like autonomy i don't like using the autonomous part of dao's as like automated i think that makes sense i it's just not something else it does it's not in some now yeah and i think it requires a lot of experimentation before you automate things but a lot more commonly i think is autonomy at the contributor level and thinking about how can you empower contributors to be more autonomous and i think one of the biggest ways is knowing what their treasure chest is so that they can go and fight the bad guys and know which ones are good and bad and like without any of that directionality it becomes actually really really challenging for um individuals who want to and have the skills to move towards some positive outcome to actually step up and do something and you either create like a power vacuum or complete chaos and neither of those things are good yeah and sometimes you can't tell the difference between the power vacuum and the complete chaos and the autonomy that's where things get more confusing when i was a manager of engineers in web 2 we used to always talk about mastery autonomy and purpose for each individual so basically inventing a area of autonomy in which a contributor has mastery which is really about agency you don't if you don't have mastery autonomy purpose you don't have age like agency over creating an outcome and and so the combination of not just autonomy but mastery of a skill set and a purpose a direction that you're going on is what we always that was at least the buzzword in web too so i don't know if we're trying to approach the same sort of environment in web 3 with dallas oh yeah i think so i mean to me that's like the ingredients for people to be able to do work that they that actually ends up having outcomes that are in line with what's going on in the barter ecosystem something that i always think about is in in networks like tcpip or or i suppose you protocols might be a better term but um tcp or even blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum you have like a you're able to have this decentralization partially because there's a very clear set of things that nodes in these networks of protocols can do like they're not there's not a bitcoin node that's creating a marketing campaign you know like it's got a very clear set of things that it's doing and there's a very clear sense of right or wrong in that because of cryptography and so i think what's interesting about this idea of like purpose what were the other two purpose mastery autonomy and purpose mastery autonomy and purpose is those are almost like your sets of very clear um things that you as a node in this network can do and if you know the answer to those or you have an idea of what those things actually are i think it becomes a lot easier to act as an independent node in the context of this greater network and without that clarity i think you end up with a very um a very dysfunctional network that actually ends up having all these centralization points which aren't bad i think like you can have centralization points in taos um but i do think a lot of centralization points actually often is a reflection of ineffective ways of making it clear what individuals can and should be doing right well you know what's interesting to me about your example about the bitcoin nodes and how none of them can run a marketing campaign is that marketing campaigns they're just an emergent effect of people owning bitcoin so not everything that your dial does needs to be encoded in the fork in the core protocol is my sort of takeaway and you know bitcoin started as this very it's it's golf's law it's a simple organism that evolved into thinking that it's state post nation state money and the marketing campaign is an emerging effect of that organism i'm using organism and organization interchangeably i hope that doesn't plus you or anything but but it's just an emergent effect and that's the most interesting thing to me yeah no i mean i think organism and organization are probably um very fair to sort of hold equal in this in this conversation but thanks for the do you think yeah it probably is um i do think this this idea of emergence is one that i am constantly trying to wrap my head around aaron dignan who wrote a book called brave new work um which is fantastic yeah i love the ready um it talks a lot about emergence and how like emergence can only come from very clear systems and of course like the perfect example of this is something like prices in markets where in free markets it's actually a lot of people making decisions at a localized level that creates the emergence of like a price of you know a gallon of milk for something like that um and so i do think there's like a really interesting dynamic at play between intentionality at the local level and emergent outcomes at the sort of i'll call it national level only because there's not a better term for it but let's say like dow wide level um i'm still trying to figure out how easy or possible it is to design for emergence um at the national level and doing that at the local level like i think that's a pretty interesting challenge and that gets to the whole gall's law point again which is just like you know you might know that you want the outcome that is emergent figuring out what the actual local decisions that need to be made to get there are is like pretty challenging like that's a lot of computation and prediction that i think is very hard to do yeah yeah um i think that you know what i love about what you said about emergence at the national level and intentional outcomes at the local level is that you're describing a bottoms-up system it creates immersion outcomes at the top from the actions of the actors at the bottom which is kind of part of the whole reason that we're here is to create bottoms up local coordination around our shared needs 100 yeah and i think like this is where you get into um what i think are some pretty interesting dynamics happening in the ecosystem of governance more broadly right now which is just how do we think about things like context and who has the context and knowledge to make certain types of decisions and how do we think about that more broadly in where i think daos are going which is basically like i see daos is the vehicle for a more democratic internet and i think what that ends up getting to is if we're living our lives on these platforms um rather than like in physical spaces we're spending way more time online then what does it actually look like to engage in these types of systems for like your average person and i don't know what the right answer is but i think as we get a much better idea of what it looks like to make these local decisions and have context on them um we're going to be able to design much better systems that normal people will actually be able to engage with beautiful yeah i think there's a lot of themes that we share about having more democratic internet for someone who's extremely online what is their digital democracy high resolution collective intelligence experience look like which is actually just a trojan horse into the second half of this episode which i wanted to talk about regen stuff so how do we build a better society with web3 how do we green pill more people into creating regenerative bottoms up systems there's so many threads we can pull here but i'm curious which ones you want to go down i think there's a lot um well i think more broadly the question of how we think about um a a society that has net positive outcomes that we all engage in is like a big question in my mind taking a step back in general i think it's important to be like rooted and grounded in this idea of the goal is not for everyone to get rich and the goal's not for all of these different things that i think if you looked at crypto twitter sometimes feel like um it's actually to build a society that feels better to exist in and to inhabit and ideally you know also avoid some like doomsday scenario that feels like it might be our future if we're not careful um and so i think that that in general is is where i come from from a grounded perspective and then i think what becomes fun about that is really thinking about how do we design systems that enable that and enable people to have a say in in how that actually comes to be totally yeah i mean one thing i want to zero on in that you said is that the goal is not to get rich it's to build a society that feels better to exist in and that sort of reminds me of this this this meme that that david hoffman and i've been playing with ethereum is not here to make you rich ethereum is here to make you free and i'm wondering you know there's a little bit of a chicken under the egg thing here maybe but it feels like the financial incentives if they're designed in a pro-social way are just a shelling point to create the society that feels better to exist in and i'm wondering how you think about the relationship between those two things is one the chicken and the other the egg or is is it more directional than that it's interesting because when i think about like the the people who i'm friends with like just people who are digitally native don't really care about crypto um i think this is probably wrong but i'll say it out loud to share my train of thought well maybe we can evolve past it yes we can start simple and evolve part of me thinks that we've attracted the people who are interested in financial gain at this point like i don't actually think that's true but i think when i anecdotally talk with friends of mine the idea of like getting rich or even the idea of building a new financial system is no longer interesting to them like that's not what gets them excited i think what gets them excited is the idea of digital co-ops which is how i describe dows or creating opportunity for artists who typically have not had access to these like crazy art markets for a variety of reasons and so i kind of think the the whole idea of like financial upside as the shelling point is definitely true for some people but i actually think that the shelling point is going to be different for different groups of people and that's also going to evolve over time which is really exciting to me like i think that is that that speaks to the use cases you know everyone's doing those dumb use case threats but truly the the fact that we've begun to do things like what git coin is doing where we're actually funding public goods and like all of these real examples of ways in which web 3 is making the world better and that's actually what i think is going to be a bigger shelling point for a lot of people who have not already been onboarded into web3 you know it's interesting as you're saying that it's different to different people and i feel like in a way that's one of the paradoxes of a global ledger is that we can now we now have this open source global ledger that anyone can program and if you can program your values into your money then there's going to be these local pockets of emergent bottoms up values that come up and there's going to be people who care about it for the getting rich part and there's going to be people who care about the getting the creating more freedom part and then there's going to be people who are fighting it because they just are benefited by the old system and it's really it and when i when i articulate it in that way or at least try to articulate it it feels like it's almost a mirror that we're holding up as like a lens into looking back at ourselves as humanity and what are the values that we want to program into our money systems from here yeah and it's so i think where this gets really interesting is um also john hillis is someone who clearly has been influencing my thinking lately because i keep referencing him but he's got so many good thoughts on this from cabin um i was talking to him a while ago about this idea of like the blockchain as the leviathan sort of where you know you used to have the state that was sort of like um which was often monarchy that is like this enforcing um power that said you have to act in accordance with these laws otherwise we'll punish you and i think what's become really interesting about blockchain is that actually you are able to locally encode values and design patterns that you want to live by into these like specific um currencies in some cases but in other cases like communities and governance systems and almost like societies and of course i think this is this gets into some apology stuff around like the network state where actually you can choose where in this like vast digital landscape you want to live basically and each has their own local instantiation of laws and currencies and all this stuff um but i do think that's actually coming back into this idea of um ethereum isn't here to make you rich it's here to set you free i think the freedom of choice that that enables is really powerful and i actually don't think that we as an industry have fully wrapped our heads around what that will look like five to ten years from now yeah i mean i think that it okay so to put it in the evolutionary perspective the simple system that i would describe back to you that you just said is that there's a bunch of we now have this new medium which is the internet of money in which you can program your values into your money and you can build economies and for the first time you've got a bunch of you know it's gone from like only the fed can do that to like a bunch of hipsters in brooklyn can do that and what's the emergent outcome in five or ten years of that mastery autonomy and purpose being given to like brooklyn hipsters or people from any part of the world that have computer science skills in instead of just like the washington elite that would be the emergent like this simple setup that i would say that we're going to play forward right and then the question becomes what a yeah and i think the the big question there if i like if i extend that out this is also something that i still need to think through so take this with a grain of salt but i do think we've seen like populism and the last 10 years of the internet have positive and very negative effects um i think when you put that in the context of what it means to be able to program your own little network state we get into a question of how do we take that phenomenon that we know is probably going to happen around populism being something that can now drive bigger things than just reddit you know reddit pages and stuff like that um how do we create an environment in which we're optimizing for humans thriving ideally from what comes from that instead of something that can be a lot darker obviously we can't always avoid the darker stuff but to me when you play that back my mind is like okay yep that's true also we now need to make sure that we're setting up the right environment such that again when you're when we're evolving from a more simple to complex system the environment in which it exists in that is like creating this container is enforcing positive values instead of letting it go down a really dark path cool so i just googled the word thriving which apparently means to grow or develop well or vigorously and to prosper and to flourish so designing we have a container and what is the system you can set up that event eventually will create the conditions such that the median internet citizen is prospering flourishing growing or developing vigorously is the design space as i would state it back to you yeah exactly and i think things like public goods as a meme and funding public goods the green pill meme the the regen meme like those are all trying to define a container that ideally makes the median of whatever develops something that's a lot more positive as opposed to something that is pretty dark you know another design criteria that comes to mind for me is vitalik always talks in proof of stake about creating a system that is uh economically cheaper to defend than it is to attack so the idea with proof of stake that you have to deposit 32 eth and then you defend that each by validating blocks on it and then you know if you lie to the network then you get slashed and you lose that and so it's much cheaper to defend that system than it is to uh attack that system and that's what's going to create the anti-fragility of it in an adversarial environment which is the world and so the question for me is how do you create a i i mean i think like how do you create a pro-social positive reinforcement loop that's regenerative that is simpler to and cheaper to defend than it is to attack and and one of the things that you know i i i i'm i'm not sure i i i just said like not sure about about how to do that especially in a world where misinformation and um basically like tribalism can basically attack any any pro-social cause and and tear it down uh it just feels like it's easier to attack and like deconstruct institutions right now than it is to create institutions and that's what i worry about within the prism of vitalik's design criteria so i don't know if you have anything to add to that yeah it's pretty interesting because i think when i think about what makes it easier to defend than attack i actually like am drawn back to the root of why we do anything which is again to just make life as a human better and like less bad to put it bluntly um and so i think where where my brain goes around a lot of that stuff is how can we shape an environment where the human experience is something that we're like very openly and intentionally designing for because it is in the benefit of everyone to defend their own mental health and well-being um and physical well-being too and so i don't know what the what the answer is going to be to that obviously i don't think anyone has a good answer but i do think that we ideally if we can build the right norms and much easier said than done but do have this like deep incentive to make it easier to defend than attack because we are effectively defending our own welfare or future welfare yeah i i think that that's beautiful um so shaping an environment where the human experience is is designed for thriving um and i wonder about the the difference between positive some games and rival risk games there when you look at like you know with um dunbar's number it's like you can only have five intimate friends 15 casual friends 50 people in your tribe and 150 that you can have stable social relationships with that's where you're having positive some experiences with people but like my relationship to mark zuckerberg is that he gets 45 minutes of my mind space every morning while i'm like you know uh getting ready for work and then he gets eight dollars worth of advertising revenue on it and then there's a negative externality to my mental health from that so like across the localism of humanity how do we defend or how do we build stronger fortification of our relationships where we hold each other closely and prevent extraction from other people that are going to externalize harm to us is kind of how i visualize that in my head but uh you know i don't know if the rivalrousness of that global competition for resources uh in the externalities that can come from that if that if that brings up anything for you yeah i i would actually be interested to try to understand if larger systems end up relying more on rivalrous um competition as opposed to positive some type games my guess would be potentially because ultimately like some of public goods i would imagine as you scale something um tragedy of the commons tends to happen more often whereas like when you have reputation systems it's probably less common that would be like my gut intuition which kind of makes me think that it is in fact these smaller groups that allow us to act more like our brains we're in sort of intended to act as we developed which is in like tribes of people whereby your malicious behavior is something that is like much less appealing to you as an individual because you're going to be held accountable for it if there's only five people who are also acknowledging your malicious behavior um all that is to say like one of my biggest hopes for web 3 is actually that it makes the internet a lot more local such that we don't have the ability to play this like huge global game of how can i extract the most value from the most amount of people which is very normalized by the way by like you know venture capital sized returns like all of those things have become normalized with the institutions that we've built um and so i think the hope would actually be your point about dunbar's number and all of these pieces that and this is kind of where like what we're doing with pods comes in but i also think in general like ideally dows start to bring some of this about and things like lens and what they're doing with allowing anyone to build different clients and stuff like that um hopefully what that ends up creating is actually like an incentive for people to build local groups as opposed to like massively scaled um systems that honestly aren't really how people were intended to be in relation to one another in the first place yeah that's such an interesting insight and i'm actually season two of the green pill podcast is all gonna be about reputation and identity systems uh so i'm glad that we that we came back to it basically uh the reputation system in local groups in smaller groups um is sort of maybe what creates those positive some games and it reminds me of this this evolution of trust game that that nikki case built a little while ago where you basically can like speed run a bunch of system humans in a system as rational economic agents and at the end of it he reveals that as long as the system has repeat interactions possible win wins and low miscommunication that's the evolution of positive some games that are not rivalrous and the opposite of as negative some games where you're stealing from each other um and it's just so interesting that you you noted that reputation is sort of the the tissue that takes you to being able to have repeat interactions and uh with people because you can track their behavior and their identity and see whether they're rivalrous or not and it sort of makes me feel like we're in this place where web3 is a dark forest and you don't see your counterparty they could be an adversary but then reputation allows you to hold up the light to them and enables repeat interactions and and those win wins so i i don't know what are your thoughts on digital identity and reputation verifiable credentials the whole dsoc meme that's happening right now yeah i think um there are a lot of elements that uh are missing in web3 but i think identity and reputation is probably one of the biggest ones which is why you see so many people trying to build for it um i'm certainly excited about some of the stuff coming out of get coin around like civil resistance and stuff like that i think a couple interesting elements to note about reputation first it's very contextual which i think is going to create some interesting challenges for any like reputation standard where um my reputation with you is going to be very different from my reputation with my parents and it's not because i'm you know acting maliciously or anything like that it's just that the the way that we engage with each other as humans is just incredibly contextual and so i think that's going to be a really important part of this um i think when we think about the way that reputation changes group dynamics it's going to have actually a really positive impact um i think of course we also need to be then something that i think more broadly we need to always be considering is like how does accessibility change some of this stuff so people who have the opportunity to um take actions on chain or you know not sell air drops because they have money that they can live off of like i think we need to be thinking intentionally not only about context uh of like relationships but also about the context of where you're coming from in the the real world and if where you're coming from is you don't have a bunch of money and you struggle to pay rent every month some of your actions on chain are going to make more sense based on that sort of environment you're existing in so um that's another piece that i think a lot about with reputation is just not only how can we think about context around people but also around understanding that everyone's coming from a lot of different backgrounds and that's going to change the moral sort of assignments that we put on things that maybe we shouldn't put moral assignments on yeah yeah i i i worry a little bit about the the arbitrage between all reputation being contextual um and so you know you have these global programmable ledgers and then you've got reputation systems that mirror them and there's pointers between them which allows you to create positive some games between the participants but then i worry about the privacy implications of that because if you put all of the context in a way that's avail you know the example of this is uh you go to the liquor store and you give your id to the the clerk and they see that you're over 21 but they also get your address and there's been examples of like creepy clerks looking up women on facebook and friending them after they get there like really you should just have just have to prove that you're 21 or or older right and so the there's seems like there's a trade-off between reputation being highly contextual and a zero-knowledge proof that exposes that to a contract with the need for privacy and the need to not you know be just walking bank accounts with a bunch of like contextual information that can be used adversarially on top of that uh so what do you think about the that contextual requirement versus the privacy requirement yeah i think evan from disco has been doing a really good job pushing a lot of the privacy elements and thinking about what consent looks like that was originally how i got into cryptos actually i was doing a lot with like uh data analytics from a marketing perspective which was interesting and i ended up falling down the crypto rabbit hole like way deeper than that so it worked out um but i do think like how we think about privacy is going to need to change a lot i mean in general on chain we reveal i think already a lot about ourselves that we're going to look back and say hmm that was strange and um i hope that we have better ways to think about linking different addresses and how we think about that with something like civil resistance and identity so um from that perspective i think too like vitalik i think has presented a really good point for soulbound tokens and i think has had like a very good balance in in his conversation with evan on bank list i think they did a good job representing two different viewpoints and examples where maybe something like soulbound tokens which are a little bit i would say less like consent driven um might make sense same thing with something like verifiable credentials where you actually want this like consent layer i think there's probably going to be examples where you want both um but i also am very grateful for what evan's doing and pushing a lot of that stuff and thinking deeply about it those are exactly the kinds of debates that i think we need to be having because it almost doesn't like the fact that we're having them makes me have a lot of faith that ultimately we will come to a a good very like ideal outcome hopefully um just the fact that those types of conversations are happening period i think is really good would you say it's the simple starting conditions that we need to create some something bigger it's the simple starting conditions and we will evolve from there yeah i hope to create that into a meme i just i think that it's such a uh gall's law uh how can we mimify that the fact that any complex system can be reduced to simple starting conditions and replication instructions i don't know how we mean that but open to suggestion i think the the one thing to point out too on that is like people and people had this response to that piece which i think was really a good point it doesn't mean not learning from old systems and when i say old systems i really mean like systems that have already gone through the process of evolution i think it's really important to learn and borrow from them and figure out what works and what doesn't but again i think it's really hard to test those assumptions unless you start with the most simple ones in your environment to see which of these assumptions from the you know previous system are and are not true for this new system and that's like constantly the question i ask myself in web 3 is just is this a new paradigm or is this the same paradigm popping up in a different context and i think you need to answer that question and then you know evolve from there one of my sort of one of my theories is that we're going to see more skeuomorphic stuff over the near term skeuomorphism just basically means it represents the old world but in the new form uh and then we're going to see more non-skeomorphic stuff which is fundamentally new and emergent of the new medium over time as this thing evolves and right now dals like you said are just kind of digital organizations but when they really become autonomous and they become these networks i think that's when it gets really interesting yeah and i also think as just a side note like something that was really funny about all this this whole trend for anyone who didn't see it it was like here are 10 web 3 use cases that was just like threads that were all over crypto twitter i think the interesting thing about that is actually that like i think web 3 is going to be a lot more of a boiling frog situation which apparently isn't actually true but it's this idea that if a frog is in a boiling pot of water they won't jump out until it's too late to realize that they're in a boiling pot of water and i think for that exact same reason that's what it's going to look like which is just that it's going to start as skeuomorphic people will say why are dows any better than companies but slowly over time as people start getting paid in you know tokens because they're dow contributors d5 will become much more interesting so like slowly i think not only do we evolve but we also start once you've taken the pill you start to realize that oh wow this other system is actually super useful and that evolves in response to it so i think we're creating an entire truly ecosystem yeah got it so more people going down native doing business the the new way in that shelling point of people getting coins pun intended uh is gonna help us evolve over that event horizon what do you think's over the event horizon loaded question of the episode yeah i mean i hope it's a more democratic internet again i think like there's some pretty big questions about what the rise of populism means in the context of all this stuff um you have to find that balance but i hope that it is an internet that feels more like our voices are being heard um something we're doing a lot of thinking on at orca right now is dows as like digital cities basically where we've seen kind of like after the pandemic the decline of of cities in the sense that actually over the last couple of decades we've seen a decline in like job mobility you know it used to be that you could go to new york and that's where all your dreams would come true and there were like real tangible outcomes um where you were much more likely to be better off if you were in a city than if you were living in the rural area you grew up in i think we've seen that decline over time in terms of mobility and i think a lot of the reason for that is actually that we're becoming a lot more global but it's also that we're online all the time and you and i were talking before this like if unless you are really wanting to be immersed in the culture of a city and you want to be physically there like you do have most of the opportunities that you might want um at your fingertips if you have access to a computer and twitter and all that stuff and so i think we're increasingly going to see that these digital spaces feel a lot more like cities and actually start to take on a lot of the characteristics and benefits that cities once provided people which hopefully makes this a lot more accessible to that opportunity a lot more accessible to a lot more people yeah i really like that metaphor because it allows me to take nation states in network states or you know maybe ethereum's a network state or maybe it's approaching biology what he thinks the network state is but you know the way i think about it is that you've got this community of people who are repeat actors in an economic system and they engage in each other over some index with cities it's your geography and on the internet it's like your interests in your niche who you follow on twitter which reddit subreddits you you go to and you have these repeat interactions and economic systems that are indexed on those vectors and from those repeat relationships and the economic incentives and possibilities between those things you get these emergent products or things that come out of them and where this is interesting to me is you know thinking about the dunbar's number thing is i remember living in the east village in the city and meeting people from all walks of life that i would just like see them around the neighborhood we became friends because we were like oh like i've seen you around a lot and and i had that experience living in a city but i also feel like in the ethereum city i have that all the time where i just see people at conferences or on twitter and we have this relationship that evolves or doesn't as we see each other around and i think that's actually why we're doing this podcast together like you're my neighbor in the in the web three city in a way like hey daver i see you around i like your stuff let's let's do a podcast together um and that feels like it's the instruction set for both nation states growing on a geographic vector in network states growing on an interest factor 100 and what's really interesting jane jacobs wrote about this um and one of the one of the interesting pieces when she wrote this about when when she was living in new york um and one of the really interesting pieces is i don't think she had data to back up some of this but since there have been researchers that have studied this and it's turned out to be true which is that the density of a city is actually like a pretty good predictor of innovation in that space for that exact reason where you just have like the entropy of people running into each other and being like hey you seem cool we should chat and then you have this like really interesting mix of ideas and and all that kind of stuff um and so i think as that happens more and more online to your point about like how this even happened um we're gonna start to see a lot of the benefits in these like quote-unquote densely populated you know digital areas um and and so people can choose wherever they want to live but ultimately we'll actually start to see more and more innovation i mean even when you think about like how people typically would meet their co-founders 10 years ago versus now a lot of people i know have met their co-founders through twitter which is a perfect example of that too where that's that's tangible um you know monetary benefits of saying hey we met now let's like start a company and employ people and that i think is pretty wild what i like is that it lets you vibe check uh a little bit like you're not just looking at a resume you have like a walking vibe check in every interaction with someone yeah twitter that is all twitter is it's just a constant vibe check and and synchronizing vibes i think yeah well it's a simple instruction set with many emerging outcomes i think we can there you go immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming

uh one thing i want to probe on is okay so we've got the density of the city equals more innovation so the density of the network state will equal more innovation are there ways that we can more densely interconnect our network state of the ethereum space uh by i don't know say allowing actors to better coordinate with each other to enter positive ex positive games with each other and like the example of this i think is like quadratic funding where it's just like oh i saw chase like working on uh her podcast and i think that it's great i'm gonna chip her a dollar and she's gonna get a hundred dollars because of that you create this density of like is it just density of where where we reside or is there ways to add more coordination to wire it for for more innovation from from there and quadratic funding is maybe just one example but there's probably other coordination protocols that will allow us to to do that also yeah i think there are like two pieces to this so the first before it is even getting into coordination is actually uh diversity of ideas and perspectives is actually i think like an important predictor when we think about innovation in the context of um what you don't want is in in another jane jacobs example she compared um birmingham and manchester and this is like a perfect example manchester was i think very heavy on like manufacturing and then birmingham had like a lot more diversity of industries basically and um manchester ended up declining a lot because and this is what happened with detroit i'm from michigan like outside of detroit this is the same deal um when you have one industry or a set of people who are really reliant upon one specific um industry or thing or coming from that perspective you tend to get a city where the moment that that is not healthy the entire city is like in trouble and you're not going to see as much innovation people are going to leave all this stuff so i actually think one of the big predictors of the how how well a city is doing and how well these digital cities are going to be doing is actually how much can we like interconnect from different parts of the ecosystem and share these different ideas um because any time that that we're really relying upon a specific thing or only using one specific meme as a shelling point like the moment that that meme is no longer exciting to people the entire thing crumbles so i think that's one piece the second piece i think is playing with a lot of different coordination games probably that can actually start to create a lot of like weak ties between things so a really good example of this actually along the quadratic funding um idea is when i donate to get coin grants i'm creating a lot of weak ties to those grants which is actually like a really cool way to say oh and i've done this before like i want to see what some of my friends are donating to because maybe there's something that i missed or maybe um i want to see you know what are they interested in right now and so i think there are some really interesting mechanisms that we can start to play around with to optimize for creating weak ties among a very diverse you know set of of players yeah um grants 1.0 was a centralized monolith that only i knew how to maintain and now we've got a decentralized uh modular tool with well-documented apis and maybe once that's out grants2 is out there we could put that out as a bounty to the community uh look if chase if if you consent to it building an application or an application where if you go to it you can consent to it and it can show you what uh bitcoin grants your community of peers is is funding and and i think that that would be an interesting experiment yeah that would be super cool and that to me is like one of the i mean making these things social i think bitcoin has already done a great job with like tweeting out what you're donating to and really trying to set this standard of people in this ecosystem donate to public goods is powerful and i think that to me going back to this idea of how do we encode a set of values in this container that that hopefully becomes um emergent and full of thriving ecosystems i think it really becomes like how do we build tools that encourage that type of thing and to me that is that's a perfect example of that which is just leveraging social behavior to create better outcomes uh so i i think the the next thing i wanted to ask you about was trustware versus social ware so scaling trust in daos or i guess in in digital cities to continue our our metaphor uh tell us tell us about trustwear and social wear yeah this so i i did not come up with trustworthy where julia and john who are co-founders of orca did um but wrote helped write the piece on it which we went through a lot of iterations of we really like took some time to think on this um but the basic idea behind trustworthy and social wear is when you look at the way the dows are going about things today it feels like we're lacking um terminology to talk about what's on chain and what's off chain because you know human organizations that are leveraging blockchains are not exclusively on chain for the most part and we know they probably shouldn't be like the dow the original dao is a perfect example of this where um part of the reason that it was so challenging was because a lot of people who own the dao token were not going to vote on chain um to sort of stop things when when that was possible and so we know that a lot of things should not be on chain and they can't be if you want an effective organization at the same time it's really important to acknowledge what is on chain and and you know there are important pieces to have so we decided to come up with the labels and julie and john came up with them of trustwear and social wear so trustware is basically um assurances that don't require social relationships to make sure that they are sort of abided by um an example of that would be kevin i send you 500 usdc that's just like cryptographically secured you don't need to trust me you just know that i've sent you that cool so this is like the like when you get those things they're like please send me one bitcoin i'll send it back to you for 1.1 bitcoin that's exploding an arbitrage between trustware and social wear yes exactly yeah that's exactly what it is and then so then social wear is requiring some social trust to have that assurance so when we talk about like these bigger systems versus smaller systems and having this reputation layer that holds you accountable that reputation layer is social wear so that's saying hey i know kevin's probably if we have a multi-sig that's a one of two um so it only requires one of us to sign to execute a transaction um that is me saying i trust you enough to not steal the money and your reputation is probably mostly where i'm getting that from the the example that we use in the article is the difference between like a lemonade stand and a vending machine so a lemonade stand you're using um social relationships and it requires your like presence physically uh ideally to make sure that people don't steal but the most ultimate version of social wear is one where you're not even there and you know some people will have like fruit stands or it's just like hey leave this amount for if you take 12 cantaloupes and they just trust that people will whereas you could have like a vending machine where it is basically impossible to get the thing that you want unless you pay for it um which is a lot more like things being on chain something like a molok dao is a little bit closer to that um the the perfect example of that would be um something more like token holders having to vote on something and like having all these things on chain rather than having like snapshot voting for example which is a little bit more trusting snapshot yeah it almost feels like in some of these scenarios that it's almost like in order to get to social wear it's like trustware plus your relationship is your collateral or your reputation is your collateral is that a fair way of composing social wear yeah i think that's a lot of it um i think when we think about like some of the social wear systems it's your reputation as your collateral um and then also even if you don't have a perfect reputation system it's kind of like you trust that people will come together to to do the right thing so like an example of this at its core might be the ethereum hard fork as a result of the dow where it didn't need to be i guess vitalik like technically used his reputation as collateral because he was in favor of doing the fork but um people came together and decided to do the right thing in their eyes um and so i think i'm sure some of that when you actually get into the dirty details was very much based on reputation and some of it wasn't um but yeah i think it's that plus trust in humanity to do the right thing yeah yeah and it's interesting how different people you know ethereum classic their social wear formed a consensus around that was not the right thing and then the ethereum what we now know is the ethereum main chain the the social consensus there is what created the the trustwear off of the ethereum chain so it's almost like these are two houses of governance in uh agrigore's aggregators are just collections of humans who think similarly but like these are two different houses of governance for network systems yeah and you you touch on something that i think is interesting when when we were talking about like what does autonomous mean and what's automated endows and all that stuff i think of a lot of trustware as like technically kind of automation not all of it is but i think the original dow term was very much taking on that idea that some of these things that are on chain um can like trigger other things and you kind of have the sense of like automation i think the reason that i'm like not crazy bullish automation for a lot of dows not some of them totally makes sense but is more so that i think innovation and um settling on best practices tends to happen at the social wear layer just because you have flexibility like you can change those systems pretty easily and you can see how people react and then you turn things into trustware because they can evolve to that point since you know how people interact and it just becomes a lot easier to say yep this system of coordination works for us let's take it from social wear and just turn it into trustware because it's easier to scale a system that way for example because you don't rely on these like reputation systems that are very loose so i think that's probably how things evolve but there are exceptions to that right um oh man it's just so it's it's easy to start to like once you have trustware and social wear defined as criteria um it's just so interesting to use that to compose something larger like so basically my my my theory here is that it like the reason why we're doing season two of green pill on identity is that uh if if web 3 is a dark forest that runs on trustware and you're not sure who's going to try to like have an adversarial relationship with you by using the light of identity you can see who your counterparty is and you can start to build social wear and social wear we know from nikki case is key to positive some relationships because you can have mutual win wins with people you have repeat interactions with and so on top of that this is like how you compose from the bottom up a regen movement is that you build positive some games using the composable money legos and identity legos that you have to take trustwear to social wear and that's how you can invent a positive some positive some game and so you know i guess i'm i'm curious how you what do you think about that that that that stack that i just subscribed described there yeah i think that is what gets me most excited so this is gonna seem kind of unrelated but i think it is the example that i love to use for like pods which is what orca's building which is basically like a permissions layer on a multi-sig is and i got this from tina from station who's an absolute genius i absolutely love her is um actually like one of the most interesting use cases is not just like dows use pods to you know have working groups that have their multi-stake it's actually more that i say i'm willing to lend an undercollateralized loan to anyone in my pod or an adjacent pod up to ten thousand dollars and so what you start to do is basically rely on these like reputational systems more identity layers are part of this um to say there are things that we could not do if we didn't have this like trust layer but as we start to represent like the it's almost like the outcome of these things on chain it might not always be like this is my identity and i have this trust score it might be just the outcome being that you kevin trust me it doesn't need you don't you might not need to provide justification as to why but you do and then we can start to build on top of that so i think it's actually weirdly almost like this much more human-centric way of approaching the space because we're not trying to quantify trust itself we're trying to like represent trust as it emerges organically and then make sure that we represent that so that we can build these layers on top of it and that i think is actually where you start to see like really wild use cases unfold this gets to the point where we we've evolved past the simple system and begun to do really interesting things yeah yeah and i think that you know it's maybe we'll take it back to where we started i sort of like envisioned this whole space as an evolutionary game where the byzantine generals problem was solved with bitcoin and then that went through these bull bear epochs of growth and then destruction and then it started to evolve towards bitcoin forks and then eventually ethereum was its own code base and on top of that dalles and defy and in eth was invented and the whole time it's like the the system is iterating the open source monetary game is iterating and eventually we get l2s and nfts and play to earn and uh dow tooling and dows and regen crypto and it feels what's really exciting to me is that that that iteration between growth and destruction in the in the infinite garden of ethereum is is basically deciding what projects make it and where like the capital gets gets flowed and what's really cool to me is this idea that with identity paired with these systems you can create more positive some games which will be evolutionarily advantaged because you can build social wear into the digital economic system so in theory we'll see like a new part of the infinite garden that will flourish that is more regenerative because of the identity systems and like the way it can route value in more positive some ways so i i know i'm trying to integrate the entire podcast into one little monologue here but like evolution time simple instruction set and what we just added to the simple instruction set is social wear uh i think yeah i think i think what we've seen so far is that a lot of crypto's evolution has had a pretty limited data set which is mostly reliant on trustware and a little bit of the social wear that like crypto twitter and human relationships have provided and i think what's like building off of what you're talking about what's really exciting about adding in the identity layer and the social wear stuff is that it basically creates an entirely new like type of data that we're adding into this like evolutionary system where you know we could like it's kind of like we could see in here but now we're suddenly able to touch and taste and we're like whoa this is a whole nother thing that we weren't even able to use as an input or measure as an output that we're now able to do and i think that is like what's most exciting about the identity layer and all of that stuff is it it creates this new um like set of data that has always existed in these systems but we were never able to quantify and so it was really really hard to build like complex really um innovative systems because we were just like this is all we have like we only have people who are able to spin up you know um random accounts and like we have no way of tracking them and all the stuff so i think i think to me that's like the really exciting pieces to your point introducing the social wear layer in and basically giving ourselves like new senses that allow us to evolve um not just faster and more effectively but also into something that's actually like a lot more exciting and honestly something that's much more reflective of what it means to thrive as a human because if the only thing that it means to thrive is to be wealthy we will fail completely uh so so get coin just released get coin passport and uh i i i'm just a contributor at the dao i'm not involved in the leadership right now but i i have been following some of the strategy there and it's basically what it's doing is it's taking decentralized society all of this on-chain and off-chain data about reputation and then it's etling it which just means extract transform load into a verifiable credential that's stored on ceramic self-sovereign owned by the passport users and then from there anyone can write an algorithm that right that turns that into a one-dimensional score in the case of get coin passport it's civil resistance how can we prove that you're a unique identity and your personal score is equal to the cost of forgery of your identity so if if you have an id worth ten dollars then you can get ten dollars worth of rewards using passport and if you have a thousand dollars you have a thousand dollars worth of civil resistance in your identity and it just scales up and down from there so i i guess you know i i i don't know uh i have two questions one you know have you followed what's the most important reputation score for you because get coin is focused on civil resistance and what do you think about like creating that pipeline of decentralized society information into into into scores is there any sort of pitfalls that you see there or what are the opportunities with with with using reputation systems in this way i think the idea of saying each like bitcoin passport has a specific implementation of something that is its own score that is basically trying to collapse context and say here's the not collapse context but take a lot of context and say here is something here's a number a way to quantify something with a very specific scope is like a very smart approach again because i think identity is very contextual um i think civil resistance is going to provide one of the biggest opportunities when it comes to things like governance and innovating on that level like i think when you think about civil resistance in the beginning when you just try to go okay well why is that useful um you could come up with like reasonably good um you know sets of use cases but i think where it actually gets like really exciting is when you need to do things like governance on chain and all that stuff sort of like these second order effects where you wouldn't think of it until you really need it and then you're like oh we have no way of knowing what's going on and also we can't experiment with many different governance mechanisms because the only proxy that we have for civil resistance right now is basically money which is a terrible proxy but that's that's really the only thing that we can do it's actually worth like just double clicking on that the most dystopian outcome is that you have to have a lot of money to have personhood and that's not what you want to build at all 100 and i think you could argue that we've kind of done that in the ecosystem thus far where one token one vote is basically you have to have a lot of money to have your voice heard and i think that's a pretty bad outcome i even think i would go further to say that it's not just you have to have a lot of money to have your voice heard and airdrops are solving that it's actually the airdrops only make that worse because they make people think that but the reality is that again people have to sell their tokens because they need to pay rent and so you actually end up with the same system so i think like civil resistance to me and a lot of where where i've been thinking about it is in the context of how can we build systems that are more fair and do provide opportunities for everyone to um to have their voice heard and all these different pieces um so to me that's like the most exciting i think civil resistance is probably the first element of identity that's going to be really important i do think the second one is is probably going to be figuring out two pieces one i know people talk a lot about skill sets i don't know if identity and skill sets are going to be like the top thing that we need right now because again i think skill sets are incredibly contextual like how you rate someone's development skills is going to be very different from how i do and that matters i think a lot is really hard to quantify um i'm very interested in seeing relationally how reputation systems develop in when i say that i mean like how easy is someone to work with i actually think is going to be more important than how good they are at something how good someone is that something can change i actually in my experience have seen that dows more often fail not because people can't do something but because they are incredibly hard the the two two people are not getting along and don't work well together and it's actually really hard and that creates more attention so i don't think we'll have a solution to that anytime soon but i do think that reputation systems that can start to play on that are going to be really interesting yeah it does seem like there's just like so many different vectors of reputation and it seems like we're starting with civil resistance but there's just many many more to consider here and i'm wondering how we spin that flywheel of like more data and more reputation scores which enables more daps and it feels like there's a network effect here to the to bootstrap where it's like no one has dids and vcs so no d ops give a about that and so therefore there's no use cases for it and there's the cold start problem so i'm interested to to sort of start playing with that yeah i am uh i'm very intrigued to see how part of that happens and unfortunately i i can't remember who's has said this to me i think a couple of people but one of the big um things of the last decade has just been that vanity this is a very pessimistic take that i don't think i fully agree with but um basically like vanity and the desire to um flaunt have become more important to people than privacy and i do wonder if that same dynamic will come into play here not in the sense of privacy but in saying the desire to flaunt and sort of show off actually ends up being like the trojan horse for identity and for not only users identifying with some set of you know vcs and all that stuff but also helping build like this relational network where like i show off a bunch of different things or even that i need to have um some proof that i am a real human in order to get something that i care about that is like that's more in the sense of like me showing off so i don't know i'm very interested in how we can take some of those the more negative or i guess not as like optimistic ways that humans exist in general and use those to our advantage yeah it's interesting you know i definitely think that the web has increased the propensity for vanity and you know since all information is now infinitely replicable privacy has suffered from that and you know it's almost like the transition from atoms to bits enabled this whole thing to be unleashed of of us all sort of trying to broadcast our image and and in this sort of like narcissism and that comes along with that or just like you know the wanting to get rewards and not realizing the the externality to your privacy later but uh it feels like even higher stakes when it's on on blockchains also so treading with caution maybe is the lesson there yeah trending with caution and i think um leveraging the fact that we are like that for positive some outcomes and being very clear that that's i think a big thing is like transparency that that's actually what you're doing um but like i am very optimistic that if we can if we can take ways that we know humans already act and try to use that as the trojan horse for improving creating like net positive outcomes um i think that's a battle worth fighting yeah yeah it feels like it's coming it's coming up as we're designing all of these new things with dallas also we're crossing that skeuomorphic frontier oh my gosh yeah well and i think like one of the most important elements too and and back to your your question i think the flywheel will probably be i guess what i am ultimately getting at is social like i think yeah humans love to engage with each other and as we do move more into this like digital city sort of space um one of the most interesting things about these types of cities is the subcultures that pop up and all of the different like economic hubs that cities provide and and the entropy of running into someone random and stuff like that i think we're going to crave that we already do crave that in digital spaces if we can use identity as a layer to create really rich experiences that actually make people feel more connected i think people will always want that right yeah yeah i think that they'll they'll want it's just it's going to take a lot of capital and talent i think an experimentation to bootstrap that flywheel um but you know the i think that what what the ecosystem maybe could aim for and this is for the listeners is you know when when axi blew up that's when everyone tried to build play or play to earn games like the one example that's proving that it's possible creates a selling point for so many entrepreneurs capital and talent to to follow that so i guess we're all just kind of looking for that that that first solution and and i've seen glimmers between poep and rabbit hole and get coin and you know a lot of these other applications that are actually creating the data emissions that it could possibly be bootstrapped lens protocol is a great example yeah i think and what's interesting is that those all get at it in different ways which i think is really important like rabbit hole is helping people explore web 3 and in doing that you're going to get a certain set of skills and credentials lens is helping people build their brand and in doing that you're going to build up a certain set of credentials so it's going to be super interesting to see how fragmented the identity sort of space ends up being because there's so many different things that that it means to be you as a human and i think that's probably also part of what makes it so hard to track also a civil resistance makes the most sense proving that someone is a human is really hard but it's a lot less there are a lot less moving factors than trying to help someone express themselves on the internet you know like it's just there's so many moving factors when it comes to who you are and at least personhood is like a binary yes no yeah well you would think so it should take you behind the rabbit hole i am the civil resistance yeah i'm sure well i'd i would love to pull that thread with you and there's so many more threads here but we're getting it to a place where we have to converge uh instead of diverging so uh i think i'll ask you one question which is completely open-ended so that you can uh take us in any direction that you want before we wrap which is if there is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say chase chapman i don't think so this has been a really fun um a really fun conversation i i do think one quick thing that i was thinking about in prep for this on favorite public goods this is totally unrelated but i have to shout it out one of the most underrated public goods i think that is out there is the people who are like scam researchers and hold people accountable i think like zack xbt is a perfect example of this because i was i was like oh which grants have i donated to like you know whatever because i was thinking about it and i totally forget about this but then i see things on twitter transparency means nothing if you don't hold people accountable for this stuff and i think that is like such an underrated public good but i just have to shout out because i think it's really important and i'm very grateful for people who do it yeah i've actually uh 100 agree with you plus one plus 100 been sort of i've been thinking about like how do you create a more green-pilled world you know the subtitle of the book is how crypto could regenerate the world and we really want to go to how crypto is regenerating the world from there and the first answer is do no harm before you create positive externalities and the biggest harms are the environmental impact which you know given the merge is gonna go away but the ponzi schemes that collapse on top of everyone damage retail investors which damages the sentiment of the space and it creates a massive negative externality for web3 and the people who are trying to prevent that by researching the scams actually increase the credibility of the space massively which is a public good and the people who want to regulate crypto really want to prevent those retail investors from getting wrecked and so do the scam researchers and it's it's really a bridge building exercise between crypto and the real world for exact xbt and and these other public goods so yeah plus one if we want to build a more regenerative world first there has to be less negative externalities and i hope in the next epoch of this evolutionary game the scam researchers are able to route out the scams before they hit 40 billion dollars dokwan level terra and crush everyone and it's hard to evolve when you can't recognize your mistakes and they're totally obfuscated away in complexity so yeah totally agree and i'm really grateful for for the people who are doing that work yeah beautiful well uh chase where can people find your you and your work online mostly on twitter i do a lot of tweeting i'm a chaser chapman so there's just an r in between um i write on mirror sometimes i try to publish more often than i do and then i also publish stuff through um orca and on our publication which is orca.mirror.xyz yeah and i think you've got a podcast i've done a couple prep of that yes i also have a podcast i always forget about my podcast so um you can find my podcast other side xyz um kevin hopefully i'll have you on a guest on it soon that'd be fun we got to continue this conversation yeah totally yeah maybe we'll do a v2 together and uh and go on to the other side from here thanks chapman thanks so much for joining me on the green pill pad thank you [Music] you
