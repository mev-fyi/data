okay i've spent a couple of years learning how to try and shape and influence policy in dc i've also spent a number of years making a case against poverty i believe web 3 can be an enormous force or a set of tools against poverty so let me try and help and hence lobby three [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today is a very special episode because i am joined by both david hoffman my colleague bankless and andrew yang my former boss from the yang 2020 presidential campaign and we are talking about lobby 3 which i want to give a quick overview of before the podcast begins because i'm not sure that we gave that overview at the beginning of the episode so lobby 3 is fundamentally an nft drop that andrew recently announced whose goal is to fundraise in order to build a really world-class lobbying infrastructure for the web 3 community and the need here and the reason i'm excited about it is right now what you have in the world of web 3 lobbying is you have institutions like the blockchain association who are fantastic you have lobbyists from coinbase and a16z also who are wonderful but who if they approach congress folk are going to be met with a certain level of skepticism because they're going to be seen as having an obvious interest in this that's sort of business or commercial or something of that nature lobby three is being built by uh by yang and others who have spent the last two years very effectively advocating for anti-poverty policies and have built up a really amazing reputation with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for their work as anti-poverty advocates and actually getting legislation anti-poverty legislation passed like the child tax credit and so the goal with lobby 3 is for those folks to who have built this great reputation to help build on that and and really make the case that web 3 is a profound anti-poverty technology and therefore to really impact and educate congress and lawmakers about web 3 in a way that they're going to be much more receptive to and the second piece here is really to be lobbyists for the people of web3 not just the institutions and so this is why a dao has been set up to make sure that the the interests of the public are being prioritized and that we're really fighting for regulation to the extent that it's inevitable and legislation that is going to do right by the people of web 3. and lobby 3 has a really compelling voice and a really compelling reason to be doing that so that's the the overview there that i wanted to give for folks and uh with that we'll probably hear a couple words from our sponsors and then we'll get into my conversation with andrew yang and david hoffman who was kind enough to join as a sort of a third party

hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another somewhat unscheduled episode of overpriced jpegs which i'm increasingly doing these days but this is an extra extra special one uh not only am i joined by the wonderful david hoffman with whom i now work at bank list but i'm joined by my former boss and good friend andrew yang hello sir hey carly how are you great to be here hello overpriced jpegs gm love it this is fun having you guys both on here and it's fun for me david having like you know you're on my turf now you're like usually the it's your home turf but like i call the rules here this time yeah yeah exactly your support staff no no uh i brought david in for a couple reasons uh we're here to talk about lobby 3 which is the awesome nft and project and an organization that andrew has been probably on your twitter feed talking about in twitter spaces but i really wanted to take this time to like break it down and talk about it maybe in ways that that still haven't quite been um done in the twitter space verse but i'm also quite close to this project i've been working on it with andrew and so i wanted sort of an outsider a little bit more of an outsider to come in uh to also help moderate this this whole condo so i know david you have questions excited to take them and i kind of want to ask you questions too david around you've been in this space for a while regulation and and lobbying is obviously important to you so we're gonna make this a really conversational one and uh i was thinking maybe we kick off with can i tell carson's stories from the trail i'm just kidding well you know okay i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell a fun story i think people will enjoy this one i've been wanting to tell it for for a hot minute you've been on a couple twitter spaces with andrew wang and people always make jokes about like oh you okay you're actually two different people you're in the same spot at the same time we know that whatever and i wanted to talk about how early in the campaign when nobody really knew who you were andrew we wanted to make a t-shirt that was like andrew yang wang tang pang who cares he wants to give me a thousand dollars a month because people would always get your last name wrong or like you know it's like really like and i like i feel like the andrew wang crowd would would appreciate that one uh so that's mine i do remember that the story i wanted to tell was that um there was a time when uh we were all hands on deck and people were doing a million different things and uh you you were uh booking my travel um and then uh you you had me like uh you had me fly out of um one airport then it turns out the airport was wrong um and we had uh like something scheduled later that day in iowa so like there was like this travel fire drill and uh and the rest of it and uh and then you were very concerned that it's like oh no i just like screwed up the candidates like uh travel like you know he's gonna be super mad and then there was a moment while it was happening when i was in one airport and i was like this is the right airport um that that i thought to myself it's like oh you know i mean this is like an organizational thing and you know like car carly probably shouldn't be doing [Laughter] admin big um and somehow it ended up working out i don't know how we we met like i ended up going into some other airport in iowa and then they i got there late but you know the the show went on i i know this is what we not what we were here to talk about but i do just want to say i actually used to give this once i had a team i used to tell people this all the time to make them feel better if they messed up this was truly like one of the worst i don't think i've ever felt this bad in my entire life because i'd also i'm not good at like travel admin stuff i've gotten better but like or that kind of organizational work i'm like really bad at we didn't have that many people on the campaign someone needed to do it i was doing it and i like i had up like a couple like a number of times and and i'm kind of a perfectionist so it's like a very painful thing and i i found out that i'd sent him to the wrong airports he was gonna miss his flight and be out like personal money that he'd spent like you know kind of like while on a layover and my phone is dying and i've got to get on like another flight and i don't have my phone i it was like the worst feeling in my entire life and then andrew was so gracious about it was like okay yeah like i think there's like other things you're good at and i think it's not this and i was like oh i like cried from like the grace of him not being mad at me i will say somebody on the plane i was on i i was like so freaked out about this and somebody commented on a sweatshirt i was wearing and i i just blurted out to the stranger i was like i just sent my boss to like to the wrong airport and he goes oh you're fired and i was just like sitting on the plane like oh my god like okay again not why people tuned into this empathy i was oh my god and i was it was it wasn't terrible this is a fantastic pitch as to what it's like to run for president yeah that's a that's a reasonable snapshot uh yeah you know so much of it i i felt like um like a backpack because i just felt like i was getting transported hither and yeah all the time and they're you know they're like people around you okay you have to be here you have to be here you have to be here you know that you show up and you're like hey automation ubi etc etc but you know that like there's a lot less glamour to it than people imagine as i'm sure carly can attest because you know in terms of lack of glamour a lot of lack of glamour yeah but uh you you made it fun nothing like web 3 no if you weren't going to make the joke i was yeah yeah yeah all right well we're here now it is fun andrew that our worlds have collided yet again uh yeah i've joked like i really do realize the older i get like i have a personality and i'm drawn towards certain things because i keep seeing the same people over and over again and like the new things i take on i'm like ah we all have we're similar and it's it's reflected in that so let's as we're reminiscing i would love for you to talk about like how lobby three came together like what was the impetus for this like and i have sort of my version of this story but i think really give people the like a look at the intention behind this whole thing and and why we wanted to to make it happen well the the genesis really started back in 2018 when i was running for president looking for anyone to hear me out and some of the first champions uh and supporters of the campaign were from the cryptocurrency world i spoke at consensus and it felt like a homecoming i was like oh my gosh like these people are super into it i i had the experience that approximately 85 of the folks in crypto were for some version of ubi so that was like such a natural fit and i came to realize that it was because people in crypto have this sense of optimism and abundance uh and uh chance to build a future and those things kind of go hand in hand so more recently when i was looking at ways we could alleviate poverty i met so many entrepreneurs who'd had their lives transformed so many people who were excited about the anti-poverty potential of web 3 and then i simultaneously became aware of the fact that there's this regulatory overhang um that i i would dare say is getting more pronounced where uh people are becoming increasingly uh certain that regulations are coming of a certain form so uh i like to go where i can add value and i felt like okay i've spent a couple of years learning how to try and shape and influence policy in dc i've also spent a number of years making a case against poverty i believe web 3 can be an enormous force or a set of tools against poverty so let me try and help and hence lobby 3. but i will say carly you were one of our guides to this where you were looking up and saying okay here's how you would structure it like here's how you would approach it in a way that seems uh very people-led and community-led carly what you said about uh finding gravity or gravitating towards people that think similarly i think that's a a thread to tug on because exactly what yang said about how so many like 85 percent of the people that are in crypto support some sort of ubi i think there's more there's more to the alignment behind the crypto industry and the the platform or just the vibe that andrew yang has given off because now it's no longer just the andrew yang platform andrew yang running for president it's now a whole host of uh things of policy issues of of platforms that many many other people have adopted uh and the crypto industry kind of seems to find alignment with a lot of them and the the vibe that i get out of the crypto industry and the vibe that andrew yang gives off is one of long-term thinking of futurism of how technology is coming a tidal wave of technology is coming to materially change how society operates but then also just a sense of optimism and a sense of ability to to grab the bull by the horns rather than have a bulldozer come and and just smash us and so like these are the same kind of just ethos that i see inside of the culture of the the cryptocurrency community and the platform that andrew yang ran on in the 2020 campaign yeah i just want to tell a quick story about this to put a point on it david um so i was briefly a cnn commentator and they were looking at various uh shows to do built around me and and who i am and what not um and there was a period when they wanted to do a show called the future of with andrew yang and i'd go through like the future of education the future of transportation etc uh and then they pulled back on that a number of months later because they said hey it turns out people have a negative attitude about technology in the future the future is not really a saleable concept these days really quick right so so so we're all laughing because that's obviously like the opposite of the web 3 experience and the mentality but that that's in many ways the place we're in right now yeah i think people are people are scared of the future the future comes along with a sense of like existential dread for a large part of the world and i think that's what i think that's why yang and his message resonate though because i think this group of people are folks who want to celebrate success and and celebrate innovation call it and like celebrate you know technology but also are like compassionate people who understand that any time you have progress or tech new technology like there are people who get left by the wayside and we need to both celebrate celebrating in new innovation and and do what we can to protect people who are being fallen or left behind by that and you can do both and that's what yang has always touched and tapped into that's what ubi taps into like it's this i i just think that's what's really beautiful about it and where they're sort of overlapped because that's everywhere in crypto if you look at how we've mobilized around fundraising for ukraine or it's like great we're so excited we've done well but let's make sure we're we're thinking about those who haven't yeah i'm going to to say too that this is uh helpful to everyone and when i was in silicon valley running for president on automation ubi and that a lot of my technologist friends were people that were enabling this technology they were some of my biggest backers because they said you know what's going to be a better environment for innovation one where people feel secure about themselves and their families and their future and i think we're at the same point with web3 which is okay do people view all of the innovation in web 3 as a force for good in their lives and if the answer is confusion or no then we have to try and change that as quickly as we can to maintain a positive environment for uh growth technology technological innovation uh and these tools actually reaching their potential you touched on earlier andrew sort of the structure and how we thought this through and i think we've been really cognizant going through all of this like this you know my my origin story for this is to your point andrew like always was an alignment between the yang gang and the crypto community and always therefore like felt an affinity for kind of web 3 even before i knew that term but really this like confluence of events where andrew you started looking at this and getting really interested in it and saying hey there's this tremendous anti-poverty potential but that's put at risk if this becomes a political issue and then some friends of ours who are incredible like work at an advocacy org that you had you founded right i'm being careful because there's like legal things our lawyers have been like you can say this you can't say that so some of this is choppy for that reason but those partners of ours who are like really really talented i'll say lobbyist advocate folks right who were also looking at this and for whom this the infrastructure bill moment this summer was like an eye-opener for them and and and they work on anti-poverty lobbying right now and and they were like they saw i think it was like jack dorsey was like tweeting at a senator and our our friend was like what like who is representing web 3 in congress that like jack dorsey's resorted to like tweeting at people and like doesn't have you know a place to go and so that was that was also this thing of like that these real pros at this feeling like there was a major opportunity and then seeing it firsthand with the infrastructure bill and being like we really think we can help here and help educate lawmakers because we've built these really good relationships with people across the aisle from this anti-poverty perspective and like is there something we can do here so like andrew kind of coming to that uh you know these frankly very talented lobbyists friends we have coming to that me working in web3 and it was like well  obviously obviously we have to do something here then because the there's there's a need and there's an opportunity for us to really to really fill it i think yeah and we've been added for a couple of years in dc and some of the things we learned are i think going to be very helpful for web3 and so i'll give you an example right now again the primary emotion around uh these technologies is confusion um but there's also a degree of skepticism particularly from folks who speak for the industry directly so uh i think the phrase i heard was corporate crypto lobbyists uh that uh there are members of congress who are not eager to hear from people who resemble that description [Laughter] and so uh you know that there are different types of messengers there are different types of organizations uh that different people respond to unfortunately in this day and age the messenger is as important as the message uh and so we have to try and empower the right messengers to reach people where they are and and in some cases kind of deactivate them ideologically you know like they might have a particular knee-jerk reaction that you have to uh temper and adjust over time andrew learning about crypto everyone knows is difficult because everyone everyone remembers when they were on the outside of crypto looking in and they just saw confusion i think that's a universally shared uh experience that a lot of people have but i'm wondering from your perspective if the if there's a difference with when it comes to politicians in dc one of the the two differences that come to mind is that politicians in dc tend to be of an older generation but they're also all politicians so how do you think the interaction of being from generally being from an older generation and also being representative leaders in government how do those things interact with what it's like to come to understand web 3 and crypto yeah i think they don't help [Laughter] i mean the average u.s senator is 64 average member of congress is in their late 50s um and those are average numbers so leadership is significantly older uh and they they've come to positions of power and influence uh completely without any uh interaction with uh the web 3 community and so there's going to be a natural skepticism uh even alienation um and in some cases they may actually have various uh friends um have a point of view that that uh that is threatened by uh cryptocurrency uh growing and developing um so i i think the the attitude we should have if you're generous uh is that you should expect some institutional resistance uh from lawmakers and policymakers naturally uh you should expect them to be overweighting uh risk management and underweighting growth innovation american jobs et cetera et cetera like a and if you have that as your uh default coming in you're you're gonna be more correct honestly and and then you have to try and work to uh to change that in a way that is not um heavy-handed uh really so you know in point of fact what do we need to do we need to tell stories of people who are locked out of a traditional financial system enjoying new access to resources and flexibility and autonomy and financial literacy through web3 uh we have to tell stories about patient medical records being secured on the blockchain and being activated only when the patient walks into the facility without any kind of concern like these are the kinds of stories that are not being told um and they we all know they exist uh we know the creator who was living in their car two years ago who now owns a home and is making a great living like that these are things that we can highlight and spotlight and then bring to uh bring to uh our legislators and policymakers and say look these are people too like that you know these are use cases that have uh not been um spotlighted as much as some of the risks and here's something i want to emphasize on that point and and andrew said earlier it's like the messenger matters so much here and so this is a little like insight into how really good lobbying gets done right is is also partnering with people in various states or local state chambers of commerce's or and having them go tell senators and congress people and folks those stories so it's not just coming from the lobbyist and like again you almost feel weird showing your hand like that but like it that's the kind of thinking that we we really need and really need to bring and make sure and the goal is to be substantive to your point carly like if you have a local non-profit leader jumping up and down going to the congress person saying hey this stuff has transformed the lives of the people we serve uh that's a home run um so what do we have to do we have to actually make it so that it's transforming the lives of the people that they serve [Laughter] and then you get that non-profit uh leader and audience with the member of congress you know so there are a couple of steps but it's very doable if we're deliberate about it exactly it's and it's twofold it's like running pilot programs for example to actually change people's lives and then it's forming relationships like they get called grass tops right forming relationships with state level officials or you know or people non-profit leaders etc and and making sure they're aware of those stories and and kind of delivering those messages and you know on this messenger front like i was being a little dismissive earlier i'm worried i am like we are so excited for all the other orgs that are out there that are doing lobbying but the reality is they clearly represent industry if you're the blockchain association you're going to be met with a certain like resistance from a person in congress if you're talking about the benefits of the blockchain or if you're a16z or if you're coinbase lobby3 is coming at this and and this is why the dow piece is so important like for the people and as like an anti-poverty crusader who's trying to make sure the voices of web 3 are actually represented andrew do you want to tell the onion story and i think you've said this oh sure it's good about 11 years ago there was an onion article that inspired me which was uh the american people hire lobbyists to uh stand up for their interests on capitol hill and there's a picture of a guy in a suit saying no they'll take the american people seriously like i could because i'm here and i i thought this was hysterically funny but i also thought it was pretty smart because i was like oh that would work like why don't the american people hire a lobbyist um and then years later uh i uh hired lobbyists and and lo and behold it actually is really helpful uh you know like some of the and um whatever your your instincts are about what's going on in dc uh it's probably like that and a bit worse uh you know what i mean um so you know when when i was in denver on stage with david um i posed a question to the audience which is like hey what's your confidence level that they're going to get this right [Laughter] that so if your confidence level is not high then maybe we should change it and you know maybe there are smart effective things we can do yeah like going to lobby three dot io you know yeah like go to live io and uh you know join the dow mint uh nfts become a member uh and and let's go be smart there's a lot of alignment between what a lobby organization is and what a dao is the one of the first things that we learned about ethereum the first things the first thing that we collectively had proof for we know ethereum is good at is capital coordination capital coordination kicked off the ico mania for better or for worse largely for worse the ico mania was insane but it's also that same capital coordination primitive has also created the the defy summer and it's also created the nft like almost everything about ethereum that's taken off has been about capital coordination and really all a lobbying organization is is an organization to collect resources to impart a will somebody's will or a collection of organization people's will upon how the rules are written and that's more or less the same thing of what a dao is except the dao's rules are about like how can we create this very valuable system on ethereum and a lobby organization is how do we create this very valuable system to become a part of our government and so these are yin and yang's to each other in from my perspective yeah it's one reason i'm so excited about the dow structure of lobby three is because it can demonstrate the power of these tools uh to enact uh the popular will uh and uh push for the right type of policy um which is perfect in my mind it's like you know like there's a traditional way of doing things and then there's this uh more modern web three way of doing things and what better way to demonstrate that these technologies are helpful and powerful than to actually use a dow for the community's interests i think yes and no david to what you just said the the no being i i i guess i'll phrase it like this i do think there's an underestimation of the strategy to good lobbying and i think like even a lot of lobbyists maybe like don't employ the like proper level of strategy or maybe just like advocacy groups and this is why i'm excited about lobby three is really knowing some of our potential partners on this and like really believing in their ability to be really freaking savvy about how you go about things how you message different things to different people how you get the right messengers to mess into those things and i think um you know we were really thoughtful about how he structured this whole piece because the dow piece is critical and it's so important and it's so important because you want you need that popular mandate and we're here to represent the people so we need a group of people that are telling us what their priorities are and what matter to them or else we can't effectively represent them and so that piece was like a no-brainer obviously we need to do that we also want to build this like world-class team who know that xyz senator is skeptical of china and if we go out and say insiders playing the inside game yeah right like there's an inside and outside game yeah and saying like okay right now if we position crypto as the way to get what you want in the you know in your personal you know kind of ideological feed with china like let's go do that and not you know not everybody's gonna know that that's the strategy to play so you you work with awesome people who do and yeah exactly to your point like inside outside but the dow piece is um it's such a beautiful way to go to congress and say we have a we have a mandate right like we have the people behind us look at look at our discord right whatever whatever it is yeah they'll know what that means i'm just kidding yeah yeah good odd good so there's a number of elements inside of the crypto industry that really really work because it's outside of the regulation of nation states uh and like the d part of dow decentralized uh even though most of these dows i actually think are more accurately called dues as in just digital organizations but the dow name has stuck um the decentralized part kind of means that you guys get to skirt regulation and that's why a lot of the things that power the fundamentals of crypto really really work but when it comes to making a lobby dao like again more closer to a do a lobby digital organization um what are the andrew and also carly what are the benefits of having a dow do thing that because it still has to answer to regulation it's not like we're skirting like or like uh pack super pac or like lobbying laws there are regulations around these things so how how does lobby 3 fit inside the regulatory framework but also still be able to get some of the perks of whatever you the perks are of being a dao um yeah i i can speak to this so uh the dao is exactly what people imagine it to be which is like a collection of individuals who want to make their voice heard and can vote on ways to allocate resources but those resources are coming from the outside and so they may be spent on things that like an anti-poverty pilot like a messaging campaign you know that things that frankly don't interact with the traditional system in a way that you need to uh like be a registered lobbyist for example um so uh that that's one component uh and then you have the inside game which is like frankly people in suits going into offices and showing up to cocktail parties [Laughter] that's like the traditional stuff um now what one one of the fun things is that these two worlds can interact like we can have an ama with like a suit wearing uh lobbyist uh or a congressperson or a regulator um and talk through uh what their point of view is and you can exchange knowledge back and forth um but the the dow is uh you know just a thriving community that's uh deciding how best to make the case from their own perspective and i i remember if um if i remember correctly donating crypto to your campaign had a cap on it and you also had to do kyc and that was kind of one of the bottlenecks for receiving crypto donations in in in your campaign but that's not true finance director correct it was a nightmare but with a doubt people can just send infinite amounts of money to the dow right like that's not a regulation that the dao actually has to listen to correct 100 so that you know it's not this isn't a political campaign with a 2800 max which is beautiful so you can give more than twenty eight hundred dollars you hear what i'm saying folks at home yeah carly as you can tell is traumatized from her past uh uh like going to folks that they're being like what like 2800 what yeah being like i want all your money trust me this is not my choice i'm sorry i can't take your crypto a very volatile asset that will change value very quickly and suddenly be more than 2800 um i want to ask you andrew i don't know if people know your kind of history only the super og yang gang folks will sort of know your history with dsas and digital social credits but and maybe you want to speak on that for a minute but i'm bringing it up because in so many ways in in in the the theme of your life which is being like very ahead of your time i feel like you were talking about how do we create incentives and and create almost like sub sub-currencies that incentivize people to like be good neighbors essentially like incentivize people outside of the traditional financial system which i think has so much relevance for for crypto today and and for those who like don't know what you've been saying on that i'd love for you to give give people that history um yeah so our good friend zach yelled at me early on in the campaign was like never speak of this again but if someone reads my book uh the war on normal people i talk about what i call digital social credits unfortunately being an asian dude talking about digital social credits people were like chinese credit score like you know like moderators don't be in future yeah that might be one reason why you know zach had me uh promise never to speak of it again but uh but but the goal is to build social economies uh build uh different incentives for people to act in different ways and interact because fundamentally the fabric of america is uh declining or disintegrating by any measurement you can find and so the question is how do you start to reconstitute it rebuild those structures and connections uh and while usd is good for some things i was like it's really not great for this like you don't want to be like paying people up to wazoo to you know like like do everything um so having uh social currencies struck me as an obvious way to go um you know i suggested putting those currencies in the hands of local nonprofits and other actors that they could help um reward volunteers or or reward people for uh helping the neighbor to your point carly um but i was forbidden from talking about this on the trail um it is one reason though why i love web3 so much is because those social economies have taken shape before our eyes uh since i wrote that that book and so now i'm just like oh my gosh it's here in real life uh let me do everything i can to help it

in crypto i've gone bankless and the government's gonna come and take it away and i'm gonna need a bank again like what do you think about on this this issue yeah with regards to that it's more about just like cutting off the on and off ramps and like oh great like i literally have been living this bankless life as much as possible and now i'm stuck here and like i ca i can't go the other way uh and so is that a concern no not really um at the end of the day i do have some amount of faith that given enough time the regulations will work out in a way that is at least at least moderately helpful and good it's just a matter of just like how many dead ends do we find before we get to that point um i mean you you you're asking the guy who's trying to take trying to give out as many crypto pills as possible like i think ultimately bitcoin and ethereum win versus the nation state they are fundamentally designed to do so it's just how much destruction and chaos and you know bad things do our regulatory regulatory uh leaders cause along the way before we get to that point i also think it's it's not just preventing the negative but it's like how do we actually enact the positive like i'm in crypto now and i and obviously and i and i'm running various projects where inevitably the thing i'm bumping up against is legal situations like the tech league our legal frameworks have not caught up with our tech so you think about anti-poverty like all the wealth that's being created in crypto and opportunities that are being created in crypto that i'm running into accreditation laws with or i'm running into problems where i can't actually include people and like fulfilling the promise of crypto and web 3 is not just playing defense on bad regulation it's actually playing offense to catch our rules up to how advanced crypto is thinking about things and how inclusive crypto is about things you know i could tell a story about how hard it is to give people money uh like we tried to give out a million dollars during covid uh and i had a really hard time you know i called banks and they were like can't do it i was like wait i can't give your customers money and they're like no you can't [Laughter] like things like that uh went on in real life um and so i agree with you carly that there are these uh regulations and impediments the regulation they cited to me as to why i couldn't give their customers money was privacy and i was like i'm like i'm asking you to identify like you know a thousand indigent families to get a thousand bucks each and like you're worried about their privacy i have a feeling they'd be cool with getting this thousand bucks i'm obviously like i'm like i cannot know who they are i don't really care um so uh so you're right carly everything is around this mitigation of risk well meanwhile frankly the world's falling apart so it's like you know like maybe that should be the risk [Laughter] like you have these anachronistic antiquated regulations holding us back from fixing problems it's really really frustrating i mean even we talk about okay mortgages in the future are going to be you know on chain or smart contracts and like our legal infrastructure does not like recognize a smart con like contract right now like i'm trying to do stuff like that in projects i'm on and i'm like well the courts still want this physical piece of paper right like i i think that's the piece that all these sort of idealistic dreams we have like we need people in our camp in in like let's go i think there's urgency there that people were so focused on how to like innovate technically which is so beautiful and important but like the thing that's gonna hold us back is is the is the legal and sort of you know regulatory frameworks that we're trying to operate within um and i think we've got a real opportunity here or our political system personally you know it it's we're butting up against it to your point carly the forward party now this is yeah no that's why there are such analogs um but but you do have innovation bumping up against the limits of uh antiquated regulatory frameworks and institutions uh and what gives you know what i mean like unfortunately if you're trying to be uh practical and rule abiding you wind up just butting up against these limits and you're like oh you know and one of the things that happens too is it drives you out of the u.s uh you know i mean like some of these things are going to happen regardless and the question is where and how they happen and so if the u.s goes too hard on uh what they view as like risk uh management uh this stuff's going to get pushed offshore uh and that's where the energy the vitality the jobs the people the intellectual capital uh you know i don't want that you know i mean i like there are people listening that just watching this who are like all over the world it's cool like you know love everyone um but i will suggest the us is the largest market and still the traditional uh technology hub and uh it does not want that to change by pushing web 3 offshore totally one aspect uh that i asked you about in denver andrew and i want to pull on that thread once again going back to the d word in a dow decentralized one of the reasons why this crypto industry works is because we have many many nodes hosting all these blockchain data all the blocks across spread across all the world and you can't stamp out a decentralized network and a political revolution or just political change is also a decentralized network and the reason why it works is because everyone is aligned with the same set of shared values and that's kind of how you boil up change how you boil up a revolution so now that we have this like central dao the lobby three dao how how do you see it helping facilitate just like more more andrew yangs more leaders that if you if you hit one with the hammer you get three more andrew yangs in their place like is that kind of the ethos of of so what we're trying to do with lobby three uh that's my goal uh which is that it becomes this popular movement that ends up morphing over time to address different needs and challenges more immediate challenges is the yeah it's like the matrix i'm like you know [Laughter] yeah that'd be good fun 50 andrew yeah well one of our jokes in the campaign um was to have a bunch of asian dudes wear uh blue blazers and math pins and just like send them everywhere and just anyway um you can get a blanketed iowa with us um so they go the goal is to meet this immediate challenge which is immediate around these regulations but then could this down then do whatever it wanted to later like you know obviously after its original mission is met because there are going to be continuous challenges to carly's point and to your point david uh that that would be my uh ideal vision for it uh is that it grows into this community that represents web3 more broadly uh and wants to make changes uh uh like ongoing you know for the next number of years even after these regulations get drawn up well and part of this is about the the empowerment piece i mean we've talked about this andrew and i a bunch which is like there's one dynamic here which is making sure we educate congress about web three and it's also educating web three about lobbying and how that works and so you know to empower this like you know all these different nodes to be able to carry on the mission if you know yang gets bombed on the head or whatever and making sure others pop up it's like arming people with the information of like how to do that and how that works and that's why we've brought in already to our discord some folks on this front but that's part of the plan is to continue to do that which is to explain you know as transparently as possible and sometimes there's limitations to that but like how this is done what's effective you know introduce our community to actual legislators or their teams so that uh you know the mission can go on beyond just the handful of folks who kind of have the insider scoop right now um so and for for folks who hate hate politics uh you know i get it completely carly gets it uh but uh you know it like we don't mind much of a choice like what do you want to do just how to wait for regs to get written and then hate them [Laughter] or or have your organization's growth uh limited by the fact that the regulatory framework doesn't understand it in my ideal world there would be an agency of the you know digital future or digital economy that uh actually understood uh web three these technologies these firms these organizations and doesn't try and treat everything like a security or you know like i mean that like the the sec uh was originated in a time where they couldn't have conceived of any of this stuff you know what i mean uh that the fact that our government is so behind the curve uh is such a catastrophe on so many levels um so if you could wind up with a regulatory agency that to carly's point you know maybe accreditation for investors isn't based on your bank account but it's based upon whether you understand certain things uh you know like that would be glorious um so there there are different things that we should be trying to change that are going to be important to the future of the web 3 community even if you hate politics totally and i think that's the beauty of pulling everyone together is to say hey like what's impacting you the most do you feel like it's this accreditation law like do you feel like it's this other thing like what's actually because the reality is like it like what coinbase is feeling the most sometimes will overlap with what the rest of us are feeling the most but sometimes like it won't which is why you need this like people's lobbyists to be in there saying okay what what are you guys feeling what's hurting your day-to-day and you know let's prioritize those things um totally well are there is there anything else that we feel like we need to cover about lobby three here i wanted this to hopefully be like a good place where people can come back to you to understand more what we're about yeah well aren't there assets to talk about are there lobby three tokens and things that we can look in our ethereum addresses about there are andrew you want to take this you want me to take this oh no carly you know this is more your brainchild than mine i get excited about this because i do think we've done something new i've said this in a couple twitter spaces but like we were like okay we really think about these as membership tokens but we wanted to do something that felt new and interesting from an art perspective and a technical perspective and so we were like how could we we were like we'll bring in a bunch of nft artists to create this mural i'll give the long version of the story actually so we brought in all these nft artists to create this mural that's like a a picture of the washington mall in dc and initially we were like maybe we'll like kind of make it like a puzzle and people can pick different parts of like the national mall to like claim or whatever and then we were like you know what would be even cooler like if we could put everybody like put all of web3 onto the national mall and kind of represent the fact that we're like bringing the people's voices to dc and to you know the white house and whatever and so where we landed was you meant your token or plural meant multiple if you want to contribute more and you then get to create an avatar for yourself and your all of your nfts or most nfts are sort of uploaded in your system once you connect your wallet and you can put like your board ape as part of your avatar you can go put whatever you know you're punk david or i know you're into mf now right you go put your mfr into your avatar and then when you finish creating it it'll show up on this washington mall if you go to the website lobby3.io you'll see a bunch of them there now and so you'll get to see your little character in in the washington mall and it was like this beautiful representation of what we're trying to do and also kind of a cool thing where we're like you know doing something new in terms of your token ultimately ends up being your avatar in this little like you know in a in a in a membership token that's what you'll see on openc for example so uh we had fun designing that i i've been we're getting a lot of good feedback on the discord about people who are participating in that and um that was sort of like mine it's like it's a benign metamarch it's a float it's a float over dc is it the watch the washington mall that's is that the same thing as the national mall or is that something different yeah not yeah maybe i said it wrong yeah i think it could be called both the national ball the washington post is this a place where mlk gave his uh i have a dream speech is that this are we talking about this yes we're not trying to compare ourselves to the 1960s civil rights movement to be clear this is a place where a lot of people with activism go it's also where january 6th happens right yes sir okay so this is a place where people go to rally to get the the politics of the united states to align with their interests the mlk i had a dream speech is the one that popped into my head because that's what i learned in in history books okay so the vibe here is the national mall david i just checked it out okay so i i've been i've been improperly referring to it thank you david okay yeah the national mall with the washington monument and like the water also the scene in forrest gump um uh okay so like we're getting all of our nft avatars to get representation at the national mall by this project and so like where you know it seems to be some sort of like ceremony or ritual to like all show up in force at the national mall except the project out of lobby three is we're doing it like quote unquote in the metaverse yeah yeah so we're getting all of our nft pfps to like storm the national mall to support web3 is that that's the vibe correct and i'm pushing for like an irl party in dc where we like project the mural or like i don't know andrew you're speaking at bitcoin 2022 yeah in miami i'm also speaking at nft week in la uh so so yeah we'll go all over but i i'm with you on the irl event uh maybe a giant picnic in the in the national mall uh so i i prefer the in-person environment uh for some things um but uh carly has an idea to project this mural on a great giant space and have us all enjoy it together i think that's a really nice vision yeah i just want to show a force of like we're here congress take us seriously and i i think that people who interact with other folks in web 3 like people are so happy to see each other especially if you know each other digitally you're like oh my gosh like this is you and like it's like a reunion david is on the record saying eat denver was the best week of his life so i don't have to tell him oh i'll say that a number of times it definitely was uh it's like is this like a little bit a surface area of a game between all the different nft pfp communities as like all right which one of you guys is going to show up in force in the metaverse national mall like is it going to be the cool cats that represent the most representation is going to be the mfers the dow punks out of the bankless dow are famous for showing up in force so which pfp nft project is going to get the most representation in the metaverse national mall that's a great so what i want i wanted to do a thing we kind of couldn't make it happen for a variety of reasons but like all of the projects that have 3d like voxel representations or like 3d rappers like cyber kongs and um what are some some of the other dad has i think does it there's like several of these right knee bits where i was like wanted to like give them a special reward where we'd actually just put their 3d character like any character like project that had gone about making their character like metaverse ready in 3d i'm like we'll stick you in there like that but they're you know we only have so many tech people and only so much time in the world so that's a good that's a good supplant for what i wanted which is like the challenge is on now folks we'll report back which community is uh cares most about ours it's a matter of first competition and it's a metaverse happy rumble exactly whoever whichever nft pfp shows up first is the one will make sure that elizabeth warren gets de-listed from the securities so some some friends just putting a target on their back or something yeah this is actually a terrible idea awesome well and i guess that's a a good place to close maybe is uh you know i never obviously not financial advice this project is truly about like how do we bring about the right legislation this is not the project i'm going to tell you like it's going to moon tomorrow and and obviously don't don't do this unless you care about the cause and want to contribute but we do want to build an awesome community here right and there will be token gated experiences irl parties etc that will be open to people who you know have put their money where their mouth is and supported this project and so uh you know if that's appealing to you you should go mint one again please like just if you care about the cause go to lottery three dot io join the discord minter nft it's gonna be good fun me and carly will be there david will be there a lot of other incredible people will be there now more stories about carly from the campaign trail coming up there after this we have some goods we've got yeah we've got a lot of good mutual stories about we had a fun on that campaign it was you were joking about uh i was joking about putting a bunch of like asian men in in your typical uniform and sending into iowa and i'm joking about the andrew yang wang tang who cares he wants to give me a thousand dollars a month t-shirts i'm like wow a lot of the jokes really are like playing on the fact that like you were so unfairly ignored and there's probably a weird little bit of like asian racism in that like mixed in that stew uh and it was uh but we had fun with it you know it's fun laughing about it that's what's matter that's what matters well you know the reason why i i think we can have fun with it carly is because uh the the campaign did uh take off and take on a life of its own and so many people were excited about and everything else i'm sure if we were like genuinely being [Laughter] like nothing had happened it would have been much different you know we have much less levity about some of these uh ideas that's true that's true beautiful well andrew thank you of course as always so grateful to have you on here and doing what you're doing david thank
