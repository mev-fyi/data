foreign [Music] talking about cultivating web3 era democracy with decentralized identity Paula is a hacktivist digital identity geek and the CEO of radical exchange this is the episode that is the story of how she got to be working on Civic Tech got disillusioned with it wrote a paper called who watches the Watchman in 2020 that was all about civil resistant identity and the trade-offs involved in it how do we create Universal decentralized Democratic civil resistant identity paulus paper who watches the Watchmen which was a review of subjective approaches for civil resistant proof of personhood protocols that's a mouthful uh was foundational in what I built when I was back at git coin in uh civil resistance so basically this paper was the foundation of bitcoin's civil resistance 20 it's 20 20 I'm in a dark hole of the bear market and the pandemic and a bunch of civil attacks on get coin and this paper for me was like the light it showed me that civil resistance in a democratic and decentralized way was possible and it was kind of like a light in the darkness that served as the foundation of the Civil resistant architecture that that I built into early get coin and now with Bitcoin passport the V2 version the decentralized version of what bitcoin's been doing it's also informed that through through the iterations there so um I think Paula is just this lucid and really Visionary thinker when it comes to all of all the things decentralized civil resistance but also decentralized identity cultivating web 3 era democracy and collective intelligence or things that we talk about in this episode and it's just a treat to to kind of soak in the thoughts of Paul Berman the author of this paper and you know we go we go later into what she's been doing at radical exchange and the synergies between radical exchange and get coin and web3 and what would would have to be true to create in 2024 a capital and talent rotation towards digital democracy high resolution democracy collective intelligence and what would it look like if those were some of the themes of where the capital and the talent rotated to in the 2024 cycle so really fun episode for me I think it's one of the best ones that we've done and I hope that you enjoy it without without further delay I give you Paula Berman a hacktvis digital identity geek and the CEO of radical exchange enjoy

now with a prize pool of over a hundred thousand dollars hello how you doing hi Kevin all good uh thank you for having me here very excited to chat yeah I'm excited as well uh some of your work on civil resistance and digital identity has been a huge inspiration for me and the work I've done on bitcoin passport so this is a special treat for me uh let's maybe start start with from the top and let's dive in on the deep end how did you get into crypto um so I'm I'm from Brazil and I've been working with Civic technology uh since 2015 so for the past seven years and I learned about crypto in 2017 and it was exactly at a point in which I was pretty disappointed with the Civic tax base for many reasons um one I was sort of had been on this project to work on a participatory budgeting process uh with my hometown uh in multiple neighborhoods and it was very frustrating the process the project ended up not happening because of sort of micropolitical competitions between different offices in the city and so I was very um just hopeless in my ability to exert a positive impact within the governmental institutions that were around me so in that sense you know it was a bit of like an exitocracy um there was an exotocracy flavor to it in that I was you know frustrated with my government of Institutions and saw in crypto an opportunity to do some interesting things um although I say that you know it was not sort of thinking about how is it that we can create entirely new um institutions on crypto land and forget about the institutions of the past it was more like how is it that um we can use this space where the stakes are lower to do experiments that then and learn things and then later these things can be implemented by by governments one of the things I think is kind of interesting is that a lot of people have on this podcast I talked to in general we talk about what got you into crypto and then we talk about what got you into like public goods and what got you into regen and green pill after that but when I hear your story I hear that you're interested in doing something from a Civic engagement public goods perspective in your local community and you got frustrated by the bureaucracy and that's what brought you into crypto so I guess like you know I guess what is what is the the sort of heart of your Insight or interest in Civic Tech in in in local community engagement and uh you know I guess I'd love to pull that thread in and ask how you even got started doing that I think that I I always thought about power and information instead of how um hiding information manipulating information exploiting information asymmetries are all very Central to how power operates and I think that at the time I was looking at the protests in 2013 2014 2015 I was thinking about how social media played a key role in all of them it was sort of the common denominator across of this protests which were in different countries and sort of triggered for different reasons but in some ways what was common to them was that um we had this new um this we have this new um channels to reach information uh started to flow much more abundantly around society and people could connect much more with each other and that had very clear political repercussions not to oversimplify things but uh technology was a factor a key factor in all of these protests and so when I was looking at them what you know there are many ways in which I don't mean to say that more technology and more transparency and more connection equals more democracy um but um and in many ways more technology makes it so that power is even more concentrated and there are many other challenges uh one thing that is very Vivid to me right now is this question of how when a new information technology is created or is adopted widely you have this phenomenon called epistemic fragmentation where um you just have multiple sort of almost unreconcilable World Views and uh emerging and and this sense of epistemic fragmentation is very Vivid to me right now because we're going through elections here in Brazil and it's just very clear how the gap between World Views is so so wide that there is it's just almost impossible for uh people with different World Views to even be able to talk to each other so there are many um challenges that new technologies uh pose but I was what I was interested in was trying to understand how is it that we could use the affordances of technology to try to to put them to use for democracy for better um Collective organizing better um governance of shared goods and better deliberation I mean there's so many things that you that you could can do with new technology so I I was interested in exploring that and building uh towards that uh and I think that that's even a way of trying to mitigate a rise to to the challenges that technology itself is also now posing um I want to talk about this paper who watches the Watchman which is a review of uh proof of personhood protocols in web3 but before I do I guess I had one more question about the the sort of prehistory of your work here and and that's it why do you think that thesis of web 2 being good for democracy didn't play out uh you know we have more information spread across the world that should increase the knowledge spread that should increase the the trust spread and that should increase democracy everywhere but instead we kind of it feels like we got this like poisoning the well effect where everyone's in their own little Collective filter Bubbles and they only see anything that hits their confirmation bias and also we've also just kind of like I had the flood the Zone with kind of thing to our attention where now we don't trust anything I mean that's in my I guess I'm answering the question has how I see it but but why do you think the the original web X Civic stuff has not worked out and what is there to learn for from that when it comes to working on it in web 3. well there are many things and I of course don't have the definitive answer but one of the one of the questions is what we what I was mentioning um the epistemic fragmentation um but I think that what's that really indicative of is that there is a misalignment between uh what we want out of technology and the private incentives that the technologies that we use are built to cater to um the private interests so um what we need is digital public infrastructure digital public goods that are um that serve the purpose of helping us talk to each other and make important decisions together and we we don't really have those and I think that we're at the very uh a radical exchange what we're doing is we're trying to understand how is it that the this digital public infrastructure can be built along with many other organizations but I think that all of us are at the very beginning we're barely scratching the surface of what uh what those tools can and should look like this is a deeply sort of neglected area of investment there's no investment in building out those tools and there's also very little um creativity and Imagination when it comes to trying to understand how is it that digital tools can magnify our ability to see each other to understand each other to find compromises to build Bridges and to collectively govern things um so it's I think primarily a question of auditing uh said it wonderfully once she said that um social media is great but you don't want to have uh social medias kind of like a club where there are many uh bad incentives and things that you can get addicted to and then clubs are fine and social media is fine but you don't want to be voting for a president inside of a club that's not uh or or having discussions about the future of the nation instead of a club we need better environments for these things to take place and better mechanisms and all of that so we need to improve our social Technologies and we need digital public infrastructure for that um perfect segue into the web 3 portion of the conversation um so who watches the Watchmen is a paper that you wrote along with a couple co-authors and uh basically it's a review of subjective approaches for civil resistance in proof-of-personhood protocols and I want to introduce this paper to this audience um I mean it's a special introduction for me because as I was telling you in the pre-recording Bitcoin depends on bitcoin grants which depends on quadratic funding which depends on civil resistance and around like round six I was in like a dark dark hole of like the bear market and there's a ton of civil attacks on bitcoin and in this paper was just like a light it was like huh it was just like a light light from the heavens it's like someone else understands my problem and is showing me how to solve it and so the early trust bonus system on bitcoin is informed by this paper um so in introducing this paper I just want to hold it in high regard and say how much it impacted me but um yeah so who watches the Watchmen proof of personhood how did you come to think about this problem what was the goal with the paper uh would love to know how it came to be uh thank you for sharing that Kevin it's really really nice to to this into this um and yeah I as I was saying I came into this space into crypto because I was thinking about how blockchain networks could be used as an infrastructure for self-organizing um emerging democracies and I think that's very much sort of in the mythology of blockchain networks but I wasn't seeing that very concretely in the space and right as I started learning about blockchains I um in investigating this question I came up on this paper called the Civil attack which essentially talks about how for any decentralized network where you don't have a central entity authorizing people to join it or not uh this network is going to be vulnerable to a civil attack which is essentially people uh creating hundreds of fake ideas to join it and then control more than 51 of the network and taking it over uh by majority so um proof of four can proof of stake are civil resistance mechanisms they are ways to uh sort of Route Around The Challenge because what they do is they make it so that you can only join blockchain networks uh through in through scarce resources so in the case of proof of work that's uh computing power in the case of proof of stake that's uh Financial power and then that makes it so that a 51 attack would be very very expensive to execute so um the implication for governance is that what you have mostly on ethereum is plutocratic governance and when you want to do Democratic governance that becomes very very challenging uh as you know so um I I just started to um understand that if you wanted to have a a network that is both democratic and decentralized uh that you needed to come up with a different way of doing membership because otherwise if a network is is decentralized and permissionless then um then people you have to devise a way to to prevent civil attacks and then if that way is by anchoring membership on scars resources then the more scarce resources you have the more you're going to be able to accumulate them so um you will end up having power uh becoming very concentrated in this network which is what we're seeing today so there is this um sort of challenge in in how is it that you can do a decentralized in in Democratic Network it feels familiar to me um I don't know if you're familiar with Zuko's triangle but this idea that decentralization scalability insecurity in blockchain networks you pick two out of three and the holy two thing is that is sharding the network so that you can get a happy medium you just have multiple blockchain networks and that's how you scale you scale outwards instead of up and it almost feels like is there a civil resistance triangle where decentralized Democratic insecure are the axes and you can only pick two two of three uh it just feels like there's a symmetry there in decentralization just makes the problem that much harder but it's also very important of course foreign yeah I think that one of the ways to think about it that I've come to think about it is that debris of difficulty there is to to have something that is uh decentralized Democratic and um and sort of universal scalable because it's it's very hard to have sort of one protocol for so it's similar to the sharding thinking so it's very hard to have one protocol uh that will serve everyone but you can have sort of multiple little decentralized democracies that are devising different ways to authenticate people and let them join their networks and that can be sort of more sort of replicable and you can have many of those I I I've come to think about this as sort of the a better sort of more realistic path um but yeah just getting back to I was gonna say what were the three axes again decentralized Universal and what was the third one um democratic Democratic okay um I was going to say not sort of not not uh scarce resource based so proof of personhood based I guess right yeah so I mean it just feels very foundational to me I mean Zuko's triangle is foundational in blockchain networks this feels like a foundational thing in the identity space so I just wanted to camp on it for a sec but um but you were telling us about how you got into this into this problem in in the writing of who watches the Watchmen so I would love to continue pulling that thread yeah uh and I'm happy to uh continue brainstorming what would be sort of the the triangle there um but yeah so so I was as I was thinking about how is it that uh that we could have Democratic Taos on the blockchain which seemed like an extraordinary thing to think about because if you have that then you can also have a Ubi or sort of currency that you sort of create and is shared by this community so it's it sort of like gives you if you can do this if you can have civil resistance in a decentralized network you can create so many interesting things um so I decided it was interesting enough to sort of be focused on on this uh problem try to learn a lot about it and I started writing out like designs for how to approach this and this was in 2017. and later on um in 2018 there were a few projects that had come up who are doing this I remember bright ID and Idina came around that and in 2019 I saw more projects and then more projects and by the time that I that so when when I started writing the article it was in 2020 and it was because I saw that there was an ecosystem already around this you know it was such a critical problem and nobody was happy with you know proof of stake governance and how that just obviously leads to plutocracies that people were creating solutions for this and I thought that it was sort of a legitimate community enough a small little ecosystem that you know you could write about it so the idea of the paper was just to um first to give it a name because proof of personhood the term was used to to um was how a specific methodology for This was um achieved and I wanted to take that term and say no proof of personhood is a category of approaches and there are multiple approaches not just this one and say you know this is this is a space it's a it's an ecosystem that is happening so um so we did that and just started to write about the different approaches and compare some of the pros and cons and I think that the paper sort of served to help create this you know this new category to make it so that proof of personhood which I think nobody has thought about this maybe before but after the paper proof of personhood was a thing you know whereas before it was used in that particular context of that one particular uh methodology um and then and then it also I think part of what I wanted to do after which we collaborated a bit on was that in the process of writing the paper I interviewed many different uh people who are leading proof of personal projects and some item some of them I knew before some I didn't but I um I wanted to I wanted for them to communicate with each other as well and to sort of exchange the things that they were learning um through their work and so I also created a little sort of working group um for proof of personal projects to just come together get to know each other yeah I've participated in a couple of those sessions it's been great to uh feels like finding our finding your tribe there's other people who care about civil resistance and identity but in a decentralized democratic way and I've learned a lot from that group also I've probably actually sourced a couple podcast guests from that group so thank you for your work on that yeah and it was you know it's it's funny because I'm I'm not like particularly interested in identity I I think I'm more in I'm in a similar position to yours Kevin that I'm interested in digital democracy I'm interested in sort of rethinking how we can do gov how we can collectively govern our communities how we can deliberate online sort of these are some of the questions that are in my mind but I I think that the work on this paper came from a recognition that identity is really a crucial element for this um I don't think that um as I was saying I nowadays the the projects that I reviewed in that paper together with dvsc darthan uh Sergey and Santi the co-authors the projects that we reviewed were looking at sort of universal Solutions um these days I'm a lot more excited to think about how is it that we can use so bound tokens or sort of more localized contextual ways of verifying each other which I I think will be more generative and more um interesting uh in you know to to they they lead to more interesting use cases because what I'm what I'm thinking about is how to do digital democracy on the blockchain uh and outside of it um and and if you have sort of more differentiation between groups within a community that allows you to do more interesting ways of uh structuring debates or um making decisions together um so so I'm more in the I'm leaning more towards the spt's uh path these days right yeah the SBT paper that vitalik and Glennon um and others wrote I think has been a huge inspiration for many of us in thinking about the plurality of data sets that could be uh available and and what could be done there and I think civil resistance data set paired with the membership data set so that you know that you're a part of a community allows you to do more so there's kind of like a money Lego aspect to it um what what Solutions or Trends or projects in the market are you excited about right now hmm um there's there's one project that I've been a bit obsessed about it's uh called govern uh g-o-v-r-n uh yes and they're doing spts for Dow contributions and maybe you know it doesn't sound like a big deal but I actually think that this can become a huge thing you know it can help sort of structure more um sort of it can give more resolution to how uh people are contributing to different communities and and the ways in which you could use that information to create more interesting reward systems to create better governance models is really mind-blowing to me and I also think that they're just doing it really well the interface is extraordinary um and they they are sort of they were thinking about um also they were coming from a similar place in mind of thinking about how is it that they can improve democracy and work with uh Legacy institutions as they say in the crypto World um and sort of recognized how crypto can offer really interesting promising reach design space and jumped into it building a phenomenal uh product and I'm super excited about geek coin as well I always you know when we're trying to explain uh what is it that we do at radical exchange um obviously I always mention uh git coin and it's it's sort of proved um it really is sort of the greatest example that we can provide of the power of of some of the concepts that we're working with and how they can serve to really energize um a community invigorate it and help facilitate uh participation and contributions in ways that other designs sort of don't don't so so super excited about it as well well thank you for saying that I think that get coin wouldn't be possible without the work of radical exchange and your work and uh oh you know Joe Lubin believed in Bitcoin before anyone else and so I think we're all standing on the shoulders of giants and that's one of the cool things about this space um it's been interesting since I I read the who watches the Watchman paper and as I mentioned who watches the Watchman was a inspiration actually the primary inspiration behind get coins trust bonus which was its V1 civil resistance tool um I I I gotta ask like when I look at the uh at the paper uh I see I see things like web of trust and token curated Registries and intersectional identity as things that you're excited about you're excited about identity Humanity or sorry identity Humanity dial Brett ID cleros who Paula like what any plans to write a who watches the Watchmen 2 that's it's all about your updated view as of 2023 uh of of what identity tools are are exciting I mean I think we've talked about how your views have evolved since then yeah I I I I definitely think that the sobone tokens paper is the who watches the Watchmen chew um okay and the answer is perhaps yeah everybody watches them I don't know if uh if uh Puja and Glenn and vitalik would uh say that you know I think it belongs in a category of its own but at the same time it it represents uh sort of the next step in my thinking about um about what three identity um having said that I just love the proof of personhood community so much as you mentioned this it was just so special to be able to have everyone in the same place because you often feel like you're sort of swimming against the current when you're in this space right like nobody wants to talk you know nobody wanted to talk about identity before the sovan paper nobody wanted to talk about that it was if you said that they would just sort of give you the sibo attack paper and say you know that's impossible uh it's impossible to have sort of a proof of personhood and you know these things will never work out um and yeah you so it's it's sort of I think that for everyone in that space it was sort of a lonely path of like trying to put together something that um went against the expectations and and trying to do that because we all thought that it was really important some of the people working on this are in places like Russia and other countries that were the reason why they're doing it is because they actually want to create an escape a way to exit very authoritarian governments you know the motivations are are so um impressive to hear and sort of the dedication that people put into trying to create blockchains as you know what truly decentralized not based on uh scarce resources type of mechanisms and I also think it's fascinating maybe like one thing that would sort of uh probably married a version two is how new blockchains are being created on top of this so right ID uh created their own blockchain and I know that I Idina is its own blockchain and it's exciting to think about how is it that we can maybe could possibly one day move to a different layer one Paradigm uh I I don't know if that's possible I think you know there are some attempts but uh but that would be that's something that I'm very intrigued by and that if it happened I think it would be sort of deeply revolutionary um so you're talking about a layer one world in which every new account is actually a new identity so civil resistance is just baked in at the base layer am I saying that correctly with the work of Audrey Tang in Taiwan uh I I am but you maybe want to cover a little bit just for the listeners who who are not yeah so Audrey is the digital minister of Taiwan and she was ahead of a movement called golf zero I came to her justice um you know in in this podcast I'd have to speak for 10 minutes about her background but she's a person a revolutionary activists and um sort of one of my very early Inspirations in in all of this and she uh she's the digital minister of Taiwan and in during the pandemic they uh sort of the hacktivism culture in Taiwan and her support of that culture in through the digital Ministry have made it so that um citizens could come together and create very interesting solutions to sort of tackle the pandemic so one example of that which he has she has framed it as a human blockchain a blockchain of humans was that um at the beginning of the pandemic everyone was rushing to buy masks right and so someone created a map in which you could see all of the pharmacies all of the drugstores and how many masks were in each of them and then um everyone hundreds of thousands of people came to this app and could contribute to it with information about the quantity of masks in their local shops so you had this system that was updated every 30 seconds with just precise information about the quantity of masks which sort of relaxed everyone and so they didn't hoard it and for a government to do this to keep this updated would be almost impossible even if it was like trying to execute it really well it would take some time it would be able to update it maybe once a day or once every two days um and it wouldn't be and because of that lag between sort of the the that lagging sort of being able to broadcast that precise information uh the information wouldn't be precise and uh you wouldn't generate that sense of like calm and that was achieved through this coordination and and so it's a pretty impressive feat of sort of collective organizing and in some ways it operated like a blockchain made of humans where like sharing this information um and verifying it and so if there was some uh if if the information in the database was wrong about one Pharmacy they could just um call a line and and um have it be corrected um and so I I don't know what I mean exactly when I talk about a sort of a base one layer where each person is a human that sort of idea in some ways but there are questions about uh how far that could scale um although it's you know it's an extraordinary project and very very very much worth looking into learning about I think it's one of the most interesting things happening in the blockchain space to I'm going to describe it uh quickly it's you know a system in which people um they have meetings that are pre-scheduled and they all come online and then solve these puzzles online all at the same time synchronously so that you can't do it multiple times you have a specific um there's a limit of how much time you can take to solve the puzzles and then everyone who participated in this is a node in the blockchain so it's super fascinating um but yeah I think it would be um I I wonder about what are the digital kinds of infrastructure that we can create if we start to connect with each other as humans um and not you know through the through an infrastructure that is based on uh proof of work or proof of stake um but I think that would take a long time but I think that that that's what would motivate me to to write again about this working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker

the things I wanted to highlight a Audrey Tang deserves her her own episode I'm trying to get around the Pod uh the digital minister of Taiwan but that example of The covid Masks preventing a panic by having updated information about where the masks were so that you always knew that you could get one if you if you had anyway that said it to me an example of collective intelligence in which a network is much more efficient than a government even spending a hundred times what a network could because you're leveraging the collective intelligence from the edges of the network and that's been a theme for me of what is possible in the Civic Tech space what can we do that what can a network do that uh better that a hierarchy can can not do and I think that's the whole design space of of some of the green pill and the regen stuff is how do we leverage our collective intelligence in in order to solve coordination failures better collective intelligence means better Collective resource allocation so um yeah thanks for that example that's it's very inspiring yeah um yeah and um I highly recommend everyone also checking out the work of devious siddarth uh with her collective intelligence uh project and she was here as well right Kevin um yeah so there's also got another great episode of uh of green pill with her and I think that this is she was able to sort of um get to get to what this all of this really is about like what are these you know markets are collective intelligence mechanisms democracy or collective intelligence mechanisms but I definitely think that we're sort of a very beginning of trying to understand sort of a neglected um space you know collective intelligence we should we should we think they're fascinating questions uh to ask um about what is it that we can achieve together uh when when we have the proper infrastructure for it yeah yeah absolutely um and so maybe you know civil resistance is just sort of one of the problems that we're solving a first place that is a high leverage point for other collective intelligence problems being solved and I just want to camp on that for a little bit because to me you know we talk in the blockchain space about money Legos a lot and basically what is the uh you know erc20 the effect that opens Zeppelin just has an auditable erc20 Library means that I as a hacker can go just deploy an erc20 thing as part of my project and go focus on my use case instead of rebuilding that that that Lego um and so um you know can you can you can you like paint me a picture of a world in which there's just a civil resistance money Lego uh if if we solve that what do we get like what what are the what are the goodies that that could be gotten if if that is solved um you know it is really compelling to think about uh what do we get um you know because identity is sort of this fundamental thing um it's this fundamental building block um of our institutions through our identities we get our rights through our identities we get the ability to vote um so it's really this fundamental uh building block and um Primavera de Philippines said that uh you know blockchain solved the uh double spend problem but we need to solve the double human problem and and I think that we can do that we're very well equipped to do that in especially in small communities through new interesting mechanisms like spts and maybe their good solutions for a larger communities like bright idea or Idina and many others um and you know once you have that Lego that that building block you you can create one of the most exciting things that you can create is community currencies so um my colleague Matt Pruitt talks a lot about that he says that um Universal currencies um they sort of make it so that the that we coordinate around the lowest common denominator that we have with each other which is power um instead of sort of localized values um and if you're able to have currencies in which sort of there's a tax for exiting the community for taking money out of the community so that you know there's an incentive to spend within a community and to strengthen it um that could be deeply transformative um and it's probably the one of the things that I think that I'm that I'm most excited about um we can also do much more uh pluralistic ways of doing democracy we can sort of have uh ways to reconcile different preferences within any community that are that are much more powerful than our traditional voting systems today if we're able to record to recognize uh through not only through a civil resistance mechanism but through something more nuanced like an spt if we can recognize all of the different sort of social Dimensions that exist within a community then then that equips us to also um facilitate more um com like the construction of more common ground and consensus across those different um social Dimensions so um I think that you know it would give us the ability to build a lot more interesting um digital democracies uh in essence you know I think I think a lot about what would happen if like a movement like women's March or um Fridays for the future some if these movements that sort of have organized online had those tools in their hands it's it's mind-blowing to think about what would happen if um if the Arab Spring you know you know how it started on Facebook with Facebook tools like but what if they had um interesting sort of Dao tools uh at their disposal too and that would help them do governance and by that I don't mean that I I'm I almost regret saying this because I don't think that right now the direction in which Taos are going uh is sort of constructing towards that scenario um which is why we're having this conversation you know we we need to devise better identity mechanisms so that those can actually become Democratic um but if that happened it would be really interesting to see what different social movements uh do with those tools um you know it sort of like moves um sorry to interrupt but I think that the the what what he what it means is that you get to have the ability as a collective and as a society to move from protest and agitation towards Construction and that's you know revolutionary let's record an episode with Nathan Schneider and we talked a lot about how social media can do coherence things it can break things down it can create Revolution but it doesn't hold power all that well so you know your example of the Arab Spring and Nathan's example of Occupy Wall Street being these mass movements in which you deconstructed power um but then they kind of like piddled out when they were expected to hold power and I think that that's one of the upsides that I see for I mean we talk the meme is digital democracy and high resolution democracy and those are hopefully institutions in collective intelligence mechanisms that can hold power if they're designed well so to me the question is what are the money Legos that allow us to get there and how do we rotate capital and talent into ecosystems so that you know like what 2017 was to Capital formation and icos in 2022 was to nfts I guess 2021 was to nfts like what would it take for digital democracy capital and talent rotation in 2024 like what are the money Legos that we need to get there clearly there's a civil resistance money Lego what are the other high leverage points in in creating that that system or is that is that even the system we want to create and if so what are the high leverage points I think that and it sort of profoundly underappreciated Lego if you want to call it is um Community organizing um I think that we sort of one of the reasons why Bitcoin is so exceptional is because you um sort of exerted a leadership role you communicated a lot about these ideas you cared about making so that more people understood this is what we're doing here and you you built a community around it not just a product right um and I when I talk to sort of the the activists from Taiwan and all of the work and effort that they put into you know it's we we talk a lot about decentralization as this sort of desirable thing but actually bringing our community together is a process that takes a lot of centralization you know it takes a lot of sort of focused work um and you need to create spaces in which uh different actors can come into relationship with each other uh people from government people from Tech designers people activists um Scholars of all kinds um you need to these spaces need to be nice fun present you know they need to have nice food they need to have nice music they need to be sort of a positive experience that everyone wants to um that makes everyone wants to be there and sort of co-create together because we don't have a lot of um experience in sort of really living as a Civic life right like we don't most of us are sort of not doing anything that is concerned the collective and even though my work for example is sort of working at rxc with with uh consult with many people who are in government and helping them structure participatory processes in my own Community I don't have a lot of that lost a lot of that also especially due to the pandemic but I just think that in general there is um a role that for Community entrepreneurship sort of bringing different people together and um and creating the culture creating the space creating the opportunities for collaboration um that is seriously underestimated like this is a crucial part of how to build these things and nobody talks about that uh whereas I I think that is exactly why because it's sort of a baffling thing I don't know if you ever think about this Kevin but in between 2017 and 27 in 2018 so much money was poured into these Dao projects right like in the Ico boom like why is it that we're not getting sort of astounding results out of it you know why didn't they build out all of these nice Civic civil resistance stuff and interest in governance stuff because they didn't had good leadership you know and that so so that's I think a Lego that we need a lot more of and and then which leads to the question of like how how do you build these uh these leaders yeah yeah well you know thank you for the nice things you said about Bitcoin uh of course equally nice things to say about your work and the leadership of radical exchange has been immense um and there's many many leaders in the ecosystem that I think are creating a plurality that hopefully creates that rotation of capital and talent into creating these Legos in the next cycle um and I guess you know that's a segue to Max question is what are you up to now uh your CEO at radical exchange what are you focused on uh are you creating leadership in order to create a movement towards this stuff and uh how can people help with that um yeah I think that ultimately a radical exchange but I would hope to see sort of the emergence of uh well coordinated movement um and it's very hard to to structure it um we do have chapters all over the world uh but we need to sort of nurture that uh more um intently and I think one one of the reasons why this is not sort of my focus right now is that I think there's an educational component that should come before that so I've been thinking a lot about how to build this and we've talked about this uh last week when when we saw each other um I think that there's sort of a a need to to create more accessible exciting compelling educational resources about these topics um I think you know I I ask myself a lot like why is it that new graduate you know newly graduated students are not sort of jumping into the opportunity to work in these uh with these questions one of their answers is that there aren't many opportunities you sort of have to create them yourself you know when when I started in the space radical exchange didn't exist um but yeah we do many things at rxc one is we put together events in the next two uh weeks is this going up in the next few weeks uh I will Air it on Tuesday so we're recording Friday September 30th should be out in a few days cool so before Devcon so I'll just uh lay it out we have lots going on um so uh we're going to be in in Bogota um and we'll have uh we're creating a a tent called plurality in uh at shelling point where also co-hosting a tech for democracy hackathon that I highly encourage everyone to apply to um including web 3 projects um we are um also going to host a workshop at Devcon um sharing more about what we mean by plural social Technologies and uh inviting everyone to come in and then after that we'll also be participating at an event in Poland called Freedom games where we also helped create a schedule and we will be uh we'll have our own event on October 18th uh in varsov which will be sort of a one day RX event so one of the things uh answering your question one of the things that we do at rxc is we we we do a lot of events we bring together people and we try to sort of harness everyone's sort of all of the interesting work and uh research that is going around and bring it together for people and create spaces where people can meet each other um and make connections and learn more about uh this kind of work then we do a lot of research we build software where we sort of instantiate some of our best thinking on how to structure um deliberation processes and governance processes in general and then we consult with different partners and a bit about um about this the idea sort of the the basic concepts that we work with at radical exchange um these are Concepts that are that all have sort of pluralism as their underlying principles so they're trying to um facilitate to to help recognize and Foster um collaboration across social difference so there are voting mechanisms public goods funding mechanisms deliberation mechanisms uh many sort of new interesting ways uh through which you can recognize and Foster more collaboration across difference and we try to advance the adoption of these uh through all of these means that I um just mentioned uh now and in doing that also provide an alternative version of what could be the future of technology in democracy and capitalism or not even capitalism maybe an alternative to that as well um I think radical exchange is such a special place obviously uh quadratic funding came out of Red X but it's so much more it's a community in which you can exchange radical digital Democratic ideas and I wholly endorse it so uh see everyone at shellingpoint in Bogota uh at the rxc 10 at the plurality tent and uh thanks for coming on the Pod Paula thank you for having me Kevin this was a lot of fun yeah totally peace thank you [Music]
