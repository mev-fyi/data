welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity I'm David Hoffman here without my co-host Ryan Sean Adams but nonetheless we are here to help you become more thankless and on today's show this is a very special episode we are talking about nfts on bitcoin and this has been the absolute Talk of the bitcoiner world ever since uh ordinals this new protocol has started to fill up all the Bitcoin block space with jpegs Yes you heard that right with nfts nfts are now part of Bitcoin and it's through this protocol this brand new protocol called ordinals which is doing some interesting stuff with Bitcoin block space and it has caused a bunch of controversy as to whether or not this is a legitimate use case of Bitcoin is that even a fair thing to charge an app with being illegitimate some people think that this is spamming the Bitcoin blockchain other things that this other people think that this is just what you're allowed to do with Bitcoin if you pay the Bitcoin fee then you're able to get into the Bitcoin blockchain uh there's been some other conversations as well as what can you do with nfts on bitcoin is this really anything useful or is this just a place to put monkey pictures on bitcoin um did you know bankless listener that you can actually run doom on bitcoin and I actually do play a little bit of Doom live here on the show my two guests are Casey rodemore who is the creator of ordinals this protocol that is filling up Bitcoin block space with jpegs and also my good friend Eric Wall who is somebody that I frequently tap into in order to get help navigating the Bitcoin world because uh as of course I don't pay nearly as much attention to bitcoin as I do ethereum and just the way that Bitcoin works is fundamentally different than how ethereum works so I'm bringing in Eric was a technical co-host co-moderator to help me guide through this conversation with Casey in this conversation we talk about how ordinals work how nfts even come to be on bitcoin we talk about some of the reactions from the Bitcoin Community while some leaders are offended most people are actually more okay with it than what might let on and actually Eric walks us through about how this new use case for Bitcoin is perhaps bringing a sustainable fee Market to buying Bitcoin block space well it actually doesn't blow Bitcoin actually makes it even more streamlined so we actually perhaps get a win-win where Bitcoin can actually become more sustainable due to block space demand because of ordinals because of nfts on bitcoin while also making the Bitcoin blockchain easier to process how do we get this win-win Eric Wall walks us through that and more and of course we poke fun at some Bitcoin fundamentalists a hobby as old as time on the bankers program but first before we get to all of these conversations we have to talk to our friends at metamask and metamask has built out this brand new educational platform which they're calling metamask learn you can go there and check it out at learn.menimask.io but it is an interactive course for you to learn about web3 through metamask learn you can do things like be guided through how to set up your metamask wallet but also learn about core basic crypto principles like what is web3 what does self-custody even mean what are nfts what is defy what's digital identity metamask has this very elaborate highly engaging and interactive course that again you can find at learn.metamask.io and it can be a place if you don't want to teach your mom or dad about crypto but they asked you you can send them here so the so you can offload them onto again learn.mass.io so check that out there's a link in the show notes if you want to get you or your family members or your loved ones or whoever asks what is that crypto thing you can get them leveled up at metamask learn it's not often that we do Bitcoin content here on Bank list but when something comes to my attention via crypto Twitter or whatnot about new utilities on bitcoin that is external to the actual base Bitcoin protocol yet it is still a valid purchasing of Bitcoin block space I get really really excited I hope you're excited as well definitely pay attention and I definitely take some time at the very beginning of the show to really parse out these details the way that Bitcoin is constructed the philosophy behind Bitcoin is very different from ethereum Bitcoin and its soft Forks which we go through in this episode segwit Taproot they're actually about taking features away from Bitcoin allowing for the second layer around Bitcoin something like ordinals to be built upon Bitcoin and so rather than hard forking features in which is the ethereum philosophy Bitcoin hard Forks take features out but that still does enable some expressivity on higher order layers around Bitcoin so definitely pay attention to the different philosophy behind these two systems it is a topic of conversation that's always super interesting to me and you can unpack some of the ways that Bitcoin is built differently but of course we are ultimately going to be talking about nfts on bitcoin and all the other second order consequences to that as well so stay tuned for this great conversation with Eric and Casey but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible especially Kraken who is our strategic sponsor for 2023 because Kraken has been around for

I want to introduce you to Casey rodimer Casey is an open source Bitcoin developer who is building ordinals which has caused headphones so excited to come on to bankless uh who has caused a little bit of a stir in the Bitcoin Community but overall a bunch of conversations as to what's going on in this small corner of Bitcoin which has now been the host of many cool nfts at least I think they're cool other people don't and also join with me is Eric Wall who is my substitute teacher for Ryan Sean Adams when we need to talk about Bitcoin and all things technical Bitcoin uh so Eric is going to help me guide us through this conversation as probably one of the most knowledgeable people about Bitcoin and other related Technologies Casey and Eric welcome to bank list guys thanks so much for having me it's uh awesome awesome to be here awesome to be able to talk to your viewers so yeah thanks so much always a pleasure David all right so let's get this thing kicked off this uh has created a bunch of hubbub in the Bitcoin world but I want to start first and foremost with just diving into ordinals specifically so Casey can you just walk us through ordinals what's ordinals yeah absolutely um so there's kind of two layers to the whole thing there's the base layer which is this thing called ordinals and then on top of that there are inscriptions which are the nfts so ordinals are a um convention essentially for numbering individual Bitcoin satoshi's and TR so they they have a unique individual identity every single Satoshi and tracking them across transactions as they are spent um it's doesn't require any changes to bitcoin it doesn't actually take up any data on the base layer and it is purely an opt-in convention uh it doesn't really affect Bitcoin fungibility which is often a question that I get asked it's just a convention for people who want to um participate in it like a lens that you can choose to see the same data that everybody else is seeing but with this additional these additional Satoshi identifiers and tracking so uh this was created uh I created it although there was actually some a Bitcoin Forum talk Post in 2012 that I found after I came up with it with exactly the same scheme so I think it's actually kind of like a very natural extension of Bitcoin that when you think about it everything kind of falls into place so but then those uh ordinal numbers or trackable satoshi's or whatever those can be used to sort of contain content or be assigned an nft and this is called inscriptions which is sort of a top layer so an inscription is just a piece of content that is included in a Bitcoin transaction in a part of the transaction called the witness and that content is arbitrary the content model is very similar to the web containing a content type which is a string that identifies what kind of content it is and a body which are just content bites that's include included in the witness in the in a Bitcoin transaction and then um the inscription is made on the first sat of the first output of that transaction um sort of creating this digital artifact which is then transferred uh using the ordinal protocol or ordinal Theory uh when I'm being uh cute so um yeah it creates these things um I like to call them digital artifacts because the term nft is very overloaded and and refers to a lot of different things and I think these have very unique properties that people who collect nfts will like um but yeah that's the that's the basic idea and just to make it Crystal Clear uh in from the ethereum perspective when you create an nft you're actually creating a digital object on ethereum an actual token that's not what's being created on bitcoin is it the actual individual Satoshi that is the transferable unit that is what we are kind of colloquially calling nft is that the you said you are assigning a lifespan to an individual Satoshi and then the Satoshi has data appended to it and these two properties together start to appear to look and feel like the nfts that we know on ethereum is that fair yeah that's right I mean I think you know um things are nfts which have the properties that users certain properties that users are looking for they want them to be unique they want them to be transferable they want them to have a piece of content associated with them so I think whether or not these are nfts is sort of up for everybody to decide according to their own definition of what an nft is but yeah that's correct essentially the SATs are already the tokens and they're sort of on the Bitcoin base layer they are very fungible if you view them through the lens of uh the ordinals protocol they become non-fungible and then um when if you then additionally use inscriptions and have like an inscription wallet or an inscription Explorer so um the open source tool which is the wallet and the Explorer that I wrote is called with additional contributors is called ORD and the block Explorer is on ordinals.com and so if you're using that tool then you can see the individual sets you can see where they are and you can see the content that is associated with them um so yeah and then that behaves like an nft you can create content that is then in your wallet and then you can send it on to others the way that you're articulating this I think is diving into a particular philosophy that a Bitcoin has where from the Bitcoin blockchain perspective it doesn't know what is going on with the ordinals but then you use this word from the ordinal lens as in you actually have to opt into looking at Bitcoin through this particular protocol cult we'll call it ordinals and then all of a sudden this nft expression is able to become out of that through and if he's by like a normal Bitcoin node doesn't actually know what the hell is going on here and Erica this is where I want to turn to you and maybe you can help us tell the story when did this uh feature uh some bitcoiners might call it a bug but I'll call it a feature when did this feature become like a possible in the Bitcoin blockchain and can you kind of help just articulate this this difference in vision of how the Bitcoin protocol Works which is what more bankless uh audience might be might be used to with the ethereum world yeah so um creating different clients that interpret what is going on on inside the Bitcoin blockchain and sort of sort of building meta protocols on top of the Bitcoin blockchain has existed for a long time like Omni is such an example which is the first place where usdt tether uh made their stable coins um Master coin and counterparty are also such protocols um the the thing with ordinals and especially in how the inscription part is made leverages Taproot so uh we've always been able to embed arbitrary data inside the Bitcoin blockchain using op return but it was limited to I think 80 bytes um so to the extent that it's been possible to create a protocol that embeds arbitrary data on bitcoin that's always been possible it just became with Taproot it became significantly simpler to do that in single transactions to embed sizable sums of data in a single transaction so it's always been possible to create like an nft layer on bitcoin it already it already exists like rare pep base exists on counterparty on bitcoin already today it just now you can make much uh larger content types due to certain limits that was that were removed in Taproot script versus uh regular segregated witness witness groups I don't know if I'm explaining that uh in the in the most simple way but the way that you can think about it is that in 2000 uh it was always possible to embed arbitrary data into Bitcoin and then in 2017 segregated witness came and we got this extra chunk three up to four megabytes of witness data could now be assigned to bitcoin blocks however in individual transactions there were still limits to how much data you could put into individual transactions after Taproot happened you could basically make a single transaction that takes up the entirety of an entire block so the ordinals sort of just leverages Taproot to create a more user-friendly experience of and more easily more easily buildable and toolable uh nft system for for Bitcoin and the language you're using like we Bitcoin got Segway then it got Taproot if you come from this from an ethereum perspective you probably think these are hard Forks but they're not they're soft Forks Eric can you kind of walk us through how how when you were it feels like we're adding something to bitcoin when we add segwit is that really the right perspective to take and how when we already have like this capability to put nfts on bitcoin but then Taproot happened and now we have more of this ability can you kind of just walk us through how to think about this yeah so a hard Fork is an expansion of the consensus rules a soft Fork is a contraction of the of the consensus rules but even though that we're Contracting the consensus rules when you're Contracting it does actually mean that you can you you can attach extra rules that need to be validated so all the previous rules you need to validate them but now you need to validate extra rules so actually the the validity space is shrinking when you're soft working and because you're adding extra rules to validate that also means that you can add extra functionality so you can actually increase the block size through a soft fork and add new types of script scripting features inside of Bitcoin using softworks and so now there's like the I mean maybe there always was but there's like this two parts of Bitcoin block space and this part is kind of fuzzy for me where there's like the normal I make a Bitcoin transaction and that data goes into one part of Bitcoin and then there's this other part of Bitcoin which I think Taproot really unlocked which is where this nft data is going into can you also walk us through that actually this uh other part of the the the other part of the uh Bitcoin data uh was unlocked in 2017 with segregated witnessing segregated witness witness stands for like segregating the witness date and witness data is a strange word but the way the easiest way to think about it is maybe like signatures on transactions are witnesses so uh when we so in 2017 we wanted to increase the block size of Bitcoin it was a big political push to increase the block size limit of Bitcoin but um we only really increased it for this witness state of these signatures and the reason for that is that it's it it's uh okay to have much more witness data in Bitcoin because after you validated a signature you know that a transaction is valid and now you don't actually need to keep it on your full node anymore you because you have validated you can just say okay I know that this transaction was valid I validated the signature but after you you validated the signature it doesn't really serve a purpose on your node anymore so you can throw it away therefore the witness part of uh the witness part of the data on the blockchain got segregated out from the regular data and the the the big change here was that because this data can be pruned more um it can be pruned on full nodes without it stopping being a full node we changed how much it cost to embed such data into the blockchain so now there's a 4X discount for this type of witness data so it's four times cheaper where you have something called a virtual byte so even if you play but if you put a 50 or let's say put a 100 kilobyte file in the in the in the witness data of Bitcoin it's going to get counted as if it's 25 kilobytes because we discount that's that's why it's called the witness discount uh segwit with the discount we discount how much that data actually counts for uh because it's not necessarily going to be on all full nodes forever so we can allow that portion of the data to grow uh faster so it's kind of like for for an ethereum I would say like it's kind of like blob space you know it's is this part of the date uh you know in ethereum with the IP 48 uh 44 we allow the block size of ethereum to grow rapidly because that block space that we're increasing doesn't it has nothing to do with execution we're not validating that to any extent it's just raw data and also it's getting thrown away uh or it's Auto pruned every two weeks the this witness data in Bitcoin is not Auto prune necessarily but you can manually prune it prune it so in that way it is sort of similar to blob space um in ethereum right and it's really that the economic cost that's lowered that really unlocks the ability to more viably embed data into the chain and I think Casey that's where ordinals really uh has found its uh carved out its spot in the in the Bitcoin World which is like oh there's this data that we can take advantage of that's cheaper than the rest of the data and that lets us do things Casey uh when so this seems to have been always been possible as soon as we had segwit when did the idea for ordinals come to uh come into your brain yeah um there are actually some other important advantages of of ordinals um that we can get into but just to say them really quick it's that um because um ordinals because the ordinals protocol can these like made up stats can be stored in normal Bitcoin addresses and transacted with normal Bitcoin transactions and kind of sit in normal Bitcoin utxos um it means that there doesn't need to be a parallel infrastructure entirely for wallets and services um the ORD utility it uses the rust Bitcoin Library which is a great um just sort of standard Bitcoin library for its transaction construction and signing and it also uses Bitcoin core as the back end for its wallet um for a lot of uh transaction also some transaction construct construction and signing um and so I think that's the that's another one of the big advantages is that it integrates a little bit more cleanly into into Bitcoin but yeah um that was an awesome summary by Eric everything totally completely accurate um and yeah like so I started thinking about this in uh early early 2022 um I've done some generative art and I um I I sort of saw that you know when nfts got popular in 2017 um I wasn't super interested um I just didn't see anything that really spoke to me or anything that like I could you know contribute to as a as a Creator um but then when I saw a really really cool algorithmic and generative nfts start to get really popular I thought like man like it would be awesome to be able to like make these myself um and I think I actually I wrote a test ERC 721 contract um but for a variety of reasons I didn't really feel like uh like the the tooling didn't strike me as very good um there's some sort of technical issues so like uh every nft on ethereum is a separate smart contract and so technically they can kind of have different properties you need to audit them for security for immutability um you need to audit them for where the content is stored um some of them are you know Totally Secure totally immutable no backdoor keys and content is stored on the ethereum blockchain sort of going down in the tiers of like desirability for most collectors you know then there's things that are on ipfs which are stored um by hash but itfs is basically like BitTorrent and people can stop seeding content at any time systems like our weave you know I don't want to get too mean or controversial or anything but I I'm not convinced by the economic incentives of those systems um and so as a result I just sort of felt like I couldn't really be comfortable like I could make nfts on ethereum but I couldn't necessarily be comfortable like encouraging people to buy them um and so I looked for a way to that's just because the assurances that the data of the nft could not be completely fulfilled because ethereum couldn't host enough of that data um so you I could have put the data on chain um I could have made a contract without any uh upgrade Keys um I would would have been a little bit unhappy having people like have to audit the code um the way that the way that nfts are commonly sold on ethereum and like I'm I'm fuzzy on this so correct me if I'm wrong is that you know when you sell an nft on on open C you give openc permission to transfer your nfts um so that being the standard by which nfts are traded um also not very enthusiastic it really wasn't any one thing it was just sort of a you know loose collection of concerns um so then I you know I'm a Bitcoin developer uh I used to be a Bitcoin core contributor although I'm honestly not exactly comfortable calling myself like a Bitcoin core Dev because I'm I was a very minor one and that was a long time ago um and so I I started to look for a way to do this on bitcoin so in early 2022 um I just started noodling and um One technical difference difference between Bitcoin and ethereum is that Bitcoin uses the utxo model so a wallet is just kind of these collection of coins and these coins you know they don't have any like permanent identity they just kind of get created and then destroyed and so for something like uh an nft protocol where nfts are like us are like permanent and they don't they don't just go away when you like spend them you know they have to be transferable that that's when I started noodling on this like ordinals thing this low level this like trackable sets and I didn't know how exactly I was going to write the nft part of the part of the protocol um but yeah so noodled on that for a long time and when I when I came up with the idea of making SATs trackable by this pretty simple algorithm it's basically just you have these SATs on the input and you have the SATs on the in outputs and then you imagine that they just move in a straight line across the first side of the first output is going to input is going to the first side of the first input anything extra goes to fees and appears out of the coinbase reward and once I had that like all the pieces kind of came together very quickly and and so started writing an index initially which could just track these sat locations and see if this algorithm was essentially tractable to use at all and then um started working on inscriptions which is the sort of assigning content um I like Eric said it's always been possible to store arbitrary content on on bitcoin it's just been inconvenient you know op return has this size limit you could do it in pretty paid a script hash but they're the standardness limits you could do it in segwit scripts in the witness but there are these weird standardness limits there too and then Taproot which I think was went live at the end of 2021 um that basically just removed all the um those standardness restrictions um and which actually had not been there to specifically prevent arbitrary data from being published on the Chain there were actually things like you know if you're constructing a transaction you don't want to run into one of these weird restrictions that all of a sudden makes your transaction like non-standard and can't be relayed um so yeah and then so the came up with the construction for putting the content in the witness which is just sort of like an OP false op if and then a bunch of data pushes and an OP Endive and that makes all the data pushes between the optif and op endif just get ignored so from bitcoin's point of view it's a no op um yeah and then you know come up with the assignment algorithm and the wallet and the block Explorer where you can actually view these things um so yeah that is the rough timeline and then I think we did a Signet release in like November of last year and we got a lot of good testers and a lot of use um and then we did a mainnet release I think it was January 20th of this year 2023 and then like things just went absolutely insane like it's been absolute Madness absolute chaos and I think part of the reason like lots of memes lots of Pepes and one of the reasons that there's been so much chaos is is additionally because of of this of this controversy you know is Bitcoin should Bitcoin be used this way is the discount unfair is this an attack Vector on bitcoin is this an exploit like all this drama has certainly propelled the project uh into the public eye yeah certainly and I think that's where I kind of want to turn to this uh turn the conversation to next but one last question when you just to really clarify this when you made ordinals the intent was to be utility for art right like it was an art based project that's yeah that's 100 correct and actually the ordinals protocol could be used for fungible tokens you know for erc20 style tokens but it's actually not very good for that um it's pretty weird it has a lot of weird details of how it works I think you could do that and if it gets really popular it's it's actually can be a convenient way to do that um one nice thing is actually you can do these protocols semi-privately so you can just you and your friends can elect to give special meaning to some of these SATs and then track how they move but then that special meaning doesn't need to be published to the chain and you can all sort of agree the set ranges that you care about and where they are without having to reveal anything to the world But to answer your question yeah like I'm uh I don't really consider myself an artist I make like programmer art but yeah it was really focused on how to do art and how to do um how to do this like nft use case yeah so this is where I want to zoom out and get into um the mindset of a bitcoiner or very the various flavors of bitcoiners that you see out there and so this is where I want to turn back to Eric and and to unpack this story a little bit um we'll talk about to what degree this is uh offensive to all bitcoiners or like how many of bitcoiners are offended by this but Eric uh putting putting your offended bitcoiner hat on why why is this uh how does this violate Bitcoin or philosophy or and can you just like tell the story yeah I think it's it's pretty easy to to um for me to to express that because when I originally discovered the ordinal system I myself thought that this doesn't sound like such a great idea I had to think about it for two days until I came to the conclusion why why it's not a bad idea but the um the way to think about it is that like we've had issues with uh people trying to build non-financial use cases on top of Bitcoin since forever and one thing that you can sort of think about like why would that be undesirable well if you think about if you think about um what's it called board ape drops on ethereum and it just causes these fee surges like that's one of the kind of problems that you have when there's demand for your block space that isn't tied to this financial use case um but Satoshi instead of us transferring ether paying each other with money doing Finance stuff we're doing monkey pictures and that is uh crowding out the finance stuff that's what you're trying to say yeah it's causing volatility in the system that is not uh you know as predictable as the the financial aspects of it um but even Satoshi was initially thinking about creating creating ens type systems on top of Bitcoin and it was called bit DNS and then I think it was Satoshi who decided that actually let's create some let's let's create um another coin for it instead let's create a name coin and then we've been trying to create all these Drive chains and side chains to bitcoin so that we wouldn't have all this type of activity on top of Bitcoin just to keep the the Bitcoin protocol as uh on complex and as unencumbered by other incentives going on in the system because we sort of think that Bitcoin is uh too complex as as it already is um so the the but the thing that did that that I the reason that I didn't like uh ordinals or inscriptions especially actually I think ordinals are kind of cool um in the sense that I think one one thing that you describe very well on your blog Casey and that Dennis describes on his blog also very well is that you know if you have a bunch of stocks in your in in your brokerage account now depending on like they look completely fungible in your brokerage account but depending on you know you have this first in first out principle and that's how the tax man decides how much tax you pay uh based on like are you selling the ones that you bought first or are you so there's there's queuing systems and there's just ways to think about like all your stocks stacked together and are you taking it from the top of their stack with the bottom of the stack that's sort of a great way to to sort of understand the urinal system that that I think you described on your blog pretty well um but the uh the reason that I didn't like inscriptions and inscriptions to just repeat what Casey said inscriptions are the part when you embed these data blobs uh that are attached to specific satoshi's because you're inscribing quote unquote the SAT yeah and I suppose the thing that I didn't like is that so I'm um I've grown over the years to actually appreciate nfts a lot on ethereum and uh one of the things that I really do appreciate with nfts on ethereum is that you can create these types of arbitrary complex auction Logics uh minting rules and right now for example I'm doing uh one nft project where I'm implementing a harburger tax which is like a pretty amazing uh and undiscovered uh way of controlling ownership and incentivizing Carpenter taxes are sick the economists loves them man yeah and you can do that on ethereum but I don't think that you can do that with uh ordinal inscription nfts so I kind of thought that Bitcoin even though yes you can make nfts on bitcoin you you the things that I like about nfts are these programmable parts to it that make them you know more potentially more interesting so I thought you know even though you can do it on bitcoin I mean we should probably still be doing nfts on ethereum and therefore I don't like that nfts are now taking up space on uh Bitcoin but I came to um I came to a different conclusion maybe I don't want to take up too much time going through how my own thought process went like maybe we can go back to that but I've since then come to the conclusion that that actually ordinals are not bad for Bitcoin um you if you want me to dig into it I'm I'm just gonna sort of stop here and give you a chance to to interrupt yeah Casey if you have any any thoughts go for it I have a few more other topics I want to get to first before we get to that part of uh no totally totally fair and and yeah it's true like uh the programmability of uh uh inscriptions and ordinals is is very limited I'm you know like you can't just write arbitrary code and and deploy it and I'm you know I'm working on for example like a trustless swap which would let you do sort of these like trustless trades um and I have to like figure out how I can like line up the inputs and the outputs and use the different Sig hash Flags to like get this very simple functionality um working so I'd say you know inscription's probably occupy like a distinct Market segment you know where um they're not programmable and so there are lots of things you can't do I'm really stoked to see how the harbinger tax goes I that's something I've been thinking about for nfts and like I just think it's uh awesome to people for people to start experimenting with things that are you know um more incentive compatible you know the philosophy that I've uh gathered is that um there's this there's this word that's gone around there illegitimate Bitcoin transactions as in this is not legitimate and I can't remember who it was it was a another Bitcoin leader is like yeah Dennis uh how do you pronounce his last name Porto Porto Porto won't say it's Dennis anyway uh he wrote uh he wrote the the blog post on ordinals that got me uh you know up to speed and interested in it so that's sort of why you know I jumped in and started to transfer my trump nft cars onto the ordinal inscription systems and instead of early inscription that was a big boy I noticed it yeah and it was the same guy you know correct me if I'm wrong Casey but I what I heard is that the guy who made uh inscription number one which is a dick butt is someone who looked at the ordinal system when it was sort of in beta maybe I'm saying it and just hard forked it and deployed it on mainnet without you being ready for it and then he made a dick butt on mainnet using the original system so that was the same guy yeah that was the same guy that made the trump nft card for me using uh the original system correct me yeah that's no yeah that's roughly true we had um it kind of didn't need any changes to be all on Signet versus mainnet it kind of worked with both but we had this artificial limitation in the client that if you tried to run out on mainnet it would complain because we didn't want people creating inscriptions that might get invalidated if we change the protocol luckily we never needed to change any things that would invalidate an old inscription so all inscriptions that have been made on mainnet are valid and will continue to be valid um but yeah so I made a test inscription to see how it works and I was like okay and then like immediately like dick butt like um game developers have this term it's a TTP which stands for time to penis and basically it's the time between when a user like downloads or installs your game for the first time to the point that they are can make another user look at a a penis or penis like object you know um and the ordinals the inscriptions uh TTP uh catastrophically low inscription number one second one is a dick butt we have to give a shout out to the guy who did it I his Twitter handle is rot 13 uh Maxi so he's a g he's awesome yeah super great guy yeah I agree so the the bitcoiner philosophy a Bitcoin or philosophy uh is that we want Bitcoin to only be about money um monetary premium monetary premium monetary premium and so that's what Bitcoin block space is preserved for and if you put anything else in the Bitcoin block blocks Block Chain that's not about transferring Bitcoins or using BTC as money that's like quote unquote illegitimate uh and I want to uh like to pause and camp on this legitimate word uh to you Eric what what makes a legitimate Bitcoin transaction and is this even a fair question to ask yeah I think that you have the question slightly misframed because the thing that Bitcoin Maximus have been saying is that actually Financial transactions are the most economically dense type of activity that will just uh bully uh everything else out which isn't actually necessarily true I mean we have one Satoshi per byte fees like the minimum possible and it's all Financial transactions and now the fees are actually going up and it's because of these uh dick but pictures are actually finally you know it might be possible that the dick buds are saving the security budget problem for Bitcoin like the dick Bots may actually make it so that we don't need to increase the the number of coins in Bitcoin so they may save the the problem like dick butts could be the solution but the some part some bitcoiners are currently like very you know really don't want that kind of stuff because they believe that it's going to weigh down the chain and fill it with nonsensical data which is which is actually also an incorrect uh interpretation of what the long-term consequences of uh ordinal inscriptions actually will be to my in my opinion uh but I would just want to and I think Casey also Echoes this that when we're talking about bitcoiners and their you know the distaste for ordinals and inscriptions I actually did go to one of my you know most you know one of one of the Maxis that hates me basically and I said you know why don't you go to your community and just do a poll and see what do you think like what do you think about the ordinals inscriptions and it wasn't like 90 hated Originals or anything actually 50 of people said if they pay the fee it's fine you know a lot of bitcoiners are Libertarians um you know there's maybe you could argue that the Taproot made it very easy to embed arbitrary data onto Bitcoin sort of like a mistake you have Luke Jr for example saying that people are lying and tricking the code because if you look at how Casey is inscribing data into these blocks is using this tab script which is basically like a uh you have you have op codes and he has one op code that says op false and that that means that when Bitcoin when that transaction is executing uh the Bitcoin node doesn't actually even look at it doesn't even actually execute the opcodes that comes after uh op Falls so you can put tons of chunks in there and um also okay so you said that there are no restrictions or limitations whatsoever in Taproot that is not like necessarily true there are still like a thousand uh stack there there are a thousand uh elements on the stack that that's a limit and then there's also a 52 byte limit of of each element so but you can uh circumvent that because you because of the op false op code you know I'm going into the things that people are not gonna because of the op Falls uh op code Bitcoin doesn't even look at all the other stuff that's going on inside of that tap script so none of the other uh limits are actually triggered so in my opinion it is kind of a exploit in some way in my opinion sure yeah so uh uh very very like yeah almost almost totally correct like it's actually a 520 byte limit um and it to each push and it applies even to unexecuted pushes so that's why the body of a inscription like the inscription content is chunked into 520 chunk pieces and then concatenated um and you and the 20 the 10 000 stack limit that that's also like just um for the depth of the stack at any one time like after an OP code um so yeah yeah it is a it is a hack uh that it it yeah and then there is the standardness limit which is why you know the main block that that massive uh single inscription block which I was very surprised to see so soon I was like maybe that'll happen eventually but not now uh you're talking about the four megabyte block that that happened that had to be in the in collaboration with with the miner right because you can't broadcast those transactions on bitcoin directly that's right yeah exactly right yeah yeah one interesting thing is actually the um it looks like the opposed up if construction was actually anticipated by some of the authors of segwit um because uh what was it they didn't want you using op push op drop I think which would be another way of um pushing data and then um you know uh removing it from the script so that it doesn't do anything um so so one one Dev actually commented that when they were thinking about it that like op false up if would have been that would be the preferred way to stick data in now that's not an endorsement and yeah whether it's uh I I don't it's I I would well I think it's a hack in the sense of like a weird technical thing that is a little inelegant not really in the sense of hacking it at an exploit I don't know that's up to it's up to the Bitcoin Community decided Luke JR says it says that you lie then you tricked the code so that's right yeah that's okay I'll just go to a priest and say some Hail Marys or something and then yeah okay peer peer charge said that every time you make an inscription you have to apologize to your node so there are those kinds of people but to get back to the point uh is that 50 of even you know the people that follow yeah you know hardcore Maxis are libertarian and think that you know if these are the consensus rules that we all agree to then let people use that talk space so I don't actually think that there is a majority um consensus for soft forking away the uh this tap scripts functionality or tap script exploit or however you want to call it the thing that made nfts big nfts possible on on bitcoin I don't think that there's consensus for that I actually think that the the most of the bitcoiners in this case are actually they have a fairly reasonable take the only problem is that the sort of the high priest that we all have come to the trust and respect in Bitcoin they've been very loud and saying like we should we should work with the miners and come up with ways to censor this so they're giving they're giving all bitcoiners a very bad look but the Bitcoin is underneath that they don't they're starting to see now actually that some of these uh people that we've respected for a long time in Bitcoin can have pretty you know and not completely thought out ideas and yeah I need to I need to back that statement up a little bit by also explaining why I don't think that nfts on bitcoin are such a bloody problem in order to make people understand why I say that but that's going to take me like five minutes to explain so I'll I'll pause again and and leave the word to you guys yeah that's that's totally right and it's like um I I run a help run a Bitcoin Meetup in SF that meets once a month tons of bitcoiners show up I go to a bunch of local Bay Area Bitcoin Meetup events and like most bitcoiners think it's super fun I mean when I say most bitcoiners I'm just saying like the slice of bitcoiners that I interact with in real life they think it's fun uh or they don't really care they're like okay whatever you know people are gonna do things with Bitcoin that I like don't really care about um and so yeah it's been just a few you know um I well I don't know a few many people have been upset but it's been you know one sort of weird Maxi contingent the toxic Maxi contingent and a lot of like like you said a lot of very weird takes from people who I feel like should kind of know better like I mean the like the the miners should censor it is like kind of weird because one would think that miners would be incentivized to include such transactions and collect the fees and then miners sort of attempting to set a higher fee rate for certain transactions implies a level of if you just try to do it naively it implies a certain level of uh collusion between miners to agree to enforce this policy and essentially not not undercut each other by by doing this so uh yeah it just goes to show that like the Bitcoin Community is uh uh hopefully diverse hopefully fractured a lot of people have a lot of different different opinions yeah and I'll offer like I'll offer a prediction on top of that which is that if you can make a full block like a four megabyte nft which we've seen the one we saw was 3.94 megabytes that we that we saw yeah I know this takes up a few extra transactions in it I was like guys come on you got to make it the whole block I think in this case you know they were they were probably trying to get there first and also if you look in a block Explorer you can sort of see how this giant ordinal inscription just squeezes these tiny tiny other so maybe they did it to just show the scale just show like this is how big banana for scale kind of thing yeah yeah maybe that's why I did it uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just Defy uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts hey bankless Nation if you're listening to this it's because you're on the free Bank list RSS feed did you know that there is an ad-free version of Bank list that comes with the bankless premium subscription no ads just straight to the content but that's just one of many things that a premium subscription gets you there's also the token report a monthly bullish bearish neutral report on the hottest tokens of the month and the regular updates from the token report go into the token Bible your first stop shop for every token worth investigating in crypto bankless premium also gets you a 30 discount to the permissionless conference which means it basically just pays for itself there's also the airdrop guide to make sure you don't miss A Drop in 2023 but really the best part about bankless premium is hanging out with me Ryan and the rest of the bankless team in the Inner Circle Discord only for premium members want the alpha check out Ben the analyst Degen pit where you can ask him questions about the token report got a question I've got my own q a room for any questions that you might have at bank list we have huge things planned for 2023 including a new website with login with your ethereum address capabilities and we're super excited to ship what we are calling Bank list 2.0 soon TM so if you want extra help exploring the frontier subscribe to bankless premium it's under 50 cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop this is the way you were talking about right Eric where we have this just oh yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah I was gonna make yeah I was gonna make a prediction about this so um yeah if you look at that block if you look at the fee it says that it's zero um Ciro Satoshi like it doesn't didn't pay any fee that transaction so why did a miner include it well if you think about it well the miner had to receive some and this is actually good that the miner must have been paid out of band so they got paid you know from the from the uh yeah they got paid you know in a different Channel just they said probably said you know send some uh Bitcoins to this wallet and we'll mine this huge ass nft for you and they had to go directly to the miner to to make this happen because otherwise the standardness rules the policy rules would have rejected it so the miners are in a unique position where they can include these giant uh giant inscriptions that take that take up entire blocks and that's so special that's such a such an exclusive such an exclusive thing that I think that this Miner could have asked for you know usually before a couple a week ago people would pay in total in transaction fees like one thousand two hundred dollars and what do you think like if you're an ethereum project or an nft project and you want to make one block one giant nft I think that you could charge for short ten thousand dollars for it twenty thousand dollars for it you could charge maybe fifty thousand dollars to to put that in a single block and if that's the case if you put a if you put a huge transaction like this and you create a giant uh if you put also a giant transaction fee on top of it then you actually screw up the game theory of the Bitcoin blockchain because these miners are going to start to reword each other's blocks just to include the transaction which is why it's much better that the people who who do uh offer this payment for for for the inclusion of the nft they go directly to the miner they pay the miner here's the money and then we can't because then like there's no point of reorging out that big nft by another Miner because it has zero satoshi's provides so this is actually a game theoretically safer way to include those large transactions and all the people that are saying now that you know we have a four megabyte block and it pays uh almost nothing in fees they just don't understand their their relationships between the nft artist and the miner and that it has to be out of band to preserve the game theoretical uh properties of Bitcoin and I think this Miner that it looks for they've just invented a new business model there are going to be people that are lining up to get a full block inscriptions uh and they're going to be able to charge ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand uh a thousand dollars per per uh full block nfts and they're actually going to start to out compete other miners because they're making it they're making so much more money while the other miners are making like two thousand three thousand dollars per per block in transaction fees Luxor could make twenty Thirty forty thousand per block so they could uh they've just like the whole game the entire game of Bitcoin mining has just changed forever with this so congratulations okay see you just change the game for Bitcoin wasn't expecting it to happen yeah I think if I think if certain miners were if this became common enough that certain miners were making more money we'd have to think about like what is the game theory of that reorgan and possibly consider lifting the 400 000 weight unit standardness limit so that these could just be in the mempool uh just because like it would mean that um well like if some pool has one percent of the hash rate maybe you won't bother trying to get them to accept your you won't even go to them when you want to mine your formag block um and so that would mean that the more the pools with more hash rate would maybe get a disproportionate amount of the revenue and we probably don't want that so it might turn into a question of whether that 400 000 weight unit standards rule is lifted so that these can just be in the in the normal mempool and it's an interesting question about that um reorg attack because it is true that very very large transactions not only that they also create an All or Nothing kind of situation where you can include that transaction or you can include all the other transactions that are waiting you have to select from both of them so it reduces the cost a little bit of like kind of incentivizing miners to mine junk you know um but yeah many many interesting questions I can't believe that things are heating up like this the the really interesting thing I think about this is of course the the fee market and bitcoin's sustainability model uh Eric you're talking about how like this fixes the fee Market problem a lot of some some Bitcoin Maxis the archetype of Bitcoin Maxis that I have in my head actually deny the problem of the fee Market in the first place uh and so uh it does this will this argument even work on them if if they can't even admit that the Bitcoin might not actually have a sustainable long-term security structure like how have you had any of these conversations I mean I'll I'll try to say this in the nicest ways possible but if you don't think that you need a fee Market in order to incentivize the security of Bitcoin I'm not sure if you're like qualified to participate in the conversation I don't know how to say that I don't know how to say it in a nice nicer way uh that's like it's not even it's not it's not a well-reasoned argument that I even feel like it has to be an address I don't know how you feel Casey is there any way that you can steel man that argument that we don't need fees in Bitcoin it'll be safe I just don't understand how you're even supposed to to understand some truths weird argument yeah I think I can probably steal man like um maybe like the most reasonable version of that is like well like there are a lot of low fee proof of work chains that like don't have much views and like those don't seem to really get but they have issuance this is we're talking about post issuance so there's nothing yeah yeah but but that issuance is very um I mean no fees the issuance is worth very little if it's you know some altcoin but like but that is I I don't really think that I can steal me on this argument because like listen like as the subsidy is declining um it's getting cut in half every four years it's gonna go to nothing faster than people think people say like oh you know it's 120 years before we have to work worry about the the subsidy declining listen in 120 years for the last four years the subsidy is going to be one sat per byte like one sat for Block like this is not going to provide any security budget although uh ordinals give SATs names a through z and the last the names get shorter as they go on so the last 26 SATs to be mined will be Z through a so maybe that will help compensate but assuming that people don't go crazy for like rare and exotic SATs yeah we we need a fee Market there's there's just no way that Bitcoin long term can um survive without a fee market and you know like anybody who's very religious kind of about anything not to pick on religious but if you're like a fundamentalist about something and you just think like Bitcoin is perfect and it it does not have any problems and sort of you just deny any talk of problems I mean it's just not a constructive Viewpoint that you can really engage with uh successfully so uh this all happened in this last month which is crazy uh this is the one of the first like if you call this a Bitcoin app Bitcoin apps that I've seen adopted so quickly so so just fervously and and then it's we've already seen like the fees actually start to show up on on bitcoin uh the additional uh block space demand uh and so this is why this captured mine and Ryan's attention it's like oh like block space demand that's that's like block space demand is a paradigm that Ryan and I live by and now I'm seeing this like have this use case on bitcoin that's creating black space demand but it's only been a month you know it's only been a month maybe this is just a flash in the pan maybe this is just like hey this is a fun meme let's put dick butts on bitcoin we can laugh about that that's a good joke Eric how how like sustainable do you think this is like do you think like yo we've perhaps fixed the Bitcoin fee structure or is this like ah this is a more of a philosophical conversation at this point we'll see how this plays out like kind of where are you on the spectrum of like how serious this is no I mean it's a hundred percent early days we don't know how this is going to play out uh I think that the we've just added a new sort of natural source of demand for bitcoin's Block space and I think that that's good but I am the one thing that still irks me a little bit is that I do think that Andrew Polster had this blog this this mail on the Bitcoin mailing list where he warned about uh volatility like transaction fee volatility you know we already have we already we've already seen that uh scarcity pricing is a real thing and even without nfts fees can go up and down extremely fast so I think you know what it might actually actually accelerate is that bitcoiners are thinking about actually can we burn some of the transaction fees when the when the fees are really high and then just have uh like a constant low inflation instead of we're sort of pushing ourselves through Reinventing EIP 1559 uh that might be the outcome and that would be uh I think a better outcome than having no solution at all to the to the uh security budget problem so more fees are definitely good if we can harmonize them over time and we know from ethereum that we can uh I think that if we just figure out how to harmonize those fees that we are amassing through nfts then it's going to be a not good so if we keep on leaning into this uh worst worst uh maximum case scenario is every single block is four megabytes Eric you talked about how this actually doesn't present a bloke problem can you walk us through that yeah so uh this is actually kind of kind of funny um I'll try to explain it in the it's a pretty complicated topic to understand but I'll try to I'll try to be uh uh pedagogical or or like I'll try to explain it in a simple way so the first time that you hear about nfts on bitcoin you're sort of like haha nfts on bitcoin that's that's dumb or that's funny and then the next question is the the next the next thought you have is probably uh uh nfts shouldn't be on bitcoin Bitcoin is for transactions right and then the the third question that you have this the third thought that you have is actually you know it's not true that you you can't really bloat the the Bitcoin chain in any way because there are block size limits every block has a limit that we have agreed on that no matter how this block is filled we are okay with this limit like that's what the block size limit is for we set a block size limit so that over time the Bitcoin node wouldn't become all unwieldedly to sync so it's not a it's not a matter of you know weighing the Bitcoin blockchain down with all these nfts it's just a matter of what type of content are going to be inside of those blocks so it's a matter of time what type of content is inside of Bitcoin not how much we're weighing it down okay so now you've become a little bit smarter you're understanding that we're not breaking the the the the the block size limit of or Bitcoin or anything now you can have another thought which is that actually though when you're leveraging tap script in this way that Casey is sort of have invented you it's this is pretty difficult to understand but in most Bitcoin most Bitcoin blocks are not actually Four megabytes and it's not because there are not enough transactions it's because uh only the witness data is allowed to fill out the block up to four megabytes there's a there's a base Block in Bitcoin that has a one megabyte limit and then there's the witness data has a in in total a four megabyte limit so when you're doing Casey's thing inscriptions then you can really max out these blocks uh uh because you're using the the tab script witness data so it if people are doing inscriptions it might become more common that we see four megabyte blocks so now you're back to the idea that actually we are making the the Bitcoin block heavier to download but okay so stay stay with me try to follow me a little bit more I'm soon done so now the the next realization that you're gonna have is that but what what is the reason that witness data is cheaper on bitcoin there's actually a reason for that and it's because witness data is something that after you validate it you can throw it away you can prune it so it doesn't have to stay on the Note forever now there's a uh there's yet another thing in that context that you also have to think about which is that there's something called assume valid David have you ever heard of assume valid Casey do you know what assuming I know the op code but like I don't know what it does yep okay assume assume valid was a pretty controversial uh configuration setting that was uh Incorporated in Bitcoin core not that many years ago I think it was maybe like 2018 or something like that which what what this what the assume valid uh option does which is now the default in Bitcoin is that when you're syncing when you're syncing a Bitcoin node for the first time assume valid assumes that the signatures up until a certain block height are valid so you download them but you don't actually validate them and then only after a specific block let's say halfway in then you start to validate signatures this is a way that it sounds like checkpointing it sounds like checkpointing but it is different because it doesn't happen it happens every time that well it happens in in in when Bitcoin core releases new clients there's a new checkpoint inside that so it doesn't come like oh every you know every 20th block it automatically uh checkpoints it comes from the release cycle which means that the developers are looking at which block are actually getting uh assumed valid in the config but what we've noticed is the table checkpointing Yeah so it's manual checkpointing by the developers in the release cycle for technical reasons it's not quite checkpointing like I don't think that for example Bitcoin core will neglect another valid chain because it does not have the checkpointed block for example yeah so it's it's more of a soft uh checkpoint and also it still checks that all the balances and stuff like that adds up it just skips the signature validation so assume valid is much safer sort of uh than than a checkpoint however they keep moving this assume valid checkpoint or whatever you want to call it forward so the last time they did was only five months ago so now now we come to the sort of the final conclusion here that if more of the Bitcoin data is getting gobbled up by inscriptions which is witness data which is easy more easy to to prune and you don't validate it in most situations you just download it it's like the blockchain will consist of more blob space than regular space which makes the node actually easier to sync because it has a higher concentration of blob space that you can actually prune so the node that you actually have to store at the end of the day will be smaller in bytes because you can prune the witness data and it might even be faster to sync because you don't have to do any computation on all these inscriptions so when people are saying this is making it more difficult for people in Africa to sync a node actually it could be completely so that it's the opposite that it is actually making the node leaner and at the same time it is increasing the security budget which makes the system more secure boom okay that is the final Galaxy brain tape yeah you're right I love that I know I want to try and summarize this okay so we have a way to create blocks based demand the additional utility plugs right into Bitcoin no hard Fork needed plays we already it's already up and running so we have potentially a way to consume block space that generates block space demand which pays for miners to pay for security in addition to that Eric what you're saying uh is that all of this extra data that's going into a Bitcoin block doesn't need to be validated because they're not transferring Bitcoins they're not transferring satoshi's around we're just adding in data into the chain and so because of this mechanism uh of assume valid you actually don't have to do the computational processing to make sure that all these Bitcoin transfers are valid or not because they're not Bitcoin transfers and so the consumption of Bitcoin block space to do crazy nft stuff is actually not a burden on node requirement rinse and so you're actually because it you don't have to do the computation to validate to validate the nft the more nft data is in the in the block the less computational overhead there is per block and so boom we've solved but perhaps solved Bitcoins blocks based demand problem while also making the chain more manageable by nodes globally across the world is that is that a fair summary Yes except for one tiny tiny little nitpick which is that the four megabyte blocks you actually still have to download it it's less computationally intense to uh to to to to to validate because you don't validate most of it if it's this this four megabyte block that we just saw that's you don't have to there's nothing to validate at all except like the the proof of work header in the header hash but you do have to download more more data but after you download it you can throw it away so you download it does increase how much you have to download when you're doing your first full note sync but I mean the bandwidth goes up bandwidth requirements goes up CPU requirements goes down exactly exactly uh but on the whole on the whole say because you then prune it you can throw it away uh if you combine pruning with uh skipping the computation and then you add a little bit more um uh data that needs to be downloaded but it's still within the bounds of the block size limit I think all in all it does create a linear node yeah like people miss the fact that they're that a full node uses many resources when it's downloading and validating the blockchain they tend to focus on um you know the the size of the data being downloaded and the bandwidth need the you know the amount of data that you need to download and disk space the amount of data that you need to sort of disk but for example significant signature verification is very expensive and a huge amount of the you know capacity constraints of Bitcoin come from needing to keep um signature verification fast during initial block download so you can you know verify everything that you need and for example that this doesn't inscriptions don't contribute to that signature verification budget and then you could imagine and this is you know an upgrade that is not on the table now nobody's proposing it but you could imagine an upgrade that would let full nodes just not download download Witnesses at all at some point in the future the Witnesses are sort of in a they are segregated in the block so they're they're elsewhere in a separate Merkle tree and you could have an upgrade which said okay you know any any witnesses that are older than a year or older than on this many you know Bitcoin core releases we're just not going to download them and I wouldn't want to say whether these are full nodes or not but these represent a reasonable reasonable security compromise and I'd say I'd say we don't have full nodes in Bitcoin anymore ever since we introduced assume valid flag as a default that's a philosophical thing that I can't that I can't that I can't vouch for I mean yeah it's a different it's a different security trade-off and some people run without the assumed valid flag um but yeah this would give us an additional security trade-off and it would mean that you didn't even have to download this old witness data and you know the people who cared about the rare Pepes they would be free to continue downloading and storing And archiving all the all the rare Pepes on there you know in in the witnesses um and it might even be that that bandwidth and disk space no longer becomes a concern for most most nodes but the the thing that I think that you uh need to take away from this is that you saw that uh you know me walking through the realizations and the twists and the turns and then the Galaxy brain at the uh take at the end what's happening currently in the Bitcoin discussion is that this thing has is very new to a lot of people that haven't thought about this issue perhaps for some time and they are therefore at different uh layers they are at different stages uh and they are you saw how much disagreement there are like in one in one realization you're like oh actually this does create more blows and then the next realization is actually it doesn't and so people are going to be in different steps of the ladder and they're going to yell at each other and I don't know if they're ever gonna all of them Reach the Galaxy brain take but uh let's hope that we with this podcast contribute to some of that today absolutely and and I know uh I have been branded to my probably my fault as a Bitcoin hater but as soon as something like this shows up I get really excited because it starts to check some of the boxes that I want to see in crypto economic systems that I hope stand the test of time so I definitely agree with that Eric that I hope that this podcast can can help produce some of these outcomes the last uh topic of conversation I want to start with this particular inscription inscription 466 uh this uh warms my heart because one of my first introductions into video games was playing Doom while sitting on my dad's lap pressing the space bar uh and this is Doom uh in Bitcoin uh I I don't know but how do you shoot I don't remember how do you shoot it so the thing is is that it's in an iframe uh we we sandbox all the iframes for to keep everything on chain so if you scroll down there should be a preview or a Content link both of those should work and that will give you like a full screen uh preview uh no no yeah either of those okay okay we're gonna we're gonna do this again now you have wasd you might have to click a little bit to get in there yeah the the inscriptions content model is is very compatible with the web so we're adding as many content types as we can can do it uh we just uh yeah this is insane I was at the SF Bitcoin devs Meetup like presenting on inscriptions and I was playing uh snake uh like a snake game that somebody uploaded while I was answering questions about how the system works it may have been the coolest moment of my entire life and how many kilobytes this is like 300 kilobytes or something like that or even less like this oh I don't know yeah this could be very small I mean you know there's a lot of a lot of the stuff in here is like generative it's like algorithmic like shaders and lighting and stuff and I I don't see very many textures so I I don't think this one was non-standard which would mean that it's below the 400 yeah I'm sure I'm sure that it's smaller than the 400 kilobyte limit but it's just so cool uh to to remember how like when when uh computers were limited how clever you had to be and how small actually you can make these games yeah it actually fit inside like a single transaction in Bitcoin yeah there's a lot of uh fun stuff for people to explore like uh that obviously we support like pngs jpegs all the normal content types but also HTML and SVG um and you need to uh it's basically just HTML and SVG we sandbox everything so you can't make outgoing web requests when that content is loaded on the server which means that everything you see is guaranteed to be on chain and there's it's just so much fun to play with and and like I'm a big fan of early computer art you know like the demo scene um and those days when you had to really like scrounge for bites I can't wait to see how people you know ex like just exploit the browser standards write crazy html.js and CSS and we haven't done it yet but what we're gonna do is we're actually gonna relax the sandbox that this content runs in so that you can publish resources in one inscription and then reference them in the HTML or csvg of a future inscription so you can actually kind of create this on-chain Content Library that you can remix inscriptions and you can essentially publish entire entire websites now obviously the space will be at a premium but I think it could be a really cool sort of recursive composable ecosystem of of content yeah and so before I got distracted by playing doom on bitcoin uh this kind of leads into the question I was going to ask is you know putting doom on bitcoin first it was putting dick butts on bitcoin great uh the time to dick is is All Time Low Time we were putting uh time to penis excuse me uh and then we put like Luke Junior's uh don't do this uh request on can I just Bitcoin say to the haters that if you really don't like inscriptions and you really think that people shouldn't do it like don't mention it don't tweet to your like 200 000 followers that you should not put monkeys on the blockchain like they're just going to put monkeys on the blockchain like just foreign and then we're at the phase of like yo we can put doom on bitcoin and I just got distracted playing doom on bitcoin uh and but then you Casey just talked about like hey there's like people can do more things and I I think hopefully you know once upon a time ethereum had icos and they were bad and terrible and then they matured into daos and yield farming and so like things in the space like and all development has nothing to do with crypto all development matures and progresses as we experiment and iterate uh and so maybe I can leave this as an open-ended question a question for The Listener to imagine about but we've unlocked something here on bitcoin and we don't know what yet to do with it but people are like knowing crypto people are going to play around and they're gonna try stuff and maybe we bring like unlock some vast Green New Field over in Bitcoin land that unlocks a new use case that uh both fixes blocks the the fee issue on bitcoin and makes easy Bitcoin um you know uh easier blockchain to run and hopefully Bitcoin is starved for fun hmm 100 uh Eric do you have any comments on that yeah no I agree that Bitcoin is finally once again fun again do you guys remember that uh the uh subreddit uh had a logo with the wizard uh like the that said you know join us in Magic internet money yeah so if you look at the the that block that took up four megabytes that was actually uh the wizard actually was a bald wizard because the the whole story is that people were like you know Udi has been Udi vertimer has been trolling about Taproot not having any use case except as the butt of his jokes so people sort of responded by putting Booty's worst uh Luna takes and FDX takes as inscriptions on uh in the ordinal systems and then Udi responded by uh making this four megabyte uh block where he made uh Taproot wizards.com and it tries to reignite the spirit of having fun with Bitcoin again and actually I just like one hour before I jumped on this podcast I got the second uh like wizard uh that that was made so now my profanity inscription number uh my inscription number is one one zero seven and but and booties is I think six five two and if you wanna if you wanna filter inscriptions from your Bitcoin core node you can check out inscription 666 which is a Pack patch that Luke uh Dash Jr uh wrote to filter your inscription so very handy to be able to reference these things how do I how do I search by a ordinal number uh it's inscription number currently we don't actually surface a URL to do that because they're they're unstable um we we can stabilize them you can actually type uh ordinals.com inscriptions slash the inscription number and that will give you the inscriptions list starting with that inscription so it'll be the first one ah okay so Eric here is your inscription number I'm gonna put it on screen here uh I think it's hopefully it's this one and there's a nascent Market forming for these things like the level of degeneracy is extremely high uh like it's it's insane people are selling like just yeah so I'm I don't know how this is gonna turn out [Music] well uh I think we can we can end it there unless you guys have any other additional things to say here's a Eric's inscription number with oh we got some tungsten cubes we got the rainbow we got the Bitcoin wizard let me do the mandatory podcast guest chilling uh so like yeah like check out the project at ordinals.com that's the block Explorer you can get the wallet at github.com Casey slash ORD great opportunity to learn how to run a full node um because you need to run it um I have a a a a a a much less professional podcast uh called the hell money podcast um oh yeah uh yeah you can no it's yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it's on YouTube hell podcast Stop Money me and my my friend Aaron We Do It um hopefully like we sort of bring the fun to bitcoin a little bit um shout out to Barry of bitcoiners and SF Bitcoin devs uh if you want to come uh hear about me ramble more about inscriptions in person you should come to the SF Bitcoin devs or the Bay Area Bitcoin and meet up and that's it for me I I just want to see what happens I'm really happy to contribute a sort of a a an interesting medium an interesting digital art medium for people to explore and find the find the boundaries of and uh bankless listeners can get all of those resources I'm sharing them on screen along with Casey's Twitter profile here at rotomore.or-d-a-r-m-o-r that's Casey's Twitter handle and he looks like he's got all of his links over uh on his Twitter bio as well and of course uh all right thank you Eric once again for tapping in to be my bitcoiner technical
