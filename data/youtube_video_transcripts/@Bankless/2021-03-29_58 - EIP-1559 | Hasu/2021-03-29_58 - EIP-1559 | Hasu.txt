welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an episode this is a perfect follow-up to our last episode with justin drake who did we have on and what is this one about we had on hazu who is a pseudo-anonymous cryptoeconomic researcher who is renowned for being a very clear sober thinker in this space which is which is hard to come by and he has particularly found resonance with eip1559 as a mechanism which he thinks is generally positive in most if not all respects and so he has really led the charge and and josue has previously been kind of labeled a very strong bitcoiner if not bitcoin maximalist and then eip1559 came around and he has really res found resonance with eip1559 and has really been a champion in the ethereum community championing eip1559 for all of its merits to make sure that it gets included into the ethereum protocol uh and so we brought on hanzo to help us walk through and understand eip1559 from the person that in my opinion understands it the most except for maybe after people like tim baiko and some of the the deepest researchers in this space what hazu is uniquely positioned to talk about is not only the specific technical details of eip1559 but how eip1559 extends into the social realm and the cultural realm which is where this conversation leads to towards the end of this podcast which i thought was the best part of the podcast yeah this is the reason this is a great follow-up episode is because you've heard from us why ethan's money previously we've talked about the triple point asset thesis we've talked about ethan's economic bandwidth we've talked about actually using eth as you know collateral for this reserve asset for this decentralized finance system last episode you heard justin drake who is actually designing the engine of the future basically economic engine of eth2 talk about ethos sound money now you are hearing people like crypto economic researchers who are kind of neutral i feel like hassu is the type of researcher who just goes wherever the data takes him now he is coming to the realization and he is here saying in this episode that ether is a sound money experiment um like things are starting to fall into place david for this narrative to pick up steam and for this reality to pick up steam in the broader market now with people like hassu saying the same thing and i i really think that's what what what we we talked about in the first part of the episode we sort of described eip 1559 and we got into some technical specifics of uh you know why blockchain is is uh why block space is scarce and how this is an improvement on the economic mechanism the economic engine of allocating uh scarce block space but then the second half of the episode is really where we camped on this this idea of ether as a sound asset and i think that's what hassu sees in eip1559 he sees it as a second economic experiment ether's soundness we've called it ether's scarcity mechanism but it's almost like ether's sound money mechanism as well hazu is a true pioneer of crypto economic knowledge and uh whenever hazu is paying attention close attention to something i also pay close attention to that thing so let's just go ahead and get right into the episode with hazu but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are

welcome back hasu who is a renowned crypto economic researcher i really think he's one of the brightest analysts that span multiple crypto communities in including bitcoin and ethereum he also has a fantastic podcast that should be on your rotation called uncommon core and we're talking today about eip1559 that's been of particular interest to hasu he's written extensively about it he is a proponent of eip 1559 maybe not just for ethereum but perhaps other crypto economic systems in the future bitcoin maybe i don't know we will dig into that hasu welcome to bankless once again it's great to have you thanks guys for having me i love your show frequent listener that's awesome well look the uh the the fandom is is mutual because um uncommon core has some fantastic episodes and and you guys really uh extensively dig into some issues on your podcast so um you know thank thanks for contributing to this conversation it's just a fantastic podcast you guys have over there yeah thanks i mean i guess the you guys really were the first to do a d5 focus podcast right i mean there was really nothing before you that ducked deep into the dynamics of d5 and so on so i feel that you inspired us quite a bit so well that is awesome um all right well so let's dig into the subject today because and you know why don't we start with this question what about eip 1559 gets you so excited um well that's uh that's not difficult to answer so i've always been focused on the security of block giants and economics that was um what i spent most of my time researching in the past i wrote a paper in 2019 um on basically the security model of bitcoin and whether it's what actually contributes to the security and whether that security can be maintained after the block subsidy is gone and uh spent several months working on that so it has always this topic is always been the most interesting to me in the entire space and ep15559 really combines this kind of research into the security of blockchain and economics with all the transaction fee dynamics and the different mechanisms that exist to to basically for users to buy transactions on a public blockchain and when i saw those when i saw erp-1559 it was something that i could immediately analyze um although it is quite a bit different right from how ethereum works today and from how bitcoin works today so it took some time to really understand all the dynamics but when i did understand them i i would say i was i was really became a really strong supporter of it because of the different uh benefits that i think we'll get into in this call yeah we're going to spend this entire episode camping on eip1559 and of course this is of a particular relevance we've been talking about it a lot on on bank list for many reasons it touches security it touches issuance and maybe most importantly it is it is now timely it looks like it has been scheduled for a future ethereum hard fork that may happen as soon as this summer so guys this is a really important topic to fully understand but before we get there uh haase i want to ask you that this question you brought up uh that you you've always been fascinated with the economic security aspect of crypto and of blockchains why is economic security so important well there are really two reasons i'd say one is personal um i thought this is the i'm the biggest unsolved problem in bitcoin it's the only one that i think could really could really become a problem for bitcoin in the future so um i really believe in kind of the values of bitcoin and the mission so i thought this like if i dedicate my time to something then it should be this uh i thought that's how i can make the most positive change hopefully in the crypto space um but the second is i think the economic incentives is what really sets uh crypto bitcoin ethereum and so on what sets them apart from the traditional systems right i mean none of the cryptography that's used in in a cryptocurrency is really new what is new is how we can incentivize a permissionless set of validators to come to consensus via these economic incentives that that's that's the the main thing that didn't exist before so hazu i i believe you may agree with me when i say that yeah the legacy that eip1559 could leave on the world of crypto economics is an elegant mechanism that fixes many things and increasingly fixes long-term sustainability with economic security for crypto economic systems and we want to guide is that is that was that um perhaps something you don't agree with no no no i was yeah nodding along just to make sure yeah um and so i want to i want to make sure that the listeners can get up to that point in understanding of eip1559 but to get there we need to walk through eip1559 and how it's designed and what it is so and i recently wrote a piece in the bankless newsletter that described eip1559 as the blind men feeling the elephant metaphor depending on the way that you look at eip1559 it does different things it one is a deflationary mechanism based off of the overspend overspending of transaction fees based off what is needed for security one is a mev mitigator one is simply a ux improvement with how to use um how to use a blockchain and so let's start at the very beginning how when you first start to like define or describe eip1559 where do you start this is like this goes back to what you said because how i how i described eip1559 has changed several times um but this is pretty much true for for everything in this space right the more we learn the better we get at explaining things and the simpler the terms that we can put them in and um today i would say that um well erp 1559 is a is a mechanism for our transactions are sold on ethereum and um it differs from the status quo in in two major ways so something that most people don't know or that don't think about right now is that today in ethereum we there's the protocol itself fixes the quantity of gas that can be used per block that's gas in ethereum is kind of like block space in bitcoin and it lets the price of the gas that is consumed float which means it can be found in the marketplace in a type of auction and if erp-15f9 is implemented then ethereum will picks will fix the price of gas and it will let the quantity per block float so it's really it's really a change from how the protocol regulates the consumption of scarce resources and that's the one major benefit and the second is or actually we should maybe get into so why do we need to why do we need to kind of regulate the consumption of resources at all right i mean aren't we all about free markets um like shouldn't the price of everything be found in the market and um that's that's actually a discussion that was very prominent back in 2015 to 17 in bitcoin um because like a lot of proponents of bigger blocks for example they described the heart the hard-coded block size limit in bitcoin as a sort of production quota and bitcoin developers messing with the free market of mining um but i mean this is totally misguided in my view because that's one thing that markets can't do and that's sort of kind of price at the pricing of negative externalities and um in a block in every blockchain like every transaction that someone makes that it has a private benefit to that person like i i have a benefit when i can send like a transaction of ether to you but that that transaction has a social cost on every every other participant in the network who has to validate that that transaction who has to download it who then has to relay it who has to store it forever um and and that cost really that's not compensated in blockchain so if we let if we let kind of the social costs explode then what really happens is that you end up with a completely centralized blockchain where no one can participate like a lot of people can participate as transactors but no one can can can participate as a validator and by validator i don't mean a miner but validator is someone who just who is a node in the network right i mean if you're not really a node in network then you're kind of second class user if you because you don't validate um that like what happens so um right so this kind of summarizes why why we need to we really need to put the limits on kind of the resource consumption that we have in uh in a block in a blockchain we need to both make it relatively cheap to transact but also relatively cheap to validate like what's going on and follow the consensus and if we go far in one direction then the blockchain itself really stops being useful right um at least for the reasons that we kind of want um and um yeah so hasu this is what you're saying here is that the purpose of eip 1559 is to really regulate the consumption of resources on the chain and the resource of the chain a chain like bitcoin or ethereum is really block space we might also say that's a network resource there's also other resources on ethereum and bitcoin namely the asset bitcoin or or eth um and it's interesting to me because i remember back in in 2017 around the time of of cryptokitties there was this move to to say you know chains like eos we're talking about um you know transactions should be free there should be no such thing as gas uh transaction space shouldn't have to be paid for and i think that these are some of the negative externalities that you were you were mentioning because if this block space is free essentially we have a tragedy of the commons we have a public goods problem on our hands what happens is what we've actually seen bear out in some of these chains which is they become centralized they have all of this state bloat they can't be run in a decentralized manner that's kind of what you're talking about that's what negative externalities lead to unless they're throttled unless they're governed by some sort of scarcity engine is that what you're saying yeah that's that's pretty much exactly right i mean eos is a good example and and like whenever someone says they can offer transactions cheaper than someone else i mean that's almost never really the case right i mean the transactions in bitcoin and ethereum are more expensive than transactions on eos because those protocols they they privatize some of the social costs um that transactions have on other participants in the network whereas uh yeah well eos doesn't so doesn't privatize this cost it's just like all of the real costs of transactions are socialized on the other participants and that's why it's impossible to run a note on eos right that's the kind of trade-off that we go for and i would address one other thing that you said so i would say eip159 it's not about regulating resource consumption not not only any more than today right it's we we regulate resource construct consumption in a very similar way right instead of regulating the amount of gas that can be consumed per block we regulate the price that people have to pay but for example if you assume if you look today i don't know what the gas fee is right now okay it's about 180 180 great per unit of gas right and when the blocks are full at this price this means that at a price of 180 grain per gas there's about 12.5 million gas of demand right and if you keep this number in your head it doesn't matter if we cut if we fix the block size 12.5 million gas or if we fix the price at 100 grey that it will be the same right i mean if we does that make sense if we fix the price at 180 then there would still be 12.5 million gas consumed because if there wasn't then current price would be higher and so the goal of this is that we have regulated what we need to regulate which is the externalities of putting data into the blockchain which makes the blockchain a bigger and bigger in terms of size but what we're saying is is that we can either regulate block space which is a way to regulate how large that blockchain grows or we can regulate price which regulates people's desire to put data into the blockchain and the net result is the same but why is eip150 better if we're at the end of the day we're still regulating how fast the state of a blockchain is how fast that data growth size is why is eip1559 an improvement off if it's going to end up regulating the same thing yeah i mean all the benefits basically are downstream of the original change they are kind of they they are kind of derivatives of it being better to in a blockchain regulate um basically the price instead of the quantity and um already in your intro you touched on one major benefit um for example so erp-1559 does in theory have a block size cap but that block size cap that's twice the target of 12.5 million gas so blocks can in theory be up to 25 million gas but that limit only exists for for basically denial of service protection of nodes so if we if we could if it turns out that maybe nodes are resistant to like 50 million gas to like 100 blocks in a row that are 50 million gas and we could get rid of this limit and it would not materially materially affect the mechanism right so um really the how how how much block space or how much gas is consumed is regulated via the base fee mechanism and um that's the that's the price that the protocol quotes you for transacting um but what this what this really gives you is that we have no more um no more fixed block size is that there's always more block space available than is than this current the protocol projects in terms of what the current demand is so this has re this is really one benefit and it's that the protocol codes your price and you know if you pay that price then you're getting into the next block and that is what most people would describe as this major ux benefit of erp-1559 and you couldn't guarantee this in any other system that doesn't have an unlimited block space right um because then what if too many people are willing to pay that transaction fee then you would get you would basically have the same system that we have today where it's kind of an auction and you have to speculate what everyone else is going to to want to bid um but this doesn't this almost never happens in erp 1559 because there's always about 100 extra space and that hundred percent exercise space could be in theory also expanded it could be way bigger than it is today and still the resources the average resource consumption in the blockchain would be the same so yeah let's go into the details behind where we are with ethereum block management today and how eip1559 changes that and so where we are today is that miners have a target block size and interestingly they can vote that up and down but that's actually irrelevant to eip1559 the ethereum blockchain has a target block size um that it holds at a constant and transactions can go up to that limit and no more and that's where we are today eip1559 it takes that target that block size and then it doubles it as a as a capacity but and so up to double of the target of the average gas size can be fit into a single block and when people are in transacting in their meta mask or however they they see this this uh gas size transaction and for a simple ether transfer it's 21 000 gas for an erc 20 token transfer it's like 35 000 gas and the block size limit that eip1559 targets is 25 million and that's the size of a block that's how much data you can fit into a single block but it targets being 50 percent full and at 12.5 million gas per block but it is allowed to fluctuate up and down because there's volatility in how many people want to get their transactions included into one single block and so what uh what we were talking about is the cons the regulation of ethereum block space is targeted by 12 is targeted to 12.5 million gas in eip1559 but that extra capacity allows for volatility and transaction inclusion and what the elegant part about eip1559 does is that it allows short-term volatility in gas in in block saturation of data but when that's that trend of how full blocks are trends upwards or downwards what the eip uh does is it tar it readjusts the price to always compensate to always be targeting 12.5 million gas did i explain that okay yeah that's uh that was exactly correct yeah okay so and so where why is this slack so nice let's just dive into the ux improvement what what does this slack in this system this extra capacity of blocks that are always generally only 50 full how does that improve things well i would still say that the main benefit of having this extra room is that there's like anyone who's willing to pay the the fee that the protocol quotes them can always know with very high certainty that they will get included in the next block what the consequence of this is as you said that when blocks above 12.5 million gas are mined then the base fee will regulate upwards in the next block right so the way that it does that is for every new the block that's being mined it looks it looks at the size looks at the distance of the size of the last block to the target so if it was 25 million guests and that's kind of the maximum distance that it can go and then it's adjusted upwards by the highest possible amount per block which is 12.5 percent for for any smaller distance would be adjusted less than that so it really what the protocol does is really tries to guess what the current how how much people would be willing to pay for 12.5 million gas and this is actually a really similar mechanism to bitcoin's difficulty adjustment could you draw that comparison for us hazu um yeah i mean both are kind of yeah i mean i agree they are similar for sure it's uh they both use control theory if you were um to achieve to to basically target uh yeah a specific thing in the in the protocol but i wouldn't say that they are otherwise related yeah yeah one bitcoin the bitcoin uh proof of work adjustment like how hard it is to find a block like regulates itself up and down to target 10 minutes um and the benefit of eip1559 is that it formally introduces a number in the protocol and so the protocol rather than like wallets and you know users people guessing how much gas that they need to pay the protocol just formally creates a number like you said using control theory and that instantiation of that number is an advantageous piece of data to have because that's where we talk about this this ux improvement of make ensuring that your transaction will get included if it if you pay this particular number which is informed to you by the ethereum protocol under eip1559 yeah and this is i mean what you said is that we have a number in the protocol that's that's i mean many depth developers would probably tell you that this is a pretty nice feature of it because it's it's it's basically an oracle for what the you know what gas price of protocol needs to pay for example to liquidate users collateral or it's also relevant in the context of systems like roll-ups that have fraud proofs and challenge periods because the protocol can for example really say if the protocol is congested then maybe the the challenge period should be extended until the protocol is no longer congested so it basically takes the time out right um so yeah that's one benefit so we're going to talk about this from a system benefit perspective but i i also want to just just camp here for a minute and make sure that the the average defy or ethereum user uh knows what's going on here and what kind of the before and after is so right now the current state if i am trying to get a transaction through the ethereum network i have say my metamask wallet and i want to send uh david some eath so fairly simple low gas uh transaction i want to send you some eth well the price of of that transaction in gway is going to fluctuate based on demand so there have been times i remember the distant past where you could do that for like five way like nothing right um you know now it's closer to 80 to 100 it's gone as as high as 900 uh like for for transactions of of this size but what's actually happening is as a user trying to get eth to another user if i'm trying to pay david in some in some eth i have to kind of guess what the um what the fee might be and so the way i might guess is metamask proposes a slow transaction fee like yeah price it it proposes an average one and like a fast one right and so if i'm in a hurry i might i might click the fast one and pay the most in gas to try to send um try to send my ether to david what's happening today hassu if i'm correct is it's some kind of a an auction mechanism essentially um but everybody who is trying to get a transaction through is guessing essentially they they don't know totally what miners will accept or what they won't expect or what other people will bid exactly or what other people will will bid and this this creates a lot of inefficiency is it am i understanding this correctly so far yeah that's that's right yeah i mean um from a standpoint of mechanism design we would say that first that's called a first price auction what you described and um and it's it's really it doesn't really maximize user welfare because it doesn't really capture very well kind of what they are willing to pay and kind of charging all of them the the least that's that's kind of how we would design the optimal transact like the optimal uh bidding mechanism right there's another form of auction which is called a second price option and there you have a lot of bidding but then everyone kind of pays i mean either there are some variations of that but i thought everyone pays kind of the price that the person bit that's behind them or everyone really pays just the the lowest price that anyone that is still included in the protocol um and this this is um this kind of form of auction is really the most efficient that you can have but um it's not possible in blockchains it's not going to be possible in blockchains and that's because it really depends like it's not um it sort of requires trust in the auctioneer so the person running kind of the marketplace and deciding which which bits are included and that's something that you can't do in a blockchain because miners can like if miners are not happy with the guest with the with the lowest fee transaction in the block then they can just include their own transactions and thereby move third of the gas price in the block to whatever limit they want so that's really not possible so we were looking for something that that captures a lot of those benefits uh but without being exploitable in this way and that's also where in erp 1559 the burning of the base fee comes into play we'll get back to that um definitely um so so so that's kind of the before i've got an inefficient transaction it's it's probably costing me more i i have bad ux in terms of you know the protocol doesn't tell me what to pay i have to kind of guess so i have no idea when david's going to get it if i paid enough if i paid too much it's inefficient from that perspective after eip 1559 with my transaction data i'm not just sending the price that i want to pay in in go in gway essentially i'm sending a few things i'm sending this thing called the base fee and what you're saying is in eip1559 the ethereum protocol determines what the base fee is essentially so it outputs that almost like a price oracle i don't have to guess i know what the base fee is so i can set that as my transaction cost with some certainty but then there's also this element on top of the base fee that i add which is a tip element as well so i have the base feed that a wallet might might generate based on the like the ethereum protocol provides me that base fee and then as a user do i set the the tip amount i want to pay and does that determine the priority of my transactions i'm just trying to wrap my head around what this looks like from a user's perspective yeah so you're right there are two fees in eft-1559 there's the base fee which is being burned so the miner has to burn a specific amount of ether miner can can like include any transaction they want but for every gas that they basically use they have to burn a specific amount of eth and that is set by the base fee right so the user doesn't necessarily have to pay the e but the miner has to so that's important and the second is a tip and the tip is sort of like that's a bribe to the miners to include your transaction because if you if you imagine that didn't exist then what really what benefit does the miner really have to include your transaction when the fee no longer goes to them so including it like you could argue of course well the miner is better off if like the ethereum users are happy and get their transactions mind because that's good for the price of if and that determines the value of the block subsidy i think that's a good argument but every transaction they include has a cost for the miner because if they mine larger blocks then they take longer to to basically to process and to propagate to other miners in the network and so you really need to you need to compensate the miners for for these delays um because the delays kind of cause what's known as uncle risk and that's basically the risk of another miner finding finding a block before you and then you don't get the block reward maybe you become an uncle or like you become an entirely stale block so that but that's really like that's really a pretty small cost so we kind of expect that sort of the minimum like one to two gray per gas uh will be enough for for miners to compensate them you can calculate what that the anchor risk is what is really the cost that the miners take so this is not something that we have to guess we can like all the wallets can just agree okay per gas we pay a two grey tip and that's pretty much set in stone so that tip is to me that's the same exact system as the system that we have today the tip is a first price auction uh that is layered on top of the base fee like it's layered on top of like the the the protocol changes for how ethereum manages gas uh and to me to me is that the priority is for first burn base fee then pay tip uh and it's really this prioritization of first first the base fee then the the uh price auction that allows this new kind of equilibrium to arise but the tip is just this the same recreation of the first price auction that we know today it's just deprioritized it's after and after the correct the new a new order of operations where eip1559 comes first and so the tip is again just the incentive to pay the miners to get the transaction included into the block but the the tip also i i think pla facilitates a different role under a high congestion environment can you talk about that yeah that's right so in the first basically in the current system there's always more demand to transact than their supply available and that's why people bid up the gas price right because kind of congestion has a cost to them like other people being processed before you had a cost to you and that's why you increased your transaction fee um and that's why we see the transaction fees being as high as they are because there's there's more demand to transact at the current price than their supply and this would under most circumstances not be the case in eip159 and that's because of what we already established that which is that there's always extra room in the block right so whenever there's at the current price there's there's more supply than demand then the the tip will be zero in this kind of auction or like the kind of very low value that we talked about but it is also it is possible as it said that there's a kind of market event right like and a lot of things could trigger this right it could be like a five percent ten percent price drop of bitcoin of ethereum on on the major exchanges and then suddenly empirically we know that kind of the transaction demand um spikes on ethereum and we don't immediately very quickly right and why is this i mean it's because people get liquidated suddenly a lot of arbitrage trades become profitable people want to exit their positions rush into something else russian to stable coins there's there's a a a lot of sort of stuff going on a lot of a lot of it happening automatically which is not really human driven right but what's doing arbitrage liquidations and so on um but we don't see we don't see this increase of demand in the block size and that is because the block size is of course kept right now we do see this in the increase of the gas price that people are paying for that gas um and it's like we can't really know today if the if the gas price but like if the gas price before sort of the price move was at 100 gray and now it's 500 we don't know we cut we don't know how much uh gas the market would consume if the price was fixed to 100 or fixed to 150 or fixed to 200 right it's it's impossible to know because we don't know that the demand curve of the transaction transactors is invisible to us um but in erp-1559 we will see we can see a block being mine that's twice as large right that has 25 million gas we could also see several blocks in a row mine that large that's entirely possible i think that's even quite likely but what will happen is that the best the basic will start rising exponentially and um i had a tweet the other day just to give people a a feeling for what like exponential growth really means and so if you imagine that um at block one the base fee is 100 gray and then we have a series of 25 million guest blocks mined in a row after five blocks the base fee would be 160 already after 10 bucks would be about 300 after 15 blocks which is only about three minutes the the gas price would be 500 way after 20 blocks would be over 900 right so that's the highest that we've ever seen and then it just keeps rising exponentially from there so basically the protocol can react very fast um very it can very quickly quote a price that will then lead to again 50 uh utilization of the block it doesn't take long at all it takes it takes definitely less than five minutes um unless really we see transactional demand that we've never seen before that would lead to a demand in the thousands of way in the current system and yeah that's not very likely and then where does the tip fit into this in this uh time of extremely high un uh unexpected demand oh yeah okay so when at the current at the current price the demand exceeds 25 million gas that's when people would that's when basically the system would fall back to the the current state that we have today as a the state of the first price option but it would already be like with far fewer participants right because we already filter a lot of participants via the base fee so um i don't like this is basically what we have today but the example that i gave about the exponential growth that really starts to show that such states of the first price auction don't last very long right so because uh because in this very short time this acute time of volatility and extremely high demand for making a transaction in the block space base fee is maxed out we're maxing out all the slack we're consuming all of that extra space or all of that extra all that yeah all that extra space in the variable block size and therefore base fee ticks up and it takes up exponentially but until we meet that threshold we have we have uh gone back to the current first price mechanism that we find ethereum in today and so during that times that economic actors are consuming all of the possible block space that ethereum is giving it which is again capped at 25 million gas we are using that tip to now prioritize transactions and this should just be like you are saying momentary because the uh the gas fee the base fee can increase exponentially and anything that can increase a increase exponentially is destined to stop increasing exponentially at some point in time when we finally discover the right price according to the market yeah and how before we unless you want to say something go ahead i just have a question hazu about so what is the net effect of this because is the net effect to like actually smooth out the these periods of high demand so i remember it was just um a year ago actually david i were recording a podcast at the time um the day later became known as black thursday and i remember at the start of that podcast gas prices were something like 80 clay and then the market dropped right and then at the end of the podcast uh we were talking about price a little bit in the podcast the end of the podcast prices for ethereum transactions were like 900 gray and anybody who has used the ethereum network during this period of panic during this period of of frenzied activity whether it's you know in the in the bull direction or in the in the bare direction the panic direction has felt this where you'll see metamask or the eath gas station quote some price and you're like oh my god like a few minutes ago this price was 100 way less and so what am i going to do i'm going to pay instead of 300 way i'm going to pay 400 way for this transaction because if i don't get it through all of my collateral in my maker loan that i just took out is about to be liquidated and so yeah i'm willing to pay an extra dollars for a transaction that if it doesn't go through could cost me like thousands of dollars right and so this is what happens but this is kind of the inefficiency that you were talking about and what this seems to lead to is like this rapid increase during these frenzied activities in in transaction fee price we we see it drop from you know go from 80 way to 900 way in a relatively short period of time with eip 1559 does this get smoothed out during these periods of frenzied activity um yeah you talked about a very important uh problem with first price auctions which is that it really has many equilibria many of which are pretty bad for the transactors like because if like if if you think that i'm going to bid 500 giveaway and i think you're going to bid 500 great then like we both end up paying 500 even though paying 300 would also get us both included in theory right and and exactly and i might just want to pay 501 you know just to get ahead of you yeah um exactly so yeah the gas price can really be bid be like way higher than it needs to be so i would say yes um transaction fees will be smoothed out um definitely um the other i mean that's the one this is sort of the same as kind of reducing really the overbidding and lowering sort of the mental transaction cost uh of like right now you look at your transaction and you really like okay so how much should i bid right whereas then it's really just a take it or leave it right you can still you can still offer a basically that's lower than is what then what is required today and just say okay this transaction is not urgent so if demand drops like you know that for example every time every time when sort of u.s business hours are over then transactions transaction or gas prices on ethereum drops substantially like during the the night in the u.s so you say okay i'm gonna have this process at night so i know the base will probably be way lower than so you can still do that don't lose that benefit um but other than that it's it's yeah it's probably a lot smoother and um it's hard to say right if it will lower gas prices um because yes on the one hand i would say it will lower them a bit but i mean if the ux is better then that could this could also increase the demand to transact so you really can't know like right when the new equilibrium will be found what i would say though one of the biggest misunderstandings about erp-159 is that it will substantially decrease transaction fees and um that is something that no transaction fee mechanism can do that is fundamentally a problem of scalability right only adding more transaction supply so gas block space can do that i want to dig into that a little bit more because when eric connor first introduced this eip into into the sphere of ethereum he actually cited that you know people are overpaying for gas because of this crappy auction mechanism and you you set a line just now where uh the mental load or the mental bearing of having to like guesstimate the right gas you know cause and humans are emotional characters like maybe we we get into like these we get into our heads and say like well if he's going to pay this much then i'm going to pay this much and then if he well if i pay this much then he's going to pay that much and all of a sudden like our imaginations start to increase the price of gas that we pay which is crazy and so the instantiation of base fee in the protocol really eliminates that that internal game that people play in their heads in their their perceived game and hazu i know that you're a poker player so i know that you know these type of mental games that you play so but why doesn't that decrease transaction fees if it eliminates that mental game of trying to outbid people in our imaginations and just formalizes the protocol into the protocol and says what you need to pay and that reduces overpayment why doesn't that increase gas fees or decrease gas feeds excuse me yeah no i agree with you i mean definitely it's if those are like two distinct scenarios right in the one the protocol quotes you quotes us both a price of 150 grey and we both accept it and then we both get mined at 150 but in the other scenario we we both have to guess what we are going to bid and what the other what everyone else is going to bid and we could end up at 200 or 250 or 300 grand right and like we both everyone ever all transaction transactors involved lose from that the only the only parties who win would be the miners right so um you could say this yeah that this sort of lets the transactors coordinate better on how much they're really willing to pay and thereby prevent them all over paying all losing but this is not something that can reduce gas prices by like 50 or whatever i mean that's only like adding more supply can can afford you there and um yeah i would reiterate what i what i said before which is that i mean if the gas prices get lower then this is this might just lead people to make more transactions right and then maybe the gas price will go up again right so you it's it's always difficult to say oh a change like this will will affect the gas price but i would say like i would say it can't substantially lower it i would yeah that's something that i would sign because i think a lot of people don't don't remember this basic fact that gas price is always going to be a product of both supply but also demand right and so if if what eip1559 is not doing is it's not doing anything to increase supply of block space really it's creating a more efficient coordination mechanism so that we're not overpaying for transactions less of that goes to to miners we're not overpaying but it's not increasing supply and it may very well increase demand because it becomes better easier to do a transaction on the ethereum network that's what you're saying yeah exactly so hazu as we progress through eip1559 again blind men feeling blind men feeling the elephant we're all trying to figure out what this thing actually is we should i think we should talk about why we burn bass feet why do we burn bass feet um yeah there are a couple of reasons um so the original one i would say this the original one because it was basically the first one mentioned in the original proposal which is um that the the mechanism would otherwise not be that what tim roughgarden called oca resistant oca is sitting for off chain agreement um and what does this mean it means if you for example didn't burn the base v and paid it all to the miner of that block then what happens is that the the price that the protocol charges transactors is no longer binding um because if you're trans like if you're a transactor and the base fee is 100 gray but you're really willing only willing to pay 50 then the miner could now like nothing really forces you to pay 100 now right the the miner could just take your 100 right but pay you 50 back from like after he received your payment right so the protocol could dictate that you pay it in protocol but it wouldn't be a cost to the miner the mind i could just give it back to you and that's really the way that that miners and um transactors could work together to really completely circumvent this sort of price setting uh so this yeah i mean this this goes back to like what governments all around the world do right the price controls never work um unless you make it like that the way that you kind of get around this is by just burning the price so it cannot be paid back pretty much and this is the term economic abstraction where uh in a transactor and a miner could strike a backdoor deal or say like hey instead of me paying you like 50 of each i will wash your car and you will include my transaction and the formalization of eth as the only currency that you can pay to make a transaction included into ethereum is formalized by the burning of it because you can't burn anything else other than ether ryan and i were talking while we were preparing for this interview hazu where we actually never thought that economic abstraction was ever a threat to ethereum simply because the ethereum protocol just makes it so easy to use ether as a currency to pay because it's it's not formally baked in but it's kind of baked in enough it just makes it makes ether the easiest asset to use to compensate miners for including your transaction um is is there a threat that we we aren't seeing because i kind of thought that the shelling point aspect of ether the currency that you use to pay for transactions would be strong enough um um i would say it's a threat and an opportunity i think you're i think you're underestimating the threat and missing the opportunity um okay so the threat is definitely that um it's way more well let's actually start with the opportunity because it's it is actually i mean most maybe you don't agree with that most people would say it's actually a big pain to always have um either in your accounts when you transact and if you're privacy conscious and you don't want to reuse accounts either so you want to make a new account but then you have to move some heat there to transact and then but it doesn't consume all your eve then you're left with dust and 100 accounts and like what what what if you really just want to receive usdc like you receive usdc on some account but now you can't you can move it right you first have to move there and so on um i think it's really like this is a pain that more people experience um than you think maybe um i actually think like i experienced this pain too and i think eth bulge experienced this pain where they're they don't actually want to sell their eth which is what that's what's required to uh create a transaction you're selling your eat for a transaction so you know you have to continuously top up your eth and buy more so i even i think bulls will resonate with the point that you're making where they might not necessarily want to spend their eat they want to hold their either they want to stake their either validate with it and they'd happily spend their you know their fiat rather than eat for a transaction yeah that's exactly right i mean um i think it's just a big pain point that prevents ethereum from getting broader adoption having better user experience that every transaction requires e um it would be better if you could use any token to pay and for example like this could go even further right you don't even need a token necessarily to pay a transaction fee in the future i mean you could also just pay with your order flow for example so imagine i i would imagine that in a few years or maybe in a year or less it's possible on on unison not pay a transaction fee if you play on unit swap because you submitted to the miner and the miner will include it because they can front run you or they can send with you right so they you pay you pay with some other form of compensation and that's okay i mean erp 159 sort of on the one hand enables this and then the other protects against the risks that we will talk about in a minute because the miners still need to burn eat but you don't need to give that each the miner the miner can also just have sort of a reserve of eat that they then sort of drain and occasionally they top it up right yeah absolutely so what this does what eip1559 does is actually enshrines ether as the asset that the protocol requires these transaction fees to be paid with yeah at least yeah at least on layer one interesting uh so are there any problems though that come with economic abstraction that we should be aware of yeah i mean i would say economic extraction it's rarely seen as something good but i think i just made the case that it's it's actually essential it's it's it's absolutely required for ethereum to get broad adoption that basically we improved the user experience in that regard but it's also a risk because it creates this sort of tragedy of the commons where yes for every individual user it is better to not have to use eth to pay transaction fees but that sort of chips away at this monetary premium that ethereally that that is a sort of central asset in the in the ethereum protocol and it this is sort of a slippery slope to sort of is becoming demonetized over time losing some of its monetary premium and and really ethereum pays for its security by by minting e right really and um so it sort of relies on that market demand for ethan and if having a high price because the more valuable ethos the the less ease the protocol then has to mint in order to pay for the same dollar amount of security um so i would say if a protocol has to pay for security in a currency that it can't mint then this protocol would always pay more for their security than than a protocol like ethereum or bitcoin that can mint its own currency hey guys i hope you're enjoying the podcast with hazu so far it's always a fun time to talk to hazu in the second half of this podcast we talk about how hazu characterizes the monetary policy of ether after we integrate eip15 and proof of stake and really what that brings holistically and we also talk about the culture of ethereum as well as it relates to some of these protocol changes in the protocol that we all surround ourselves in ethereum right how does that impact the culture really excited to dig into those parts of the conversations but first before we get there we got to take a moment and talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible it is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry

recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave so that actually brings us into the next part of this eip1559 conversation where you know we're going through we're feeling all the different parts of the elephant trying to figure out what's what's what and how's it in a recent article that you wrote that we will have in the show notes um the design goals of eip1559 you started off talking about a better ux which is just the formalization of the number that you need to pay to get your transaction included it's clear it's specific there's no guesswork better ux we also talked about the slack mechanism the variability in block size which increases the probability of you as a user getting your transaction immediately in the next block that's a fast that's a fantastic feature as well also aids in a better ux and then next up is the section that you just uh you just kind of hinted at which we're going to dive into now which is better security but interestingly hazel when i noticed that you uh when i was reading through your article i noticed that in the better security mechanism you only discussed the issuance of ether the asset how do you square these two things why is security and ether issuance the same thing um so i think it's fundamentally like for i think fundamentally it's better for a blockchain to pay for its um security with permanent issuance because that affords you one thing namely that basically you will always have a certain amount of minor incentive right so even in bit if you compare that to bitcoin for example because it's the it's probably the most known um in bitcoin after the block subsidy has ended then the miners will only paid with transaction fees so in that system the security of the system is entirely linked to the congestion of of the network right right the transaction demand relative to supply and that has a few big problems right so you can get into a sort of death spiral there if if if the transaction demand is low then as a result of security will be low what does that do it will only further lower the demand to transact i think that's really problematic so hassio on a on a recent episode we just had with with justin drake he kind of compared the different uh ways to fund economic security as kind of different fuel types of fuel so he talked about grade a fuel versus great b fuel and he said grade a fuel is issuance it's a better quality of of fuel because it's it's predictable because the protocol can manage it and transaction fees are more like grade b fuel it can still uh fuel economic security essentially but it has some major problems it's it's not reliable necessarily it's not protocol managed um it's sometimes it's too much sometimes it's too little exactly very volatile so it's also very like very combustible i think that's what you're you're talking about here uh when we talk about sort of issuance of issuance being a very good fuel for economic security but in order for issuance to be a very good fuel it also has to have some sort of a a monetary premium right like that makes it the best type of grade a fuel if you're not just issuing some capital asset you're actually issuing a thing that the rest of the world views as money and arguably that's what bitcoin has today right and arguably also that's what ether is starting to have this this monetary premium uh can you talk about this some more is this is this sort of why uh economic security is important and why like enshrining ether as part of the the only payment mechanism by which you can pay for transactions is is this why all of this is stuff is important yeah i i definitely think so um this goes back to what we what we already talked about right which is that um if if ether is worth a lot in usd terms then the protocol has to pay less in order to generate a high amount of like us denominated security and this is this is sort of one aspect that i would say secures the protocol right having just a high absolute number like a high absolute likely high u.s denominated barrier to overcome foreign tekker but we we typically also want the the security budget to scale with sort of the either the network capitalization sort of the market cap of the network or the transaction volume right so some of those activity measures if you will right because a protocol that transacts a lot of value would be arguably at a bigger risk uh of attack and the text would be easier to monetize than a network with like a far lower transactional activity for example so so those are really two things that that are several things even that sort of the the block subsidy affords you that transaction fees don't and um i really like that that meme that justin made i mean he's really getting into the memes lately right with the with the what did he call it ultrasound money right and now the the the great a few great visual yeah that's really good i mean i definitely agree with um with everything you said there that like sub subsidy paying for security is fundamentally better than fees um there's even one aspect of transaction fees i mean we we earlier touched on why do we need to why do we want to burn the transaction fees and we can actually go we can go back to that right now because i think it's very fitting now so one one benefit is that there was this um this paper back in i think it was 2016 uh called uh on the instability of bitcoin without the block reward that's one of the most uh well-known papers on basically the economic security and fees and crypto and the thesis of that paper was that transaction fees uh can also destabilize uh consensus in a cryptocurrency because they can create incentives basically for miners to to reorganize each other's blocks instead of building on them right so there are some mitigations for that but that's i would say that's fundamentally uh a problem so the fees come in like really unregularly blocks come in come in unregularly and then you have some blocks at a very high fee just recently on a theorem we had a block that over 120 east in transaction fees right but i mean this it would totally make sense for some miners to try to reorganize that transactions and include that include those high fees for themselves um but luckily we are not yet seeing that hopefully we will never see that but if we if we can lower the fees um of the blockchain we can lower that kind of instability risk so that's definitely one factor and um yeah the other one kind of you already touched on that as well which is that really the security spend of a blockchain shouldn't be linked to the congestion of the blockchain um the congestion might be high but it doesn't necessarily mean that i mean that that the network should pay much more for security and when congestion is low then it doesn't mean that we have to pay nothing or very little for security i think that's that's exactly the wrong approach right when when demand is slow and you lower security even further then you can get into very dicey territory there so that's why i think it's fundamentally better to have a block a block subsidy which is you have basically holders pay for security via dilution but where this ties back to erp-1559 is that it's way more acceptable by the market and by holders to pay to subsidize security in this way when they know that when that subsidy is not necessary for example because congestion is very high and there's a lot of transaction fees generated that then they don't need to be the one also paying for security right so they only subsidize it when it's really necessary but when when a lot of trans when there's a lot of transaction activity in the network a lot of fees generated then what happens is sort of in erp-1559 that the the holders still pay the subsidy but then they are refunded via the burning of the transaction fees which is sort of like a reverse block subsidy if you will so then you can have a scenario where when when demand is really high and there's no need for a subsidy then the holders won't pay a subsidy and i think that makes it way more acceptable for them to pay a permanent subsidy at all so going back to this fuel metaphor which i think ties in nicely here we have the grade a fuel which is issuance because it's dependable it's exactly what is needed to secure the blockchain and then there's grade b fuel which is transaction fees which are volatile but justin drake in our recent podcast and hazu i think you're going to appreciate this metaphor said that there's actually two different types of grade b fuel there is the stable amount of generalized transaction fees that we find on a persistent level and right now with ethereum that's roughly two to three eth of transaction fees per block in addition to the two eth issuance per block there's also roughly on a very dependable stable level there's two to three ether transaction fees that we can find on almost every single block and then there's kind of this other type of transaction fees which is extremely spiked amount of eth fees per block like and like you said there was a recent block that was mined that had 120 eat per block and since we are burning all transaction fees what that allows us to do is pocket all of those transaction fees and turn them and refine them into great a fuel and great and turn that into future issuance and this is really really important and where we i want to leave this conversation next is how this burning leads and protects ethereum from minor extractable value hazu could you talk about all of these different transaction fees and how mev is relevant with the ip1559 yeah i would i would actually challenge um what you just said so first of all i think it's a great meme um i think maybe we should call it a great c fuel because it is really different from the great b view in the sense that it won't be affected by erp one five f9 and it maybe helps a bit to dissect where actually those fees are coming from just using the example of that one block that had 120 if of transaction fees so it wasn't the case that there's a hundred transactions in the block that that that each paid like 1.2 each of fees right to get into that block that was not at all the case that the lowest fee paying transaction at block paid maybe 200 grey or 300 grain right um but then you had some transactions some really large transactions that paid 50 000 way for the same amount of gas and why is that the case that's because there were some really profitable arbitrage opportunities in d5 it was there was a big a big price drop and there were a lot of liquidations on compound and a couple other lending protocols and so someone someone paid these very high amounts of of grape or gas in order to get a very very early prioritized position in that block right so the first 20 30 positions in that block were all basically just bots um and like large trading firms bidding against each other to get into these very special early blocks right where only the first the first person to a particular opportunity can can fill that trade and um yeah that's that's sort of uh where you have this large divergence right between sort of the last person in the block and the first person in the block that's yeah and and it's absolutely true that this is sort of the most uh the most aggressive sort of fees uh that also causes the most incentive uh incentive problems and consensus instability and i mean we would like to get rid of them if we could but that's not really possible not even in eip159 because if you think about it it's not enough for those they don't really care like basically the the the people who want to make these mev transactions they don't it's not enough for them to get into the block right they don't care about that they want to get into a specific place in the block like the first place the second third the fourth and they want to get there and they want other people not to get there so they they bid against these others and they will always be engaged in a first place auction even if the block is otherwise completely empty right so this is for them it's like it's totally irrelevant how much extra space there will be afforded by erp one five of nine so what they'd currently do via the regular transaction fee will then move entirely to the tip so you will have these same kinds of we call them priority priority gas auctions um those will all happen in the tip and not in the base fee those transactions will also pay the same base fee that everyone else pays but they will also pay a very high tip that's probably 10 20 30 maybe a thousand times what the base fee is and um and that will not that revenue will not be burned um there was this debate um to maybe go on a small attention here where miners like most miners argued that um erp 1559 would slash their revenue by more than 50 percent and that could really hurt the security of the network and lead to a large drop in hashrate and so on and what what georges and i did is we leveraged some mev data from flashbots um just sort of an initiative to democratize the extraction of med and sort of just illuminate the dark forest i think is what they called it so we we leveraged some of this data to figure out how much of the fees that are today being paid stems from these priority gas auctions versus from regular transactions and compared that to the block reward and what we found is that about like we can only give a like high level guess because it's not always easy to identify maybe transactions so we only give like a lower bound right but we figured that about fifty percent of the fees that are today being paid from mev and 50 uh from regular transactions so uh i think it would be probably a fair assumption that about about half of the fees that are being paid will be burned after erp 155 f9 and the other half will continue to get paid and so extending that out that implies that the base fee to tip ratio of ether value is roughly going to be about the same from the perspective of miners yeah absolutely like from the perspective of an individual user right you will like the you will almost never pay a tip right you will almost always pay a base fee but then you have some people who pay obscene amounts of basis because they are engaged in this in these auctions and they like the base fee that they play will look completely tiny in comparison right so inside of a block perhaps 95 of transactions are paying just a tiny little tip but that five there's a five percent of transactions which are in trying to engage in some sort of uh arbitrage transaction some mev transaction that are paying exorbitant amount of amounts of tips which go to miners and ethereum uh current ethereum proof of work ethereum but then also go to stakers in ethereum proof of stake correct yeah that's right yeah after like that i mean we will go to uh to the statehouse in pos now so that's that's why you can think of like pos internalizing like the fp1559 internalizes some uh of the revenue that currently flows out to miners basically leaks from the system and then in eip15f9 internalizes some of that revenue uh and pos will then internalize even more so so hazu since we've brought up the subject of miners do you foresee any systemic issues with regards to eip1559 and miners and the future of ethereum um you know because we do need miners currently in ethereum while we have the beacon chain and is not securing the actual gdp of ethereum uh do you see for see any bumps in the road with transitioning into eip1559 as it comes to uh getting miners on board um i mean there's i don't i really don't think so i mean you do see like especially the smaller miners the hobbyists do you see them make a lot of noise right now um [Music] and i mean it's it's sort of understandable right i mean they think that the kind of revenue is being cut but in my view really the best and we wrote a long analysis about this but in my view really the by far the best they can do is just go along with the update um because it's just it's just an unsustainable scenario right now right minus make like many times like a magnitude more than a year ago or something and i mean it's clear that all of this money is not actually necessary to secure the ethereum blockchain and and really the holders are kind of the losers in the current scenario right because there's a lot of demand for transactions there's a very high transaction fees uh the transaction fees are even a little bit higher than the current block subsid like no they are they're actually several times higher than the current block subsidy about three to two or three times and this is but still you have kind of the holders who are paying the block subsidy right but why are they subsidizing it it's a subsidy that's completely unnecessary because the transaction fees alone can can clearly sustain the security of ethereum so i think this is like a much needed upgrade that um that then would kind of alleviate this this burden from from the holders when it's not necessary and i would still pay it when it's necessary um so i think that like the miners who complain about this are really short-sighted because they don't see well for one they don't like properly recognize their own status in sort of this economy right that they are service providers to ethereum they are not like ethereum doesn't because this exists to make them profitable or keep them profitable right that's not how this works and um yeah uh but also the other weird thing about all this hatsu is like are they not aware that um their positions are about to be eliminated like that they are a redundancy i mean ethereum has made no secret that it plans to transition to proof of stake and with the launch of eth2 has now implemented a decent portion of that vision uh the reality is if if they're service providers to the ethereum network they're temporary service providers so this is another reason i've not understood kind of the the reaction from from miners i mean if all goes well in 12 months 18 months 24 months they'll no longer be needed at all and will receive no revenue from the ethereum network unless they transition to becoming validators and staking providers and holding eth that's i've never understood that you have any ideas i mean yeah i mean i think it makes a lot of sense right the behavior uh it's exactly what we kind of would expect right so i think that like when when you think about it when are miners actually when do they have the most control over ethereum it's on the last day of proof-of-work mining because then they have only one day of future revenue left that can that they can lose but they have all the power over the entire consensus of ethereum so i mean this is something that the people behind the scenes i assume are thinking very hard about right so how can we actually make a safe transition to proof of stake um because it's i mean maybe you know this i don't know who set this up was it naval or something but play long-term games with long-term people right this sort of goes into this really the dynamics of sort of repeated interactions with people are a lot different a lot more fair than sort of these one-off interactions and if someone is can be sort of the the control the entire entire block ordering and mining of ethereum but have nothing at stake really that they can lose if ethereum goes away if they blow up the system or if we decide to move to proof of stake sooner then like what do we really like what is really the incentive not to misbehave right that's so um i think it makes sense that maybe miners accepted previous block block reward reductions which were by the way much larger right we have we had one from from 5e 5e to 3e so 60 reduction a couple years ago and then we had another one from from three to two if that was a 33 percent reduction so and that those were both uh by our estimates much larger than the current expected reduction and i mean no minor complaint or almost no minor complaint complained back then why is that maybe because they they thought that if the price of either increases as a result of this then they would have more like they would have a longer time to benefit from that right um so there's really the way i i think about uh mining hardware is sort of as basically future coins that still have to vest right and if they mine then can can unlock these coins if you will so um i think that it makes sense that miners become more and more hostile um the shorter the duration to proof of stake and but it's it that's what we also said it's like it's way too soon for them to be stupid right and make any uh aggressive moves because there is still 12 to 18 months of proof of work mining left and if you just look closely enough then that the market loves erp-1559 right i mean there was an article about it on bloomberg that was the most read on the entire site i talked to the author on twitter it was clicked 330 30 000 times on the first day that it was posted it was the most weird article on the site i mean the narrative they call the ether crypto coin [Laughter] um you know i'm actually fine with that right because it's it's whatever gets people to click on the article right i mean the headline is just to catch them in a sea of other other kids right so people wouldn't maybe click that the bloombox audience will maybe not click on an article as much that that mentions ethereum so um but to me it's it's really clear that this this is the the most important update that if your ms ever made um outside of the transition then to proof of stake um proof of stake is the only thing that really comes anywhere like close in terms of the importance and a lot of people are looking at it and i mean if eip159 doesn't go through for whatever reason i think that's terrible for eth and the price of ethan ultimately everyone loses i mean i have no doubt in my mind that miners would make less money if they somehow managed to block efp1559 or even to like fight for some important concession like uh block reward increase or something um i think that would be yeah that would that would ultimately not even benefit them so that's that's why i'm just really yeah i think i think we already see uh them realizing it it will take maybe a while longer but i mean there was this protest planned on april 1st where miners um where some smaller miners called for uh the gathering 50 of the hatchery in one mining pool and then uh maintaining it for 51 hours right to send the ethereum quota for the ethereum developers signal right that they are not to be messed with and what was the response i mean the response was uh a research a research post that discussed their like accelerated deployment of proof of stake right the the sort of the fast merge and uh now miners are like next that you can you could tell that the minor suit sort of pushed for this uh sort of freaked out by this but because they i don't know they they couldn't really or they didn't really think about the consequences of their actions right which is unfortunate yeah it does talk about the game theory and about the whole entire ecosystem and really having the proof-of-stake beacon chain live and operational is really just a fantastic ace up the sleeve at least from from the perspective of the ethereum community because you can't argue with that um the the beacon chain is ready to be accepted if if such a need ever arises hazu we've done a fantastic job running through the specifics of eip1559 but i want to start to stitch everything together and try and uh create a comprehensive picture of uh at what at one point if eip1559 will just in my opinion be called ethereum or at least a part of ethereum and so i want to project ourselves into that future where at some point in time we will be under a proof-of-stake system the issuance uh the heavy issuance under a proof-of-work system will be eliminated at some point in time that during at this point in time it's highly likely that eip150 will have gotten integrated so no not only are we reduced do we have reduced issuance meaningfully reduced issuance because that is the benefit of going from proof of work to proof of stake but now we also have um a fee burning mechanism a deflationary force on the price of ether when we get to this point how would you characterize the monetary policy of ether uh i mean i would say that you have holders paying for security when the subsidy when sort of that subsidy is necessary but then getting refunded uh when it's not necessary and even get rewarded for kind of the subsidy that they pay right because in theory um there doesn't need to be inflation at all right um you can have you kind of hold a funded subsidy but the holders don't even feel any inflation because the the deflationary pressure from the burn could be larger than the inflationary pressure from from the minting for the block subsidy so um i think that erp-159 really captures sort of the best of both worlds it really combines sort of having a very secure very stable monetary policy from a security standpoint right where it's you can ensure that the protocol always pays x amount relative to market cap for the security which is this is just a fantastic feature of any blockchain but it it it combines this with having a solid monetary policy where they there's no guarantee that holders actually have to pay this the subsidy right that that the protocol gets which i mean in my view this it's really the the perfect combination and i think i i don't want to say ethereum can write a bitcoin's monetary policy but i mean it if if really i mean i think this it will just happen automatically right i mean if if really it turns out that we burn more transaction fees than we issue uh in new coins and eta turns deflationary i mean that's just going to be a very powerful narrative and i think a lot of people a lot of institutions a lot of people that current that like bitcoin right for for very good reason will also then pay far more attention to ethereum i think that they are still i mean it it's not maybe it's not um like the issuance is not everything right i mean there are also other aspects right if you're just purely interested in the sort of value asset then you might still value bitcoins larger network you might where you like the integrations that it has the brand value the the trust like the protocol itself is easier to trust because it's less complex right a smaller attack surface and so on so bitcoin doesn't lose these advantages but i think that ethereum will definitely against everything else right against every other asset in the world will become a far better store of value type asset and i mean you've made this point many times on your show and you know articles i think you call it like triple point asset right but i mean this combination of an asset that's yeah really it's a productive asset but also a deflationary storehold of that world asset that's just incredibly powerful i think um and that really goes to show what the kind of the the private the kind of types of money and value that the private market can design uh if it if it's left free reign and um i mean i wouldn't be surprised if yeah if ethereum is going to become really really successful on the back of proof of stake and the erp 105 f9 in combination neither neither would we of course i mean this is a very kind of austrian sort of ideal it's like almost like hayek with you know we'll try all of these different private monetary experiments and see which wins it seems uh clear you know from what you're saying that now not only do we have just one sound money experiment which is fixed cap bitcoin we have this now the second sound money experiment which is sort of this eip enabled proof-of-stake ethereum ultrasound money as justin drake has called it but but i want to ask you about one thing and this is something that uh bitcoin does have in addition to all the things that that you mentioned from a monetary premium perspective that ethereum doesn't and that is that is it's never changed its monetary policy from from day one and i think that's that's fair right so bitcoiners will say that ethereum even the fact that is making these changes and ethereums would say these are improvements these are in line with the social contract of minimum necessary issuance but the fact that these changes are even being made goes against the principle of having an algorithmically defined monetary policy like bitcoin was made and there was 21 million and there shall never be more than 21 million no one can change that social contract of bitcoin what would what would you say to that to the sound money evangelists who say well the fact that ethereum's monetary policy has changed in any way even if it's gotten better is a bad thing and you know makes makes ether less of a sound money um i would say that soundness means different things to different people and i can totally relate to those who say that i mean blockchains are really ungovernance mechanisms or they they get their their value from being very hard to change and um i mean it's i also think it's definitely an attack surface of ethereum that it's more easy to change right and i've been in i participated in the governance process for the last few months because i really want to push for erp 1559 i want to see this get implemented right and so i participated um pretty closely and i mean it's i think it's definitely far easier to get changes even major changes into ethereum than into bitcoin right and um but i mean at the same time if the change itself is good then it's really no no saying like it doesn't pose like a long-term risk as i said i can understand if people just want the protocol to be completely resistant to change because they don't trust humans right i mean so far we have we have driven every monetary system into the ground right we have found ways to hack every one of them and uh basically for a small group of insiders to to control it and um and basically extract rent uh at the expense of everyone else right and who's to say that um this doesn't happen to ethereum in ten years right i mean nobody can right it's it's just a risk that we i think we are happy to obsec to accept like us who sort of like the way that ethereum works right now and i think i mean ethereum as well it has to specify probably at some point if it doesn't want to fall victim to that um [Music] so yeah that was a bit like long-winded but i would say i can definitely understand those who prefer like strong resistance to change but i i would i would also see this other side of it that the like the inflation or deflation aspect of it is the most important one right i mean how many people today invest in bitcoin because they know that it has a fixed supply they don't even care about any of the benefits that it has or the weaknesses right they don't think beyond okay what is the inflation rate of the of that asset and i think i mean we can't expect most people in the world most investors to dive as d as deep as we have into kind of the technical side of cryptocurrency and so on so ultimately this will be a big driver of what they invest in and what they don't and if ethereum has a lower inflation rate than bitcoin then i mean it will that will automatically put it on more people's radars and make it a far more attractive investment and i do think this makes it sound money for sure it just depends what you define assaultness so hasso in our in our intro you talked about uh you said security was one of the last unsolved problems in crypto and uh you made mention of of bitcoin i wonder what you think of this um do you think that bitcoiners and the bitcoin network will have to wrestle with its issuance in time in order to to pay for this economic security so like how does i i know you've written extensively about this but the question in my mind is how does the the unsolved problem of security in the bitcoin network gets solved because of transaction fees are that that grade b fuel not a great fuel um do you think that the market is kind of over overweighting bitcoin's immutability and fixedness i've always thought it seem it seems to be the case that at some point bitcoin is going to need to in order to maintain its economic guarantees is going to need to change something about its issuance policy or the or the way it does security what are your thoughts on that do you think the market maybe underweights that or doesn't understand that yeah i mean i guess there are two several ways to think about this the one is really that you should think about this today because change in bitcoin takes a long time um so that's kind of the approach that i take right i try to engage people in discussions about this topic even get them to think about it and explore even what solutions they might see as viable if it turns out that there's a problem but then so the other side or the other half of people would be like that for them there's really no value to admitting that that's a problem right now for one because it doesn't make bitcoin look good right which is important right the more really it's sort of like a self-fulfilling prophecy right if we deny today that there can be a problem in the future then it actually decreases massively the chance that there will be a problem right because if bitcoin gets adopted like the higher its adoption is the higher the fees will be and maybe we'll never see um actually a scenario where the system isn't fully congested all the time so this makes me actually pretty reluctant myself right because i think that's actually such a valid argument it's not just okay these are like mind there's maximalists who don't want to admit to the faults of the system but it's one of the scenarios where if you do admit it you can create a safe fulfilling prophecy and if you don't then you can create the reverse sort of like a virtuous cycle if you will that's that's such a nuanced take that's so crazy yeah you're saying this is crazy but but this should be no stranger to anyone who's kind of listened to to what we've talked about on bank list right there is value in the shared delusion that we call money that's what you're talking about here yeah and hazard that brings me to my next question i i think the question that we can wrap up to close with is i want to talk about sound money culture and if you see sound money culture and ethereum because we definitely see sound money culture in bitcoin and perhaps perhaps sound money culture in bitcoin is an absolute necessity because if there isn't sound money culture in bitcoin then the meme of bitcoin is less strong and as we just said bitcoin needs to make sure that everyone sees that it's wearing clothes rather than not wearing clothes and if the world sees that the emperor has no clothes then perhaps bitcoin doesn't work but that same ex we can extend that same sort of reasoning or rationale to ethereum and ether the asset where the ether the asset has this shield this protective shield of the culture around ether the asset and if the ethereum community and ethereum culture predictive predictably protects sound the soundness of ether the asset that then that makes the eth the asset meme even stronger how do you see sound money culture in ethereum playing out in and and overall can you just comment on the connection between a social contract of a cryptoeconomic system and its security yeah um i think that i mean one of the longest standing feats that i've had about crypto is that blockchains are most useful for money and the money that the market most wants assault money right i mean you have all these i mean you have people who are worried about what will like we need two percent inflation per year or like a deflation the economy can't work and so on but ultimately these are all systemic arguments right these are these arguments that like a like a monetary economist would make or like someone who plans an economy who writes regulation and policies and so on but those are not the ones who make the decision to adopt bitcoin or ethereum but the individual does and for the individual it's always better to use the currency that sort of has the least cost of carry for them right that has the lowest possible inflation rate or even deflation rate at the if if possible so um i think that every blockchain that's useful will converge to basically the salt money idea over time it's just inevitable right if it doesn't then we'll just disappear but the best ones that have the strongest community then i think over time then you see sort of those supporters rise to the top that do support the that idea that has the highest fitness in the marketplace in bitcoin we saw i mean it wasn't really about the block size right in bitcoin in 2014-17 what was about the vision of what bitcoin is supposed to be and the vision for bitcoin bitcoin has sound money uh as a store store of value that's the kind of vision that won out and it wasn't really about the block size right that was just one one better field of it and in ethereum we've seen i think the same battlefield i mean um [Music] i think that like when ethereum was conceived um like the idea of either being money or the idea of d5 being as big as it is today that was just that wasn't really an option at all right but then people this is this is the thing with blockchains right and there's something vitalik said which which i really like it's not like blockchains aren't as much developed as they are discovered right we have this kind of technology and we we can only guess at what it might be used useful for in the future but one thing that it's clearly useful for is sort of the yeah this form of digital value right that people want to want to stay want to transact and want to just keep away from sort of the nation state and and banks and so on and so it just turns out that people adopt the blockchain to be useful as sound money and to transact uh sound money and in the case of ethereum also do do like more additional stuff with it like lending and exchanging and leverage and and and all these these great stuff that this that's really necessary for sort of a apparel financial system to work and and so i think that the social contract of ethereum and really of any blockchain will migrate always would have a very strong like magnetic pull towards these song money ideas and haseo have you seen that from the time you entered into crypto to now that the ethereum community and ethereum culture has moved farther in that sound money direction oh yeah i mean it's it's it's impossible to overlook i mean when i came then nobody really i mean nobody really thought that ether should be money but at that time you already you already could see that ether was being used as money because of the ico boom right i mean all these projects raised raised their icos with eth and then held it in their treasuries and you could tell it was already being used as a as a reserve asset even though it wasn't really acknowledged in uh the community itself and um i think i mean i would say that ethereum developed like a sound money focused social contract or the the the social contract gravitated toward becoming more sound money in spite of who was in charge and in spite of what maybe the sort of the the preachers said right um because i mean if you look at vitalik himself i mean it's sort of an open secret that he doesn't really believe in an ether to be money and the same goes for for other people who just um were very important figures at the time right um there there were several like ethereum figureheads who did not really strongly believe in the ethereum as money uh narrative right but that's that doesn't matter right because the market took ether and made it money right and then people who sort of all set this all along they they grew in importance right and are seen as someone who predicted this and uh and also yeah we saw it happening much earlier right yeah the the most i've heard of italics say about this um is if the ethereum community wants eth to be money then it will be money he's kept almost this neutral poise the entire time that was his answer to my question about whether he thinks ethan's money which i asked him in in tel aviv it's like vitalik do you consider eath to be money and his answer was well if the ethereum community wants eth to be money it will be money and hazu that i kind of want to finish off with this question would you say that the sound the growing sound money culture and ethereum is one of the reasons as to why i've noticed you become part of the ethereum community spearheading this effort into eip1559 if the if you hadn't noticed ethereum moving towards the sound money culture do you think that you would have been as interested in this community and as interested in this eip [Music] no i would say that's definitely a big part of it right i mean i have my thesis about space and what's valuable and what isn't and when when i see that a coin gravitates towards these ideas that i think are being rewarded by the marketplace then that's something for me to put my uh my time behind and my capital and so on because i i too would like to front run this opportunity right because if i think that that sound money is is what the world most wants out of crypto and nobody really looks at ethereum as sound money right now but i see that ethereum's on the way to becoming salt money then that's that's just a great opportunity right then you can see the future before others can and um i mean ethereum has a lot of other interesting stuff as well right i mean sort of defy and sort of the sound money narrative those are the those are the two big ones i think diva is totally revolutionary i think that lots of people are still missing uh the opportunity there but just it wasn't really clear in 2017 like what a blockchain could really be useful for other than money and i think it turns out that just financial services that do transact the sort of permissionless value uh and also some some permission assets i think that that this is really a fantastic use case uh yeah for like sort of a general purpose blockchain that's too last one for you i think we all agree that the inclusion of eip 1559 the merger with with proof of stake makes ether a sound money asset we probably also agree that maybe folks on the bankless journey maybe folks like yourself are sort of front running that opportunity but the world has not yet woken up to this fact the world is just now discovering bitcoin as a sound money 21 million fixed cap meme what do you think it's going to take for the world to discover that about this ethereum sound money experiment two and how close are we to that i think it'll take time so that's that's i think the biggest one some things just can't be rushed i think uh erp 1559 it is catching the attention of a lot of people including sort of the mainstream financial media and so on as we've seen with the article for example that i talked about it's um i think that's that's that's one that will get a lot of people talking but it's not the first time that you hear about something that you invest in them especially not if you're an institution or like a a large money manager right it takes several it takes it takes time right and it takes several instances right lots of people like the people who invest in bitcoin today they they haven't heard about it now they heard about it for the first time in 2017 whatever right it's kind of it just it just takes time to grow i think and um and then it takes time to develop sort of a momentum where it turns from being like a a very controversial trade that can sort of lose your job if you miss to do something where you lose your job if you don't right so it turns uh into a consensus trade and ethereum is not there yet um and i mean but every every big thing that it achieves every milestone is getting getting it closer to that i think ep 159 is very important and it's also super important in the sense that sort of this sound money narrative it it sort of de-risks ethereum from [Music] the biggest risk that it has which is execution risk right i mean nobody nobody really mentions bitcoin and execution risk in the same in the same sense even because it doesn't exist bitcoin doesn't need to execute right i mean not on a protocol layer it doesn't need to do anything to be sound money right and um bitcoin executes every 10 minutes yeah but there's no real i mean we have to we talk about here the economic failures that bitcoin could have in the future with a declining subsidy but that's something that like the market doesn't talk about right but with ethereum everyone is treating it like a venture a bit right it's it's like a super risky tech startup or whatever right that that has a pretty large chance of blowing up but if ethereum is sound money then if ether is sold money then you know a lot of this is getting de-risked right because then okay so maybe part of that shouting roadmap or whatever is not going to materialize but it's okay i mean because it has some money right guys that's right hassu we agree with you uh did this transition from ether becoming a venture bet which is you know words even michael saylor has used recently to becoming a sound money bet i think that narrative and and that switchover is uh is starting to happen and thank you so much for guiding us through eip1559 not only guiding us through on the podcast for the work you're actually doing in the community digging up yeah pulling up your sleeves and digging into this eip writing about it fighting for it in governance uh we we def as a sound money advocate i think david and i definitely appreciate everything you're doing for the ethereum community so thank you for coming on the podcast and thank you for your contribution sasu thanks guys all right bankless nation we hope you got a flavor of eip1559 so once again hopefully this is coming out this summary if you want more on this we'll include some reading material in the show notes make sure you check out hasu's analysis of eip 1559. there's an article about it we also made reference to an article on our bankless newsletter that david wrote about this and then you might have also heard mention our justin drake episode on crypto economics that also touches on eip 1559 so those are some resources for you lastly make sure you check out the uncommon core podcast that is a fantastic podcast that explores some of these topics as well and also explores defy it's on both david and i's rotation guys finally and hazu is the host of the uncommon should have mentioned that the possum is the host with his co-host you can actually find it at uncommoncore.co podcast and on that site we also have a a resource for erp1559 that that's uh yeah that sort of summarizes collects and summarizes and answers all of the biggest questions that people have had in the past about this erp check those resources out they're definitely big brain resources for you guys risks and disclaimers of course despite being sound money heath is risky crypto is risky so is defy you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us
