[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks knew that the code that they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because the ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with kevin o'keefe the leading mind behind the whole git coin project and one of the biggest most vibrant proponents of public goods that i know of and i obviously have a ton of respect for kevin owaki as one of the guys that has really helped me formulate my mental models and ideas about like what this whole crypto thing is and why it's meaningful for just the and why it allows you to be bullish on humanity um bankless listeners will remember kevin from our slang moloch episode which um is referenced in the show a few times and if you like the conversation that i'm having here with kevin that is definitely a fantastic follow-up follow-up episode to you to listen to to get more of the same type of conversations um kevin is a guy who wears many many hats uh he is a software developer he is a an entrepreneur he's a business leader and then he also reminds me during the show that he's also a community manager in addition to a father and a husband and a bike rider and a coloradian but i focus on the first four that i listed and because kevin has built so much in this space not only with what he's been building at bitcoin but just being a general contributor both to the the discourse and conversation around ethereum as well as contributor of actual software that we use in the open source world so immense respect for kevin kevin thanks for coming on the show without further ado let's go ahead and get right into the show but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d-apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrom arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer two to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrary and join their discord hey kevin what's up hey david thanks for having me oh glad to have you here man what do you want to talk about today uh layer two this this podcast is called layer two right we'll tell you we're focused on scaling scaling only okay um yeah no i think the the name of this podcast layer two is is really interesting uh layer zero is the humans of ethereum is that right yeah right yes humans all the way down and i've always had bad respect for for what you're you're doing because to me the whole like funding public goods side of ethereum is like almost everything else like defy speculation nft jpegs it's like kind of a means to an end just to like spin up the flywheel that ultimately becomes funding public goods totally yeah yeah it's been really exciting so bitcoin's mission is to uh build open source software to build and fund the open web and it's been a lot of fun to help builders get into the space and then once they're in the space make sure that they can get coins for their work in the space and um when i was at ecc i think i saw you at ecc maybe once or twice i had maybe a dozen or two dozen people come up to me and say hey thanks for creating git coin it created my first opportunity in the space or it affected my career in this or that way so in a way layer zero is is where git coin is focused it's on helping builders find places to work for public goods and get paid for that work hey like both me and ryan before bank list was bankless both me and ryan were getting bitcoin grants and this is always how i tell people is like the gitcoin grant model was like the first way that i was actually able to receive input from the market that my work was valued and that i could actually turn that into something that i could like actually generate like a livelihood with and i wouldn't have had that opportunity had it not been git coin uh funding people people funding other people totally yeah and i got into this space sort of aiming to help software engineers be able to quit their corporate jobs and work on open source software and then also to some extent be able to work on public goods and stuff that didn't have a business model instead of icos in 2017 but it was kind of a happy accident to see media people like yourself and like sassel and ethub all start to use bitcoin grants and i think that um it was kind of a happy accident that we pioneered well vitalik pioneered quadratic funding we just implemented it but that it works for open source which is the public good but also journalism which is the public good for the space right yeah it seemed to be kind of like a like a breakthrough moment where maybe you can elaborate on this but like you said that it was a happy accident as in like bitcoin didn't intend or think to really fund anything that wasn't like developer and coding and software um software focus but instead just like at some point people just used this thing to the market just chose the the outcome of this thing and all of a sudden like it turned to bitcoin into it not just a software funding platform but just a funding platform for anything yeah totally well i mean the the genesis story of is is that i've been a software engineer all of my career and the idea behind get coin was hey what if we can use this crypto economics thing to fund open source software right now open source software doesn't have a business model creates 500 billion dollars per year in economic value and and there's no business model if you're an open source software developer and so it just felt like an asymmetry between value created and value captured and the fact that there was billions of dollars of capital now trillions of dollars of capital sloshing around in this in this financial system that's open source meant that instead of that money going to some back office on wall street to do it stuff that it would go to open source software and so that was sort of the idea behind git coin and you know i i think journalism is great and i think that there's a lot of really other good public goods privacy is another digital age private good that public good that i care a lot about and um we had nothing against those niches it just we really wanted to focus on software development and um yeah the pivot it's not really a pivot because we support both audiences but i think came from bitcoin grants maybe round three or four i think that vitalik realized that oh my gosh we can get more people talking about get coin grants and therefore more funding for open source software if we support all these bloggers and people who are creating public goods in this sort of journalism space in in ethereum and so it's kind of a happy happy marriage where i think like having l2 clients and eth2 clients on one end sort of legitimizes the journalism and the journalism brings more eyeballs into the funding of the open source software so it's been it's been in that sense it was a happy accident so kevin here's here's a question for you did you care about public goods before ethereum or like when was the first moment where you were like oh public goods i like those things and i want to help those things grow yeah it's not like a real natural thing i think for people to come to a moment like that unless they're studying economics maybe but for me there was i've been a technology entrepreneur basically since since i was 23 and i went through tech stars learned how to run a engineering shop there and and ran an online dating website basically for the first five years of my career and every time i wanted to do something new for that online dating website if i wanted to install a database server i didn't write my own database server i used an open source one it was my sql and then when i wanted to build a web server i didn't write my own i used apache or later nginx and so i think with open source software we're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants insofar as there's so much value created by open source software developers and as a technology entrepreneur i was just deriving so much value for open source and really understood the power of it as open source came to prominence as github came to prominence this is before get gitcoin and over the last 10 years i just kind of jumped from technology to technology startup to technology startup and everywhere i went open source software was something that was used it was something that we recruited on it was something that we virtue signaled about but we never really gave back at any of those startups and so it was open source software and the sort of like visceral experience of having that of working on open source software through the last 10 years and then the idea of an open source financial ecosystem combined that was the genesis of git coin and so i just have that that sort of personal experience with open source software and that was the first public good that i really really appreciated it was later conversations with vitalik and other economist nerds in the space that sort of turned me on to the wider world of public goods things like journalism which is really important for making an informed public or clean air which is really important if you don't want to have lung cancer there's just so many public goods in the world and it was that was sort of how it all snowballed for me so when you were developing your your dating website which i definitely want to unpack that later um and then and then all the other like things you were doing with software development when you would go and tap into public goods were you like cognitive were you like consciously aware of what was going on is like oh i wouldn't be able to do this because of this open source software thank you developers that came before me or was it just like oh i'll just go to i don't know where you go to the library of open source software and just pull out a book and like was it a cognitive things like oh thank god that this is here or was it more just a mindless thing where you didn't really realize you know how awesome this thing is yeah i mean you know i my first startup the date the dating site was like 23 year old cto and like you have no business being chief anything i think the age of 23. and um i was just trying to keep up with everyone else and i was trying to get good at shipping software and so you spend a lot of time on hacker news you go to meetups with other technology entrepreneurs and you try to learn from them and they were all leveraging open source software and and yeah github is kind of like a library you pull a book off the shelf and you install it in your repo and you don't think much more about it you don't think about the maintainer behind that software until you have to file a bug and then they don't respond to it and so that was kind of the experience with open source but when you're a technology entrepreneur like we had we had like three months of runway left at some points in that company and i wasn't thinking about supporting public goods at that point i just wanted to ship and i wanted my ceo to be happy so that our investors could be happy and so we could survive and so that was the job to be done for a technology entrepreneur that leverages open source but maybe doesn't give back you've always said that open source doesn't have a business model and that i mean i understood it but now what you just said makes me understood it like a lot more in the sense that like oh yeah yeah like we have all these people touching this product which is free and then there is a maintainer or maybe not maybe it's just been abandoned um i always like this question when if you can envision a world in which like bitcoin is maximally successful or just a like business model for open source is maximally successful like what would that world look like yeah so i mean if you go to getcoin.comresults you can see our live results page and i'm super proud that we've always been metrics driven and kpi driven we've delivered 32 million dollars worth of funding to open source software which you know when we crossed a million i was like yo this is legit we're gonna make an impact on the world but then i quote that stat of how 500 billion dollars per year in economic value is created by open source and just do some math there's maybe three orders of magnitude a thousand x per here from here until until we're maximally successful and i think that what that world looks like is people coming out of school and just working for the open internet people quitting their jobs at jpmorgan chase and working for the open internet and hopefully systemically more people are building infrastructure digital infrastructure and less people are going to projects that extract value so i think more eth2 clients and less avatar pfp projects coming out of the ethereum space so that's that's what i think a world of git coin being maximally successful looks like and then the secondary effect of more people working on our digital infrastructure is a more solid digital infrastructure so no more bugs in openssl that cause the secure contents of all these servers to be dumped to the open internet um the there's this uh this maintainer of an npm package that just got burnt out and was tired of all the support requests and so they're like they posted on their forum hey i'm gonna give up this package who wants to maintain it and they found someone who wanted to maintain it well that person ended up injecting malware into that npm package and every downstream site that used it and so stuff like that will not happen anymore black swan events where open source maintainers get burnt out would not happen anymore if bitcoin was maximally successful so if if like we visit if you uh get uh github as like a library i'm kind of also getting like a kind of kind of a legos vibe too right so like if we have all these open source packages of software books of software and then if there's a lot like and there's some of them i'm some of some of them have been created very much out of just demand and someone's like all right we all all developers have this problem i'll fix the problem posted to github now other people can use it and then boom now we have something open source without that whatever level of that that we have now is a function of having that before we have a business model behind open source software and so like once we unlock a business model behind open source software like we can actually incentivize the creation of these like software legos and then like perhaps like illustrate it it begs the question like is the internet even close to be remotely close to being like a done which it never is but like imagine how much progress the internet itself and all the things on top of the internet have gotten off of not having public goods funding for open source software totally yeah yeah the motivations to contribute to open source are basically you're doing it for exposure you're giving it to bit give back and sometimes you can find a job that will you know maybe google is at the scale where point one percent of their their person opex can go back to contributing to open source but even then it's just a virtue signal for them uh oh one other thing about this world where git coin's maximally successful probably software repositories will not be hosted on github they'll be hosted on something peer-to-peer like radical r-a-d-i-c-l-e is a name of a tool in the ethereum ecosystem called called radical and it's actually a peer-to-peer github so they're trying to build the collaboration layer for software that isn't owned by microsoft and a lot of people say hey kevin are you trying to disrupt github and i'm actually not we're trying to build an incentive system for open source software we're not trying to replace the collaboration layer and it just so happens that i met these other entrepreneurs ellie uh and abby at radical that are trying to build that and so uh i think the interoperability between get coin and radical is something that you'll see in that world as well and hopefully most of the software designers are not going to be using a centralized service like github in that world they'll be using something like radical very cool very cool i would imagine just like the another conversation to have about like what happens when we can finally figure out how to like increase the order increase like the availability of open source quality open source software by orders of magnitude like once that happens like the cost of producing something on the internet like drops significantly and the ease of either the ease of implementing it goes down and like maybe it actually gets to the point where like the technical knowledge to create something really really cool on the internet like drops away from actually even needing to code right like at some point like the internet can be created by like drag and drop like systems or which is not don't take that literally but like just illustrative of what could happen when just like cost costs and complexity keep on getting dropped because we keep on building open source things on top of open source things totally and and progress becomes exponential so basically every new money lego that gets added to the ethereum open source world means that there's a new possibility that i can build when i walk into a hackathon i like to say that you walk into an ethereum hackathon today and you can get enough software off the shelf to build something during the weekend as three hackers that some bank 10 years ago would have to have 100 people and 20 million dollars worth of budget to build with closed source because there's this exponential ability to just pull new legos off the shelf and every new lego creates a new permutation of something that can be built and so i think we're going to see exponential this is this is why i think the open source financial system is going to be the closed source one is because progress is just exponential in it you can build things so much faster with with open source libraries than you ever were able to in the old financial system so that's what makes me almost certain that d5 is going to beat out tradify eventually cool cool and i mean i think everyone listening can probably like understand that like we talk about d5 money legos all the time and that's just like the economic financial side of open source software like that's not even just like all the other parts of the internet too but like now that we have the open source financial side that's probably what we needed to unlock the business modeling of like the rest of the internet yeah yeah i think so cool so now i want to get into like tech stars can you tell us your tech star story yeah so um i let's see so my entrepreneurial journey kind of started when i was in when i was in high school i was working as a cashier at a supermarket and this is like when i was like 16 or 17. and i had this friend who was running a web hosting company and making like 400 a day which you're 17 in the early 2000s is a lot of money and i was like yo you got to cut me in on this i i can like i can program i was always kind of a programmer kind of kid and he did and my friend his name was mike he was on my street hockey team and he showed me the ropes of how to basically rent servers from um rack space or it was called rack shack back then and we would pay like a hundred dollars per month for servers and then we would just sell web hosting to people across the world for something like 50 per year so like you had a break even point where you've you've sold a certain amount of web hosting and and i was in it and i got to the point with it where i quit my my job at the supervisor just reselling just purchasing marking up and reselling yeah putting brand on it yeah and and like by the way i'm competing with all these web hosting companies that have like a staff of 30 and i'm just like some kid my parents house you know so i've like i've like no cost i could undercut everyone and um and there were there were shifts at the supermarket where i went i would make twice as much online during my shift than i would at the supermarket uh and i was like you know f this noise i'm quitting and i just and and i kind of ran that and i was 17 and i didn't know anything i ran it into the ground and and so i kind of gave up on that and and i got my computer science degree from university of delaware and after that the corporate career services just ushered us into corporate america this is delaware and like all these banks are located in delaware and so they're just trying to hit their kpi of graduates that they place and i'm a computer science major and so i'm an easy mark to just go place at a bank you know um and so i i go work at a bank when i'm 23 this is like i graduated with a degree in computer science in 2006. wow you're that you're the second guest on layer zero that worked at a bank yeah yeah there's there's and now i'm on a podcast called bankless there we go but anyway so i was so miserable at my corporate job i mean imagine going from being 22 and hanging out with your ultimate frisbee friends going to tournaments on the weekends and then all of a sudden you have to spend your your tuesday morning at the coffee maker talking to some 47 year old about their kids in like soccer practice and stuff i was just the culture was not right i hated how high oracle it was i hated the technology and i was looking for anything else and so um around then the facebook platform came out the facebook api was like when facebook apps launched and um and and i ended up launching this like flash games website and again was making more money off of flash games than i was off of my uh off of my corporate job and i was like oh i got a like this is a sign i have to get out i have to do something else and this is this is 2000 i'll say a flash game like advertisements just ads everywhere ads everywhere pixels i would put ads and you know i was like 23 i didn't know how to build a scalable business but i didn't know how to get eyeballs in in stuff like that so um so that got ran into the ground again and i was like it was a sign to me that i needed to do something else and this is 2006 this is before i think things are really like it was still the nuclear winner after the the the dot-com boom anyway so i'm getting to it i'm sending my resume out to anywhere i can i'm looking for anything besides corporate america and i find these two guys from new york city who are looking to run an online dating website which i think is a little bit scummy at first but you know it was a ticket out of corporate america and they had just gotten into tech stars which was this this seed stage accelerator program for for up-and-coming entrepreneurs and their cto just dropped out and so i was like oh this is my golden ticket like willy wonka style this is this is how i'm going to do it and um i went for being in corporate america wearing a suit and tie every day to just wearing a t-shirt and hanging out with brad feld and david cohen and trying to build this online dating website and it was just one of two inflection points in my career one was getting out of corporate america and into startups and the second is out of startups and into crypto and that was a huge one that dating site was not successful but i learned a lot about how to run technology startups from that wait so how do where where did tech stars come into that um so techstars was the startup that i got a job offer from they had already been accepted into tech stars but they needed a cto and i was looking for any path out of corporate america oh okay okay i thought texas tech stars am i wrong in thinking that tech stars is like american idol but for tech startups um i didn't do any singing um no it's like it's no they take they take 10 startups per cohort per season and they basically put them through uh month one is like what is your business what are you trying to build month two is building and then month three is they put you in front of a bunch of investors vcs and angel investors and then you you pitch and then you graduate so it's kind of like an mba in a summer for tech startups oh wait is this not like a reality tv show no there's no oh because you told me this story forever ago and i thought that this was like some sort of like yeah you would build a t like a tech product but you would also like be interviewed by people like on camera or something is that not at all like the right way to envision it yeah no it's a tech stars i think they consider themselves to be on the in the echelon of y combinator tile oh my god i thought this was an entertainment yeah and so but they later did launch a reality tv show about tech startups which i don't think did all that well but the their main business was the way it works was that they gave you six thousand dollars for a summer and you gave them like six percent of your equity and then they only made money on you if your startup was successful which was their way of aligning incentives and so i learned everything that i know from the techstars network and i'm super thankful to them for giving me my start yeah that's that sounds like a kid who figured out how to make money via developing software and tinkering on the internet twice a dream come true yeah yeah totally and this is before startups were cool like before 2008 i would describe finance as being cool and then we had the implosion within 2008 and i think the geek became chic again with that and the rise of web 2.0 okay so between tech stars and ethereum what happened in that gap of time uh ran the online dating website for five years raised five zombies okay yeah i stuck around um we raised vc money but we didn't figure out how to monetize it and it all just imploded in spectacular fashion um i mean i was echo hired my resume says i was aqua hired and and i just worked as kind of like a director or vp of engineering at different tech stars companies for for 10 years and and ran engineering teams and so it was through that experience of i think i hired like something like 40 or 45 engineers through those 10 years at these startups and and i just found out how how broken recruiting is i mean basically the median recruiter on linkedin is just like a 99 linkedin subscription plus a bunch of spam in both directions and then they charge you like 25k when they place an engineer at your company so me learning to recruit software engineers by just like being outgoing and friendly to them was like d.o in the matrix i was like oh my gosh i don't have to pay a recruiter 30k to like bring them on to my team i can just run a funnel myself and so real realizing that sort of arbitrage and uh was another part of the get coin genesis story like people really care about having engineering candidate flow into their organizations and i would describe that as what we do for the ethereum ecosystem we we help engineers find their next opportunity in the ethereum ecosystem and without my experience of learning how to recruit engineers at these startups i don't think bitcoin would would exist so kevin i i see three different things of who you are one is a software developer one is a entrepreneur who likes to find business models and make money and then the third is a manager uh ceo leader which which one of those do you think a which one of those do you like three questions actually which one of those three do you like the most which one of the three do you do the most in terms of time and what do you most personally identify with i guess that last question was the same as the first but take that as you will right um so i mean i think that you know all of us have multiple layers to their identity in addition to being a developer an entrepreneur and a manager i'm also a husband and a father and i'd play ultimate frisbee and i go to bluegrass concerts like you know we've all got like different parts of our identity that we just like display in different times but now but now we're contained inside of the professional lens of kevin yeah yeah yeah true i mean maybe yeah um i i think that it really and maybe this is maybe this is a non-answer but i think it just really depends on what i'm what i'm doing you know if i'm in the mood to build and i want to do deep work then i like software engineer creative kevin more than anything um and i actually think when i did web 2.0 stuff the the cto like the engineer was just like the quirky guy that you like hidden in the back it was like the drummer in the band and and i think it's really cool that in web 3 that i can be the ceo instead of just like you know like the guy that the vcs don't talk to and you know geek is really chic in web 3 and so i think that that's really cool i spend the most time in web 3. that's not the first time you've ever said that before right yeah i i'm not sure it could be but wow but you know it's it's just like it's just so so neat because i i never thought that i would do ceo stuff i thought i would like lead engineering teams for the rest of my career and and when bitcoin raised its round and i was kind of like hanging with multiple vc's like hanging out on on sand hill road and and they were into get coin i was like oh my gosh this is this is really neat that this world exists for someone who's nerdy and kind of not as charismatic um and can can like do these things and i actually think it's a prerequisite because if you don't understand the technology then you really can't be an effective blockchain software they move so fast that if you're not keeping up with the latest trends then you're then you're not effective but so uh when it when it first started get coin i was building all the software and i was kind of rage building a lot of our software and the manager stuff would be on the side but now it's kind of flipped like now i'm i'm doing financial models and spreadsheets and managing and coaching people and and and i spend most of my day in meetings but it's still that that acumen that being able to hang with software engineers that i think informs our roadmap and helps keep us grounded and so they're they're complimentary all three of those i think yeah no that makes a lot of sense and we definitely know that well a we know that this crypto industry is inherently multi-disciplinary right and especially in the like bootstrapping phase of this crypto industry in the first you know first 12 years of bitcoin in the first like six years of ethereum like it's there's such a supply glut of talent and labor that like ethereum will suck up all the talent and labor possible and so it really really incentivizes and rewards people that can just wear multiple hats right because like there's multiple hats that need to be worn yeah well and i think you actually missed one hat within the the professional sphere of of kevin milwaukee is that um i learned how to community manage community build when i moved out to boulder colorado and andrew hyde he's at unicorn on twitter and he really is a unicorn at community building he invited me to be an organizer at boulder startup week which is this one week celebration of entrepreneurship and technology every may in boulder or at least it was every may before the pandemic and the way that worked was that you got to run a track i would run the data science track or the engineering track at boulder startup week and i would just invite these prominent people to come speak about whatever they were doing and and that to me putting together an event the hospitality associated with that getting 100 people in a room to understand some later late trend in technology making them feel welcome looking them in the eye and shaking their hand as they walked in making sure they had a good time and then hanging out and vibing with them afterwards i think that's a really important skill in web 3. and andrew hyde like if you're out there thank you so much for he's like the yoda to my obi wan when it comes to community building and so i think that's a really important skill for a web 3 entrepreneur or just person to have yeah and then i guess like the meta skill is just like straight up uh like intellectual curiosity probably like or curiosity and just like a desire to and yeah a gender generalized desire to build because i think that's what we find across almost everyone no matter like what domain of crypto they find themselves in is like everyone's really curious everyone likes to learn and everyone likes to build yeah totally and i think that it it it's it's it's almost like a space that through natural selection will weed you out if you don't have those traits because it moves so fast that you're just never going to keep up if you're just punching the clock ends and you're not really intellectually curious about all the things that are that are happening but the way i look at it is it's hard not to be intellectually we're reinventing the internet of finance it's incredible it's an incredibly huge opportunity i mean can you imagine going back to like 1997 when the internet was just getting started and and not trying to learn everything you could and gain every little alpha that you could the opportunity to reinvent how humanity transfers information was just so large and you gotta you really gotta seize that and i see i think the opportunity with blockchains could be that big with web3 and so that that's why i spend a lot of time thinking about about blockchain and and uh god bless my wife because she whenever she wants to go on a double date with someone in the in the other guys like a sports guy i'm like no find me a crypto guy that we can we could vibe with hey guys in the second half of the show we continue the conversation about an increasing rate of change that we are experiencing in ethereum in defy and with the power of open source tools and we also bring up some of the conversations that um bank list listeners might have remembered from our kathy wood episode about how so many different industries are all hitting uh new levels of rate of progress innovation and then i ask and talk to kevin about what happens when we add a git coin type financial innovation financial uh collaboration or capital coordination layer all to all these other industries that aren't just uh about crypto we also bring up conversations like the regenerative finance movement which uh kevin started uh kevin coined in the 2020 food token era as well some other conversations about how and why kevin is bullish on humanity as am i but before we get into that second half of the show we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matra also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.exe bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless we were talking about like increasing the rate of innovation by making like software and tools more accessible and you know applying that to both both crypto and and ethereum and then we have um or you know software outside of crypto and then we're also talking about how like how you just said like if you this industry weeds you out if you aren't like intrinsically interested in it because you're not going to keep up with it and so like and there's also this the idea of like we had like the proof of work fair launch you you know the re the reference of the youth and asia roller coaster to all of these like crypto phenomenons that happen i actually don't can you explain do you know the euthanasia roller coaster no i don't oh gosh okay so it's a roller coaster that with multiple loop-de-loops and it goes up really really really really really high and then it drops you on the first loop to loop and then you do like 17 more loopy loops afterwards and they get tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and because they get tighter and tighter the g-forces that you get kill you because you have too much duty forces for too long it's euthanasia related and so the the phenomenon is like uh it's like a fractals of fractals forks of forks of forks of forks right when we saw the 2013 fair launch phenomenon like it was a for it was like just like the 2020 d5 food token summer which is then just like like the 2021 profile picture nfc avatar movement it's just like something somebody unlocks something and then like the whole entire crypto industry goes on forks of forks or forks or forks or forks until like we just bleed out all the possible energy of that one little phenomenon and so like okay so the point of that was to we were talking about how like this industry weeds people out who aren't like able to keep up then we just recently had the whole loot phenomenon right so like loot launched everyone like had this aha moment and then we had forks off works off works off walks or forks and the thing is one of the reasons here's here's the point i'm trying to get to uh one of the reasons why the space moves so fast is because the space moves as fast as the fastest person in it whoever's moving the fastest and like like for example dom the guy that did the the loot uh the loot thing or robert leschner with compound or like will price and dan elizer and with with yams it's always it's like it's like a there's there's that gif of caterpillars that are are crawling over each other as they go forward so like some caterpillars going on the ground but some caterpillars crawling on top of that so as a unit they are all collectively traveling faster together right and so and so this space moves so fast is because we all maybe maybe a better metaphor is a peloton right like you know 20 cyclists all in the line they're all dragging on each other and then the last person who's taken the most rest then speeds up to the front and sets the new pace and then it takes turns and so each all these developers with all these open source tools are all taking turns going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster it's like that's why a lot of people i think are so inherently like subconsciously bullish on the space is because like the rate of change isn't going slower it's going faster and it's because we have like a open source tools and now open source incentivization to pay for all these games yeah totally and and i think that there's there's even more multiple levels like it's not just caterpillars on caterpillars i think it's caterpillars on caterpillars on caterpillars like you know we're all built if you look if you look at the seven layer stack it's you know all the networking foundation and the chips and all that kind of stuff we just kind of take for granted you know i took computer engineering in in college and i'm not good at low-level programming so thank goodness i don't have to do assembly language stuff but there's there's just so much progress that and we're all standing on the shoulders of giants i think it's really it's really incredible um we we uh get coin in and get coin dow is a fork of uni which is a fork of compound and so i like to think of what we did is like robert lesner sort of pioneered the the delegation system in compound and i think that hayden and uniswap in a lot of ways pioneered or made popular retroactive distributions and then what git coin did was we did a retroactive distribution and we made it so that you had to delegate when you did your claim of your tokens and that was important because a lot of people don't actually even use their governance tokens we wanted 100 of the consent of the governed we wanted 100 of people to delegate to someone in the get coin community when they got their airdrop which is when we had the captive audience and so i'd like to think that we're all sort of standing on the shoulders of giants and pushing the space forward a very little bit on top of that which hopefully enables the next cycle of innovation and you know i would never compare what we did to like what dom did or what yam yam did but uh i think the space is expanding in many different directions at different magnitudes at a time and it's always excited when that when there's that new punctuated equilibrium where you see a new idea in a new light and it enables that cascading bit of innovation yeah it feels like there's always that like slime mold metaphor right like you've seen like slime mold like try and find new food in like sped up terms like it's it's searching in like 50 directions at once then it finds food and all the directions it wasn't searching and are redirected to that new food source and then it goes again again from there it's kind of like the natural way to have like maximize maximize progress yeah you're a big biomimicry guy i'm realizing as we're having this conversation lots of natural metaphors to the web space web three spaces expanding in this new design space oh yeah that's my stick yeah no well a metaphors are like scaffolding for learning and understanding and therefore conversation do you have a metaphor about a metaphor yes i did that's a really good point yes i did yeah um yeah well it also allows for conversation to happen faster and more precisely right like just like oh my god this is great just like how like rather than having to build something for scratch i can just go into the library of your own brain and pull out a metaphor of like a peloton so i don't have to explain as much stuff it's the same thing if it's we can make the conversation move faster yeah yeah that's true i'm a pretty verbose guy so i'm going to take a page out of your book but i also just really like nature i mean i am out in colorado and i have to show colorado really quick just the beautiful sun and uh sunshine and the way the natural ecosystem out here it's it's just it's there's something refreshing to your soul about spending time in nature and so i think it's a source of inspiration on multiple levels to draw from that yeah yeah civilization or like the order imposed by nation states is like hey there's that nature thing but like we're gonna find a way to for you so you don't to have to live in it right like we're gonna give you like asphalt pavement streets and and like lights that light up at night but yeah colorado washington uh the all the like the outdoorsy cities or outdoorsy places is just like it feels like it's just easier to live more harmoniously with nature i actually um so i have to tell you i've been on bankless podcasts maybe four or five times and i think it's at this point that i have to reveal to you all my secret which is that i'm not much of a i'm not much of a cyberpunk um i consider myself to be a little bit more of a solar punk than a cyberpunk and it's because i am just really inspired by the solar punk art and the philosophy of humanity evolving past its contemporary challenges whether that be climate change or misinformation or cancer and all these different things that exist out there and so um the cyberpunk ethos which is like very like anti-nation state and and about the independence of of cyberspace you know i vibe with that on a software engineer level and there are things about it that i appreciate and i think are really interesting but i i would consider myself to be a solar punk more than a cyberpunk and it's because i think we need these we need some sort of web scale coordination and we need to work together as as humanity and as a planet in order to move past these global these global public goods problems that we have one day so i hope i'll still get invited back if i don't identify as much as a cyberpunk well can you define for me and the listeners what a solar punk is because it's the first i've heard of it yeah for sure so um i've actually been tweeting a little bit about solar punk it's an art movement that envisions how the future of humanity would look if we solve major major contemporary challenges like with an emphasis on sustainability stuff like climate change and pollution um and so basically like integration with nature and and and and sustainability for the planet and for for people is kind of the the vibe of the movement but if you google solar punk you will see a lot of really beautiful art that has humanity integrated with the environment that they they are in this is insane yeah okay so this is like that uh that meme about like if society like society if like this was like that right like society if i i can't remember a good one but like there's there's that one society meme society meme template right society if oh i don't know that meme oh yeah that's right society if we have salt if we had solved public goods sure yeah that's exactly right that's exactly that's exactly what i'm going for but yeah um okay yeah i will as a guy who like plants who likes plants and architecture this is uh exactly what my vibe i just i just solar punk pilled you david yeah i forgot how much of a plant guy you are i can't believe we haven't talked about this yeah i know this is really cool this is exactly what i want society to look like did that website just call it hope punk oh i did not uh which one's pretty this one that's pretty funny i'm not sure it's what you just clicked through i think that that's a funny name i think it was this one but yeah i did wow that's great hope punk yeah it's harder so you know like i'm a little bit of a hippie i'll just always come out and say it and so you know i do think that there are there are places yeah well um and and i think there are times in which the nation state there are people in the nation state that are genuinely trying to solve global coordination failures or nationwide coordination failures and it's just such a shame that there are other people that are used trying to use the nation state to oppress people and to corrupt people and to basically milk the system for government contracts and feed them to their their friends and cronies and so you know like wouldn't it be great if there was a transparent immutable programmable incorruptible basis for finance and for governance that we could actually trust its ability to coordinate because we could expect inspect the code like the solution is not less coordination it's coordination on a more solid foundation so we can solve these contemporary problems and and that's not always against nation states but sometimes and maybe many times it is sure yeah i would summarize like the biggest the big problems of the nation state is like it's fantastic coordination infrastructure and it's because it's fantastic coordination infrastructure uh the entity that is most likely to leverage that fact is going to leverage it for personal profit or for oppression or power or control and then that drowns out the people that want to leverage that the coordinating power of the nation state for public goods yeah well i'd say that like you know it's good coordination infrastructure if you're someone who's well connected and can pull the levers but if you're someone who's poor then there's an information asymmetry because it's not transparent there's no open source code that you can that you can um take a look at so there's an information asymmetry that comes out of that and then there's also just like it's not incorruptable so basically um you know and this is the problem with like web 2 companies right so like travis i forget his last name the uber ceo basically can go into a city can give all of the drivers really great wages and give all the consumers discount to attract them and then they had a network effect where every new driver that joins the uber network makes it better for every rider and every rider makes it better for every driver and the cycle just circles itself that's called network effects and then they get inevitable and they stop trying to attract the drivers and the riders and they start extracting from them so that they can they can pull more profits out of the system so that's a corruptable system and what's great about web3 is that we can build incorruptable systems where like if kevin owaki turns evil one day then gitcoin can still be fulfilling its mission because well we're still working on decentralizing but you know eventually we'll be on this like decentralized immutable sort of substrate for our coordination and so you won't have to rely it's it's it's can't be evil instead of don't be evil and i think that's a that's a huge part of it so with uh earlier i asked you like uh what's the maximally successful version of the world where like open source software is funded in uncorruptable ways and all the good thing that happens what's the thing that keeps you up at night that's like nightmare fuel for like why that will never happen um i'm pretty well running a startup is what does elon musk say it's like chewing glass and staring into the abyss eventually you stopped you never stop staring but eventually the chewing doesn't hurt so much um i'm butchering that quote but that's how i kind of feel about about running something as big and ambitious as bitcoin but um the thing that keeps me up at the end of the day is like even if i do a really great job running get coin then i don't know where the regulatory regime in the united states is going to land and there's so much gray area that it it really really keeps me up at night and so i i don't know where we're gonna land on that but i hope that that wall street and washington see that defy and crypto is something to embrace instead of trying to fight the future so that's something that keeps me up at night and and i really want to be a part of changing the story about what crypto is i think that people see these stories about volatility and they see about about gambling and i don't think that they realize that we could solve our web scale coordination problems with with crypto because it's such a more solid foundation for that and i have some i have a couple aces up my sleeve about telling that story to the general public that we may we may see in the next couple years but uh i think public opinion about crypto and telling them about public goods and coordination is is a role that i would hopefully like to see bitcoin play in the long term hopefully but leading by example yeah it's weird that like everyone in crypto who everyone who's in crypto is like buy a proxy cryptos marketing division like crypto bitcoin ethereum they don't have marketing divisions they have people like you know anthony at the daily gray or bank list or like what bitcoin did that's and or all of the like individual zealots like like you who just say hey there's this ethereum thing it's really cool and like it's weird that like everyone in crypto is like yeah this crypto thing is dope uh and then everyone like and yet somehow the narrative is like it's for drugs and criminals uh you're gonna lose all your money like crypto has the simultaneous brand of like it's going to make you rich and it's going to make you broke except one is always true and one is like well yeah you you aped into like something stupid and you got all you got an exploit right like and so like we haven't been able to like control our own narrative our the narrative of what crypto is still comes from the outside in and like that that is my concern that i have yeah i mean you know i was i remember when i was in the 90s and like the joke was always that the internet was just for porn you know and so and and people who were who were spinning that narrative were either in transgenderists or they were just they were just ignorant about what the internet had to offer and eventually you don't hear people say that anymore and so i think that it's inevitable that we'll move past those type of narratives but it it certainly is there it is misinformed and and i don't know how how to really bridge that gap because well i'm a computer scientist not a not a communications and marketing person but i hope that someone figures it out i'm i'm really thankful for the work that that coin center is doing in helping inform our lawmakers about crypto and you know that's a public good for all of crypto lobbying the the government totally yeah uh not not to say too much more on the nightmare fuel thing but like the internet didn't have the problem of like invading the world of finance and like the banking system like there's no there's no more entrenched player than like the banking system right it's like oh the internet's just for porn and then yeah all dudes in the world are like oh really nice but then yeah that was a joke um but then like it's different when like crypto comes along and it's like crypto all it's good for is like you know disrupting wall street and banks and all the you know the money of the world's like uh oh yeah i don't like that and so that is a different history rhymes doesn't it doesn't exactly repeat and that is a big difference yeah yeah i don't know maybe it'd say like try to take yourself back 30 years um i don't actually know if you could do that david no i couldn't because i'm an elder millennial but um like newspapers were the way people got their information and so it was not even cable news back then and so you had a lot of entrenched interests that were forming public opinion back then to maybe on a slower slower speed and scale but the world doesn't changed a lot in 30 years and i think a lot of technology is inevitable and so you fight it at your own at your own peril i'm remembering the record industry of america suing all of its customers because its business model was being eroded as a counter example of what to do and they caused a lot of pain to a lot of people in the short term but in the long term they they certainly lost out sure sure kevin can you rate ethereum over the last this is going to be a terribly imprecise question rate ethereum over the la over its lifetime over his last six years i say how well it could have made moloch retreat versus how well it actually did that yeah should we explain to your listeners what molok is before we answer that question sure you want me to you want you want to go uh we could vibe back and forth why don't you start though okay moloch is the god of coordination failure but he's basically the simple example as to why humans can't have nice things and the reason why humans can't have nice things it's because we do it to ourselves because the more more a bunch of people all agree that we're going to do something that is beneficial for all of us the more it rewards a single defector to go against that that alignment right and then as soon as one person says like well i'm gonna let all the other people agree and not do the thing that harms us collectively but instead instead benefits the individual i'm just gonna be the only individual that does that thing and then somebody sees him do that or her do that and they're like well they're doing it so i'm going to do it and then that just repeats until we're all back at the same state that we started on so it's basically why we can't have agreement and alignment towards working towards systems or things or outcomes that we would all want such as climate change yeah yeah i mean i think like the example i think of when i think of moloch is cancer so basically you've got a bunch of cells that are harmoniously working for the whole in your body and one of them decides to defect instead of coordinate with all the other cells it starts becoming cancerous and that just basically means that it's consuming resources and it's it's reproducing itself more than the others and it eventually chokes off resources to the cells that are coordinating and that's why cancer is is so nefarious is that is is is is sort of the resource consumption game and the misaligned incentives associated with that and so there's like a holistic body and then all these cells are aligned and working towards a common goal and then one cell is like  you guys i'm gonna i'm gonna reprioritize for myself and i'm gonna get myself as large as possible and propagate only myself yeah for sure and you know it's possible to like make this into a moral thing and like on some level it is but like i don't know i i i flew an airplane to eat cc and like hung out with you so you know i was polluting the environment by doing that and so you know that i i'm someone who buys carbon credits and i think that that's an important thing to do is just try to stay as carbon neutral as possible but i think that you know it's it's really hard on a global scale to get people to to remedy their um their their sort of like defections from the whole and and one of the things that's really powerful about ethereum is that you can you have transparency at the base layer you've got a mutability at the base layer and a lot of people are really excited about the idea that we can build better coordination systems identify defectors sooner and just build less externalities into the financial system which will help slay molok uh miyu amin solemani and ryan did a podcast called slaying moloch which you all should check out on bank list if you want to know more background on the on the question but yes so what was the question how good has ethereum been at slaying bollocks so far yeah like basically how on a scale of zero as in we didn't do anything in 10 is and we did all of the things that we could have done and we could have like been very proud about what we did where do we fall on that spectrum um i think that the much of the molex slaying energy of the ethereum network blockchainer at large is in the form of potential energy thus far and not kinetic energy which is a little little physics reference there which is saying it's like the spring is coiled and it could it could happen but only if we choose to because all coordination is a choice i am really encouraged to see lots of people in the ethereum space support public goods on git coins support open source software and we've got something like 10 million dollars in the get coin treasury for public goods and 50 million dollars if you think that akita coins have have value which is like a whole nother thing but um i'm i'm really encouraged that people want to give back to the the ethereum public goods we've got multiple epns is an example ethereum push notification service they started off in get coin kernel they raised money with a git coin grant and then they raised vc money several months later and now they're giving back to get coins matching pool so like full cycle of like the virtuous cycle of ethereum have they given back more than they've than they uh had donated i think they have i don't know the exact number but i think they have um and so so like this is actually the meme that came out of you know speaking of the uh of the infinite caterpillar or whatever you said like when yam finance launched and and this whole d-gen wave started happening with vegetable farming i started uh memeing with a couple other people about about how djen was a thing and now we need to make regen a thing so what if we had regen finance a financial system that sort of gets better over time and i'm really happy to say that we're seeing multiple projects uh coordinate clr fund optimism bitcoin doing good regen network there's just a bunch of people under the radar that are working on regen stuff and and are like legit builders that are doing it and so i'm really excited for you know we we had icos and then we had dowels and then we had nfts and like we'll probably have web 3 social networks and then we'll have dowels again and then we'll have nfts again but like when we get to the level where people are aping into public goods that is that is when we've met the full potential um so i don't know if i answered your question but i think most of the potential is ahead of us well the the point of the question was to trigger an argument or trigger a conversation i didn't really care about a number or anything so yes you did um but like i i also want you to open up and explain uh regen uh regen finance a little bit more because um uh yeah it just go into further details as to what that actually is yeah totally so basically i mean it's just a meme and you know a lot of memeing is trying to take what's in the zeitgeist and to repurpose it for something that you can just you can just vibe on but um i guess like the best way that i can explain it is through this idea that i learned from yancey strickler he's the founder of kickstarter and i'm going to share my screen real quick and just show you what i'm talking about there's this thing called um basically bentoism and the idea is that instead of just making decisions that are good for you now instant gratification um what if we extended those incentives into a bento box of incentives uh and the first axis is self-interest to others interest so basically what if we made decisions that instead were just good uh instead of just being good for now me are good for now us so like making decisions that are good for me and you david and ethereum at r writ large and then extending that out to the world itself and then the other axis is time so what if we created more anti-fragility by instead of having our incentives be about now me but also being future me three months from now me three years from now me all right i'm gonna take a drag of a cigarette because it might give me a little buzz for the next 10 minutes but what does that do for future me and for for future us and so to me dj and finance is just thinking about instant gratification and only thinking about yourself and then regen finance is building a bento box financial system that rewards people with a long-term time horizon and rewards them for coordinating with each other and that's what i hope that with the transparent immutable programmable system that we that we evolve past the decentralized casino stage like that's just the boot loader and then we eventually build a regenerative finance system that doesn't externalize that that uh has a long-term time horizon so when i heard you explain to me regen finance i got uh an image of like people aping into like defy apps right this was they came around during like the the food farm fork mania right uh and then part of the social contract of a lot of those like new d5 food app farms whatevers was to actually repurpose money back into bitcoin right like we would commit x amount of money towards funds right and and this is like part of like the the inevitable ways that you know ethereum can like slay moloch right like by if we can keep on funding a ourselves and then only actually allow for funding to go into places that fund of their public goods we can repurpose the energy uh the energy of like to ape and like have that to uh to ape into like good things right and this is like one of those the fundamental shifts that ethereum we all hope brings to the world is like you can act in your self-interest and by definition you are acting in this in the uh self-interest of everyone else and their future selves in moving into the forward and and committing to that as well yeah for sure um it's been really promising to see that and i'm super thankful to andre from urine finance for starting that wave i remember there was a couple vegetable forks that were going to do it and their community really revolted when they were they're like you know we're not giving that two percent to public goods and then andre from urine did it and all of a sudden it was the cool thing to do and so um you know it's it's been a thing that's ebbed and flowed in the in the ecosystem and i'm lucky to say right now we have eight bitcoin grants rounds future funded so in if the market turns bare then we want to be the pilot light that keeps the mark the the ecosystem alive through the next market cycle and couldn't have done it without the community supporting that yeah yeah yeah so somehow there's a connection here to going back to what we were saying about like the accelerating rate of uh innovation and progress right like if we can if we have this flywheel going where like we can allow for products to get funding and then they would probably become profitable and then those products send money back to get coin to find more projects and then all of a sudden like with this flywheel turns and turns and turns boom we have like a self-sustaining uh eco economy with self-sustaining funding for developers to build more of the tools we just came out of the podcast with uh kathy wood uh we're recording this on on the monday with that where that kathy wood episode dropped if you didn't listen to it the gist of it is that like there are so many different technologies hitting their like uh their peaks of their s curve of adoption all right we got ai crypto like gene editing like energy storage uh i'm missing one but like all of these things are hitting their biggest points of like progress and innovation their speediest points all at the same time and like these things can all interact with each other right and so it's it's compounding progress upon compounding progress and it's kind of like why it may i'm like with kathy wood in the sense that like the future is like there's so much left to be built like we don't have autonomous cars yet but it is still so close there's so many things that are so futuristic that we don't have at all today and it's only a few years away yeah yeah it's really it's really pretty incredible um i was worried for a second you were gonna bring up the metaverse and then i was gonna freeze because i don't know what that is but i i think that um you know the crazy thing is that it's only gonna be obvious in retrospect you can't predict right like you can use first principles and try to think into the future a little bit and you can create allegories but like who would have predicted google in 1990 like the idea of a search engine that could search all of the world's information back then was totally foreign and this this sort of point in which we're going to pass where ai and virtual reality and blockchain and gene editing and all this stuff goes forward is i i just think that we're going to look back in 2050 and say oh my gosh they didn't know what they had coming in 2021 because it's it's accelerating exponentially rate of change yeah and like not only are all these things uh having they're going through like their own like massive acceleration of innovation but like think about all the different surface areas behind all these technologies right like combine crypto and ai combine ai and energy storage create like compute an incentivization layer which is crypto behind all of these technologies they're like one of the reasons i'm i'm cautiously optimistic but really really bullish and optimistic about the future is that like not only are each of these industries like their own like massive like job engine growth economic engine growth like sectors like the intersections of all of these things also generate their own permutations of possible things to build or teams to fund or innovation to be had um and i think if git coin can play its card cards right it can have play the role of um helping facilitate and capitally coordinate capital coordinate to help all of these intersections and all of these industries be built out yeah i mean i hope so um i i probably should post a few weeks ago about what getcoin could be one day and i and i think that you know one of the one of the sort of possible eventualities i i call uh the epcot of the metaverse um which is like epcot stands for experimental community of tomorrow and you know when i hear of it as a us citizen in 2020 i think of epcot which is the disney one which was built in the 50s in their vision of tomorrow but if you think about experimental community of tomorrow as of 2021 if you get a bunch of builders and a bunch of capital and you put them all together then hopefully you get prototypes of what the future will be and there's like and i want to bring this back to layer zero um and because i do think that a world in which that is all being done for the public good is much different from one in which it's just the ultra rich that have access to those technologies and and this is kind of like the ultimate vision of git coin is is to create middle class jobs for software engineers by giving them access to bleeding edge technologies and opportunities at that but also having the whole system be governed by the people that it serves so it's not just this extractive thing that that the that like only silicon valley or wall street can can really get the the gains of and so hopefully for right we'll create this virtuous cycle in which we're helping builders find all of these technologies advance their career advance the planet create a more solar pump future and and like you name this podcast perfectly it's layer zero it's all it's about the people um it's about the everyday people not just the rich people and um and i think that that's it's just like it the future could be so beautiful but we have to coordinate towards that and i think that that's what keeps me up and gets me working on ethereum every day and keeps me working on get coin through through all the chewing glass and and staring into the abyss is that we can really create a better future with this technology but we have to choose to do it we have to coordinate in order to do it and kevin i think
