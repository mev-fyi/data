how will the metaverse enable people and is it a good thing that we are also depriving people's uh a way to escape when so many sectors of the gaming industry is like kind of optimizing for escapism when i think about enablement so much of this is first imagining and understanding these worlds as being proactive places that people people are building we've already gone in the direction of people being able to realize the vision for themselves and their lives inside of these worlds and that's very very different if you think about the history of gaming even 2030 40 years ago gaming was already far more lean forward than you know television before it and movies before it but even in the last few years the progression we've made towards gaming not just being leaning forward and interactive but actually a place where you impose your will and your creativity into a world for others on a permanent basis
