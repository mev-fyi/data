we really see like private debt all moving on change over the next five to ten years welcome bankless nation to this edition of meet the nation it's been a while since i've done amita nation and so for those that have not seen that meet the nation before this is where i pull in a project and introduce them to the bankless nation what is the 101 the tldr the the high level overview of what this project is and today we're talking with blake and michael from goldfinch protocol goldfinch is all about under collateralized loans uh defy as we know is really really good at over collateralized loans uh but kind of the whole point about a loan is to borrow money because you don't have money but you want money and so it's actually over collateralized loans are kind of like the weird this weird thing that is for some reason really really common in defy it's under collateralized loans that is really just the loans that we know of today and goldfinch is developing the system to help businesses uh access capital when they don't already have capital uh which you know kind of crazy right and like weird how that works uh and so they have this very interesting kind of like uh organically balancing mechanism using really just you know basic primitives in defy along with just traditional business development and outreach and they have definitely penetrated pretty well into emerging markets um michael tells a number of stories about you know success stories about how goldfinch was able to put capital in the places of the world that wouldn't previously had access to capital so this is the conversation of banking the unbanked or providing money to businesses that are definitely credit worthy businesses but just by proxy of where they live in the world they just don't have access to finance now that we have defy spanning the whole entire globe we have systems like goldfinch that can put capital in corners of the world that definitely need it and deserve it but otherwise wouldn't have gotten it so i really enjoyed this conversation we're going to go and dive right into all about goldfinch and what it is and how you can participate and get higher yields than you otherwise would have if you cho choose to go into the goldfinch protocol and so if you are doing your due diligence definitely start with this episode and then learn more at their website or in their discord the links should be in the show notes so without any further ado other than this one let's go ahead and get right into all the conversations about goldfinch right after we talk about

thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys i'm here with michael and blake of goldfinch michael and blake welcome to the show how's it going dude thanks so much for having us yeah uh so uh first off how did you guys meet since you guys are both co-founders and then how did the inspiration for goldfinch come about yeah so mike and i actually have known each other for a really long time like almost 17 years at this point uh we met as we were randomly paired together as freshman year roommates in college and since then we've worked on just like a bunch of various kind of side projects and stuff together everything from a music collaboration website to machine learning models to protect tennis matches to a new music notation system and and you know we also both worked in coinbase for a while together and then goldfinch and i think the thing that really inspired goldfinch is like one of the things that brought us to coinbase originally was just being super excited about what we feel like crypto can do in the world around expanding access to capital and empowering financial inclusion and i know those are kind of like buzzwords in the crypto space but we really believe it and we loved uh coinbase's mission of an open financial system and then while we were there we were feeling like a lot of the sort of infrastructural pieces had fallen into place and feeling almost antsy with the industry that like we could be we could be moving further and like doing things like help people and getting like the true sort of promise of crypto of changing financial systems as they are today i wanted to make that happen so that was sort of the thing that really drove us to start goldfinch which is to be this bridge between all of the capital that is like sitting in crypto looking to be put to work with borrowers out in the world who have been traditionally underserved but are looking to grow their businesses and actually can like use that capital and michael talk a little bit about the infrastructure pieces that you saw falling into place that was really allowed you to perhaps see something greater than what was being built what were the things that were the flags so you're like ooh look at all these dots that i could love to connect tell me tell me about that yeah there were like three big ones the first was that the there was so much more capital in crypto looking to earn yield so i remember when we were at coinbase what was that coinbase was launching it was like staking one of the staking problems also usdc uh so yield uh i actually worked on that team at coinvest when we were there yeah and i remember when it launched and just like how many people were like all about the like this was before compound launched comp token and like like the whole yield farming thing took off in 2020 and just seeing how many people were using the staking product just realizing oh there's like a lot of sort of pent up demand for earning yield just by seeing how many people were using that um the second big piece is we needed staple coins to exist and so ustc and and tether i mean we used usdc with goldfinch but it was just starting to get to a critical amount of like actual capital and stable coins that we could use with borrowers who aren't sort of crypto native because a company in nigeria or indonesia like they're not going to take an ethereum denominated loan they but they do take loans in usd terms today so we needed stable coins to be able to like have this whole thing work and then the third piece was exchanges expanding around the world so that made it easier for for these businesses to receive usdc and then exchange it for the local currency so like one example is binance had launched in the beginning of 2020 which now in in nigeria specifically which then allowed us to work with our first customer quick check in nigeria and they that like that was what enabled them to actually use crypto so we needed these exchanges to be popping up in all of these markets around the world we needed staple coins and we needed all the like yield uh like field desire among existing capital and crypto and so how did all these moving parts come to become the vision behind goldfinch and at this point we should just dive right into what goldfinch actually is so what what is goldfinch and how do all these moving parts uh come to be inside of it yeah so i think yeah we can kind of get to both of those questions at once so like you know if you look at a lot of the the yield products that were in uh crypto at the time and still you know really the most popular ones it's all this over collateralized lending protocols things like compound and ave right and they've seen a bunch of success but they serve a actually a fairly narrow use case right you should are either you know using as kind of margin trading account or you're looking to take out some gains on highly appreciated assets while still maintaining some exposure right to the upside of the asset which is great and that works to the tune of billions of dollars for those for those protocols and we were like okay so that's over collateralized but most people in the world when they want to take out a loan it's because they don't already have the money so we wanted to figure out how we could build a system that was under collateralized and so that's that's really the heart of goldfinch is building this under collateralized lending protocol on ethereum and initially we you know we were told by people well who's going to be the borrower side right who's actually going to be borrowing that um could it be individuals well we're like probably not like the gas costs are like too high and it's really hard to underwrite individuals and then we thought maybe it's like miners or other traders or something like that but you know we talked with a lot of those entities and none of them really felt like they were the right fit or really had the the serious borrow demands and then uh you know i've had kind of like a long-standing interest in microfinance and realized you know we should be reaching out to companies who have not been served as well in the financial system and so we started reaching out to a lot of fintech companies we talked to dozens of these companies before starting goldfinch to get a feel for like is there a real customer here is there real demand and after talking to them we heard the same story kind of over and over again which is that like there's just not enough capital going into these markets and despite the fact that there's a lot of great businesses here people have years of track records lending out money and they're able to generate really you know pretty sizable returns on that capital and uh they're willing to try something new because they spend like half their time trying to raise capital for these businesses so they're willing to do weird things like use metamask and and they're like crypto like sure whatever like i need this to grow my business this is really important to me and so once we had those conversations uh we felt like okay now we have we know there's both sides of the market here and we felt confident to like really go start start goldfinch so let's unpack the over collateralization verse under collateralization just to make sure we nail down for the listeners the the nuances here uh crypto as it is today is really really good at over collateralized loans and that's because of the nature of an anonymous like ethereum address right like an ethereum address doesn't know your identity doesn't know who you are therefore if you want a loan like how do you ensure to the protocol that you're going to repay that loan you ensure that you're going to repay that loan by over collateralization which is what you guys are kind of saying is like well that's kind of like antithetical to the whole concept of like a loan because most people that need loans don't already have the money that's kind of the whole point so then we get into the topic of under collateralized loans but that gets really really hard in d5 because we don't have identity and identity is key for how we get loans from the bank and tradfy right like if you don't repay they can take you to court and they will take you to court but there is no defy court there is no ethereum court like that's kind of the whole thing we're trying to get away from so how have you guys solved this identity issue is is are you guys like a kyc platformer like how do you go about feeling secure and giving out loans in an undercollateralized fashion how do you solve that problem yeah there are two aspects so you brought up the identity part and the answer is like yes we do have a we do have kyc in it and what we build to make goldfinch work is what we call unique identity which is an nft we call it uid the nft and that is like uh when someone goes into kyc we create this nft that's non-transferable that says you've been ky seed and so then it's known that this represents your identity it's nft that any protocol including goldfinch can use to know that this person has been kyc and is and is unique so that solves the like uniqueness aspect and then there's the second aspect which is how do you ensure that a borrower is going to repay their loan uh when they aren't already providing this other form of collateral which is crypto collateral and the answer is uh to do the to figure out a borrower's credit worthiness in a different means and have different a different kind of collateral so the way it works on goldfinch is there are a community of folks and we call them the backers and the backers talk to the borrower like uh off chain look at data rooms do due diligence get into like amas and ask them questions and are working with them directly and then when they supply capital they also enter into loan agreements directly with that borrower and so we call this um instead of doing like crypto collateral the sort of collateral comes to what we call a trust through consensus which is the consensus of the backers who all agree a particular borrower is credit worthy and they provide capital and it's higher risk because the capital the backers provide goes into the junior tranche which is first loss and then they also enter into loan agreements with that borrower so they have legal recourse as well off-chain and so the creditworthiness comes from in the like the collateral is from that borrower's like off-chain assets and their off-chain activities and that whole loan agreement that exists and so we're kind of shifting the way creditworthiness is determined from just capital literally sitting on chain to the consensus of a group of backers who are all agreeing this particular borrower is good yeah i might add one analogy that some of the listeners might be familiar with which is how nexus mutual works right where uh there are these protocols who are looking for insurance right and you have a community of people who through whatever means necessary uh decide that this protocol is trustworthy and they stake their nxm token on it to lower the price of buying insurance on that protocol it's a you know somewhat analogous mechanism to the backers to deciding to whatever opt-in mechanism they want i'm willing to put capital into this particular borrower and by putting their own capital up you know they're taking real risk and so the protocol isn't able to trust them and it allocates additional capital from this senior pool which we haven't gotten too much into but we can get into that as well so it sounds like this is really like a hybrid tradify defy approach where like you guys haven't really solved the whole like identity thing uh in which uh is arguably like not really solvable if you want to do under collateralized loans you can you kind of have to bring in some sort of like external identity in order to really have the full backstop but you are using ethereum and d5 for capital allocation capital efficiency like easy seamless movement of funds as well as the ability to collect a lot of people to make some sort of group wisdom of the cr of the crowds type of uh market analysis so would you say that's a fair uh representation i would well i would i would say yeah versus i think it is like a bridge we're trying to bridge what's happening on crypto with things that are happening off-chain in this like real world activity but take for example the uid nft we created where it's like we are like there's a service that is guaranteeing someone has been kyc i view that as pretty uh analogous to say usdc where like the the consortium there is is saying yes there's a dollar sitting in a bank account for every usdc token that exists we're saying yes there's been kyc for every one of these uidnfts that exist and so then it'd be like um like in terms of solving identity it's not like it's not like the die of identity it's not like a fully entirely crypto native version of it but i think like a version of this where it's this bridge and it's still like proving that off-chain there's like proof that that person's been kyc can still be like fully sort of composable within the device space and i view that as like one of potentially like a number of different solutions that will show up i would also i mean i separate i think the identity pieces mike's point out is is totally correct in terms of the like uh the sort of lending piece right that that component because the identity like we could swap it out with any provider we want we could stop that with the decentralized id provider in the future and the protocol has been built followed that way identity is just sort of like a it's a function that's necessary but it's not core to how the lending takes place but i think to some of your earlier points from the lending perspective like yeah we're using d5 for the things that we think d5 is truly really good at which is capital allocation anywhere in the world the ability to be composable with other financial products in a permissionless way uh the global nature of it like all that stuff is is just better than the traditional finance space which is why we really see like private debt all moving on chain over the next five to ten years because of these features things like access and liquidity that are just like these are the two big things you think d5 does like so well like anyone in the world is able to participate in these deals um in a way that just would have been really hard before and then beyond that like d5 makes it so easy to create liquidity on the positions that our backers take into these these deals so like you know a kind of an analogy it's sort of what we're doing is a private credit fund in the traditional finance space um those are usually maybe like a qualified investor or an investor again and it's very tough um and then also if once you put your money in you're probably not going to see it for three five seven years and there's really no good way to even sell your position because it's all on paper no one even knows where that money is really going um but with goldfinch all that stuff is on chain all the loans are on chain the repayments are all happening on chain you know which pool your token is a representation of and it's really easy to permissionlessly create secondary markets for those tokens which allow people to get liquidity on them and this should all like reduce the cost of capital we think that's just going to be part of like a big sink uh this is like you know to go with your ethereum think sync thesis i think this is why capital is just going to be like flowing into ethereum and like why do you think private credit is going to move on there and you're going to want a marketplace to organize all that activity but like i don't think that d5 like sort of fundamentally makes it easier to underwrite these deals or assess creditworthiness um until all that information starts moving on chain and i think it's just going to be a little while so you do you guys uh you guys do you have to take kyc information to be compliant from a regulation perspective for you for goldfinch as in like in order to check marks all the compliance boxes you guys have to take kyc information or do you take kyc information just because like that's really just the base building block that you need in order to establish some sort of identity like are you required to take kyc so i yeah i've got us over here like goldfinch the protocol from the borrowers who are companies right so like our borrowers are our companies they have their own compliance requirements and like they need to have some notion of kyc to know they're not taking anonymous capital because you know that's a global thing that's not just an american thing right and the anti-terrorism finance thing is very real it has a lot of stringent consequences so they need that from a compliance standpoint the goal is the protocol just needs some sort of civil resistance right because we use this notion of trust through consensus and that that requires some form of id that's hard to replicate and so kyc sort of ended up serving kind of both purposes there but i just kind of want to underscore that it's really the the borrowers who need the kyc and also i think that the kyc actually is really helpful for truly making this decentralized like we want you know goldfinch as a as a company to really be stepping out as much as possible right we don't want to be involved we want this to be direct between the backers and our borrowers who are coming to the to the protocol and the fact that there's koac is what enables that for the borrowers to remain compliant and allows them to sign deals directly with the borrowers rather than like you know we're not signing any deals here we're not like part of these legal agreements or anything like that whereas i know that the other other real world asset protocols sometimes they get like the company sort of acts as a centralized entity which that's what's taking the risk off of the borrowers um even if the protocol is open up to all interesting okay and then you you talk about the uh the nft token that represents a like that uh a signature that this person or this individual has been kyc'd um from my limited experience of working at a previous company that had to do stuff like this like even if a third-party company was able to attest to some uh ethereum address that this one particular ethereum address was indeed positively kyc'd as like a united states individual compliantly we wouldn't actually be able to trust that without doing the kyc ourselves so does that token actually work as an endpoint for other third parties to trust as kyc information yeah it depends on the type of entity so the main reason we want to do is because a lot of these entities around the world they just need to have assurance that they're not like taking a terrorist money or helping in money laundering of these forms and so there there's like the folks who don't need kyc whatsoever and they're happy to like use defy today then there's like another layer of folks who just like need that assurance for their own local jurisdictions and they can get comfortable with the nft that exists then then you could go to probably an extreme of like like highly regulated institutions in the us who feel most comfortable if they're doing their own kyc and then probably there would need to be some evolution of how this kyc nft works on crypto to serve that but i think it's helpful to think about it in terms of a spectrum from like doing every single kyc yourself to not requiring any kyc at all and this nfc at least got us like past the hurdle of a large group of new kinds of funds and companies around the world where that was enough to check the box off for them to use it and then i think this will certainly be a space that evolves over time and probably there will be always some folks who want to do their own kyc directly on the individual every time and then like we have ideas of ways to to solve that eventually but yeah it's not it's not like solving that particular type of customer right now slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that combines the performance and ease of a

bankless right and and then also just to reiterate it sounds like uh goldfinch is like kyc system agnostic and it's in like any sort of kyc system can come into d5 that has some sort of like adoption and standards around and maybe the industry like uh just somehow organizes around that one and that's the one that goldfinch just plugs into just because that's what the ones that are using right like you guys aren't building your own standards you guys are just setting like the minimum viable kyc standard and like letting the participants kind of take it from there yeah yeah exactly i mean like ideally we wouldn't have had to build the kyc thing in the first place but there was just nothing that was going to solve the customer's needs so we built this and and we hope that is useful for other protocols as well like we think it has you know some really cool sort of capabilities that it enables um but also if there's some other kind of uh like kyc solution i i would suspect the goldfinch community would like switch over to that cool all right that's enough kyc talk i hate kyc let's get into like the the d5 lending lending stuff okay so i would imagine that the incentive for lending out money using goldfinch versus just lending it into compound is that you can get higher rates on goldfinch if we're going to if we're going to have some sort of under collateralized loan then there's probably a little bit more risk there than a collateralized loan and so therefore you could get more yield by lending it to goldfinch than you could to compound am i on the right track here yep that's right and there's two benefits so one is the yields are are higher so the the interest rates of the loans to these borrowers are the market rates in these in these areas which tend to range from 10 to 15 percent and then take the senior pool which is the aggregated kind of like passive pool the that pool there's fees that go to the protocol and then there's a portion of interest that is reallocated to the backers so the senior pool sees 70 net of the actual interest rate so if the interest rate is 10 the senior pool is seeing 7 so even on the low end the rates are really compelling this is all directly on usdc and then there's additional kind of g5 distributions on top as rewards so that's one one compelling part of it is the yields are higher the second compelling part is like these yields are coming from businesses selling selling products around the world and that have nothing to do with crypto it's like motorcycle taxi companies in kenya and small businesses in brazil and like cook stove uh sales in india and so i take right now when potentially the crypto markets are fluctuating a ton like these yields that are coming from these borrowers are just steady they're not driven by crypto activity and so the second benefit in addition to the higher yield for for the additional risk you take there is that these yields are are steady and completely uncorrelated with the crypto space neat neat okay so we're starting to build like actual real world anchors with our demand for lending and and it's also international too yes we're in 18 different countries right now already that's really cool that's really cool um why is that uh intentional or is that just because that's where the demand is yeah it was uh you know really two things one uh as you said they have a big pain point there's not a lot of capital going there and so they're willing to use crypto off the bat right um and so that there's just like a ton of demand a ton of pain point there uh as michael saying also they have compelling yields there which is great place to start for crypto and third also helps uh achieve sort of the mission that we have as a company just expanding access to capital and building financial inclusion through crypto i would add the fact that it's like in 18 countries like we didn't focus just on nigeria or like just on indonesia to start was also intentional because we think it's stronger to be diversified geographically from the very beginning very cool that's really really cool uh do you guys have any like uh like success stories or any stories that you liked from like the consumer standpoint of like people that got funding from goldfinch that otherwise wouldn't have uh i could give examples of three pretty cool borrowers who are using goldfinch one there's this company called togende they're based in uganda and they're ramping up their operations in kenya and what they do is they provide loans to people who want to do motorcycle taxis in kenya so this is like the uber uh of kenya there and these these folks need a loan and they do rent to own to buy the motorcycle i think it's like a two thousand dollar loan and they pay it off over a couple years and so uh tagente has borrowed a significant amount from goldfinch to ramp up their operations in kenya and they've been around for years and years and they have i think tens of thousands they have yeah they have tens of thousands of customers but mostly in uganda so this is helping them like really ramp things up in kenya another example is so like the the the version the vis vision that people should have is a bunch of people buzzing around on their motorcycles uh and there's a lot more transportation going on there's a lot cheaper transportation going on because there's just a lot more supply of motorcycles because of the capital that was able to come out of goldfinch yeah and and these these folks that uh i think they use the term like they're entrepreneurs like who are getting a motorcycle and they're doing like this is how they're earning their income so not only is it making the transportation cheaper but it's folks who are earning a living now right uh by being like taxi drivers on motorcycles through the help of all the capital coming from crypto basically to help them borrow that money which is which is pretty cool to see like capital coming all the way from disparate parts of crypto into the hands of someone in kenya who's able to get a taxi motorcycle uh which is which is a really cool thing uh another example is a company called divi bank and they're in brazil and what they do is they provide working capital loans to small businesses in brazil and so these are these are a bunch of companies throughout brazil who just need you know short-term loans to be able to uh meet their working capital needs and now like divi bank has built up a great business doing this and they've taken capital from goldfinch to then provide to these these businesses and then a third really cool example is a company called greenway they're in india they have these these eco-friendly cook stoves that are like they um yeah they're they're like eco-friendly and they they provide them to low-income households throughout india and then the way the company makes money is through the carbon credits they are profitable from that and so what the loan from goldfinch is doing is allowing them to get more of these cook stoves and provide them to low-income households throughout india and so this is another example of like something completely separate kind of from crypto but um they would have struggled to get that capital without this kind of alone and why would they have struggled to get that capital it's just like the options to get like micro loans or short-term loans just like not available is this is this like a story of crypto coming in like providing financial services to parts of the world that it just doesn't exist in so i would say it's uh we should also be clear that goldfish doesn't provide like micro loans to these individuals at the bottom they're writing loans to the company the company then provides loans to smaller individuals and businesses and stuff like that and so i mean that is important from a risk standpoint all like the expected defaults from those individuals are all kind of rolled up into the rate that people should get so the default rate on goldman's right now is actually zero percent it has been for over a year that we've been in operation that's cool and um yeah so it's really like there's a lot of these businesses fall into a gap that is just not well served within the traditional financial space so uh in a lot of these developing markets they don't have capital markets that are as deep as they are in europe and america and so there's just not as much money there so if the businesses wanted to raise you know less than say like 500k that's probably a kind of a doable thing in there even with the the limited financial markets but then if they wanted to raise like a lot of money like you know 25 million plus or something you probably start getting the attention of western institutions and people from europe but there's a big gap there that's just really not well served due to kind of inefficiencies of the general financial markets as well as also a lot of you know governments in these space they offer kind of high yield government bonds that tend to sort of crowd out the other investment money that might come from a bank and so banks are just really like not interested in serving these types of customers in a lot of these markets and that's a theme we also heard over and over again from uh the calls we had and so you know did you have crypto over here very risk tolerant capital very global space and like we knew they'd be willing to lend out to high quality businesses no matter where they are in the world and so that's really what crypto's providing is just access to capital cool um so let's uh talk a little bit more about the lenders uh we talked about how the the incentive to lend might just be because of how higher yields but you guys have also alluded to um some sort of like tiering of risk uh can you go into that if i heard that correctly yeah so there are there are two ways to participate one is in the senior pool which is kind of at once in the senior pool and one is as a backer in the individual loans and uh the way to think about it i'll start with the backers which is when there's a loan through goldfinch it is divided into two tranches the junior tranche and the senior tranche then the backers provide capital to the junior tranche and what that what that tranche means is that whenever there's a potential loss or default the backers take losses first before the senior tranche takes any kind of a loss so if the backers provide 20 of the loan and the senior tranche is 80 of the loan then if for whatever reason the borrower defaulted and they only paid back 80 percent of what they owed the senior tranche would get every dollar back and the backers would lose all their money in that scenario and so there are two ways to participate one is if you're a backer you can evaluate the individual loans and you can provide capital into very specific loans and then you're doing so in the junior tranche and or if you participate in the senior pool you're providing into kind of like an aggregated pool that just automatically allocates capital to every single loan on the platform into the senior tranches so when you're providing into the senior pool it's automatic it's diversified and it's protected by the backers and the the way to make this all make sense economically is that 20 percent of the interest for the senior tranche is reallocated to the backers so it really gives the backers an outsized return so take for example a loan that has a 12 interest rate well the senior pool might see in the range of say eight to ten percent uh base yield but the the backers who are in the junior tranche they'll see more like 18 right base yield so they receive a much larger yield for both doing the work of picking and choosing the different loans and then providing capital that is higher risk and like junior okay so like there's this line that uh kathy wood said that stuck with me is that like prices are determined at the margins she didn't invent that line but um basically this is what's happening here right where we have this very big senior pool that's just like the lazy lenders the people's like all right just you know take my money go do stuff with it i don't really want to do any of the vetting and then you have the junior tranche which is and or just the active lenders which are actually unpacking like looking at the terms like you know actually drilling into this thing uh like you said doing the work and then also taking the risk and that's where you can get some like super high yields and the way that that super high yield comes from is the taking a small slice of the yields that are going to the to the uh to senior senior tranche which is like your laziness penalty uh and then giving that to the the junior tranche which is like your you did the work reward uh and but then also this is where like the wisdom of the crowds comes in where uh the the risk takers need to actually do a good job vetting uh the quality of the loans and if they do a bad job they get punched first um exactly right yeah and i think i think this leads to a second question that would be helpful to clarify but i'm guessing people would ask which is like well how does the senior pool decide how to automatically allocate the capital to the different tranches because uh and that's where this whole concept of consensus comes in if there's a borrower pool and like literally just one backer participates in that borrower pool the the senior pool the protocol says well i don't know if we can just trust what only one backer did but if there's a different borrower pool where like a thousand or ten thousand different backers all participated then the protocol can say oh like we can trust that a lot more because it has a lot more consensus by the share number of people who have participated in it and so the methodology is that there's the concept of this leverage ratio which is how much additional capital does the senior pool put into a given loan relative to what the backers put in and that leverage ratio is dynamic and so uh it'll it'll be based on parameters that will set as a community but there will need to be some minimum number of backers before the senior report will even put like a single dollar in that and then there will be like a leverage ratio that increases and say as you get to 100 backers or a thousand backers maybe the senior pool will put in two dollars for every dollar or three dollars for every dollar as you go up and so that leverage ratio is like really crucial because it's the idea that you can trust alone when there's a bunch of backers already in it and allocate more capital to it but if there's like only a couple backers you don't put any capital in there because you don't see the consensus yet okay this is really cool this is the really cool crypto economic magic side of this protocol so far that i've got it this is where like so what you're saying is that uh if all of the risk takers have all decided to allocate their money to the same pool that's signaling to the market that actually that pool doesn't really all have have all that much risk in it because all of these backers are putting all their money in the same spot it's like oh well clearly they all believe that this is a very good opportunity for them clearly there's not much risk here uh and so they they either the lenders the senior senior pool will get more favorable rates or perhaps maybe the actual borrower could also get more favorable rates too how is the interest rate for the borrowers determined or how how are the interest rates determined yeah so the interest rate does doesn't move in response to this thing the interest rates are determined um really you can think about it as just kind of a market action between the backers and the borrower right the borrower could come to the protocol and say hey i'm going to pay you know one percent interest rate that'd be great for the borrower but then no backers are going to fill that and so they're never going to get their money right and so there's going to need to pick a rate that is reasonable that's going to satisfy both the backers but also is low enough for them to still be able to pay it back yeah i think kind of walking through just to so you can understand how it works like the borrowers almost propose like a term sheet to the backer community they say hey everyone like we want to borrow 10 million dollars at a 12 interest rate because we have this great business we're going to use the money for these things and they are asking the backers to provide the capital towards it and they're saying these are the terms that we're asking for the capital so it's not a dynamic interest rate in the sense the borrower says here's something i want but if the backers all kind of reply being like 12 like uh that's not really a market you should really be paying 13 or 14 then then that could be like an off chain agreement and they can propose a different pool but the the terms of the interest rate aren't kind of like dynamically set uh what's dynamic reset is like how the capital flows into that pool very cool very cool it's like an automatic like wisdom of the crowd load balancing for capital yeah i mean it's still like that fair way to look at it yeah cool um so there's a token right yes there there is a token that was uh launched three weeks ago uh yeah a few weeks ago in like early january and yep um and the token is the governor's token so right now governance is live we kind of like handed over the protocol to the community and there's like snapshot voting and a very cool thing is we're using quadratic voting because we have the we have the uid like the unique identity nft so we know people are are unique and we don't have to worry about we have civil resistance from that and so we implemented quadratic voting on on snapchat which is cool because there aren't that many ways to do that without having that simple resistance um so the token's there it is uh serving governance it is also right now being distributed um as like rewards for liquidity mining for the senior pool and then for for the backers side very soon to come maybe maybe even by now for folks listening and then there are a number of other utilities that the token serves um one is when there will be an auditor system we haven't described that yet but auditors will stake this token and they will be like paid in the token um and then another is the ability to kind of stake on on backers which is listed in the white paper so this is other kinds of things the token will do a whole bunch of different things for the protocol cool and then uh how does the protocol collect fees the protocol takes 10 of all interest that comes back in so they basically it's you know the protocol wins when everyone else wins right and uh there's also a point five percent withdrawal fee point okay point so after you are when you are lending and it's time to come collect your money you pay a point five percent uh on the capital to the dow yeah and that um really just there to kind of lightly incentivize long-term holders right and guard against certain attacks of like you know if you were to try and predict when interest payments are going to come back in and the prices come up you don't want to like you know flash loan into that and then pull your capital out and stuff like that so it's just a light mechanism there say hey you should be here for some long term cool guys um let's see are there any angles that i have missed or haven't touched on yet um i would just say uh there's there's a whole bunch of like questions we get from other people around like how do you prevent fraud and collusion between the backers and the borrowers and things like that um that is a rich topic that actually we can get into i don't know how much time we have and stuff but also just wanted to say a lot of this in the white paper and people can read all those angles uh as well yeah this sounds like a in-depth conversation but it sounds like there are answers to that to that we have thought through all that um the token is part of helping to do that security um like keeping it really brief the auditors like they stake this token sort of like a proof-of-stake mechanism on ethereum or other chains where like they can be randomly selected to look at deals before a drawdown happens to look for signs that collusion might be taking place between the borrowers and the backers and that's that's kind of the idea there uh so where does the protocol actually live are we on ethereum mainnet or where where is it ethereum mainnet yeah any l2 planes uh yeah i would love to move to an l2 um the it just kind of got me to to get to it the truth is for the for the bars because they're borrowing such large sums of money um the gas fees on ethereum are not as big a deal for them um the of course we want to be able to expand access and make it available to as many people as we can and the gas measurement theory as we know are prohibited for a lot of people so we'd love to move to an l2 um we're going to kind of delay that build a few more aspects out on the protocol and then probably you know i imagine the community is going to want to move to that maybe like that later this year right i could imagine these aren't really uh high this isn't a high touch application this is like one transaction and then a really really really long time and then another transaction not not like nft degens who are touching their ledgers every single day yeah it's like folks who like the ideal kinds of folks supplying capital are doing it you know for for a very long time and then people who are borrowing they're borrowing millions at a time and then they're making a monthly interest payment so it just doesn't require frequent transactions uh what happened well i guess you guys have said you have a zero percent default rate but like what is the protocol for somebody who like misses a payment yeah so the losses would just get socialized i mean there's the waterfall as we said right the the backers with all their money first and then the senior pool is loses its money um in either case the losses between the groups are socialized so that just means that um we sort of reduce the the share price uh for the senior pool all at once so there's no ability for someone to like to come in and like get all of their money out before someone else there's no kind of running the bank yeah issue there you mentioned the word share price which is kind of like an internal  like protocol term but it just means that the amount that folks can redeem is like adjusted for the fact that like it's expecting this payment will not be made yeah so what if somebody's just like uh like five days late like how does the protocol account for something like that there is a grace period so i i forget what the exact is it 30 days negative 30 days or a couple weeks some grace period so if it's literally five days late uh what's traditional with these loans not even in crypto but in traditional markets is there some grace period and then after the grace period i believe it's 120-day write-down period continuously so that loan just gets like written down over the course of 120 days until it's paid back and then all that capital is resupplied back to all of the folks who participated in it or sold for another yeah so there's no like you know from one day to the next just like some big loss it's just yeah that's the way it works awesome guys well if people are intrigued and want to learn more where should they go they should go to the website goldfinch.finance that has and then i would encourage people to check out the discord and join the community and the twitter those are all links to from the website and uh who do you guys need the most in the ecosystem do you guys need like lenders or do you guys need customers or like what what are you guys missing in the ecosystem the most um you know really every every player in the ecosystem is important to making the whole marketplace work um i think you know for this audience probably the most thing that makes the most sense is becoming backers or lp's in the protocol and the backers are the active ones more risk takers and the lp is more kind of passive set it and forget it awesome guys well i've definitely learned a lot in this episode so thank you for explaining to me
