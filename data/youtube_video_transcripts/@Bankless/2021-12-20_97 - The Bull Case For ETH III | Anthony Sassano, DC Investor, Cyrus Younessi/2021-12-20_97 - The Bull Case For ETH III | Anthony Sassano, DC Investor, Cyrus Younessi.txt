mila to give financial advice um that you're allowed to be bullish cyrus this is a bullish podcast uh it's probably like a good thing for the price of eath if all those things kind of converge all at the same time so yeah the numbers and the merge and everything is exciting right welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams and i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david great episode today this is the bull case for eth eth as an investment in 2022 how's it going to perform what's it going to do there's five key takeaways we talk to the panelists with first why eth is destined to go up second what happens to eth price when ethereum finally scales end the panelists believe it will scale will the flipping happen is the third thing also we asked some controversial kinds of questions like are eth maxis the new bitcoin maxis is there even an eth maxi is that a thing we also end the podcast with price predictions so you're going to want to tune into this one david what were your thoughts after this episode oh my thoughts are i'm incredibly bullish ryan we start off this episode with just recapping the year in 2021 which in hindsight it's crazy how long this year has lasted but also simultaneously how quickly it blew by so much happened in 2021 and i think 2021 was really it was the year that crypto people wanted to have in the bull in the bear markets of 2018 through 2020 we dreamt of 2021 and so like reflecting on the year like we have to pat ourselves on the back like this is the year that we got break out generalized adoption of so many different things turns out it wasn't d5 that did it turns out it was nfts but something did it um we had eip1559 finally go live in the middle of this year we set new all-time highs twice first at 4 300 and then again at 4 800. still time left in the right in the year to set a new all-time high i will say that uh and then dows are now in the mainstream and it's just crypto vernacular has been gone into the mainstream we all gonna make it is part of like general twitter discourse now so many of things equip about crypto and ethereum specifically got exported to the rest of the world not just the the the values of our assets going up but also our culture too uh which is definitely something that we also talk about how ethereum is now the base layer for culture so many different things we talked about in this episode and all of it made me bullish yeah i i'm just gonna say in 2021 we were right like the e thesis was right a lot of things that uh that we said that happened right and so it was very gratifying from that perspective i think the big question in people's minds that we talk about um with the panelists is what's 2022 going to be like are we going to have a repeat year is ethereum actually going to be able to scale can we do it again can we do 2021 all over again can we do it again right that's the question and i think ethan's as an asset has um you know made huge strides been through the acid test in 2021 now ethereum the network the big question in front of it is can it scale so we talked to the panelists all about that guys if you like this panel make sure you like and subscribe to

ethbull panel this is the third that we've done very timely the end of 2021 the beginning of 2022 i want to introduce our guest to you today anthony cesano dave you know him from the daily gray he's an investor he's a twitter meme lord he's the bleeding heart of ethereum i've heard him called that at least maybe david and i call him that uh great to have anthony on we also have dc investor he is an investor advisor as well consultant and nft god had him on the show many times as well you also know cyrus yunessi he's former maker dao on the risk team financial wizard now he's just a guy with great takes on twitter investor in the space as well all three of these people have one thing in common that thing i know is they are bullish on eth we're going to talk about that today the theme is is eth a good investment going into 2022. that's what we're going to talk about today and you know these bulls are going to be bullish on the subjects so if you don't want to be bullish on eth if you're not ready for that uh i i suggest you skip this this podcast episode and go on to another one go listen to up only or something like that because we're going to talk about the bull case for eth today uh guys it is wonderful to have you back on the podcast how's everyone doing hey ryan hi yeah great great to be here thanks having us on well i hope you guys are feeling bullish uh david do you want to lead us in maybe just do a recap of this crazy year that we've had of 2021 and just for folks the last time we had the equal case was about five months ago and the time before this we've recorded it in december 2021 of 2020 of last year our very first bull panel session maybe got us from there david what happened since the very first time we've recorded an episode like this up until now yeah we recorded at the price of a roughly seven hundred dollars per ether uh and by the time we hit may it peaked out at four thousand three hundred dollars largely driven by nfts nfts really came into their moment especially in the first half of the year and lots of people were getting exposure to ethereum the network and ether the asset via nfts as it turns out d5 was not the thing that was going to take ethereum mainstream it was nfts uh and so nfcs had just a very bullish first half of the year uh and exposed a lot of people to just crypto at large especially ethereum gas fees were insanely high two to four hundred gway were sustained for months eip1559 was not yet live that would come out about uh um uh that would come out later in in august uh the polygon proof of side chain was all the rage largely pushing as a result of being people being pushed off of the l1 and dowels were just beginning to form in the first half of the year uh then we recorded the second episode uh which is when cyrus came onto the panel uh we recorded that on june of 20 on june 28th after ether and the rest of the crypto markets went from forty three hundred dollars down to seventeen hundred dollars in a very quick liquidation event and they had recovered by the time we started recording it to two thousand five hundred dollars so off off the top by a very significant amount eip1559 came not too long after that second recording on august 5th and and we set again new all-time highs 4 800 in the first week of november after ether slowly climbed out of that crab season after crab summer uh this is then when macro inflation started uh to come around in the scene and also crypto moved into the forefront of the regulatory conversation and also we saw dalles really take their strides uh constitution dow made made big time news pleaser dao bought the wu-tang album uh many many dallas spun up all across ethereum uh layer twos by this time are in much better state than they were six months ago but still leaving a lot to be desired and the demand for block space had really been satisfied by non-ethereum layer ones mainly solana and avalanche so guys that was the recap of 2021 in in my in my words and i just want to ask you guys uh what did i forget to me did i uh forget anything what also comes to mind and what were really the big things that moved the needle when it comes to ethereum progress and overall crypto market development and anthony let's start with you yeah i mean i think you gave a really great summary there of kind of like the high level points of what's been going on through a bit of macro stuff in there as i think that's actually going to be a big theme for today talking about the macro environment and how that's affecting crypto and eth as a kind of like asset these days i think you know you touched on layer two i think that became a much bigger theme towards the end of the year when these things actually started going live and started getting kind of apps deployed to them and people realized that ethereum scaling wasn't a pipe dream it wasn't a joke it wasn't something that was coming at a later date it was here now it was getting you know exponentially better over time so and i think you know as as kind of like time has gone on uh into kind of like november and now december it's become even more apparent and we've had kind of like some really nice growth there we have steady growth without token incentives like native token incentives which is always good to see we've had a lot of kind of like big acquisitions like polygon has been you know acquiring all these zk teams and we've just had a much clearer picture coming to view of how ethereum is gonna scale via layer two uh we all knew about the roll-up centric roadmap but it was kind of like okay well what's that actually gonna look like which teams are going to kind of like be the big ones you know our zk going to dominate or optimistic roll-ups going to dominate and i think even that um debate has kind of like almost been put to bed now where it's like well both are going to exist they both have their strengths and weaknesses and we're just going to kind of keep developing that out as time goes on so i think that that would be like the major kind of like stuff that that just got you know much hotter as as time went on in the year but yeah i think you covered most of the other stuff that i can think of of right now in terms of like the highest level things but yeah maybe dc or cyrus has something else to add there yeah dc you want to take it sure yeah i'll jump in with a couple points here and i really want to focus on the nft side and you mentioned it david but i think a lot of what happened in nfts is incredibly significant for ethereum as a network in 2021 and in particular if you go back to the beginning of the year um the the community has expanded so much since then i mean in january there were not that many people talking about nfts and then really in kind of the march time frame that's when they started to take off and what i've seen over the past year is a tremendous introduction of new participants into the network and these aren't people who are in other cryptos before necessarily they came to ethereum and other networks as well because of nfts and i think that that nft momentum has really pushed ethereum into the zeitgeist in a way that it hasn't been um in before and it's starting to gain more recognition among people who are not that deep into crypto like bitcoin has and i think we're gonna see that continue frankly into 2022. the other point that i'll bring up around nfts is it wasn't just these nfts as assets it really represented this creator economy taking off on ethereum but for the first time i would say we had this organic economic activity because before we had icos and we had defy there are people who would probably rightfully argue in some cases they were kind of self-looking ice cream cones that didn't necessarily have a purpose the technology's there but those things become valuable and they become applied in a true economy and that's what nfts represent it's a creator economy where creators can create something and earn money for the work that they're doing so i expect that to continue in the coming years cyrus what do you want to add on to the state of aetherium and overall crypto in in 2021 uh i mean it's hard to go wrong in a year when heath pumps from 700 to 4000. but i think for me um you know for years we have all been shilling eth as this multi-faceted protocol that does not just one thing really good uh but does 10 things extremely well and for years it was always like you know one day it'll do all these things but today it does nothing right uh and then all of a sudden out of nowhere um eth you know it it gains consumer adoption on the nft side uh scalability solutions such as um you know the l2 stuff comes into play uh you have d5 apps launching on these l2 platforms right it's no longer just a uniswap maker compound but you know you have a bunch of uh awesome teams building directly on layer 2 which has led to kind of an explosion of l2 d5 e2 development has you know obviously been coming along as well eip1559 was kind of the monetization or the financial aspect of ethereum right so these are all like completely diverse endeavors that the ethereum community has gone after um and they almost all came to fruition around the same time right i thought that was really exciting and for me like i can tell because i'm having completely diverse conversations with more people than ever and it's it's always about something else with you know people are people are interested in different things all the financial people are interested in the burn and the tokenomics and then you have the you know the nft people doing their thing and the tech wizards are are interested on layer 2 adoption or e2 so i don't know i think like finally showcase you know ethereum has finally been able to showcase all these different things that we'd always hoped that it would start to do and it's you know so far it's going well cyrus so anthony was talking about layer two and dc was talking about nfts breaking into mainstream do you think like 2021 was the first year that eve kind of broke out under the shadow of bitcoin on its own it's like was it the first year that it became confident in itself and it broke into mainstream without being sort of overshadowed by its older brother it was kind of the first year where i think we stopped um we stopped being afraid or like nervous or worried you know kind of there was always this like overhang of um will will the broader investment world ever really care about ether are we kind of doomed to this this weird awkward shadow position uh i kind of feel like and i see this you know maybe it's just bull market vibes but like people feel increasingly less threatened by bitcoin um it's just like not really even in the in the realm of the conversation maybe that's a little bit uh uh toxic to say but it's just like you know i just we're talking about it less it's become you know and the institutions are now starting to like slowly pump out um reports on eth and and all this stuff it's just the narrative has changed so do what the do with that what you will one thing i want to pick your guys's brains about is is what cyrus says is that ethereum goes in so many different directions all at once right we we do dows we do nfts we've got layer twos we've got ultrasound money what would you say what would you guys say that ethereum did the best in 2021 what is ethereum's definitive clear biggest w and then also what did ethereum kind of uh lag behind on what what did we also uh kind of not prioritize as much as we could have um so like well yeah what did we do the best on and what do we need to continue to work on um anthony let's start with you yeah so i think uh what we did best in 2021 was probably uh i think selling the value prop of eth in a lot in a much better way than we had previously and we got buy-in from people as cyrus was saying because we no longer felt like we were i guess under the foot of bitcoin where you know we couldn't say anything we couldn't kind of talk about the flipping or as everyone would kind of like ravage us or anything like that we became a lot more confident in 8th and its value accrual because i mean at the start of the year we knew 1.559 was coming we didn't have a date but we knew it was coming like relatively soon um you know the merge has been known about for quite a while dropping that issuance down as well and uh you know it was continuing to be used in d5 it was being staked at a really nice rate we had you know obviously at the start of the year we'd come off the high of december first beacon chain launch where everyone said that a lot of people said that we wouldn't even meet the minimum eth required to launch the chain and we did that you know and then we went way past that so i think the best thing we did was we basically uh made it so that people saw the value prop of eth as an asset and we weren't scared to do that anymore uh which which was you know my highlight of this year so far um the worst thing i think is the most obvious is that we didn't scale fast enough and we allowed other kind of like chains to eat into ethereum's market share as kind of like a flow over um you know you mentioned the polygon pos chain which is obviously ethereum aligned it is not what people would consider a true l2 but it helped a lot to keep people within the ethereum ecosystem but then because of the scalability issues we kind of like lost the narrative war on that front at this point to other chains as you mentioned like avalanche and solana which are not necessarily friendly to ethereum so ethereum basically got too popular got too big the fees got you know got um got too high before we had scaling but at the end of the day i think that's a short term kind of like pain and long-term gain because i believe without these pain points we wouldn't have even had a lot of these scaling teams working on this sort of stuff because there wouldn't be anything to work on there's a reason why we didn't have the layer 2s for a very long time well there's multiple reasons but a big reason i think is because fees were cheap on ethereum for a very long time there was no necessity to get these solutions out there and then once we had the high fees everyone was like okay we really really need to you know get get um ethereum scaled here but it took longer because we're trying to do it the right way the decentralized way we're trying to not compromise on our principles and our core values um whereas these other chains they're scaling in different ways right like solana has taken the approach of we don't care about letting users run their own nodes at home we're happy using data centers we're happy kind of like just having something that they call decentralized enough um avalanche i think takes a similar approach you know they have their evm c chain which is just from my understanding a higher gas limit change something like you know a bsc for example but they've managed to cultivate their own ecosystems because they have tokens people got in early on the tokens they made money like let's be honest here that's that's a big reason why a lot of people stick with these ecosystems if they they get they make money from them they get rich off them this is not this is a this is kind of like an open thing just people don't talk about it so i think that that's where we kind of like performed you know worst on and we lost on and maybe a lot of some value from eighth you know bled to other i think i think it did i think a value from that would have gone into eighth bled into other kind of like um ecosystems uh but at the same time i actually think funny enough that these other ecosystems help eth as well i read the other day that uh wrapped ethon avalanche is one of the top assets that is used on that chain um even more so than the native avax token now i have to verify that but you know it makes sense because eighth is so liquid if there's such a large market cap there's so many people who have eth and it's so easy to bridge across and it's an evm chain so you're literally just kind of like bridging there to farm the tokens you know get get you know um yield farm and all that sort of stuff so in a way these other things are kind of like still a net positive i think in the longer run but at the same time if each doesn't kind of like scale on its own with layer twos the narrative war just keeps getting you know we keep losing it and the narrative just keeps getting worse and worse and people just like have this really sour view of ethereum want to ask dc the the same question too but before we do i want to you know highlight the um the win that you talked about first uh anthony which is like something because i think all of these panelists have been involved in it to one degree or another and that is this this chant this idea this narrative that we've been talking about from 2018 onward ethan's money remember we'd say that in 2018 people would laugh at it no it's not money it was crazy it's crazy yeah it was crazy we were 20 90 saying that ethan's money yeah right whatever bro no it's not 2020 ethan's money come on it's not money 2021 ethan's money oh it's money yeah of course it's money sotheby's says it's money it's money that in itself was a massive three-year victory i would say and i'm not just talking from a narrative perspective i'm talking it's like this is where holders i think help their respective communities like long-term believers is they see the vision from the beginning right eth deserves a monetary premium the asset it's not just gas and i think many of you are like all everyone on this panel has uh believed that you know from 2018 onward and kind of pushed that and how far we came in 2021 it's actually unbelievable there's bank reports talking about ether as a productive asset as an internet bond as as a monetary unit as uh as as a money and i think nfts were were key to that too so huge huge uh huge progress i think in the last year um but dc what do you think what's your take on this so what are the biggest wins for eth and then maybe some of the things where needs improvement fell down a little bit in 2021 sure well i definitely agree with anthony's assessment and if i had to say the biggest win and where we struggled a little bit i would agree with that but i would say my second second biggest win in my mind was we established ethereum as well i'll call it like a cultural asset layer and i think that people don't realize how significant that actually is yet or a lot of people don't i mean if you look back to the a year ago and the year before that right typically the ethereum community most of it was all focused on like the same thing at the same time and everybody was focused on like icos then everyone was focused on defy and then we came into nfts and it kind of led to this explosion of content that we were not ready for right we went from having really dorky discussions about money and like security layers and stuff like that that that we guys like us love having those conversations but for the new people coming in they're not having those conversations they're just talking about the assets that are being built they're talking about the communities that are emerging on ethereum they're not so much focused on like the technology that's powering it in the back end although they understand i mean a lot of them do understand more than they let on or more than they might realize but but i think that's a really interesting transition we're finally at a point where we're talking more about the applications on ethereum than just the protocol layer that's powering it i think that's pretty pretty significant i think an area where we struggled and this goes back to the scaling piece that anthony touched on is i don't know that we as a community have communicated that coherent vision around how rollups will scale ethereum around how bridge technology is going to plug into that there's still a lot and i think part of that is because ethereum is not this centrally controlled um blockchain you know i mean even the layer one protocol development is led by multiple client teams who have to collaborate and agree on changes to the network and they have to manage an equilibrium with what users expect and and soon what stakers will expect right but i think that really we need to communicate more of that vision around how ethereum is going to scale and what i think we've done i think this has actually stepped up significantly in the past few months to talk about the modular blockchains and so on so i'm hopeful that we can have more of that conversation in 2022. we definitely have some room slotted in the agenda today to talk about that and so but before we get there cyrus what are your takes what are what are ethereum's big wins in 2021 and what are what are our big l's um i mean i think you guys hit upon all the big wins um but what i wanted to add was that you know these weren't just like things that just like randomly materialized this year right they were the result of you know a compounding effort over many many many years um you know everything with with roll-ups and scalability research is the product of many heart many years of hard work from um the research team um you know everything with d phi and nfts and you know ux has just there's been a lot of work that's gone into it um and i think we're just finally getting to enjoy like the some of the fruits of that labor i think you know ethereum's commitment to uh decentralization and developer adoption and it's kind of it's consistency there is you know what i would consider a win right like i haven't um it's kind of like an easy time for users and developers and you know whatever people to kind of jump ship and go explore like the new shiny object but i don't really see that a lot i kind of just see the best and brightest mind still gravitating towards ethereum i think that's you know primarily because uh these you know these people they can rely on the community and the protocol to kind of uphold those uh those values of decentralization and whatnot and i think that's pretty cool to see um you know maybe it's not totally transparent from from the outside but that's just kind of like the kind of a feeling i get is that people are still really excited to build on ethereum they they trust uh they trust that the core devs and you know all the researchers can kind of uh mold this platform into something that will scale for all um i think that's really exciting i think it's cool so guys i went to something we didn't do in the first episode and or second episode of the ethereum bowl case is actually recap some of the core drivers of how ether the asset actually accrues in value uh and anthony you've said this a number of times before on the into the ether podcast with it with eric as if the ethers three value pillars of accrual value capture pillars can you just quickly walk us through each one and quickly define each one and then we're gonna take it back to cyrus and dc to talk about the state of those things in 2021 yeah yeah for sure so yeah i've had this kind of like thesis around um it's core value pillars like three of them for for a while i think there's many more reasons why it is valuable but there's really three core kind of reasons that you can point to and the funny thing is up until december 1st of last year we only had uh kind of like uh one of these uh and and then kind of like we unlocked them all as time went on but so just to describe them so the three are staking so it's used as a staking asset or an internet bond as you guys like to call it which i think is a really cool name for it um it's used as trustless collateral in defy obviously there's a lot of eighth kind of powering defy it's you know the best collateral asset you can get on ethereum it's the most trustless and then you have eighth being used to pay fees now uh paying fees uh and and burning those fees see that wasn't unlocked until recently so you know we still had people using ether to pay to pay for pay for transactions but most all that eighth was going to minors which to be honest like it's kind of like hard to argue how much of a value accrual pillar that was because the miners tend to sell their ether they get to cover costs and things like that but now in today's world we have all of those three at at full power essentially like staking is at full power um i guess you could argue that it's almost there like once we have um the merge happen uh the merge done the stakers will actually be getting the unburnt fear revenue as well so they'll be you know they'll be getting even more value out of their staked eighth but you know we're pretty much almost there with staking uh each users trust us collateral within d5 i mean that's you know no one can argue against that that's obvious and not just on ethereum layer one but also layer two and also all the other chains as well as i mentioned like is being used on the avalanche c chain you know uh pretty heavily so it's not trust it wouldn't be like trustless like it is on ethereum but it's still used as a collateral asset which is obviously one of the pillars and then you have one of the most important pillars which is uh using use to pay fees but now with one five five nine we have value directly going to eth as an asset because we're burning most of those fees so those things have been kind of like on the roadmap for a long time i've talked about them for a long time because of that uh but we didn't unlock them all until recently and as i said i would argue that we aren't at that kind of like full power until the merge because that's when stakers get the most value out of their their stake because they get the unburnt fear revenue and also potentially mev as well so those are the three core ones but as i said there are also other things that fall off of that and kind of like are auxiliary to that like you could say ether is a story of value because of all these sorts of things right people want to hold it because they know there's these three core value accrual pillars even if they aren't using it to stake or within d fire or to pay fees they're just holding it in cold storage that's you know it's used as a store of value um and then obviously it uses money right powering the nft economy people are kind of like using it to buy and sell things and all that sorts of stuff so eth becomes an moe of the ethereum ecosystem and people said that stable coins would replace this and i mean they have in some kind of ways but at the same time people just like because ethan has is so desirable as an asset i think people would rather hold eath than a stable coin and it just makes it much simpler to kind of like price things in eath and trade with each but obviously dc would have more color on the nft side but yeah those are kind of like the three core pillars and some of the stuff that falls off of that as well so let's start with eip1559 because some of the numbers that came out of eip1559 i think blew a lot of people's expectations out of the water so since august 5th we've had 1.2 million ether burnt so that's 1.2 million ether burnt over roughly 130 days that which is about 9230 each per day which is also roughly 37 million dollars per day in ether that is being quote unquote bought back from the network every single day so let's start with uh dc dc do you have any reflections on these numbers like were these what you expected or anything to any thoughts that you have i think the burn has been really significant and of course that's going to ebb and flow based on the use of the network but use use and demand to use ethereum has been pretty high so we've seen a lot of burn now we are still seeing issuance of course and i think you know it is important to understand that we're not at our deflationary state yet but when you stack these numbers with a potential proof of stake issuance model which might hit let's say in the next four to five months or something like that right we're starting to look at a pretty compelling value proposition for ether as an asset and i think this is i think i think a lot of people a lot of the financial industry will probably start looking at these data especially as staking especially as we transition to full proof of stake and those assets become withdrawable from the network i think that's gonna i think that's gonna totally shift ethereum into a different kind of asset posture even then we've all been thinking about it but i think it's gonna be realized in a way that we can't really anticipate until that merge happens and until those earnings become withdrawable cyrus what do you see when you see some of these metrics that have only been around for roughly 130 days a few thoughts uh one is you know the the first time um a protocol or a company or anything you know is able to uh monetize its its product and and kind of start to pull in revenues is just an exciting it's just an exciting component [Music] and um you know it it really sets it apart and distinguishes it from other protocols that that you know all these super uh scalable you know other layer ones they they have super low fees they don't have any burn um it just kind of provides like a different metric to benchmark ethereum versus its competitors um just as important it allows uh fundamental investors to kind of value ethereum and try to construct uh you know valuation models using dcf methods or whatnot um you know there's this like there's this narrative out there you know in the in the current macro climate that uh fundamentals don't matter and it's a meme driven economy and everything is just memes memes and memes you see it with tesla and and whatnot um that's all true to some extent especially you know obviously in the current environment but you know there will come a time where fundamentals do matter there will come a time when uh p e ratios matter again and uh there's you know plenty of uh there's plenty of money out there that you know if they haven't already uh we'll start looking at uh these these metrics and they'll start valuing these blockchains as companies they'll start applying traditional methods um it may not be perfect or whatever but uh once they do i think people will start to wake up to what the burn actually represents and what that value capture means for um for the price of ether uh it hasn't you know it hasn't happened quite yet i don't really see that discussion out there publicly but i i'm betting that within you know one to two years we'll start to see uh you know big bank reports you know using using these these methodologies to try to put a you know put a put a multiple to what you know the youth network is and and try to value it i'm just really curious from the panel uh really quickly here do you think that the general public is aware of what's happening now and what's about to happen and sorry of course the general public is not aware of it what i mean is like the crypto investor the typical crypto investor do you think they are aware of the burn rate the fact that issuance is going to be cut by four percent and ethan is going to go deflationary next year like do you think they're even aware of these dynamics and the whole eth as a triple point asset thesis or maybe a way to ask that is what percentage of crypto investors do you think are aware of what is coming in 2022 for ether the asset what do you think cyrus um i mean what percentage of investors you know counting one one per person very very few because kind of most of the most of the retail community out there is just kind of chasing uh chasing kind of the meme cycles as a percentage of kind of capital out there that's you know able to be deployed today um certainly less than we would hope right um i think you know a bunch of us in various um interactions with members of the broader crypto investment community have you know we i think it's fair to say that we don't think that there's a lot of uh good due diligence out there right it's a fairly i guess you could say inefficient market by educational standards um you know it's not really uh put it this way until like a year ago you never really had to like um dig down deep on the fundamentals to to make money investing in crypto you know uh following trends and following hype it was a pretty successful uh strategy from 2010 to 2020. um i think we're like starting to enter this cycle where you can find latent value by applying some of these methods and and once they do i think that that'll just kind of be a self-fulfilling prophecy where all this institutional capital will start to uh basically fomo in based on the fundamentals yeah well i mean what do you think dc do you think um this stuff is priced in a lot of people will say look like i feel like we've been talking about this for a year i'm talking about all of this for a year now eip has happened now that you know the merge is going to happen next year and some people will say well there's execution risk and that sort of thing but like my question to you dc is do you still feel like this is alpha or is this old news you think the market's like nah we priced this in already that's why eth is sitting above 4k at the time we're recording this and sorry are you eating boomers yeah yeah i i definitely don't think it's priced in to be honest i would say maybe like 15 to 20 percent of crypto participants really understand the implications of what's gonna happen as ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake but most people just don't get it you know most of the crypto market needs like really simple memes and they're like that's why bitcoin is so successful with its hard cap because it's very easy to understand even though i know for some of us including myself it doesn't make a lot of logical sense which is part of why ethereum does not have a hard cap right we realize that you need to have sustainable issuance i think the other thing to think about with the fees is um you can't fake this right it's like like these other layer ones can't fake the fee income that ethereum has right you can't fake the users who are willing to pay or need to pay that much to use the network and that results in those transaction fees being burned so i think that is going to over time become this differentiator versus other networks especially within the context of all the other things that we talked about with respect to ether as an asset and by by the way i do think it's important because i think i think that there's a false narrative that's been propagated by some hedge funds and other folks who say things like well the fee situation on ethereum is extractive and i want to set the record straight on that point because it's really important to understand that fees are not in place to make money for ethereum or for ether holders the reason why fees exist and the reason why there's a fee market on ethereum is because we need to be able to limit the transaction demand so that you can get transactions included we have to be able to decide what transactions get included in any given block which has a limited capacity so on balance before all these fees were just being paid to minors now we're burning them which creates this indirect benefit for all either holders so we basically reassigned a benefit that was very concentrated and we've now turned that into something that is very distributed and benefits more people in a positive way so i want to turn the conversation to proof of stake and again i'm going to rattle off some stats here uh currently at the time of the recording right before we recorded i wrote these numbers down we have 8.9 million ether that is currently being staked roughly 7.5 of the total supply almost 270 000 validators are earning 5.2 ish percent on their ether year over year um so you know 5.2 on your ether pretty pretty good returns but i want to also talk about some metrics with uh what we would see if the merge happened right now so if the merge took place uh we are burning and i'm using i'm going to bake in an assumption here so disclaimer a 70 30 gas burn to tip fee payment split so when you pay gas 70 goes to to gets burned by eip1559 30 gets paid to as tips to validators and so we are currently burning roughly 9 230 ether per day annualized at a 70 gas fee rate which means if that's true we're adding on 16 apy to to yield if we were to emerge right now um just again some quick math is nine thousand two hundred and thirty uh 9230 ether per day times 365 is 3.3 million ether burnt a year if you multiply 3.3 times 0.7 you get 4.8 eth paid to validators 70 of that gets burned 30 of that gets paid so that means 1.4 million ether is paid to validators in tip fees per year and 1.4 million is roughly 16 percent of the 8.9 million ether that is currently being staked so therefore post merge eth apy if the merger would happen right now would be at 21 apy in eth terms and i want uh to pull up a website a quick question sure so does that include the uh the mev projections as well yes i think that but i think that bakes in mev into it as well it definitely definitely does yeah uh and so and using those numbers as contacts i want to pull up this uh website money printer one of the one of the david mihal's great great websites and just to kind of juxtapose ether's monetary policy its issuance rate versus the other other blockchains and now with all of those stats in our brains and our listeners brains anthony i want to throw it to you how does ether and ethereum's monetary policy differentiate itself from the many many other l1s that are out there yeah yeah so i can talk to about that and also i think like the um the fact that you brought up kind of like these numbers uh speaks to what we're talking about before as well about how how many people actually understand this right in a big way um you know how people have priced this in things like that um but first of all you know i'll answer your question for sure so with ethereum's monetary policy it's been designed in a way that allows it to be sustainable while also driving value back to eath holders so it's being designed or has been designed to basically uh minimize the amount of value being bled and what i mean by that is minimize the amount of value going where it shouldn't be going so previously before one five five nine we were overpaying miners and i actually think we're still overpaying miners at the current issuance rate of 4.19 right but we've offset a lot of that with the burn um last time i checked i think the net burn was like either 60 or 70 since inception so we've offset that issuance in a really big way already obviously not net deflationary yet but we will be post merge if this continues right so the way that ethereum has kind of like created this symbiotic relationship is that with proof of stake we will have a constant issuance of i think right now it's what 0.6 or something like that over the total kind of network amount you mentioned 5.2 that's just what's paid to validators but if you take it as a percentage of the total amount of ethan circulation it is about 0.6 0.7 percent it may be higher by the time the merge happens because more people will stake the issuance rate goes up slightly so let's say we we have like one percent issuance a year once the merge happens right but then we have much more than that i think over two percent being uh kind of like burned each year uh so then you have kind of like the net deflationary effect which means that even with constant perpetual issuance with no hard cap you still have a net deflationary ether and you still have a secure network because the validators aren't reliant on fees they are paid you know very nicely from the block award in perpetuity there is no need for them to be like oh what happens in the block reward goes down like with bitcoin right um because bitcoin's bet is that the fear of and you will make up for the block reward well that's not going to happen it hasn't happened and it's going to keep getting worse because the only thing you can do on the bitcoin network is transact btc there's not that much demand to do that right then people aren't going to pay lots of money to do that whereas on ethereum layer one you have a million reasons to transact on the network and that is reflected in the amount of fee revenue like people think to themselves like how like how are people paying you know tens of millions of dollars a day to use this network well it's because they're getting more than that out of the network in terms of value so it is worth it even if you're only getting uh one percent of the transaction as profit it is still worth it especially for mav people who say okay well i can extract 100 of mev out of this transaction um but 99 of that is going to be a cost that i have to incur whether that be kind of like fees or some other costs gas fees or some other cost so they're willing to pay to do that now none of that exists on on the bitcoin network uh because the bitcoin network is is really just there to to be home to btc so that's where a lot of the fees come from but then because prior to one five five nine all that was being bled i think that value was being bled out to to miners who would sell it now it's been it's going to eath holders and post merge it is actually going to go to stakers as well the mav which are eighth holders right because you have to hold eve to be a staker you have to stake it as a miner you don't actually have to hold ether at all right you can just set up your miner and that's it you don't have to stake eighth nothing like that you can sell all of your e you don't have to do anything so i think that from that perspective um that's where the symbiotic relationship gets created where we have a network that sustains itself through a perpetual block issuance we have the burns offset that issuance to make ethernet deflationary we're sending all the value to each holders and each stakers which is you know how it should be in my opinion um and we're making we're ensuring that the network is secure forever so that's kind of like the gist of it there cyrus i know there's a lot of numbers there and you're kind of a numbers guy uh when you see all these uh proof of stake and and burning metrics uh what gets you going what what what makes you excited about this um yeah you know when when an asset all of a sudden starts yielding like an additional uh an additional 20 percent um you know that that definitely kind of uh gets into motion a sort of you know a pseudo-carry trade right where people will borrow or invest from other capital assets and and inflow it into eth to um you know to earn the yield and they'll they'll maybe want to hedge this you know even if they want to hedge exposure you know whatever there's a number of ways to play it but just you know fair very simply when an asset goes from yielding 5 to 20 something percent that that typically has impact on capital flow um yeah i mean it's exciting i mean not not to mention when that happens like it'll also be you know it'll be ushered in along with kind of this significant achievement um which is the actual kind of the technical launch of the merge right i mean i think i think nobody really knew what to expect when the beacon chain launched last year um and i i i think there was like maybe one to two days after it was successfully activated the kind of price of eth was stagnant and then kind of investors started to say you know holy crap like they actually pull it off like it's the first step but it's still such a huge achievement and and that was the start of the bull run right um just just almost like a self-fulfilling prof prophecy we've been talking about the merge for so long now and how important it is and what a landmark achievement it is and now you have kind of the financial component like i think it's like it might i don't even know if i should say not financial advice give am i allowed to give financial advice uh that you're allowed to be bullish cyrus this is a bullish podcast uh it's probably like a good thing for the price of eve if all those things kind of converge uh all at the same time so yeah the numbers and the merge and everything is exciting right dc can i ask a question uh to you too so this is um this is the crypto fees website it's one of my favorite you know sites to see this this year and um kind of gets um gets me above the noise of asset prices and actually focus on where is the block space demand when we had chris dixon on the podcast um he said you know i am super bullish block space in general and if you look at like the actual market and what block space they're particularly bullish on they're particularly bullish on ether block space on ethereum's block space and how do we know that we know that because they're paying a whole lot for it so seven day average fees on ethereum right now 33 million dollars okay this dwarfs every other chain out there uh including including bitcoin at times this year i you know pulled up this chart and spent like 80 million dollars uh seven day average fee and if you look at some of ethereum's uh competitors you know the avalanches of the world 376 thousand dollars seven day average not million thousand dollars versus ethereum 33 million if you look at uh let's let me scroll down way down i don't even know if i can find salon on here polka dot is a four four thousand seven hundred seven day average volume um ethereum is just dwarfing all other all other chains in terms of its block space demand as measured by revenue what do you make of that and why is that important in your mind so i think the reality is that um not all block space is created equal quite frankly and it's easy to spin up any block chain and say oh we've got block space come use it but the reality is um not all of it is created equal and i think that's where when we talk about is decentralization important the market still says it's important right a lot of the higher value activity is still occurring on networks like ethereum which espouse that stronger decentralization ethos i also think though because and this is kind of an accretive network effect because ethereum has already tokenized a lot of these important assets and i'll go back to that cultural asset layer comment that i used earlier because those assets exist on ethereum in order to transact with those assets you have to use ethereum or if you want to transact with them in a truly censorship resistant way soon you're going to be able to use layer twos also right and i think that's another aspect to consider because as layer twos take off on ethereum the way that i describe that is it's increasing the transaction density of layer one right so you're replacing the barns on our layer one transaction layer and you're replacing them with skyscrapers effectively and skyscrapers can allow for a lot more commerce a lot more reserve demand for ether and a lot more demand for ether block space right because because the marginal value of ethereum block space is going to be set by how much commerce can occur on those layer twos and then the commits that they make back to layer one so i think that that is a really important story and i think i think those layer twos we can talk about how other chains will also probably eventually move to a roll-up model but ethereum is the one that is constrained at layer one first and i think people actually underestimate how much of an innovation driver that's gonna be for ethereum right it's gonna take a solana or maybe an avalanche a lot longer to get to the point where they feel like they need to move to roll-ups right ethereum is going to be developing a full-fledged roll-up ecosystem in the next year i feel confident about that because the demand is there the technology is finally there and that's going to be reflected even further in the value of ethereum layer one block space i have a question for the group is that uh with when this merge does happen and ether staking turns into having a 20 apy do we think that that's actually going to incent people to actually go and buy ether to get that apy or do you think instead maybe some dormant ether wakes up and and tries to get that yield or the question is does that actually result in an ether price increase does that actually make ether a compelling financial investment as a result of the merge um i would say 100 i would say it would be both i'd say this would be some kind of like dormant eighth that comes into staking because then it just becomes like wow okay i can get twenty percent east denominated yield why wouldn't i do that there's going to be a lot of new kind of like eighth being staked i believe um and i think even just the narrative of that like it would would be bullish because people would be like oh you know the yield's so high that means people are going to buy ethan stake it like that means the price is going to go up and it comes becomes like the self-fulfilling thing right a lot of crypto is narratives and self-fulfilling things but i think that would be a big one um but it also goes back to what you know we were talking about before about how how much of the kind of like ecosystem crypto ecosystem understands all of this sort of stuff like not just the high yield that's coming post-merge for each staking but also all the other things happening and you know going back to earlier when we were talking about the numbers around one five five nine i think so many people were surprised by how much eighth was being burned and i'm like how are you surprised like we talked about it for a long time this that the metrics were there it wasn't hidden i was posting about it not just me but all of us we were posting about it on twitter all the time and people were still surprised by this so that just is empirical evidence that basically shows me that uh there's a very few people who actually one understand all this stuff um from kind of like a higher level but also understand the impacts of it on eth by the short term and the longer term and i think that that's going to play out the same way with kind of like this staking yield and people seeing that and being like i didn't know about this when it has been public information um just like everything else was public information i mean i remember in january of 2019 ether just falling fallen 94 it was around 100 i wrote a blog post titled why ether is valuable and i had feedback from a bunch of people in this group as well on that and kind of like helped me write it but i was talking about the staking the merge the burn everything everything at that price point so when you kind of like talk about that sort of stuff and talk about how do people actually understand this i would say that very few people understand it at all and that's probably the most bullish case for ether i could give is that you're still early even though you think you're not this is uh this is so good and guys so here's where i think we need to shift the conversation though is because can i point out just one quick thing yeah to answer your question david i'm that's that's what i was referring to earlier with um the concept of the carry trade and just kind of a super simple example for people who aren't familiar especially crypto people but like you know let's say you're sitting on um some usdc uh you're not really doing anything with it and all of a sudden maker increases their die savings rate or the dsr to 20 right well then you're automatically uh incentivized to either you know trade in your usdc for die uh which would push the price up so you could get the staking uh reward or uh let's say you're sitting on eath uh then you would kind of borrow funds off of your eath collateral which you would then use to purchase dye to then stake it um and we we saw this um kind of my my favorite examples of this was in a defy summer last year when a yield farming first came became a thing um on compound you could earn you know a pretty high uh apy on staking bat there's like kind of a really high bat yield and you know we saw this kind of rush to just purchase bat um uh the bat token even you know kind of irregardless of the uh the price volatility um and kind of led to some interesting price dynamics but my point is you know we've seen empirical examples of of when when the apy of a particular asset jumps drastically there's typically a follow through of uh investment okay so here's the thing and i i want to maybe uh get to the point of the conversation where we start to answer some of the critics about ether so uh one of the critics has famously said that um eath holders like to sit around jerking off to the burn and i wonder if if somebody listening uh heard what we were just saying and all of the amazing bullish things that are happening to eat the asset is asking themselves well what about users what about gas fees what about ethereum's scalability story and i i want to both position ourselves as a as a listener who's maybe asking that question but also to address that listener and and to also say this um if we if we rewind the clock to a year ago at this time again no one actually believed in everything that we were just saying ether as an ultrasound money right it like we were fighting the narrative battles were fighting for that to be a thing the popular narrative was you know bitcoin is the the asset ether is an interesting maybe commodity but it's not a store of value right now look at how far we've come now that is generally accepted and so the fud has turned into well now eath holders are a bunch of rent extractors and they're just trying to get eath value to go up and up and up like a year ago at this time folks remember um like the the popular narrative was that eth would never retain value and like would just be a sort of a um a you know a commodity that people don't store but they just use to purchase gas and then they kind of cast away so we've come far from one perspective and now i think the ethereum community has to really address the question of of gas fees and i'm going to make a statement i'm wondering if uh if you guys agree with this but i think that the story of ultra scalable ethereum it's the modular blockchain story is just as underrated now as ether the asset was at this time last year and i want to have discussion on that and and see if you agree but maybe i could turn it to anthony first can you tell the story of how ethereum scales into the future what is this we've referenced it a few times we've called it the roll-up centric roadmap we've called it modular blockchains i just called it ultra-scalable ethereum what is ethereum's scalability roadmap and why aren't we there yet why have gas fees gone so high and what is the hope for users to actually use this system again without paying you know 20 fees to trade something on uniswap yeah so i i think first off i totally agree with you that i think ethereum scalability is at the same place ether as an asset was probably you know same time last year definitely getting very similar vibes on that and getting a lot of people that just don't understand it which you know i can definitely explain it for for everyone you guys did a great episode on this as well uh the ultra scalable ethereum one so people should check that out too but the tldr is basically that ethereum wants to remain decentralized and secure at the base layer now in order to do that the most fundamental thing is that the chain can be run and verified as like a full node by the regular consumer on a regular consumer laptop or a pc or something like that and it shouldn't require some kind of data center or some kind of beefy hardware to do this that is the fundamental kind of thing behind why the gas fees are high because if we were to increase the block size for example which is kind of like the gas limit in ethereum we make it harder for end users to verify the chain and it could also leave the chain instability uh between kind of like the the miners and things like that as well um kind of staying in sync with the chain we saw this play out with bsc where they just raised the gas limit up incredibly and to run the bsc chain you need beefy hardware and there was still a lot of issues for people to keep it in sync because they were just using the evm which you know has not been optimized to to go to those kind of gas limits just yet so that's kind of like the fundamental reason why uh we're keeping the base layer decentralized and secure and keeping it limited and how many transactions it can process um then enters the roll-up centric roadmap so this roadmap basically stipulates that okay well since we want to keep ethereum layer 1 as decentralized and secure as possible and because of that is a result of um the fact that it's kind of limited in its in its scalability and it's throughput let's take this uh kind of the heaviest kind of work off layer one and put it on layer two now the heaviest work is obviously processing transactions right um doing that actual execution of those transactions and this is what rollups do they basically take the execution do it on any pc that you want you can have beefy hardware at layer 2 it doesn't matter you can run these kind of things run the the transactions run the proofs and then post these proofs and what's called call data to layer one ethereum so essentially what ends up happening is that layer two acts as the compute engine and layer one acts as the settlement engine where you basically have this layer one attesting to the validity of what's happened at layer 2 and keeping it secure and keeping it available as well which is very important so that you know the data and the and the proof of the transactions is always there now what that does is it gives users the benefit of if the layer 2 goes away if it goes offline if it shuts down if they run away it can't actually steal your money you can always get your funds back from layer one ethereum because the funds actually exist on layer one still they've just been bridged over to these layer twos in order for you to enjoy the cheaper transactions because rollouts basically pull all the transactions together um by computing them off chain and then posting it to posting a proof of that to to layer one now that's the roll-up-centric road map but what also feeds into that is what people have heard about before what's called charting and this is layer 1 scalability so with sharding essentially what we want to do is we want to split the block chain or split the ethereum layer 1 into multiple parts but the shards are just going to act as what's called data availability layers to allow rollups to just dump their data onto the shards and um for a much cheaper price than doing it on the existing kind of like ethereum chain they can do it you know on either kind of like chain there but allows them to kind of like dump what they need to onto there and it's still just as secure as as kind of like as it normally is but you have a lot more capacity so it's it it's essentially horizontal scalability at layer one you can imagine it kind of like like that and then vertical scalability is layer two and they both feed off of each other and they both kind of like allow each other to increase the overall throughput of ethereum and then that's what's called the modular kind of like architecture where you have where you split the the concerns where ethereum layer 1 remains decentralized and secure as a settlement layer ethereum layer 2 is the compute layer uh where all the transactions get processed and obviously ethereum layer 1 is also the data availability layer with you know as it is today but also with sharding that enhances that and then sometime else into the future we also have what's called statelessness coming to ethereum which would allow us to increase the gas limit much higher than what it is today which gives us even more capacity at layer one which enables potentially at layer two millions if not tens of millions of transactions per second while still retaining the decentralization and security of layer one ethereum so you're not just sacrificing that you're not just requiring like end users to trust these layer twos all they have to do is run a full node on layer one and they get the same guarantees no matter kind of like where they're at there so maybe that that is a bit technical for some people but that's kind of like the the the view of how ethereum is scaling and final point the reason it's taken so long is because it's bloody hard to scale systems in a decentralized way it's it you know all of this would be very easy if we just said oh who cares about decentralization let's just jack the gas limit up let's have a few miners let's have a few you know or even just stakers running the chain that's all well and good there's been layer ones that have done this right um and they're just taking a different path but that's not the path that ethereum wants to take that is not what we are building this stuff for and yes there's short-term pain for users they have to kind of like uh put up with the high gas fees there's alternatives they can use and that's all well and good but with the layer two ecosystem they're going to do what these alternative l1s do in terms of scalability but also give you ethereum security and decentralization too which is the most important thing at least in my view um and and then that's why it's taking so long because roll ups are a technology that's been worked on for many many years i believe arbitrary started working on them in 2014 for for bitcoin i don't even think they were working on it for ethereum because ethereum didn't exist until mid-2015 as a live network so this isn't an overnight thing this has been coming for a very long time but we needed to get to a point where essentially we did it in the correct way and we had guarantees that it was all valid and it would all work and it would actually work at scale which is obviously the most important thing so so yeah so one of the implications here dc of what anthony just said is that it seems like the ethereum main chain is not really for users right like right now it is but if this modular blockchain approach uh plays out and rollups play out it's really a settlement layer for chains not a settlement layer for users like users would actually start their live and live their entire life in some sort of a roll-up ecosystem what do you think like first of all is that is that true and what does this mean for the average user and do you think that ethereum and its scalability approach as anthony just described how can that be competitive with all of these alternative layer ones that we've seen rise up over the last you know six to nine months or so so i think that um you know first no centralized development blockchain team and ethereum is not ethereum is the least decentralized in terms of or excuse me most decentralized in terms of how it actually does development at layer one right we've got the different client teams who are all working on a spec they work together to set that spec and they execute right that is that that kind of process and the technology that we have at layer one is not gonna allow for significant scalability at layer one there are things like sharding and execution and charting that we may eventually get to i mean i do think we're gonna have data sharding sooner rather than later i think a lot of people realize that that is a priority as we move into a roll-up-centric world but the reality is a lot of execution if not like almost all of it will shift to these layer twos and that's actually a positive because when we get as we move into this future this layer two future it's not just one team that's developing the one roll-up solution it is a bunch of different teams all competing in the free market to develop competitive solutions and i think that is going to be like a really powerful driver for innovation i think a lot of people who are in crypto will hopefully intuitively understand that they understand how capitalism works and i just think we're going to unlock a lot of innovation through that process how do we get there and what does it mean for your average user i think we do need to see a couple of infrastructure pieces fall into place so one we need the roll-up technology operable so that users can use it i think we're there on some of the roll-ups already which is really exciting and we're gonna see the starkware and zksync solutions come out relatively soon which will have pretty close to generalized evm compatibility that'll be exciting one of the key things that we do need is exchanges to support withdrawals to these layer twos and i think we're going to see more of that in 2022 we've already seen a little bit of that on some of these layer twos but not as much as we need and i think once we get there we will be in a world where users can just interact with a layer two they never need to settle they never need to withdraw assets to layer one they are just working in layer twos and we will have bridges connecting the layer twos and that is gonna be how most people interact with ethereum and by the way that there's also potential for improving ux in that process versus using layer one using layer one is still it reminds me of my early internet days when i was doing like hacky stuff to get my computer to work right but that's how layer one works it's it's designed for machines to use almost it's not really great for humans to use but layer two can solve a lot of those ux issues i think smart contract wallets will become the norm i think users won't have to manage keys these are the things i see playing out over the next three years cyrus um what if we're wrong about that i saw a tweet this morning here that said something like extreme decentralization is just a solution looking for a problem it's just a very small market demand okay and it went further to say uh ethmaxis have yet to wake up to that what if what if we here just eat maxis that haven't woken up to the world saying hey we don't really care that much about decentralization you don't need to push it that far we're happy on some of these more centralized chains we just want low gas fees what if users don't care about decentralization cyrus what would you say to uh to that well i think i think that's just empirically false i'm just looking at uh the bitcoin market cap you know it's just kind of dominating the space and dominating the narrative uh clearly there's a there's a need for um you know there's a value there i think maybe what the tweet is getting wrong is that uh kind of the more transactional crypto community doesn't necessarily care about um about decentralization especially when they're already using somewhat pseudo-centralized tokens and coins like usdc and tether um but that's not the whole story right there's like this huge swath of wealth coming in from you know all over the world that that are just looking for a place to park their capital um you know we've talked about at length about kind of the the reach for yield and trying to store your store your capital in a world that's slowly being overrun by inflation and you know they're not necessarily the most vocal um vocal group especially in kind of the more in the smart contract ecosystems but they're definitely driving the most value um so so yeah sure you know retail users who just want to trade on on on dexes and whatnot they don't care as much that's that's fine but so so what right there's like clearly this huge contingency of of investors worldwide that definitely definitely do care and that's kind of why the market cap rankings have have uh shaken out the way that they are right now and i mean i guess that's maybe a justification for bitcoin's one trillion dollar valuation right it is highly decentralized it's a store value asset and so people value it as such and of course like the market cap of bitcoin reflects in the economic security of the bitcoin network and the same is true for ether as well i wanted to run like an idea um by the panel as well as i was thinking it's like if this whole module as this whole modular blockchain thesis plays out when we talk about the users not caring about decentralization you have to kind of ask yourself well who are the users of the ethereum main chain right because they're not necessarily individuals anymore as we just said many of the users of the settlement block space of ethereum will actually be chains and so then you have to ask the question of do chains care about decentralization and i think that's a different question entirely you're not talking about the average joe who's just like hey i want my you know gem on uniswap and you know i want to pay one dollar gas fee i don't want to pay 50 gas fees we're talking about entire chains like zk sync optimism arbitrarium their entire ecosystems how valuable will they rate decentralization on their their uh priority list what's your take on that anthony yeah i mean i think i was thinking about this when cyrus was talking too i think that framing the question about as kind of like do users care about decentralization has two parts to it your your point about kind of like what users are actually using layer one ethereum and which will use their one or three over the long term and you're right it'll be chains right it'll be a layer twos and things like that it won't it'll and it'll be whales as well right it won't really be the everyday user i mean we're already at that point but i also think that decentralization is just security as well it's another way to think about it so if you ask users do you care about security like most of the time they're going to say yes right like 9 out of 10 are going to say yes i think that um and by saying yes they also implicitly are saying they care about decentralization as well because it's just they go hand in hand so and i also think that people say they don't care about a lot of things until they do like you can say oh god insurance is so expensive for my car like i hate having to pay this i don't really care about it and then you get into an accident and you're like oh i'm really glad i had that insurance because otherwise it would be kind of like paying a lot of money and it's the same for like basically all insurance i think that's like the classic example that's used but also just kind of like um in the real world like contracts a lot of people don't like contracts like oh i have to sign another contract this is uh but then you have that contract there if something goes wrong if you didn't have that then um you'd have to go to court you'd have to kind of like battle it out and it would be up to the court to decide who was right and who was wrong you still go to court you know if the contract if you want to dispute the contract but the reason why we have contracts is so that we can kind of like settle you know things between people and have like a written thing that people agree to um so the same is true for a theorem there's a contract within ethereum that basically says you know ethereum is a decentralized and secure network hey layer twos you can come and you can settle on us you can you can kind of like uh post your data on here and we can give you like you know it's not gonna be 100 guarantee but we can give you a really high guarantee that your data and proof of your transactions are going to be secure that they're always going to be online and that users are always going to be able to access it just like your you know users as in everyday users just as you are going to be able to access it as a kind of like layer 2 chain as a user so i think the yeah the correct question is to basically pose it to users of like of course you care about security like you care about your assets being secured you care about people not being able to kind of like steal your assets so then you implicitly care about decentralization even if you say you don't you you do like i'm sorry but like people can say whatever they want actions speak louder than words yeah i totally agree with that um that narrative because the the term decentralized decentralization doesn't really mean anything but like if you think of decentralization as like anti-corruption technology right and and if you ask someone like do you care that like the system where you store all of your wealth is if it's corruptable or not right if like if like insiders can take advantage and bend the rules in their favor everyone will say of course i want the least corruptable system uh which is the most decentralized system every single time and that's exactly why people store their money in a bank instead of under their mattress right they know the bank is more secure than their mattress so right like it's just people already do this they just don't realize they're doing it because it's just ingrained into them about security they you know as humans we kind of like it's built into our our dna that we need to protect ourselves we need to defend ourselves and we do that in different ways all the time but it's you know as soon as you start posing the literal questions to people they're kind of like oh it's not something that i actually think about so you know and then it's like well you do care about it because you treat things like that you lock your doors right you put an alarm on if you have that in your house you have security cameras um that's the same kind of concept here your security cameras or your security system with ethereum is its decentralization so that's how i kind of think about it arbitrim is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and now it's live with over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on the ethereum l1 sucks too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrom have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization that's why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrom many defy applications that are on the ethereum layer 1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrary and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer twos there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.albertrum.io and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed and start having a defy experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the default apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space so there's a growing theme uh that i'm noticing and i find it particularly interesting uh and hazu has talked about this how ethereum culture is downstream of bitcoin culture and now we're watching these new chains with these newer users kind of have the same reaction to the incumbent chain the the ethereum chain in the same way that ethereum people once had a reaction towards the bitcoin chains like oh uh you guys are are lost the plot like you guys don't don't care about the users um you guys are just religiously uh zealots about just like purity standards and and just talking down on newer chains our ethereum maxis just bitcoin maxis 2.0 are are we the new maxies the incumbent maxis dc uh would you have an opinion on this well i do think that there are individuals who exhibit more maximalist tendencies right so yeah you can find that person that's just yelling ether is the only asset that should be worth anything and everything else is worth zero do i think that's a predominant view in the ethereum ecosystem frankly i don't i think that ethereum inherently is a pluralistic blockchain right we i mean in bitcoin is a mono asset chain by definition there's only one asset on bitcoin it's bitcoin on ethereum there's hundreds thousands of assets and so i think we have always been comfortable with the fact that other assets are going to accrue value i think where the ethereum community has taken exception is there's been a lot of undeserved there's been deserved criticism of ethereum but there's also been a lot of undeserved criticism where we're criticized for focusing on things like decentralization and there are certain people who are like well these things aren't important all that matters is how much tps you can transactions per second you can put out well if that's all that's important to you by all means use one of these other chains right i mean i'm not and i'll never tell anybody hey don't use some other chain all i will say is these are the kinds of trade-offs and assumptions you are making when you choose to use another chain if that chain better meets your needs then use it and i think there's a lot of people in the ethereum community who feel that way but i think what where we take umbrage is we're not going to listen to everybody just like put out false narratives about ether and ethereum anymore times have changed right and i think that this narrative that's being pushed of like well ethereum doesn't care about its users is simply false right i think ethereum cares about its users a lot to the point where we maximize security for them right that is what ethereum maximizes for for security and the blockchain doesn't go down once every couple of weeks right it's it stays up and so we prioritize that bulletproof consistent operation which is what you need i think to secure trillions of dollars worth of value right and so when we think about the future of ethereum and we think about like what is what is going to be better ux as we've been talking about i think actually users are going to continue to use it and l2s because that is where the liquidity will be because the really big depositors understand these things right even if your retail user that's depositing ten dollars in deciding to put it on an l2 or solano or avalanche right they might not understand but the person that's deploying a hundred million dollars understands these things and they're acutely focused on this right and they're the ones who are adding value to a lot of these apps and retail participants then come in behind them so i think beyond all these things that we've talked about users will follow the liquidity and they're going to follow the value okay so let's wrap up the eth scalability discussion with this so so many users are still asking is eth going to scale dc is eth going to scale what's your confidence on each scalability roadmap it's v it's very strong i think it's going to be a very uncomfortable period as we get there to be perfectly honest but i think that you know in talking with the development teams everybody's going to be at the layer one we're going to be focusing on data sharding coming straight out of the transition to proof of stake so we're going to start working on that immediately and i think that the layer two teams have learned a tremendous amount they have working product now and we're gonna see bridges get better and we're gonna see the exchanges bridge in so i'm confident anthony are you confident as well and how soon does this happen we've been waiting a while yeah i mean i've i've never been more confident in ethereum scaling roadmap as i have grown to being over the last six months obviously we've known about a lot of these things but kind of like the picture wasn't very clear because there was a lot of moving parts to it but i think that everyone in the community or at least most people in the community the ones that spend every day in here working here work you know work on everything they understand they're coming to grips with the ultra scalable road map we've had a really great cheerleader in polynya who is a relatively new entrance to twitter who i talk about a lot on my show and you guys talk about a lot as well but they've been able to really shape the narrative and push forward on this kind of narrative about a modular ethereum and i think that has given everyone you know a lot more confidence in it and i think the fact that these things are live or some of them are live right now is is just um giving a lot of people confidence in the ethereum scaling roadmap as well so yeah never been more confident i think that 2022 is gonna be a really great year for layer twos i think that all of them or most of them are to do tokens as well which is really going to bootstrap the growth of these things and it's really going to change the narrative because people want to hold something right i mentioned this earlier people want to be early to something they want to hold a token they want to get value out of it they can do that with each but they can also do it with other things and once you hold a token you become a very ardent supporter of something like it actually changes you know i'd love to see a study done on this but it really changes people's mindset and how they treat these things so i do think that uh alto's uh and just scalability in general with ethereum have never been at a better place than it is today cyrus how about you you've been with ethereum since the early days how confident are you in the scalability roadmap or gas fees uh going to become reasonable for the transact or user class well i mean i'm not like much of a technical guy in that respect but you know i'm watching uh tvls i'm watching uh uh dex volumes i'm watching kind of like general user adoption of these layer twos uh kind of taking a more empirical approach uh i've never been one to like kind of um [Music] push people to use a certain product or l2 or whatever i'm just kind of waiting to see if they're naturally drawn to these to these platforms right like people should want to uh naturally migrate onto the l2s uh maybe maybe they need a little bit of a push with some uh liquidity mining incentives um which i think is totally normal and and appropriate um i think the numbers have been you know again i'm not like the most knowledgeable guy but i think the numbers have been pretty pretty decent for for what we've seen for arbitrary and obviously polygon has morphed into this massive ecosystem of its own and you know you guys are just saying like this is all just sort of getting started right like optimism is getting ready to take its white list off uh we really haven't seen much in the way of um zk ups beyond um kind of just a few things here and there but we're still waiting for it to like morph into this massive um platform for for users so yeah you know it sounds exciting right like we're seeing some traction the you know there's a lot of work and effort being put into it like i guess my question is like why how why wouldn't what are we seeing you know question to you guys like what are we seeing that is is putting you you know putting cause for concern right from the l2 ecosystem were we expecting you know sure in timelines yeah we would have all loved to see this you know years ago but now that these things have launched is the you know the adoption metrics seem to be pretty good to me right it's like about as good as i could expect for these new these new platforms that have just launched in the past couple months i mean i would definitely agree with with that um i think that the growth has been has been decent i think that tokens always supercharge growth i was actually looking at um the avalanche c chains tbl the other day and you can literally pinpoint where they added their token incentives like that's what really kick-started it and you know for better or worse that's how you get users to use these things i mean ethereum started the same way with d5 summer like d5 was still this very niche small thing until d5 uh summer happened and liquidity mining happened and yield farming happen and that really just gets the flywheel going so you need that nudge i think every new ecosystem needs this i don't think you know you need to give the users an incentive to move across especially when bridging fees are still quite high and we don't have centralized exchange bridges into these l2s so i think that's why i mentioned the tokens you know once they go live and they start doing these you know they do an airdrop they do some liquidity mining that's going to supercharge it like to the next level that's going to get you know a lot of people to migrate across for sure all right guys i want to get specific here with regards to the markets and prices because as we wrap up to a close i think that's what really everyone wants to hear as they go into their holiday their holiday break so where are we in the market these days because there seems to be a lot of bears out there there's a lot of people paying attention to the fed there's some macro concerns some people are really bullish some people are really really spooked where are we in the market and what do you guys expect from from maybe in q1 2022 up down flat anthony i know you pay attention to the markets pretty closely what do you think yeah i mean you mentioned kind of like the fed the macro environment i think that's playing a big part in crypto these days a much bigger path that it has traditionally had because we have a different set of actors now we have lots of institutions we have a lot more money in here and those kind of investors traders whatever you want to call them they definitely pay attention to the macro environment and they kind of like make moves based on that but traditionally end of year in december is kind of like a bit of a lull period but besides some kind of like outliers like 2017 december was a really big month obviously for for bitcoin and then ether followed on from that um but usually december can be quite it can be quiet because it's the holiday period um people are selling for taxes as well it's a big kind of like source of cell pressure for a lot of uh for the market um and also you have a bit of uncertainty as well i think uh generally right now as you mentioned like the fed stuff and inflation's like super high too like i mean anyone who says they can understand the macro environment is lying i think there's very very few people i mean there's some people but there's very few people who can actually accurately kind of like predict what's going to happen i mean you know everyone was a bear until this meeting today and then the meeting happened the fed meeting and then the prices went up right it's kind of like okay well everyone was saying that would go down and if the rates were going to increase and it's just very hard to read that environment in terms of crypto specifically i think that i mean in terms of e specifically i don't really know about about the rest of the ecosystem but aid specifically i think q1 and q2 is going to be really good for eth because we have the merge coming up in q2 hopefully which is a massive narrative driver that that kind of like triple hardening that people hear about that massive issuance reduction is going to play a really big part in that i think i think layer 2 adoption is going to play a really big part into changing the narrative around ethereum just saying okay well ethereum can actually scale like this is awesome just get on the l2s and you know you can enjoy these cheap transactions and it's still ethereum at the end of the day uh so i think those are the two main narratives in q1 q2 that should drive eighth kind of like higher i'm still expecting obviously a 10k ethan beyond um you know very very bullish on that just timeline's always a bit difficult especially when the macro stuff comes into play like i couldn't begin to understand or describe what how the macro is going to affect the price of each let alone the crypto markets more broadly but i do think it's a positive thing that we're more correlated to nutritional markets because it means we have the more institutionalized player it means we're going to have bigger money coming into the ecosystem and not just buying the assets but participating and adding liquidity to things like defy which is going to benefit all users so that's just my general view um just yeah i mean the next six months very very bullish for for those reasons anthony do you think eth is going to outperform alternative layer ones in 2022. it's a it's actually an interesting question because i think some of them are high beta to eath where they actually will just outperform eighth because people are like well it's this market cap so why can't these ones go to this market cap like they have traction they have users they have you know an ecosystem i think you know we've already seen that play out with something like a solana and an avalanche their tokens have outperformed each this year celina much more um it's out you know it's greatly outperformed eth which is fine but if you're talking about like five years you know over the longer term it's impossible to tell but i would caution against most of these things outperforming especially as the l2s come online with tokens i think um the other alternative l1s that value is going to bleed to l2 tokens and it's going to be kind of like this this kind of wishy-washy stuff going on i mean you can look at uh matic as a perfect example of a and a scaling token on ethereum that's performed better than all the alternative l1s this year i believe in terms of like price performance uh but in terms of long term against eth very few of them are going to outperform eight in the long term like maybe one or two but picking those one or two is going to be hard it might seem obvious right now people might be like oh i can just buy soul or avax and that's going to be fine well what if it's not what if in two years they didn't really go anywhere because the l2 ecosystem took all their market share i don't i don't know like it's too hard and it's just going to be very interesting to see over the long term like i'm talking five years what's actually going to happen because look at five years ago in 2017 or four years ago um with all the l ones that are around back then they're all never reached their all-time highs in usd and are massively down against eth so it's just it's so it's very very difficult to predict what's gonna happen but short term to medium term i can see some of these l ones greatly outperforming each just based on narrative and lone hype cycles that's just the way it is but um you know if you can catch that and stack more eth more power to you but uh a lot of people don't lots of people will kind of like hold them and hold it down to the bottom like they did with the 2017 era l1s dc what about you when you see the the current market structure current macro environment what's really paying attention what are you really paying attention to what's on your radar these days so there's still obviously uncertainty in the macro environment but i think we're still in an era of money printing you know and that's that's probably not going to change significantly anytime soon even if rates go up a little bit and so i do think crypto is somewhat correlated to macro in the sense of if the macro economy just crashes right i don't see crypto being spared from that necessarily um i i see that that because crypto is still viewed as a risk asset you know even with all of the um all the pushing of the narrative that people have said like bitcoin is a hedge against inflation i don't know if that's really i don't know if that trade is fully played out people treat bitcoin and most of crypto like risk assets like stocks even um i do think what's interesting in crypto is that the market seems to have fractured in ways that we haven't seen before and when i say that i mean we used to see a pretty clear behavior of like bitcoin pumps than ethereum pumps then all of the other alt coins pump right and everybody and the participants were a smaller group but everyone would kind of rotate into the same trades at the same time and and what that meant was that increased the price reflexivity when people would rotate like that right because if you have all those people piling in from one asset you know bitcoin tops let's all rotate into ether it sends this price like soaring right and we're not seeing that kind of behavior in the same way and i think that's because we have more assets we have nfts are now in the picture we have more chains that people are invested in and some of them may or may not be leaving their ecosystems and we just have more participants right so there's a possibility that we're going to see somewhat reduced reflexivity moving forward but i think actually long term if that is the case that means we're entering a period where crypto valuations might be more sustainable right and if there's any rationale to believe that we're in a post-four-year cycle world and we're not going to have another 85 to 95 percent bear draw down in like let's say bitcoin and ether that's it in my opinion but i my just my general feeling is humans are um i i will believe in cycles until they stop occurring because i think that humans tend to be motivated by greed and you know when you see emerging technologies and this was true of internet stocks as well people saw promising stuff start to take off narratives built up and then everybody started to pile in right and that will then attract that reflexive price accident investment as a result of that but i think the reality of where we are is crypto fundamentals are so strong that the industry has been de-risked for participants for people working in the space for people investing in the space and that's going to drive a lot more capital flow and whether we have a blow off top bull market and and then you know and then a bear rush period that follows that i don't know if that is going to continue to happen or not but i think demand for crypto is definitely going up into the right right we're going to keep going up and i think that's what's important cyrus what about you when you look at the charts look at the markets look at cnbc look at fast money what do you hear i mean does anybody realize how massively bullish it is that you know with with all of this fud and negative sentiment and all the macro concerns that we've gone through for the past few months like heath fell from its all-time high down about 25 down you know from 4 800 to 3600 roughly um you know i don't know if like investors have grown soft or whatever but 25 that you know we used to have those in like one day in the last cycle you guys remember just like randomly like the entire you know coin market cap would be down uh like 25 percent um for no reason right um that means there's like you know and it felt like there was a lot of energy expended to push prices down right just just from how how people were kind of freaking out and to me that just signaled that there's just an insane amount of uh by support there's there's just a lot of people buying the dip at the i think at the institutional level um otherwise there's like no right like nothing has happened that anybody should be concerned about from from an up only perspective right this is like this is like just full send right now as far as i can tell um i i i can't you know i'm i'm obviously super bullish but like i'm just trying to contextualize that like the price has performed extremely well given everything that's that's going on and you know all the negative sentiments so yeah i think we're i think we're good for you know we're i think we're still on track i think things are still going very well right guys we got this far into you guys guys we got this far into uh eath bull episode we didn't even say the word flipping which i'm astounded about and you're you're talking about eath strength uh there cyrus and you know i'm reminded at the ratio is uh getting close to not quite there but getting close to all-time highs right and we'll have to monitor where that goes moving forward maybe we should uh we should ask that question now it's like prediction time all right it's prediction time uh so price of eth at the end of 2022 and in 2022 will eth have flippened bitcoin or not that is a question put toward the eath bulls right now anthony those two questions what do you think i think eth can flip bitcoin leading up to the merge i think the merge narrative is going to be so incredibly powerful it is going to perpetuate everywhere even east haters are going to be buying and promoting eth because they know the trade is so juicy especially when we get like more of a kind of confident merge date or at least window like if they say they being the core developers and researchers that are confident about a june merge like if they say something like that i feel like the trade is on in a really big way um i feel like it's already on i feel like there's people acquiring eighth for this trade but obviously um as time goes on the trade gets bigger and bigger more money pours in so if it's gonna happen i think it's gonna happen then um and i don't know if it's going to be temporary or permanent i would wager that there's going to be a lot of volatility so it could be a temporary flip and then ethan btc fight for number one for a little bit but i think that it's very different to 2017 where there was nothing holding eighth up against bitcoin now there is a lot holding ether up against bitcoin so even if it is a temporary flip you're gonna have uh i i think eth will just gradually permanently flip bitcoin like even if it happens like six months after the temporary flip or whatever i've always been bullish on that i've never kind of like waved on that um and in terms of price predictions it's very hard to tell what if it's going to be at the end of 2022 it could pump really hard going into the merge it could go up to like 20k 30k or something and then by the end of 2022 it could just be a 10k because it came down off that or something like that i i it's very hard to tell but um i think that yeah if he's going to flip bitcoin it's going to have to be leading up to the merge because that's just the most powerful narrative that ethan's ever had really more powerful than one five five nine i i say this the one five five nine is like the appetizer and uh the merge is the main course um dessert may be something else later on but uh i think the merch is the biggest upgrade in ethereum's history not just from a technology technological standpoint but also from a monetary perspective standpoint and more people are going to wake up to that because the narrative is just going to be too strong there we go anthony's calling a flipping possibly up in uh toward the merge and maybe eth price 10k the end of this year maybe we we go above that for a period of time uh but it's hard to tell dc what do you think uh you know i i i try not to focus too much on the flipping because i think the value that ethereum is creating is almost independent of what bitcoin provides and i'm not an anti-bitcoin person but i think if you just look at it objectively what is the narrative value that's going to propel bitcoin from this point and i think that there's there's a few things that are possible you can see that nation states might start to add it as a reserve asset we haven't seen a lot of that play out beyond el salvador but like that is something that could happen um but we're not really seeing it but the etf has already happened we've and granted it's not a asset-backed etf but it is a bitcoin etf and your average investor is not going to know the difference between a spot-backed dtf and a synthetic etf and that happened and it didn't really drive the price up so i think that bitcoin will continue to remain in this digital gold aspect compare that to ethereum which is going to be hitting on all cylinders i won't repeat everything anthony just said but like especially when you talk about that merge when you talk about how the narrative of ethan's a productive asset is going to take off and the scalability is going to hopefully start to kick into a meaningful way i just see a lot more upside for each so in that situation i see that flipping could be possible right it's not something that i'm necessarily waiting for but i am watching the eth btc ratio and i you know i tweeted today that i sold i didn't have a ton of bitcoin left but i sold the remainder of it because i feel like wow yeah just just looking at the charts and this is not financial advice you know my circumstances may be very different from your own but i feel like i'm very bullish on where ether is headed and into the following year you know i price targets are always difficult but nothing has fundamentally changed in my point of view and i said ten thousand to thirty thousand before and i'm gonna stick with that like whenever however this bull cycle plays out and if we don't get that manic blow off top then all the better we just grind up slowly and sustainably and eventually i think we'll still have that blow off top i just can't tell you exactly when feeling healthy now 10 to 30k maybe in in the next year or at least in this cycle uh not willing to predict the flipping but dc just sold his last bitcoin so what does that tell you cyrus what do you think flipping and then price predictions uh yeah you know i i spent so many years like you know obsessed with the flipping and kind of waiting for it to happen and it obviously um it petered out but i i think this was like the first year where where i noticed that there was like a palpable like people stopped caring about you know people from the youth community just stopped caring about bitcoin uh they kind of don't really even focus that much on the ratio anymore and you know just so happens that's the year where the ratio just explodes right so i think like i think that sentiment is like indicative of like you know eth is just kind of developing into its own uh its own its own thing and it just it doesn't really care about you know rankings or anything else like i you know i kind of want to say that really don't care too much about like uh the alt l ones either um and i think that's just kind of like bullish for me from a investor's standpoint like we're here for eth you know we're all pretty well informed for like you know what it's what it's been trying to do how far it's come and you know all that stuff and uh yeah i think if it continues to execute especially the merge like i i think the merges just seems like a very poetic catalyst for you know big price run up and you know potentially um snowballing into a flipping um like i just i wouldn't be surprised if that happens uh i also wouldn't care too much like i just i'm i'm i'm as least concerned about the flipping as i've ever been um if it happens great um if it does happen you know uh east price probably um you know i i just you know i see everything that's going on you know the the the way adoption is trending like you it's hard to envision that like eath does everything it's it's you know slated to do next year and the price only goes up from like 4k to like 7k you know that that just doesn't seem to like comport with reality for me for kind of the the gravity of you know or kind of the momentous nature of what's what exactly is going on right now especially in you know especially in the context of like the macro the macro cycle and you know i think uh there's clearly this shift towards more utility you know extracting utility out of blockchains and and bitcoin is just kind of continuing to lag on that front uh it's con continuing to lag on its scalability solution so if ever there was a time this is this has got to be it in my opinion you know i would i would bet on it and i have been betting on it so yeah let's see how it goes there we go price is higher this has been the eth bull panel this panel is bullish maybe more bullish than they were last year if that's even possible uh anthony dc cyrus thanks so much for joining us we really appreciate it thanks guys it's great action items for you today of course listen this podcast you got to be bullish being bullish
