[Music] hey bankless nation it is the second week of september and it's roll up time how you doing david pretty good ryan ready to get into the weekly rollup again so much happened this last week the crypto world only gets crazier and crazier got celebrities getting into crypto we had a flash crash nfts continue to do nft thing uh so we got to go ahead and get right into it and roll all of this up david did you uh get some gray hairs from that flash crash man it's like it's like an instant 25 down uh did that uh cause any pain nah no we we were on we were on a call while it happened i was like hey ryan look at the uh look go look at the eath price and you were like what what was it at is that what and i said oh it's at 3 000. you go oh wow 3000 is really doing well like no no no dude not 4 000 3 000. yeah for some reason yeah and then we popped right back up i was also not bothered by that anyway this is crypto this is what you come to expect and this is definitely what you come to expect in the roll-ups we get you the entire week that was crypto all packed into markets news some hot takes meme of the week we're about to get into it but before we do david we gotta tell them about so rare yeah so rare fantasy football on ethereum where you can actually pick out your team and create a fantasy sports but using nfts on ethereum so you can even create your lineups you create a select a captain you get points based on real performances as one does with fantasy sports and you can even get weekly prizes by playing fantasy football with silver what's super cool is these are all nfts right and they're all layer two nfts so that means like buy buy gas fees no gas fees on this um so rare just let us know too that laliga which is one of the top um five world football leagues just signed a major long-term nft partnership with them that just happened this week if you were a soccer fan if you're a football fan you know that is absolutely massive news that includes both of their leagues their first division laliga santander and also la liga smart bank that's super cool and i didn't know this david but uh so rare already has half a million registered users they've sold over 130 million dollars worth of nfts since january so this is absolutely exploding and it's no wonder right like you could see it coming we've got sports over here fantasy sports we've got nfts over here match made in heaven you add some some layer two so low gas fees and you've got a platform that is expanding and growing so bankless nation if you are interested in this go check them out at so rare dot com we'll include a link in the show notes that's s-o-r-a-r-e-dot-com go check it out just further proving that nfts are how ethereum markets itself to the rest of the world so thanks to solarware for sponsoring this bankless blitz totally true okay david we should get to the markets what's happening in bitcoin land yeah bitcoin started the week at 46 000 got down to the low of 45 250 got up to the high of 52 700 and then back down to where it is currently at 47 000 so overall down 3.5 percent on the week yeah look at that yeah you're muted ryan but yeah that is a straight line down from 52 000 down to 47 000 that it all happened within like two hours it looks like yeah i was just saying it looks like an elevator all the way down that happened on tuesday was it right like tuesday morning okay it's solid blur uh same thing happened with eath price right we see that elevator down effect so where did we start where do we end on the week started at 3760 uh hit a high of 3975 and then found a low at three thousand three hundred and we are currently clocking in at three thousand five hundred and twenty dollars overall down six point five percent on the week okay what's our ratio looking like the east to bitcoin ratio which we monitor uh on a weekly basis is are we up are we down we're a little bit down but not by much i believe we started the week at uh 0.7877 and now we are clocking in that point excuse me point zero seven eight i think is the the high that we also started the week at and then we are at point zero seven five so down three point four percent on the week let's explore this flash crash a little bit that's what they're calling it a flash crash of course this is larry cermak he said more than 2.6 billion worth of positions were liquidated in the last hour looks like there was a lot of leverage clean out and that was over 1.1 billion in bitcoin leverage flushed down the toilet 700 million dollars worth of eth larry says if you ask me perfectly healthy leverage flush uh funding rates on ultra spiking too much he says what's your take on this was just this just leverage getting flushed out of the market do we need to detox ourselves it's like leverage dude it's always like everyone gets really scared when like like some sometimes the crypto markets just like cut off like you know 15 of the total market cap in like you know like five blocks right like 15 minutes right and like and everyone like all my normie friends everyone asks like what caused the market crash was it a whale that dumped like no the answer is always leverage this has been leveraged every single time it will continue to be leveraged when you see these extremely violent rapid moves and it looks like the whole entire industry is going to zero for a brief moment and everyone gets spooked it's always leveraged people got too leveraged then they they levered up way too much then the market moved in a you know modest degree to the downside which caused some people to get liquidated cascading liquidity liquidations was caused liquidations and then it bottoms out at some point in time and overall like as far as a like uh cascading liquidations event this one was pretty modest uh this one was pretty modest it's it's funny because so i tweeted out uh not long after this david quick everybody go look for an unrelated news event to blame this flash crash on because i think that's what always happened what was interesting about tuesday was there was nothing really going on in the news so uh crypto media and like wider media couldn't attach any event to this thing i think if it happened maybe like wednesday or thursday they would have blamed it on the sec uh news with coinbase but of course this happened before that so sometimes these things just happen as david says it's like it's just leverage flushing its way out of the system one take for you i want to ask you a question i i saw a reddit post somebody said this is why crypto will never be mainstream it's because you can get it like uh an instant 10 15 20 uh drop in in terms of price what's your take on that yeah so the the reason why crypto always gets like these leverage flushes is because people keep on leveraging up because people are so incredibly bullish they're like oh i'm i missed out i need to grab more so i'm going to go on leverage and so it's really just like there's a the everyone in crypto is bullish so they're always leveraging up and like if everyone in this industry is bullish like that is a mainstreaming phenomenon like all all people in the crypto markets are bullish and that's why we this whole entire industry is proponent towards leverage and so when someone comes and says like this is why crypto will never be mainstream the reason why this happens is because everyone in crypto understands that we are going mainstream right like that's why we're all leveraging up all the time i also feel like uh what's going to happen is actually volatility is going to become normalized right yes i think people are just going to get used to it yeah right just like yeah a 10 20 day whatever as soon as we start creating tokens out of everything and then markets out of all of the tokens we just created we're gonna have spikes in volatility like this and it will become just part of the daily thing that happens this is not the s p 500 folks we don't have a fed backing these assets and a plunge protection team that's going to come out and make sure everything's like super stabilized we live in a real wild free market so we're not this volatility is not going away i think people just get used to it yeah i mean this is a different subject maybe not for the weekly roll up but i also think that like volatility volatility is going towards the traditional markets as well i think uh crypto is just a sign of things to come and also volatility if you can handle your volatility you are anti-fragile right it's the markets that can't handle anti that can't handle volatility are the ones that break uh and so this is why like crypto is a great foundation because we are born inside of like volatility like we are birthed inside of it it's like that bain meme like we understand volatility to the nth degree yeah absolutely one last thing i'll say is um don't take leverage folks be careful with margin this can happen in a hurry if this is your first cycle be very wary of taking leverage uh you could be the next one liquidated all right let's talk about this total locked value in d5 ah man we were skimming that 100 billion mark we got to 98 billion but now we're we're down david what are we looking at for total locked value in d5 yeah i think at the last weekly rollup we had just breached the last all-time high and even after of this liquidation flash like flash crash which again didn't really set us back all that much we are still like tied with the previous all-time high right so now that now the all-time high is 98 billion dollars locked in d5 we are clocking in currently at 90 billion locked in d5 uh but the overall definitely up on the week uh for sure let's talk about defy tokens themselves um where are we on the week it looks like we're down yeah we're down a little bit with the dpi start of the week at 425 dollars and we went down to 366 overall down 14 on the week so dpi d5 got hit harder than btc and eth down 14 on the week part of me wonders david if these defy tokens are starting to get attractive uh at least these ethereum d5 tokens like they haven't seen a bull run in a while and some of them i mean yfi is cranking out some serious cash i think it's valuation something like you know fair fairly low billion dollars or something like that uh anyway uh let's talk are you just teeing this up about how low the dpi ratio is i was trying to help you out here david but why don't you tell me what the dpi to width ratio is uh holding its head above water at point one um which is meaningfully below my point one three bottom call about thirty percent lower than it looks he said it beautifully blow yeah i know this is it did not hold hey it held it for a while put up a valiant effort but overall that downward slope from like the march high that dpi versus eth painted at 0.25 we are just continuing this downtrend setting new lows with with dpi versus eth well ether is holding up fairly strong and then dpi is kind of staying stagnant right i mean it's sort of the reason for this is a really tough benchmark to be evaluated against right like this isn't dpi versus the dollar this is dpi versus eth so like yeah like losing versus eth is kind of expected we've also seen some seasonal seasonal shifts which we'll get to in a little bit further as we talk about markets it very much seems like uh eath killer season alternative layer one season which we'll discuss in just a minute but before we do let's talk about the bed index where are we on the week this is of course bitcoin eth and dpi 30 30 33 uh a third a third a third split what are we looking at yeah this is the first week that the bet index had a meaningfully down week it's had other down weeks before but it was only like one or two percent this week the bet index is down eight percent from 164 to 149 but if you zoom all the way out the total all-time chart looks great it is still pretty solid and so we are the the bed index has some sort of floor that is painted right around like 145 to 150 uh and that's kind of what it's been doing for the past uh like month or so um ranging between 175 and 145 dollars uh so uh yeah that's the bed index invest in bed sleep comfy at night folks uh uma protocol is doing that they just purchased a million dollars worth of the bed index for their treasury it's pretty cool to see other dows dipping their toes in the water a good way to diversify your treasury if you are a a dow um let's talk about layer two's david one billion now locked in ethereum layer twos this does not include this is just layer twos we crossed that mark last week pretty massive yeah up to almost 13 percent on the week i believe we might have dipped below one billion uh in the because this tweet is i think two days old um but we crossed one billion and like we're right around it right now but overall definitely a lovely adoption by the l2 ecosystem yeah that's pretty impressive and we'll continue to monitor l2s but another way to look at l2 is this new metrics board that came out this is uh l2 fees dot info you can check out ethereum layer 1 is expensive but how much does it cost to layer 2 to use layer 2 that's the question and look at this loop ring clocks out at the cheapest this is to transfer eth only 37 cents per each whereas on ethereum right now if you're moving each round costs like nine dollars nine to ten dollars and then we see some other uh solutions here like hermes polygons hermes is uh 40 cents to transfer eth all the way up to optimism and arbitrary arbitration costs about three dollars optimism close to six dollars uh what's your take here yeah this is this there's a couple takes here this a illustrates the how more cheap zk roll ups are the versus optimistic roll ups all the zk roll ups are this the extra super super cheap ones uh clocking in at below a dollar the optimistic roll ups which are optimism and arbitrary they have throttles on their l2s right now because they're kind of still in their that rollout phase so they haven't actually totally unlocked all the capacity that they have uh and so like they just they just don't want to like just yeet into a fully just like open ecosystem and they want to have a more controlled rollout so they've throttled their their layer two capacity which is why those the eth transfers are still in the multiple dollars range um and but like as as they open up more capacity and as more people enter the l2 those numbers are actually going to come down and down and down over time so while we while we're kind of watching uh the ethereum l1 gas fees kind of be up only i also kind of think the l2 fees are generally going to be like flat or down only until it actually does hit some like inflection point where the actual capacity of these things do max out but we are still pretty far away from maxing out the capacity of our both arbitrary and optimism we talked about the subject in length with the arbitrary team on today's state of the nation and so if you want to understand the gas markets on optimistic roll-ups like to a pretty like expert level degree definitely watch that show with them yeah absolutely it helps me really understand um like gas fees on on arbitrary in particular optimism works similarly but as you were saying david as they get more users they actually are able to spread some of the fixed fees that it cost to settle on main chain across a wider set of users so gas fees go down for everybody and i i think we will see a continued decrease in gas fees on layer two but then um which is super interesting and we'll get to this maybe toward the end of the episode once we get data sharding in eth 2.0 that's just a massive unlock right where we get like a 90 reduction in fees yeah yeah even like it's just going to be absolutely crazy uh and that is a big unlock coming to e2 happening after the merge um sort of put that together after talking to arbitrator i'm talking about sort of ethereum's roll-up centric scalability path that it's on anyway some cool stuff there but let's talk about this they're also printing the revenue too these layer two so optimism had a record trading volume day yesterday um uniswap on optimism oh excuse me record trading yeah so you swap traded almost seven million dollars on optimism yesterday uh and so if you are frustrated by the gas prices on ethereum and you're still using uniswap on l1 consider moving over to optimism that's what it's for what's it like to move over david you've moved over i i assume a few times straight trialling poly poly gone trying optimism that sort of thing it just costs some fees to bridge across and then it's fairly easy after that right you use the same tools you have right no that's exactly right like you just point your metamask to a different rpc endpoint it's as simple as like dragging and dropping uh on a drop down menu i think if you go to the optimism site they actually even generate the prompt for you so you just have to click accept and then it's just one l1 transaction from your wallet to the optimism contract and then once you do that the money shows up in your wallet on the optimism chain uh and then you can like you know swap freely for funsies as much as you want it's great easy as that all right let's talk about the eath burn david it's had a crazy week in terms of the amount of eath being burnt of course that's because gas fees are high that's because ethereum block space demand is high but what are we looking at on the week as far as eth burn is this a record-setting week yeah we almost had seven days of deflationary issuance right so we had uh how much total issuance 94 000 ether issued in the last seven days and 87 000 of that ether was burnt due to eip1559 so we had a net issuance of 7 300 ether over the last seven days which over proof of work because or excuse me over uh pre eip1559 we actually reduced issues eip1559 reduced issuance by 92 uh and that is ex not even talking about proof of stake which also like lowers issuance by another like 90 uh so we are seeing watching ether become ultrasound in real time you know i saw this metric yesterday we don't have it up but um you know all of the eth that's been minted for eth 2.0 and as a result of of people staking right that's kind of collecting on this deposits into the deposit contract uh yes and but the issuance from the deposits in the deposit so the the staking reward essentially you take that entire like reward um and and you subtract well if you take the the entire amount of reward and you subtract the burn we've actually burnt more than everything we've issued in eth 2.0 which is absolutely crazy over the first like it's been 30 40 days now of eath burnt and we've already compensated for all of that additional issuance that has come up from the ethe 2.0 seeking contract so pretty phenomenal there um what what are we looking at this particular block you wanted to highlight this data yeah this is the new highest burned block ever so block number 13180434 congratulations to that block it burned 96 ether inside of one block 96 ether that's more ether than is what is issued over the next uh 45 blocks i think that's the right math um so that is pretty crazy the base fee for this block clocked in at 3 200 gray so like that's if going in like imagine going into your metamask and you're seeing like okay setting setting my next price to 3 200 well it was definitely an nft drop or no maybe this this actually could have been the liquid one one of the liquidation blocks right so this could have been a lot of like arbitrage uh and uh people like people actually liquidating people out of their positions in ave compound or dydx or any direct like leverage platform uh and so like this is uh where a bunch of like uh mev bots are competing to to buy out people's collateral because they were over collateralized and so this is where we get into the meme of bullish selling right so like if there's a bunch of liquidations it actually burns more ether because everyone's clamoring to buy block space uh it's always a fun little meme when we see like eath price goes down it but then it also burns a ton of eth in the process but that's what's funny about this right so we'd only see a block with gas prices gas fees this high if it was worth it for somebody to actually pay these to get the economic value out of that transaction if it wasn't worth it like we wouldn't see the gas fees bid up to this so this is an economically valuable block right i suppose it was worth it to somebody this block produced at least 96 ether worth of value for all the transactions inside of it that's one way to put it absolutely this is another graph of each first deflationary day david so if you guys are watching on on youtube you can see it depicted very well what are we looking at here yeah we're just seeing so in the blue we have the issuance and in the red we have the burn and i mean this is almost implied uh we said that we almost had our first week of deflation uh with with ether and its monetary policy we had actually two days inside of this week where ether was actually more deflationary than it was uh inflationary and we were just seeing these these gas fees just go up and up and up and it's largely because of nfts uh and there's actually some fantastic data about this that we're going to show yeah here is the second day so the two the top two days number one was the eighth of september which is yesterday at the time of recording and then the the number two day was uh the ninth of september which is today um and that was sixteen thousand eighth burned and then fourteen 14 800 eat burned on those last two days and then number three day was the fourth so it's all in september it's all in the last like two weeks or so and this is correlate correlated with nfts uh you could see that in this graph what are we looking at yeah so nfts are gas intensive since they are unique tokens they are unique objects and require like much more gas and computation to make a transaction and so all these nft activity is really that's over it's really over consuming gas on ethereum more than anything else right and so according to takes theorem this was a fantastic tweet um nfts account for 42 of the variation in the base fee as in like when you go and you look at like the base fee or the gui costs that get your transaction in 42 of the reason of why that number is whatever that number is when you look at it is because of nfts as in like nfts are dictating the direction of the gas cost on ethereum 42 of it like there's there's 58 of unaccounted like generalized ethereum activity uh that's not nfts and then 42 of that activity is nfts and so you can see like as nft markets heat up base feed prices also heat up well this is an interesting i think like segue into our next conversation which is this monster solana run and maybe even more broadly than this like a monster uh layer one alternative layer one non-ethereum eth-killer sort of run that we've seen because here's the narrative david um the ethereum people are over here celebrating like uh fee burns right and yeah we're celebrating hive nights we're celebrating high fees in a way right with this fiber metric which is good for the entire ecosystem uh and certainly way better than than pre-eip1559 meanwhile the it's costing eighty dollars to to do a uniswap transaction if i want to mint an nft maybe that's going to cost 150 like people are saying we can't afford to use ethereum and then they're also starting to see some nfts on other chains like some defy on other chains so solana is one avalanche is another so let's talk about that in the context of what we have seen over the last 30 days and even just this week even with despite the flash crash an absolutely monster run that solana has had so this is kind of 90 days 90 days ago solana was 37 now we're above 200 and i could look at that on the one year too it was even further yeah yeah it's like three dollars to over 200 an absolutely monster run what do you think is going on here what's the what's the narrative that's taken hold yeah well first and foremost it's always something when something moves this violently especially to the upside um and especially when it didn't have that much of like a history prior it's always reflexivity like people are seeing people pile into a trade and then they pile into a trade and then more people pile into the trade the amount of reflexivity that this uh kicked into gear was like absolutely insane i think this is one of the biggest like reflexivity price movements we've ever seen but when something goes from like 50 to 200 in the course of like 30 days like it's it's traders traders are acknowledging that people are uh also acknowledging like how solana might actually be the east killer that actually takes the east killer slot but then you also see like there's other other quote unquote eat killers that have also performed like just as well as solana in the last month like phantom comes to mind even binance smart chain polka dot and this happens every single bull run and just like we were talking about with with the high fees like ethereum has a certain amount of block space and it has like its population of people that's willing to consume that block space and as that population of people that is willing to consume that block space goes up so does the cost of buying that block space which also pushes out more and more people who and out prices them out of that block space and so those people have to find alternatives we like uh we are proponents of layer two alternatives but the other answer is that there's other blockchains that you can go do like crypto stuff on uh and so the the narrative the why these trades get reflexive is that everyone's like all right like people are going to like get priced out of ethereum where are they going to go and i think a lot of people have uh included solana as like the first and primary destination after ethereum that people go once they get price out of that block space and so this kind of kind of created that reflexivity in the price action and so people in my opinion people are pricing in solana as like the eath killer that like beat out all the other eats killers the eath killer that lived in the east killer that lived yeah yeah so i mean that that's an interesting narrative right it's like and here here's actually what this looks like on on token terminal as well so you can definitely see that as a function of the amount of transaction fees the revenue that it's producing it's it's still trading at a colossal multiple to eat so like as a function of transaction fee revenue eth is a price to sales ratio of about 40 whereas solana is 3 800. so salon is definitely pricing as if you if you take the lens of a capital asset it's it's pricing in a tremendous amount of growth right in order to justify that fee revenue would have to increase by 100 right to match what uh ethereum's doing but it feels like it has sort of consolidated and taken the mantle from a bunch of the other eighth killers although i will also make the argument that maybe we're just in a season here david like eath killer season okay we didn't get d5 season this summer uh but maybe we got eath killer season at least over the past couple of months because if you look at this um this is an assortment of all smart contract platforms and i'm going to sort this by 30 day david so you see like phantom you're talking about earlier that's even up more than solana over 30 days it's up 509 solana's up 388 but then you also have like near protocol 250 percent uh cadena 180 that's a blast from the past elgo rand 171 avalanche 161 over the last 30 days if you look at this year to date it's absolutely even like it's even crazier um you have to scroll all the way down i think to like number 40 or something to see ethereum uh in in the 30 days so it's also possible we're just in a season that we see every other cycle that this is kind of a new narrative that's taken hold do you think that's what's going on or do you think that some of these alternative layer ones actually have some staying power yeah i mean we definitely saw this in 2017 2018 like when ethereum was congested in 2017 we saw eos pump right afterwards uh but as soon as like the bear market came uh all the activity on the actual ethereum blockchain and the developer activity just died out and then as went the the eos price do i think that that is good we're going to just see a repeat of that like perhaps not i don't really think a bear market is going to come and therefore like more and more activity can come onto these non-ethereum chains because people are going to continue to be priced out of the l1 and then also not migrate over to the l2 and just choose to migrate to a different l1 also at the same time like eos has not seen the level of just like um brute force like marketing from like uh sam bankman freedom ftx right so this is going to be another thing we're going to talk about later on the show but like we get there there's tom brady like shilling ftx on on like global commercials right along with steph curry who also just signed a deal with ftx and fdx is kind of just a proxy for solana right like ftx is sam bankman freed solana's sam bregman freed so like if you're seeing ftx cast a wide net trying to capture new users those new users might be going over to solana because ftx is like incentivized to to like you know shill solana more than anything else so what does this mean does this mean do you think that the eth killer value proposition is winning is correct or are we just in a in a cycle that assumes it is what are we what are we what's the market pricing in here david yeah i think the market is pricing in people not prioritizing decentralization as the current cohort of people that find themselves inside of crypto um i think the people that aren't yet in crypto the people that are still not crypto people but destined to become crypto people in the future i think those people will care about decentralization less than the people that are already in crypto because if you're already in crypto you probably cared about decentralized decentralization more that's why you came here already uh and so i think traders and and like the solana run are pricing in um a new generation of crypto people who might not have the same like decentralization values as the old crypto people uh and so like that which is something to be concerned about um i'm kind of concerned about the concept of like if you can be regulated you will be regulated it's an outstanding question as to whether or not solana can be regulated but when you have like a centralized company ftx and a centralized person sam bankman freed like promoting this thing like and and like also there are significant decentralization compromises to the solana ecosystem right and so like that is going to be the the thing that this industry has to like parse apart and come to terms with is like do if we want to onboard all the world like can we how how significant can we uh sacrifice our decentralized values in order to onboard more and more people and is that going to be a net positive trade in the long term yeah you know two other things that that might indicate that this is kind of a cyclical narrative is you know one i don't think we've seen layer two on ethereum really hit its stride and so once it does this might sort of change things um the other thing i would say is like it's really hard to get signal out of a market that prices cardano at 80 billion dollars okay like cardano does not really have defy it has staking that you can do in cardano but like um there's not much there as far as an ecosystem i would contrast that to the solana ecosystem where there's actual apps there's a wall there's stuff you can do cardano it's kind of like tumbleweed's ghost town and yet it's worth more it's worth 80 billion dollars so i just have a hard time parsing the signal out of this and we'll have to see how this plays out over the long term i will say bankless is definitely biased towards the most decentralized platforms ultimately winning not to say that other layer ones don't have a place and other platforms won't have a place in this story but i think the the bankless thesis has been from day one like hey in order to have a monetary system and a monetary unit and true d5 you need maximal decentralization and the platforms with maximal decentralization the bitcoins and the ethereums of the world will power law accrue most of the value now we'll see how that thesis plays out and holds up over time but hey this has been an interesting three or four months uh to witness all right guys we will be back with releases but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave dot com hey guys we are back with the news of the week david we got to start here with merit circle last time i called these guys a zk roll up and i was confusing them with another solution called metas right in fact i think i just called them a roll up medici is a solution that is basically a fork of optimism they're doing some interesting things in in the roll-up world but merit circle is completely different they tweeted me after the show they said i guess we're a zk roll up now sorry guys hey we don't make mistakes often on bank list this this is the first time we've had to like actually do a correction on the last week um but uh actually we edit those out yeah we do usually edit those out usually we find them before we publish it but so with that said i think merit circle actually deserves some explanation these guys are uh creating a dow which is kind of a play to earn doubt which is a super cool idea in my world of warcraft diablo days i used to be like part of all of these different guilds and you'd like come together you'd like win items as a group and you'd like succeed as a team basically they're kind of dalifying these play to earn games so it looks like what merit circle is doing is uh one of their early initiatives is they've got 420 people on scholarships playing axie for them essentially so playing to earn in the axi game and they're providing some sort of reward structure for them i think that this concept of you launch a dow in a play to earn um like business model and you just kind of maximize profits and a portion maybe goes to the dow is something that's super attractive i wish i had this in my early gaming days and i think it's going to be something that takes hold look the the um metaverse market the crypto gaming market is only 36 billion dollars right now so like we are just getting started on this i think it's going to be worth multiple hundreds of billions even trillions possibly into the future as things shift into the metaverse so really cool to see merit circle getting started with that guys i hope that was a better explanation of what you guys are up to um but uh yeah really cool to see that progress the combination of crypto asset powered gaming plus dows with treasuries plus players is insanely powerful right like we already know people play games we already know that there's these concepts of you know treasuries that's nothing new and now we have dows and like when you combine all these things like imagine how many zoomers and whatever comes after zoomers are going to be employed by like dows where they pay you to play video games and collect valuable in-game assets that can be sold on uniswap for ether or stables or whatever to go into the dow like that is just going to absolutely if it explodes this is going to happen quick man give it a few years like we're not talking like in 20 years this will be this you know like this is happening right now under our very eyes three years yeah let's talk about dydx so dydx governance token dropped um at least for some people i think if you are a us citizen maybe maybe didn't capture that drop um but uh doing pretty well on the markets yeah what do you want to say about this david yeah congratulations for dydx for actually getting their token out the door if you were paying attention to antonio on our interviews with him we would always ask him about win token and of course he would never actually explicitly say we are going to do a token but he would say that we will do whatever the community wants us to do and obviously the community likes tokens and so finally that's token is actually here and doing pretty well on evaluation performance right out of the gate so congratulations to dydx for getting over this obstacle yeah these are some launch stats but uh 32 000 dydx holders uh fairly even distribution so they incented it well um yeah a whole bunch of open interest in this so really cool to see of course u.s investors did not get this make sure to thank your unelected officials for that there was also a little bump along the road too uh something to do with the staking contract what happened here yeah the staking contract was uh broken when people came and staked their dydx token they would be received zero staked wrapped wrapped staked dydx tokens in return i think like something like 64 users got affected by this where they staked their tokens and then didn't get anything back so in fact effectively burning their own tokens whoopsies um but i believe this has already been fixed and those uh people are being able to be re-enumerated by the foundation i think that's what's happening very cool all right david the uh the bankless dow and git coin just uh put out the ultimate doubt report so this is i think the the biggest dow report of its kind where they actually surveyed about 400 people who are actively involved working in dallas as dow members and a whole bunch of insights came from this report um so first of all really cool that this is kind of a dow to dow research report not a lot of information has ever been like created about dowels or research dials and then there's just some fantastic uh summaries here or key takeaways here one one of which is um dow fatigue is real like i felt doubt fatigue from like time to time if you're involved in too many dials but only for a minority of highly engaged participants i found that interesting um also interesting is the amount of intradow coordination so there are some findings on that uh as of september 2021 many daos have ecosystems in the billions of dollars in capital and hundreds of creators working for them so some people might not even be aware of the level of activity that that's um that's going on already a lot of the people surveyed were part-time members but they're also some full-time members who all they do for their job is work for a doll so it sounds kind of cool sounds a little bit like living the dream maybe anyway we will include a link in the show notes to the full dao report so if you're interested in digging in further make sure you check that out this next david this is a promise of a release long time coming from rocket pool what's going on here yeah rocket pool finally announced their launch date which is going to clock in at the 6th of october 2021 so under a month and so this has been a long time coming rocket pool has been honest with ethereum since 2017 uh one of the few icos that was a a good ico and then also b was building throughout the bear market super committed to decentralizing staking for ethereum uh yeah so actually if you don't know what rocketpool is it is a decentralized staking as a service application on ethereum to for for people that don't have 32 eth or people that just want to actually run nodes for the rocket pool application and then actually receive more ether rewards than they would if they had just steak solo these products are for you uh and so uh it's been a long time coming it's hard to do decentralized staking as a service that's why they've had uh had to like rewrite that because as in eth2 has been developed rocket pool has had to develop around eth2 e2 has like changed its course a number of times therefore it made as a forcing function rocket pool changes course a number of times but now we are finally here with a launch date october 6th for rocketpool's staking as a service app so congratulations to the rocketpool team and community for getting to this point i think this is the second like obviously the the best way you can keep the ethereum network decentralized and and uh you know stake your ethernet decentralized ways to be a validator yourself run it at home run it on a raspberry pi you can do that it's actually not that difficult but this to me is probably the second best way at least it promises to be i i should mention that october 6th date it's going to be a phased rollout so only a certain amount of stake will be allowed in in the first phase of that rollout and then they have a second phase where they're going to open it up to more east and the third phase and the fourth phase so it will be sort of a scaled rollout over time but if you've been waiting to stake some of your eat for a more decentralized solution not wanting to run your own validators you might want to check this one out um david let's talk about hop protocol it is uh it is growing in terms of integrations who's hop integrating with and what is hop for people who haven't listened to previous rollups all right hop is a protocol to protocol layer two to layer two to ethereum uh bridging protocol to allow assets to flow through layer twos without having to go back to the ethereum main chain and then if you do want to go back to the ethereum main chain on optimistic roll-ups you have to wait seven days but hop protocol will ferry you across instantly for a small fee so it's a layer it's a layer bridging uh platform similar to connects as well and they've already integrated like polygon x dye optimism and then they also have usdt usdc matic and then they are working on their arbitrum uh bridge with ether and dye and then something hidden as well so hot protocol continues to build like a webbing of bridging between all of these different layers of ethereum so many people have been building this entire time and building with the plans to deploy on layer two i feel like argent is another one so probably my favorite smart contract wallet the most usable that i've seen i think they've been stymied in terms of their growth because gas fees are so high on layer one so there's been this persistent questions like when is argent coming to layer two looks like they're teasing us some more can't wait to share our layer two wallet when in the next few weeks weeks this tweet from argent with a a screenshot and i think a post about their layer two plans david did you dig into this what is argent planning to do do you think what what can we expect yeah i think that this is just execution on that same uh talk that we had with vitalik about the uh combination of smart contract wallets on layer two like the quality of life is going to be orders of magnitude better when it comes to smart contract while it's on layer two uh and so it's really going to be it's really going to unlock so many integrations that would have been largely unfeasible uh on with a smart contract while on layer one uh and so as d5 gets built on layer twos argent wall is going to come over and be accessible towards d5 and layer twos and so i think it's really going to be a fantastic portal towards cheap and instant defy stuff in your mobile wallet which is really a very powerful way to onboard so many more people yeah the beauty of a smart contract wallet of course is it's normally friendly i mean you have social recovery you don't have to memorize like 12 to 24 keys and if you if you if you lose your keys it doesn't matter because you have social recovery in place this is a huge ux upgrade and i'm i'm pretty excited about arjun's ability to execute on this because their original wallet has been absolutely fantastic very easy to use so well high expectations i'm excited to see what they finally release um david let's talk raises for a second this is something that we thought would happen and now is happening we've got nft specific social networks that are getting funded and coming to market this one is hype and they're announcing a 1.5 million dollar seed raise from electric capital what's the story here yeah we all know that nfts are social phenomenon and kind of this kind of reminds me of like the loot structure for building an ecosystem around nfts lou uh if you guys didn't watch the last week's rollup it was a new kind of nft that doesn't actually have a jpeg or any sort of file embedded with it it's just text in the token and then now we have like a similar kind of model where we have this hype uh new nft like social media platform but it's not specific towards nfts it is just a wrapper around nfts and allows you to embed your nfts into this new social media platform and the social media platform can wrap around the nft ecosystem and so i think we're going to see some pretty cool stuff coming out of the intersection of social media and nfts and hype seems to be building a platform to allow people to tell stories or just do things with their nfts that you know we twitter is like the best we got when it comes to like nfts and social media like everyone's putting in their profile picture as their avatar and so hype is taking this uh which is clear demand to have some sort of social environment with nfts and building a an open ecosystem around nfts without actually dictating what those nfts are yeah look like somebody's to build the instagram for nfts basically it's like you know uh facebook started as just a web platform right but they totally missed at first the the mobile the the mobile initiative where people are taking pictures and they just wanted and instagram totally captured that medium well now we have a new medium shift we have these things called nfts that are all surrounding digital scarcity social signaling mimetics if you listen to that bankless episode and i think new social media platforms have to be built that actually optimize and draw the strengths out of this entirely new medium so i don't know if it's hype or if it's going to be something else david but i think we're going to see an instagram for nfts being created here um and and then of course the big social media companies they will be slower movers but eventually they'll figure this space out too um let's talk about this tokenizing mev so eden network just got some funding from multi coin jump capital uh um who else winter mute defiance capital a few others as well and what is eden network david what are they trying to do here yeah this seems to be a way to manage and control mev in the same way that flashbots has and so is it is a um it's a system or a protocol that is you know parallel to ethereum that if you are proposing an ethereum block you can propose it under the eden network and it'll be an eden block and the mev inside of this block will be managed according to the rules of the eden network same kind of gist as flashbots but they are doing it in a different way and my technical knowledge is going to be limiting and how these differences actually are but it's basically there is a world of mev out there and there are different systems for managing mev and these different systems point the captured value of that mav into different spots based on how the system is constructed and this eden network is doing it differently than flashbots yeah and the mev problem is really a thorny problem we've done podcasts on this in the past with flashbots and the paradigm folks what's really interesting is this post from tuchar and i think the approach that eden has had on this or maybe the marketing surround it has really stirred up some controversy in the mev space um so i think this these two paragraphs in particular where tushar from multicoin is talking about flash bots nox also blocks route two other mev solutions and says this other mev projects such as flashbots and blocks route attempt to create efficient markets between mining pools and bot operators to extract as much value from average network participants these systems do not attempt to mitigate malicious mev instead they make it easier to extract their systems are closed with centralized integration processes that exclude some block producers and leverage opaque reputation scores that favor certain addresses over others whereas eden is focused on reducing malicious mev and creating positive externalities for ethereum as a whole that's really interesting that they say they are trying to reduce po creating positive externalities for ethereum as a whole and reduce malicious mev well robert miller from flashbots had a thing or two to say about this post david do you want to get into it yeah again the the details of the mev is a really hard subject so i'm not like an mev expert as to how this works but like you said this has turned out stirred up a ton of controversy from the ethereum community especially from the flash flashbots team robert miller says contrary to multi-coin's claims minimizing mev is a core component of flashbot's mission and products that shows from our funding of fairness and ethics research work on mev aware d apps and hundreds of users that have used the flash bots to skip the mempool and protect themselves from front running so there's some jabs being thrown um back and forth between uh the tushar um and uh robert miller and overall like the flashbots uh team and ecosystem flashbots has like a pretty insane amount of alignment with the health of ethereum and therefore also like the deep ethereum community and so the deep ethereum community did not like um the way that this eden network was messaged by the multi-coin boys who have also done a decent like amount of like marketing trash talking ethereum they've been they've they like they like to trash talk a theory robert miller i mean robert miller says explicitly multi coin is lying about eden super interesting it's not permissionless or transparent um anyway you guys can get up to speed on some of this drama but i i think we have a to do probably on our side david at some point in the future we've got to sort through these different mev solutions and uh and you know roll this into a podcast into a panel to help educate folks get our arms wrapped or ourselves yes that's mainly why we do panels to understand ourselves um guys we should talk about the jobs that are available to you in the crypto space as well for the best jobs you can go to the bankless job board we have three posts today that we want to profile the first is a senior software programmer at popcorn second is a community lead at popcorn popcorn is a decentralized yield um you know yield generating protocol it looks super cool you check them out at popcorn.network but if you're not a programmer this community lead position might be sort of interesting to you put those communication skills to work we also have a senior front-end web developer at tracer dow all of those are featured there are dozens of jobs that you can find on the bankless job board so make sure you check that out all right david you want to get to the news oh boy here we go this is going to be this is going to be a long one regulatory you ready let's go let's talk about our shadowy super regulators david that is that is the subject i think this week and everything that they are doing we've got to start with maybe the the few events that happened starting with uniswap so on friday just after we recorded our last weekly roll up it appeared that there were some investigations going on at uniswap and from the sec uh tell us about that david yeah so uniswap got a letter from an investigative letter from the sec asking just just for more information about the business um i mean so in in theory these letters are totally just like peaceful and just casual it's like hey we would like to know more about you but also like the context the subcontext is that like we are looking to like figure out what to do with you guys uh and so like while it doesn't indicate that they that unit swap has done anything wrong or is being charged with anything the sec is just probing into uniswap trying to like get more information is not it's not a positive thing it's definitely a negative thing this is not the kind of letter you can ignore right it's not the kind of thing oh junk mail just gonna yeah sec i don't know them i'm just gonna recycle that one you cannot ignore these letters and um it's also it's like you know perjury some very bad things can happen if you falsify the letters or don't provide the necessary information it just gets you in the bad books with the sec as well so i think investigation is um maybe a bit more serious in some ways it's not a formal charge but this is not a a small matter like i don't know what questions are being asked from the sec to uniswamp but uh you can bet that there's a lot and like very detailed right and so uniswap is is definitely this is uniswap labs of course they're definitely need to put in the time to answer these questions right as accurately as possible so that that in and of itself is sort of a shot across the bow yeah yeah and that is just the first of the the regulatory issues that came out this week so like that story is currently being like told like we're gonna just here be hearing more and more from this i'm i'm sure uh the sec is not done with uniswap or d5 this is just the first of a very long story but that story took another turn this week when coinbase uh was informed by the sec that the sec if if they uh release a product which they have been in open communications with the sec uh if they if coinbase was told by the sec that if they release a lending product and the sec is going to sue them and that is extremely aggressive uh and there's absolutely no dialogue going on between uh the sdc and coinbase or anyone in the crypto space and so this has been a this blew up the the whole twitter sphere and cryptosphere in the last two days what do you mean by lending product for people who aren't familiar what does that mean right so people will might remember blockfy getting a cease and desist letter from the sec because they the sec said that their lending products are securities um which has you know some debate about that again i'm not a lawyer don't listen to me about any of this um but uh the this is the same kind of deal like so lending products are maybe securities and the sec is trying to get coinbase's lend product which is just the same that we've known like all these other centralized lending products right like common deposit your bitcoin your ether your stables uh and then we'll get a yield on them the problem is that the sec doesn't like is that like how they are how yield is being achieved on these things is opaque and so investors don't have like good uh clarifications or clarity on how that yield is coming and so like if like a black swan event happens maybe depositors might actually lose their deposits which is not enjoyable um and so that's what the sec is claiming that they are trying to protect from what's coinbase claiming coinbase is claiming that none of this qualifies as a security it's like you know it's we're lending money we take your ether we take your bitcoin and lend it just like if you you know lend money to a bank and they generate interest on those returns it's just a lending product this is not a security and is therefore outside of their jurisdiction but the scc is coming back and saying coinbase if you release this we will sue you right right what they didn't do is provide explanation as to why the lend product is a security they just said if you release it we're going to sue you which is meaningfully different than providing any sort of guidance or indications as to their logic or analysis as to why this thing is a security at all uh apparently in the letter in a letter to coinbase they said that they have done the analysis but they didn't share what that analysis is right and so the threat is that like when we sue you and take you to court we already have our analysis ready to go rather than broadcasting that to the entire industry and saying like here is our guidance here is our analysis and allowing the industry to work around that they say like okay we've we have our analysis we're going to keep our cards close to our heart and then if you like you know do anything wrong and if you break this analysis we're going to sue you which is just like infuriating it's infuriating it's what that is yeah it's absolutely infuriating and i can understand the frustration because this is um this is not a typical move right where a three-letter agency from the fed comes and says hey we're going to sue you if you do this thing and then the company that's being threatened like this comes out and tells everybody about it right right usually the legal advice that you get in a situation like this is like don't talk about it right right until we can reach settlement until the investigation's over but this is coinbase now saying uh okay it's on we're going to let everyone know what's going on uh and so the drum support legal officer has written this blog post um that that's clearly not meant maybe it's partially meant for the sec but it's more meant for public support wouldn't you say uh the title of it the sec has told us it wants to sue us over lend we don't know why and then brian armstrong put out this um this twitter thread about and it begins like this some really sketchy behavior coming out of the sec recently and he goes into story time where he talks about um what the sec is doing he says millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years block fi is an example of that david as you said makes sense if you want to lend out your funds you can earn a return everyone seems happy with that a bunch of great companies in crypto have been offering versions of this for years so coinbase came out recently and said they would be launching their own version if you're a coinbase customer you might have seen the announcement in fact gemini has a version of this david like block file like this isn't even the only exclusive is doing this uh celsius um we're planning to go live in a few weeks so this is all built out it was all ready so we reached out to the sec to give them a friendly heads up and this is what they always recommend by the way the sec always says hey come tell us if you're doing something well in this case it sounds like it it kind of backfired they responded by telling us this lend feature is a security okay seems strange brian says how can lending be a security so we ask the sec to help us understand and share their view we always make an effort to work proactively with regulators and keep an open mind they refuse to tell us why they think it's a security instead they subpoena a bunch of our records we comply demand testimony from our own from our employees we comply then tell us they will be suing us if we proceed to launch with zero explanation as to why look brian says we're committed to following the law sometimes the law is unclear if sec wants to publish guidance we are also happy to follow that it's nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry by the way he says but in this case they are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why no clarity this is something gary gensler promised david clarity we're not getting clarity instead they're engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors whatever their theory is here feels like a reach land grab versus other regulators he goes on with a few more tweets i won't finish this out but that gives kind of the tone for what's going on here and here's the thing like coinbase from day one has always been their message their branding their total their approach to all of this has been we're going to be by the book like u.s regulated okay binance like bitmex these companies will be more aggressive they'll list other products earlier uh but we're gonna play it by the book because we think that's the better long-term strategy for a company and for a us-based company at the cost of growth and they could have done things the binance way and gone into kind of hyper growth but they decided to play it by the book and it feels like they're getting punished from that and like i gotta say if if you're a regulator you can't get along with coinbase i mean who can you get along with yeah they're like the goody two-shoes uh you know teachers pet of the crypto industry they do everything right and like if just like you said if if the teacher's pet is getting in trouble by the teacher then there's obviously bias towards the whole entire classroom right yeah something wrong with the teachers what's going on this is this is hitting the front page of the wall street journal by the way sec investigates coinbase over crypto lending plan on the front page of the wall street journal so they are getting the press i wonder what kind of public support they're getting they certainly have the crypto industry support here's a take from narage david you want to go into this yeah so this is something we haven't covered about this yet uh the sec wants coinbase to turn over the name and contact information of anyone who has said that they are interested in their lending platform wow so like think about this if this is a security the people who have expressed interest in in purchasing said security doesn't change whether that's a security or not and so niraj says uh why would that be relevant to their investigation into whether the program is compliant or not and so the sec is targeting people that have expressed interest in lending their crypto assets on coinbase they want your name they want your address they want your phone number for why i have no clue prosecute them in the future i have no clue i mean i do have a conspiracy actually but so i'm on this list because when i saw the coinbase email like i love to try things in crypto so i put my hand up and i was like yeah but yeah i need to get a new co-host sometime soon i'm on the stc's list for this but why would they want that what's like what are some of the ideas floating around okay so the the conspiracy which again i'm on board with is that uh when we again when we zoom out and view the nation state as a holistic concept we have the treasury who's frustrated about people who aren't reporting their crypto taxes which is legitimate uh and they have tried and found tried to find ways to find the same information like who are all the people that like own crypto or have interest in crypto then we now we have the sec coming from the other side who's making this claim that this uh lending product is a security when everyone's like why the hell is this a security while they are making that claim they're asking for everyone's you know name birthday address their their nation say identity uh and so like the conspiracy is that like the sec and the treasury are like pincer attacking crypto people by trying to figure out who they are right and and that is in my opinion an infringement on personal privacy and personal sovereignty that's that's my take look i i i don't know if that conspiracy theory it like holds but you have to i don't know about an explanation right like what is the explanation for why they are asking for all of these details right uh here's kind of a take i meant to to say when we were talking about uniswap this is the complete backwards way of how a regulator should approach a uniswap or a coinbase i mean coinbase has built a phenomenal company like a company that the us as an economy should be proud to host within its borders right like part of the next silicon valley but utah swap too uniswap is even more amazing one of the most innovative and empowering tech projects to come out of america an american team in the last decade that's what i think unit swap is david and i feel like the the us should be giving hayden adams and the uniswap team a medal right like thank you for doing this instead those guys are getting an investigation this is like a financial prison type stuff this is completely backwards from the way they should be handling it yeah what's going on to me is like we have found ways out of this financial prison using defy that's what defy is breaks you free from your banks this is the lines we've been using and then we have the treasury and the sec is like no no no get back in your cage i don't know how how did you get out of your cage get back in your cage that's basically what they're doing yeah and i i i do feel like that um let's do some other takes from around the crypto industry this is from jake travinsky i think this is interesting david why don't you read it yeah jake says if the sec thinks that all non-bank interest products are securities that require the offer to become a public reporting company then they're not just picking a fight with crypto they're going after the entire fintech space so this to me this take lends itself towards lends itself towards um the whole concept of protecting incumbents right like protecting the banking encumbrance you know the banking uh the banking side of the world all the bankers they were probably okay with fintech because they were built on banks but now that there's crypto fintechs don't need to be built on banks anymore they can now be built on crypto rails which is again breaking free from your bank so to me this uh illustrates how this might be incumbent protection rather than just like you know investor protection get back in your cage get back in your arcade yeah look at this adam cochran part of me wonders if the sec's unwillingness to provide coinbase guidance on why they are blocking their lend program is because they can't right like maybe they've realized that things they think are a security may not at all be accounted for in an act from 1933 they don't like it they have concerns feels to them as if it should be a security but under the how we test exchange act they know won't really stand up in court and they don't want to set a precedence that would make the this industry harder on them so adam's basically saying maybe they're doing this backroom threatening because they don't actually have a case right it's a bluff card it's a bluff and coinbase is being like no sorry we're calling your bluff maybe they've finally overreached and like played their hand extended their hand too far and maybe now is the time where we're coinbase and why shouldn't it be coinbase david it's gotta be so well resourced like they they have the reputation they have the prestige they have the leadership to actually stand and fight this maybe now is the time maybe this could flip into a good thing hey sec get back in your cage get back in your cage what is what so some of these crypto natives uh what does chain link god think about here he is responding from brian armstrong right so shanel and god says so the sec is pushing people through a minefield without telling anyone where the minds are yet at the same time telling to not step on any of the minds or else you you will die this makes zero logical sense right yeah this is just the approach that we have been asking as long as i've been in crypto we've been asking for more regulated regulation clarity and instead of giving it to us they're just taking us to court which is absolutely insane and absolutely irresponsible and against the american principles get back in your cage get back in your cage mark cuban he had a response to this too good to have more allies and mark cuban is definitely an ally he responds to brian armstrong he said brian this is regulation via litigation they aren't capable of working through this themselves and they're afraid of making mistakes in doing so so they just leave it to the lawyers just the people you don't want impacting the new technologies this is the key line you have to go on the offensive this is mark cuban saying hey they're trying to do regulation by litigation so like they better arm up because we need to go on the offensive as a crypto industry and settle this in other ways settle this in the court of public opinion settle this in the actual court system as well we need to get offensive because they are clearly being aggressive it's no longer like live and let live right this is actually some aggressive impact like i want the ability to lend through my coinbase account i like coinbase i use it why shouldn't we have this ability these are all great questions uh jerry britto what's he say right bruto says if true this is pretty underhanded i know it's easy for me to say but coinbase should go ahead and launch its product let the sec sue it and go to court let the sec make its case and let a judge decide what the law is jerry brito basically saying coinbase take the offensive coinbase don't ask for permission coinbase we need you guys to to break free out of this financial prison and lead the charge out of it right and i i and to push the sec back this is government overreach and we need people to plan draw a line in the sand and saying like no no no like back off that's how this can get resolved though right right and i mean if they're not gonna if the sec is not gonna give us regulation willingly we will force them to give us regulation by beating them in court well then you have like then you have court case uh like rule rulings and you have precedent established i just wonder how long this process is gonna take right so like i do think this is the sec is not going to give us clarity so we have to get clarity by the courts it just takes so much longer to do it it'd be so much easier if you had a regulator that was just like armed across the aisle hey crypto's doing some great things we have these concerns let's address these concerns over time but we're not getting that from the sec maybe we're getting it from other government agencies i'm not sure but it doesn't feel like we're getting that from the sec right now so i guess we have to go to court but what does coinbase do do they just release this product in the meanwhile yep and people sign up yep fight the court battle alongside i wonder if they'll do that i i hope they do [Laughter] here's the big take here um i just have one question the sec who are you trying to protect their mandate is to protect investors david are they protecting us yeah this is not now they're investors in bank no investors in banks ryan bank investors that's who their job is to protect it feels like i don't i don't actually know who they're trying to protect i know it's not the average retail investor right is it is it banks is it the treasury is it their own regulatory control is it some other shadowy figure in uh like in the nation state government some bonds i'm not sure i don't i don't know but it's not us i do know that but that would be the question i think we would have to gary gensler it's like who are you guys trying to protect right i'm not feeling protected by this i didn't i just don't like the plot yeah did you get your dydx airdrop absolutely not do you feel protected because you didn't lost out on a significant amount of money let me tell you that okay so this is this came this take came from eric connor who talks about anthony anthony cesano anthony and i talked about this on a recent podcast episode but i think the elected officials are extremely underestimating the influence coming from the crypto community there are there's a gigantic power culture and wealth shift happening that most are ignoring and i think the sec is making this mistake as well like the the the crypto news uh ecosystem like what you guys are listening to right now is vibrant uh we got mark cuban we got like all of crypto twitter who like there's a lot of wealth in crypto and so like all of these people have interest in like rallying their support behind coinbase and against the sec witherspoon now yeah yeah we got we got wreath um uh inside joke okay um but like that that all the nation state regulators don't understand how uh vibrant and engaged the crypto community is and how willing we are to like die for what we believe in like we will we will take this all the way to the very end and i'm not sure the regulators will do the same for whatever the hell they believe in yeah i'm not sure there's that fervor either and um yeah this is um i think this is a actually going to turn into a good thing for crypto so there you have it guys are we at war with the regulators i don't know we didn't fire the first shot though it seems like they did yeah we'll see how this ends um let's get to some other things really quick david um oh this is actually related to regulatory so brian quintes we had on the show on monday former cftc chair he just uh commissioner excuse me he just joined a16z to help advise their crypto fund so that was something brian hinted at he was going to do something maybe next in crypto looks like the next thing he's doing is joining a16z as a regulatory crypto advisor i would imagine so good move brian fantastic person great values aligned ecosystem i'm sad he's no longer a regulator because we need people like that on the other side but at least he's staying in in the space and fighting for values this way yeah maybe hopefully he joins the offensive fight rather than just the defensive fight of the crypto industry exactly this is an interesting juxtaposition um so apparently in panama they're doing the complete opposite they're trying to become compatible with cryptocurrency and the digital economy that is coming uh david what's your take here on what's going on in panama congress yeah yeah so panama is kind of doing a similar thing as el salvador but with a little bit more options uh they they are trying to like you said the the gist of the bill is that they are trying to make their country crypto compatible and so that is uh using cryptos as payment rails that includes bitcoin and ethereum which i think implies all the stable coins on top of it but also goes even further they talk about like making their daos legal entities inside of panama as well so this is pretty like precise and well-versed crypto regulation coming out of panama i think there there's there's still nice time for this story to steep and really get digested by the broader community but we are seeing again nation states have relationships with crypto and then choosing very intentionally what those relationships are el salvador and panama choosing very positive stances towards crypto united states choosing very negative stance i don't know that nation states get that they actually have to compete for their citizens in the 21st century right like that that should be a global competition and so what are the crypto friendly nation states maybe panama's becoming one let's burn through some of these david mastercard is acquiring cipher phrase what does this mean yeah cypher trace is a kind of a blockchain analytics company so like you know tracing transactions and addresses through the blockchain making it more uh you know illuminating what's actually going on and mastercard which is again a payments network has acquired them which is a very intentful and like with a very specific direction as to how mastercard wants to enter the crypto space so that is pretty interesting it says this article says details of the acquisition were not disclosed so we are going to hear more about this in the future i suspect lido is also a staking company that provides a staking organization endow really that that provides staking support for eth now they are also including staking support for solana for their soul token so uh we knew that was coming and looks like it is here now congratulations to light up um steph curry this was big steph curry is partnering with ftx crypto exchange ftx is just making moves in celebrities in sports and gaming and everything they're trying to buy their way into mainstream legitimacy and i think doing an okay job steph curry is a like a definitely a good name to add to the roster what's your take yeah again right after tom brady right so tom brady probably the most famous football player out there steph curry probably the most famous basketball player out there we do know that like sports players really like crypto for some reason uh there's resonance behind um uh people that play professional sports and investing in crypto and steph curry also recently tweeted out like yo what's up with this crypto thing crypto twitter what's up uh and ftx again doing a fantastic job just like buying the support of you know public figures i think i think it's going to do like extremely well for them that's those are the options that are available to you when solana token pumps ridiculous percentage uh they bought tom brady as well to have him as a uh a sponsor and a commercial came out with tom brady that was high production high value commercial yeah yeah pretty good and this is like so i'm kind of divided on this right i don't love that crypto banks um are dominating all of the mindshare because there's so much more to crypto than just what ftx provides yet at the same time this is how we mainstream right this is absolutely how we remain this is how we make it normal now it's not just the sec against all the weird people on you know twitter uh doing corrupt shady crypto stuff they also have to go against tom brady steph curry and his entire fan base that's a that's a harder fight i think we are breaking into mainstream consciousness at this point right now it's going through sports is actually a really really smart move um and i mean i i'm with you in that i don't like crypto banks like being the representative face of crypto according to like the commercials that we see on television but also who else is going to do it right like it's not going to be unesco uniform's not going to run a commercial it's got to be a crypto bank so i mean somebody's going to buy out all the celebrities and turn them into into crypto celebrities and like by the very definition it can't be the defy apps it has to be the central centralized companies because that's that's really where they get alignment the most uh ethereum stuff metamask just chris crushing it they just surpassed 10 million monthly active users largest uh non-custodial crypto wallet in the world i i've heard rumors that that's actually like 14 million now so even since the this was posted so they're just absolutely exploding in growth i feel like it's healthy growths too it's not like 2017 growth people are actually using these protocols so there's a different feel and flavor there david uh let's go through some of this nft stuff did you know that polygon is actually compatible with openc this is something i did not know and that that's one tidbit but but the second is this there's actually more open c nft users on polygon than ethereum slayer one what do you think this means yeah i i think people are finding ways to do all the things that they want to do on defy but without having to pay all the fees and that has always meant l2s or in this case sidechains um uh and that's how you can like mint your nfts because michigan nfc costs over 100 on ethereum i think it costs under a dollar on polygon and that nft that you minted can be sent back to the ethereum main chain and have that sovereignty tied to ethereum itself um and so congratulations to the polygon team for getting so much nft volume on uh on polygon because there's like a lot of people that have straight up and priced out of nfts on the main chain and we definitely don't want to lose those people to just either lack of interest or centralized chains uh immutable is doing the same thing so now you can mint and trade on immutable x uh super cool of course this is a zk roll up it's fully secured by ethereum so it's not a side chain but that provides another avenue for cheap minting of nfts and trading of nfts it's great to see um also christie's is doing more in the nft space what's this david yeah they're selling off art block sets art block curated sets one through three as part of their post-war to present auction on in new york on the 1st of october so they have a chromey squiggle and a bunch of other uh art block sets from the the first three sets out of our art blocks so our blocks making their way into mainstream culture that's pretty cool it's kind of cool prediction markets on d5 are a thing this is poly market they have just introduced an nft for pricing market so you can long or short the floor price of something like crypto punks or board apes or even loot really cool we'll include a link to in the show notes where you can see that live on poly market and start getting price exposure to these nfts in a less direct way but maybe a more capital efficient way depending on what you're trying to do um also david vitalic has been posting about nfts um like big brain stuff about nfts on layer two getting them on layer two to cut fees what's the tl dr of this youth research post that he published right so earlier in this episode we talked about that post of the that was the correlation between gas consumption and nfts as nft activity heats up it disproportionately makes the gas price price move in in the same direction and so vitalik has identified this as a huge problem and he says that the nft ecosystem is growing rapidly and it's a significant part of ethereum's gas change consumption the youth and relative lack of entrenchment of the ecosystem as well as the greater need to avoid high fees due to the non-financial nature of the large part of the nft sector makes it a prime target for moving on to layer two however this opens the question of how to move uh how a move to layer two could actually happen one simple proposal is to socially coordinate a move to a single rollout platform igil as an optimism or arbitrary but this has some important downsides all existing major evm capable roll-ups have back doors centralized sequencing or other training wheels and it's risky to commit an entire ecosystem to a single roll-up when there's uncertainty as to how that roll-up will graduate but on beyond such features and so what vitalik's blog post is offering is is a way to make nfts move on to layer twos without having to commit to any specific layer two and so this is a maybe a short term stop gap as allowing you can have your your nft on layer one and then have it wrapped and then wrapped onto a layer two so your nfc actually stays on layer one but the wrapped version can hop around seamlessly around other layer twos and then maybe as the layer two ecosystem gets more built out and more diverse and more solidified then we can actually have native nfts on layer twos after some of those you know important uh design choices have been built out on the layer twos uh it's actually a really complicated post so if you wanna learn more you gotta go read the post yourself that guy has some good ideas sometimes just sometimes you should usually valuable listen what's going on uh okay oh yeah loot time loot time so dom dom hof de hof the guy behind the whole loot project that kickstarted that homania has submitted a proposal to burn the keys to the loot contract which would uh just basically remove the option of minting any more loot bags that is up for debate as to whether the community wants it or not but the proposal is out there there you go david uh let's touch on bitcoin stuff el salvador said they would purchase a bunch of bitcoin when they legalized it as tender and here they are they just purchased 200 bitcoin um this is really interesting this is the the president tweeting this out buying the dip winky smiley emoji 150 new coins added just like a bitcoiner he is telling about buying the dip as he is purchasing the dip and broadcasting that on twitter fart and wide uh interesting to see for sure yeah really like quacks like a bitcoin or walks like a bitcoiner you can also see this on the usage side so of the top six finance apps in el salvador all of them are bitcoin apps paypal is number seven el salvador's largest bank is number eight so it appears making bitcoin legal tender actually does increase adoption who would have guessed el salvador going bankless so that's pretty cool all right guys we will be back with some of the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at banklist we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools

gemiini.com go bankless all right guys we are back with the takes of the week the first is from jack butcher he talks about web 3d that's what we're in web 1d is all about just information those base protocols web 2d is information plus people the social network layer of things web 3d we have information people and money i think that's a great take i think that's exactly what's happening uh crypto is just the next revolut uh revel the next revolution of the web is the next iteration of the web it adds a money layer to the web it adds digital scarcity layer to the web i think he absolutely nails it that's why i'm more comfortable calling this web three do you know i feel like two two years ago david web three was like this nebulous i don't know are we gonna decentralize twitter are we gonna decentralize uber i don't know they called that web three and i gravitated away from that term for what we're doing now but now we understand it's all about digital scarcity we understand it's all about capital assets we understand it's all about money and i like the framing of web3 this is the third iteration of the web yeah the only corollary i would add to this is that web3 means that information people and money are going on to web3 platforms right like the whole people that's the identity layer of ethereum we're not using web 2 to establish people we're using new identity tools to establish people yeah that's that's a good take um what's bolaji talking about he is talking about consent of the govern and self-sovereignty what's his take here yeah he tweeted this out less than a day ago so this is definitely coming after the sec coinbase uniswap news bloggie says the decentralization restores the consent of the govern right and this is what we have been preaching about defy and being your own bank and controlling your own assets right like uh the sec they can come knocking on coinbase's door and tell them that if they do offer a lending product then they're going to sue them but that doesn't mean that you can sue the ave protocol or the compound protocol or the unit swap protocol so as users of these things we don't have to ask the sec permission to make a transaction that interacts with uniswap and so it restores the consent of the governed as in we they we don't have to ask permission to use these things elizabeth warren had to take this week calling everything in crypto a shadow bank crypto is the new shadow bank she said anthony cesano had a counter to this the traditional finance system is the actual shadow bank it's the very reason we're building a new decentralized censorship resistant transparent permissionless and global financial system well said anthony elizabeth warren either needs to get educated or get out of the way i feel like this with a lot of our members of congress david they don't actually understand what they're talking about here sent a letter to my congressman mark warner my center uh my senator mark warner about the infrastructure bill he replied back and said basically nice hearing from you i've taken this under consideration but i'm super concerned because bitcoin and cryptocurrency is used by criminals and terrorists right classic that's his 2014 2015 mindset on what we're doing in crypto right meanwhile we've built a two trillion dollar industry over here the most open financial system that's accessible to everyone that's ever been built and they're just not educated we have a lot of work to do there the question is do they want to get educated and i'm not sure the answer to that question yeah uh elizabeth warren you can't just call something you don't understand a shadow like just because you don't know what it is doesn't mean it's opaque you just haven't learned about it yet yeah uh she's sticking with that term shadow i don't know she must not know about the memes let's talk about celebrities getting liberties celebrities this is a defense mechanism so we got reath witherspoon just bought her first that was last week i think on friday of last week uh pretty cool she's getting into it who's our next celeb steph curry just getting started in the crypto game y'all got any advice which almost got a hundred thousand likes which is crazy mike tyson solana or ethereum so mike tyson getting into the game trying to learn the differences between solana and ethereum of which there are many i i hope someone's underneath this uh pointing them to a bankless episode maybe uh yeah no we haven't yeah oh he's got a cryptocat as his nft profile yeah that's already in i didn't even realize that wow that's a pretty cool cat so what does this mean i think chris berninski summarized it for us yeah chris bernicke says major celebrities getting started in crypto is the beginning of the end and the end of the beginning uh and so i think what he is saying is that like the early days of crypto they're over like the wild west it's not so wild anymore like these the crazy days of like all this like crazy rampant speculation i mean it's there's still going to be speculation it's no longer a weird niche exactly exactly like no crypto's mainstream is bringing on mainstream people with mainstream use cases and the celebrities getting into that uh is indicating that the end of the beginning is upon us that's the right way to play yes the the we are no longer in the beginning stages of crypto we're in the middle we're in the middle of the story that's gonna miss that like kind of that hipster thing it's like hey it's a small group and we don't have to worry about paris hilton or lindsay lohan tweeting out some stupid you know nft uh do you miss part of that yeah but like it's also we we are currently where we've always wanted to be and while that now comes with way more baggage than we thought such as like the sec being dumb uh i i guess this is what we wish for i i do think actually some of these celebrities in the mainstream adoption for our earlier conversation actually provides a heat shield to some of these regulatory agencies as well so there is that side benefit but yeah chris nailed it as usual david let me ask you the question we end with which is what you're excited about what are you excited about this week uh well what i'm excited about this week is what's happening uh next week and the week after uh m-con in denver i'm gonna go to m-con the meta cartel uh convention uh and that's gonna be a ton of fun to see all the homies there and then right after that i'm going to missouri mainnet in new york with chief uh chief of culture at bankless michael wong as well as lucas the the chief editor of the bankless newsletter as well as a bunch of other just friends all hanging out in new york the pleaser dow doge party uh is happening and so there's gonna be a party which is gonna be doge themed because please the dao owns the doge nft uh so i'm excited to go and do a bunch of traveling and see all the people in the different different cities yeah that's awesome man it's like um you know we couldn't do any of that in uh in 2020 right because of covet now some of that's coming out again so it's great to see and i'm glad you're going you know i don't i can i could just not go right it's fine it's one of us goes you can just again you'll just live vicariously through me and i'll tell you all about it that's how it usually goes ryan what are you excited about i'm actually super excited about layer twos this week right so layer twos are cool because i feel like this is um we don't have to take shortcuts i think that a lot of high transaction throughput chains are saying hey hey we're less decentralized we're more centralized but do we really need all that decentralization is kind of the question and you know it's hard to answer that question and say yes there is a reason for you to pay 80 fees on uniswap right when somebody can pay almost nothing on a centralized layer one um but with layer two we actually don't have to take shortcuts and i think layer two on ethereum is massively underrated because it's not just what we're seeing like today this is in its infancy it's very early years it's what we're going to see in the future um somebody wrote a fantastic post on this actually on um reddit this is uh eath finance um liver liver host librosti uh fibrosis liberosis yes thank you it's weird he goes there he goes through and he talks about um layer two and he specifically talks about zk roll ups this is where i think things get really exciting it's because with zk roll ups um you actually don't have to make these trade-offs between centralization and decentralization to get the high throughput specifically when we have data data sharding in layer two right so this is like remember that episode we did with justin drake about the the magic of cryptography right it's like cryptography really is the magic that this entire space rests on right and that's where we get like not not just moore's law increasing kind of every year but like we get these massive leaps in terms of of capability and we do things like have large super nodes and we centralize because we haven't created better cryptography well zk technology and zk roll ups that is better cryptography and when you combine that with you know you know the data sharding on ethereum we're going to be able to scale this this out to like as much as we need to so this guy talks about um you know on reddit he talks about if speculatively up to 15 million tps by the end of the decade if you combine various zk roll up solutions on ethereum so 15 million transactions per second without the centralization trade-off so i think now we're in the season of like hey gas fees are high we need you know centralized layer ones uh ethereum will never scale but um i'm really excited about this kind of dark horse that's that's that's coming up which is zk roll up tech layer 2 ecosystem on ethereum so it's going to be exciting to see that develop but it's also not going to happen overnight it's going to take like months and probably years for this to come to fruition but i think it's worth waiting for and this has always been ethereum's commitments right like uh we as a community understand that there is like that uh scalability trilemma there's security decentralization and scalability and ethereum doesn't at all want to sacrifice um security or decentralization so it chose to sacrifice scalability but the whole gist is that we will figure out the scalability via improvements and innovation and research in cryptography and if you find scalability on your l1 chain and you did it without cryptography you compromise on one of the other two things it was either you either compromise on security or you compromise on decentralization the only way to make your base layer one better is through innovations in cryptography and that is why ethereum has been a cryptographer's developmental playground and that's why ethereum has always been like oh developers developers developers not just on the app layer but also cryptograph cryptographic researchers the way to improve your system is through cryptography and if you're not doing it with cryptography you've done it in a way that shoots yourself in the foot with one of these in very crucial dimensions of what makes a crypto system a crypto system the ability to run a node at home is super important it's probably fundamental to these systems and this preserves that um all right david meme of the week of the week what are we talking about meme of the week let's do a show yet let me show you this one okay so this is the uh the rich bankers holding glasses out of champagne laughing their asses off me and politicians and politicians yeah oh god that's reagan i had no idea reagan was in this there's reagan there's also uh bush bush senior in the background yeah okay okay so these are politics these aren't bankers these are politicians maybe they're the same thing i mean okay we'll get to we'll get to the uh the actual text and then so all these politicians are laughing their asses off and it says and then we would tell them that we are protecting investors exactly i mean like this is this is kind of how i feel about this is um man um they're pushing all this down our throats but under the guise of protecting us and that's what feels protecting me from a vacation because i didn't get the dydx air drop i i'm not feeling very protected this week from all of the gains we could have made as us citizens there goes guys that was the roll up thanks for hanging with us of course none of this has been financial advice bitcoin eth are risky so is d5 you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's
