i'd say initially the creative started looking at blockchain like a new medium and how can we interact with it and there were some fascinating things like just this decentralized ledger but you could store all kinds of information on on it and so when it was cheaper people had images they had ascii images we did things like make fake addresses to make like trails digital trails that led to information that if you put it all together you got something so it was just kind of this neat process because of the fact that there's no third parties involved so it was really inspiring for us to think about how could the blockchain be this new medium it was really a fun playful time and i think that's actually a big missing piece right now like for example um a lot of creatives and artists just skip that step they are now with these the interface and um and making like minting an image that they feel like is an nft but you're missing the whole like deeper meaning and how that ties into the networks that could be way more creative or like artistically driven
