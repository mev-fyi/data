but if you are a mid-sized Merchant that is the way in wire transfers and the wire transfer is costing them 50 to 100 dollars and you can only do it Monday to Friday nine to five during banking hours and all of a sudden you can do something that has instant settlement and installer nominated and works 24 7. you're just gonna go there welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we've had a thesis on Bank list for quite a while on how we get to 1 billion crypto users worldwide we call it the D5 mullet thesis that's right D5 mullet that's fintech in the front defy in the back and basically the idea is fintech will help onboard the world to crypto and there is no bigger fintech company than PayPal it's our guest today is Jose Fernandez de Ponte he's from PayPal he's a senior executive he leads all of their crypto and blockchain initiatives and he wants to tell us what the 400 million PayPal accounts can do with crypto right now we talk about that we talk about the future of cdbcs stable coins and the regulatory headwinds crypto is facing right now a few takeaways for you number one what does PayPal see in crypto why are they developing on it number two we talk about what PayPal's 400 million accounts can do with crypto today is this the front door to a bankless money system number three we talk about how to get to one trillion dollars worth of stable coins we got a ways to go but Jose has a plan number four we talk about the role of cdbcs in a world of Highly Successful stable coins can cdbcs and crypto coexist number five we talk about Jose's contrarian views on crypto regulation the environment that we're in the US and why he sees this environment actually as a glass half full it's not all bad news and David maybe my favorite part of this episode is we just got the senior vice president of PayPal to see say the words defy mullet I think twice in this episode so I enjoyed that as well uh what's the significance of this one it was really refreshing to hear Jose say that PayPal is here in crypto based on its merits and I mean it makes sense PayPal is a for-profit company that has shareholders that needs to do right by shareholders it's not going to adopt crypto for some ideological reason God who would be so crazy to do that uh PayPal is going to adopt crypto because it provides a certain set of unique services and product offerings to what PayPal wants and that's why PayPal is here in crypto and they're also I'm sure paying attention to cbdc's as part of this conversation of this podcast though I'm sure they're also paying attention to Fed now and other payment and money Innovations yet they are paying attention to crypto and perhaps perhaps according to Jose you'll have to find out by listing the episode paying attention to crypto the most because crypto is the best and furthest along in all these things at least that's just my bias but hearing that PayPal is is here for their own benefit and crypto is here to service them uh is is a nice perspective to bring the other thing that we didn't talk about this and uh and I want to talk about in the debrief run is that on that same vein in that same vein uh PayPal is adopting cryptos payment rails to facilitate payments but it's also letting you touch Bitcoin and ether other monies in of its same Merit so what does that mean when PayPal lets you touch Bitcoin and ether because maybe that's just what people want uh and so I think there's another conversation of just like not only is Paypal a fintech for payments but now it is also allowing for the expression of who wants to choose what money they want to express their money-ness desires in little did they know PayPal is allowing people to choose Bitcoin and ether even though they are a payments company I thought that was pretty interesting I express all of my money-ness desires in crypto let me tell you that and I can't wait to talk to you more about that tell me about your money Mr desires bro I'm sure we're going to talk saying the words D5 mullet more than a few times in that debrief as well of course the debrief is the episode that David and I are going to record right now

course one in the same he drives the company's efforts to bring the utility of crypto assets and crypto networks to millions of global customers certainly have seen PayPal doing a lot in the space he also knows a thing or two about how the banking system works how it's broken and maybe has some insights in terms of how to fix it Jose welcome to bankless greatly here nice to be with you Ryan and David uh it's great to be with you we've wanted to have this conversation with um with somebody from PayPal uh and uh you know yourself for for quite some time so I'm glad we could arrange this I figured we could maybe break this into two parts for bankless listeners and and part one is just try to figure out what PayPal is doing with crypto right now and then part two maybe you could give some uh wider insights the 30 000 foot view in terms of what is actually broken about global banking maybe we could talk stablecoins cdbcs and crypto's role in all of this does that sound okay absolutely let's do that you know first though Jose I have a 101 level question all right and this is my own kind of kindergarten level curiosity um can you tell me what a dollar is in PayPal so being in crypto for as long as I have I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of what a usdc what a stable coin actually is and what it's backed by um because we've had to study that in crypto right we've had stable coin failings um we've we've learned about under collateralized stable coins and algorithmic stable coins uh we see sort of usdc uh and its balance sheet we kind of know maybe a little bit what's backing tether um what about a dollar in PayPal what is that what is that backed by yeah absolutely happy to to do that and and it's funny because sometimes we in internally in the team we like to joke that if we were starting PayPal all over again now maybe we'll call the the PayPal balance unstable coin in a permission environment right because it's pretty much what what it is it is it is electronic money for the we'll talk about this when we discuss International uh but it is Europe has this concept of electronic money that I think that is really helpful for what we're trying to discuss so when you have a dollar in your PayPal balance that is backed by funds that are held in bank accounts for the benefit of of that user so we'll talk about banking later but there is no a rehypodication of assets there's nothing like that the the money sits on on the bank it's there for when when a user wants to redeem Android PayPal balance and take it out to their bank account again so Jose every dollar in PayPal is backed one to one with a dollar somewhere in a bank account somewhere is that correct and like what banks does uh PayPal use because that's come into play too and we've we've talked about usdc do you use some of the larger Banks all over the world there is a number of banks as a company where we operate in 200 markets so the the treasury and the banking relationships that we have is international and I don't think that we have and I couldn't tell you at the top of my mind the names of the banks our treasury team deals with with that but we are active globally and again I think that we are one of the few financial institutions that I know that is active in 200 markets so is the business model of PayPal just pretty similar for all the crypto people more or less the same thing as usdc where you have funds dollars in a bank many banks across the world across the financial system and then you have representations of those dollars as ledgers that are presented on uh you know mobile or a web browser is that kind of the the very quick summary of it uh I would say more than more than that paper what is that at its hard disa payments company right so the the origin of PayPal came from peer-to-peer money movement but then eventually became a way in which you wanted to do a transaction or an e-commerce environment and remember the good old days of early internet and and The New Yorker cartoon that nobody knows you're a dog in Internet so it was definitely a trust problem and people wanted to buy online from other parties but they didn't want to provide their credit cards and they didn't want to to need to deliver more information that they wanted so in essence PayPal grew to ensure the trust and the confidence when you were doing an e-commerce transaction so let's get to crypto now Jose because I know PayPal is doing a lot with crypto now and it sounds like you are one of the key leaders of that charge let's start with just this basic question I'm sure a lot of bankless listeners um have an app called venmo or have an account with with PayPal if I log into my venmo app right now what can I do with crypto so what you can do the story that that we have been in crypto PayPal has been crypto product for the best part of the last four years uh I myself have been in crypto Pro since 2015 back in my in my banking days and the way when we started the first thing that you could do with PayPal and with venmo initially with PayPal only and then you extended to memo was to buy fall and sell a few tokens so you could get into PayPal or you could get into them or way back in 2021 and 2020. you could buy a few tokens you could buy Bitcoin and and is and Litecoin and big concussion you can still do that to this day uh it was a custodial experience and it was an experience in which the user would only buy from from PayPal and sell back to PayPal so you couldn't you could not do Unchained transfers and the reason we started there is because we thought that that we helped the ecosystem in three places and one of the places where we help is access so there was a lot of users who were intrigued about crypto but they didn't want to get into detail of what shot 256 cryptographies and horror wallets and this and that and and and they didn't want quite frankly to give their banking details to some exchange out there that they didn't know and they and and were not familiar with but they like the PayPal brand that they trusted the PayPal brand so the first thing that we said is okay let's provide experience for folks who are curious about crypto but not very sophisticated and when they have their first experience that's why we we started there and by and large that has been very successful even today many of the folks could do transaction with us we are their first crypto experience and and again I think that that's part remember that we have more than 400 million accounts worldwide so as part of the driving mainstream adoption into crypto I think that ourselves and other platforms are an important Gateway for people to to engage then we started we moved from PayPal to venmo we opened the UK as our first International Market maybe the most important relevant Milestone after that was last year when we enable on chain transfers because that was the first time that from a PayPal wallet you were able to connect with a external crypto wallet and that triggered a bunch of things so if you think in terms of network Theory so you have now 400 million accounts on the PayPal and the micro system you have your nodes will know better than than I do but the same more than 100 million a crypto wallets out there which were separate there was no connectivity between those paper wallets on those crypto wallets when we enable a on chain transfers last year basically they were building a bridge between the 400 and there and the 100 and that means a number of things first if you believe in network Theory the value of an Edward grows with the square of the number of nodes so adding we're going from 100 to 400 million connected networks adds value to the ecosystem the second thing that it means is anyone with a PayPal wallet is at most two degrees of separation to anyone with an external crypto wallet and we think that is something that is extremely extremely relevant and that led to a bunch of different things one of them is first use case casual users who wanted to double into crypto for the first time when we open on chain transfers that we launched on PayPal last year and we just announced that we have just opened that on venmo then all of a sudden we have that role as a non-ramp as an off-ramp to crypto so we see more and more people who come to to PayPal to say hey I want to buy it not because I want to bet on the price of it or keep it in custody of PayPal we want to buy I want to buy it because I want to send it to madamasco I want to go and buy nfts or I want to go and do D5 and experience uh you know very well the experience for Fiat to crypto on ramps it's pretty clunky there are any suspensive and there are a bunch of steps that that you need to take so now we have a population of people who are doubling with crypto and getting used to it which is fantastic and then a population of Fairly sophisticated users that were very demanding from us is hey we want easy cheap fast on ramps between Fiat and and and crypto and that led to the next thing that we are doing now which is integrating PayPal in the properties where crypto users go we launch our first integration with metamask a few months ago which has been very successful as well and there are all sorts of things that now the market is amazing from us from modern Rams to wolframs to different ways to connect the Fiat and the web 3 world the way that we see our role is in building that conduit we don't play at the protocol level we don't think is is our role to to be driving the protocols we do believe that we play in the application layer and on the user experience layer so when when PayPal looks towards the world of blockchain uh obviously money and payments payments are very very close to what PayPal does how would you summarize what PayPal sees as its position in this space um we got we have hooks into metamask uh we're making stable coins and and crypto transfers easier um but how would you summarize in totality what what the actual PayPal strategy is for hooking into these blockchains yeah so the reason that we are on the digital currency space is because we believe that a food that a relevant part of payments and commerce will move to digital currencies and that is digital currencies Rate large so cryptocurrencies feedback stable coins even cbdcs and if you are a payments company at heart you cannot just see that one out I think that is the first time I've been in payments for the best part of the last 20 years and this is the first time that I've seen technology that can radically transform payment rates for all the Innovation that has happened on in fintech over the last yes 20 years most of it is just better user experience on the same traditional Financial rights and and this is the first time that I've seen something that can actually revamp and and rebuild those payment rates if you look at what I'm the most interested in is programmable fast low-cost payments and if you look at some of the information that that others have published the colleagues at Circle published some information on their transaction cost and I think that we're saying depending on the protocol they were looking at a transaction cost of one cent per transaction when we have been kicking the tires of some of the latest protocols we have been doing transactions with a cost of 100 of a cent per transaction and if you think that the cost of payments in general is about 200 basis points if you are able to run transactions at one cent per transaction or one tenth of a cent per transaction then there is a bunch of stuff that you could not do in payments before that you can't do now you can do micro payments you can do streaming payments you can open a channel between the three of us and charge a flat fee and just move value back and forth you can do business models that were not possible with your traditional Financial rates and that's the reason that we were so intrigued by by it there's something um I think kind of interesting and also refreshing about that posture which I feel like is um your PayPal and maybe we could generalize this to other fintechs um are just looking to the market for Solutions there's sort of a neutrality about this where you guys are saying we just want programmable fast low-cost payments we don't care whether that comes from a cdbc or that comes from the traditional banking system or that comes from stable coins or that comes from crypto we will adopt the technology that gets us the best programmable fastest lowest cost payment technology period and we'll try anything I think that is the posture that you guys are taking is that uh accurate Jose that is accurate we're coming at this with a very known I would say non-ideologic position so we're wearing it for the payments aspect and we think that is what is driving us I also think there is a little bit of that fallacy of the use case then I'm sure that do you have many of your guests in the show face that question every day that I face which is people asking but why do you need a blockchain to do this and why do you need a stable coins if you have credit cards and why do you need well I think that is the wrong question to to ask and both on the commercial side on the regulatory side because it's it's a little bit of totals all the way down right where do you stop and say why do you need planes if you have forces and why do you need Wheels feet so at some point in time the the question should not be about why the burden of the proof is not on on the new technology to prove why is is on the other side to say hey why not in which cases you cannot apply this technology because there are risks Associated to to it but the use cases keep popping up and I'm sure that if I were in the gaming business I would bring you a bunch of use cases around gaming on the payment side and and I don't think quite frankly that you will see the early adoption of digital currencies for payments on mainstream e-commerce payments I I don't think that the next thing that's going to happen is that folks are going to go to a large traditional e-commerce website and start paying with a crypto assets we have enabled crypto checkout as a funding instrument in PayPal for the last three years and what that means is if you have a Bitcoin or eth balance with us and you go to new website and and you click the PayPal Blue Button because you want to buy anything you will be showing your payment instruments your debit card your bank account whatever you have with us and if you have a crypto balance you will see your crypto balance and you can click there and pay with your crypto balance and what we do in the background is we sell the crypto we get the Fiat and we give the merchant the Fiat it's a flow that exists not a ton of people use it I don't think that mainstream users are thinking of uh their crypto holding in such a way to to pay but what I do think that we will see adoption quickly is first what it is today I think that there is proof of existence right there is 120 billion or so of a stable console already out there that mostly get used on the crypto trading ecosystem I do believe that we will see adoption in a bunch of verticals that are really really right for that gaming is one that we follow very closely because it has some characteristics that make it really interesting for a digitally native currency um there are pockets of cross-border e-commerce meaning I am in Peru and I want to buy from a merchant in the US but I don't have an international enabled credit card you see some of the of the crypto payment service providers are mostly looking at those use cases and I do think that you will see that on on B2B payments at scale relatively quickly because if you are a company that has to play A supplier in Indonesia and you have an instrument that is 24 7 that are dominated a instant settlement outside of banking hours it's a very rational decision to go and use that to your point Ryan what you were saying is less about the ideology and more about the hard utility of something that is it's a better tool in the toolbox I like that and I I also want to emphasize the opportunity here for for folks that just missed this and I'm speaking on behalf of of crypto natives who are very excited maybe about the future adoption of of crypto and uh what we would call on bankless bankless Technologies Jose which is what you just said is did I get this right Jose you guys between PayPal and venmo have over 400 million users is that correct 400 million accounts I I have several accounts myself sure sure okay so 400 million accounts and now there is the ability across both PayPal and venmo and those 400 million accounts there has been the ability to buy hold and sell crypto assets like ether or Bitcoin now there is the ability over the last year or so to transfer those assets from PayPal or from venmo to a non-custodial crypto wallet what we would call in Bank list a bankless wallet so guess what guys what we just created is a back door okay what we just created here is an onboarding mechanism from the um fintech systems like PayPal directly to a self-sovereign crypto wallet and we got the network effect that PayPal already has in place I mean that is incredible when it comes to adoption potential now of course crypto has the task to make its non-custodial wallets a whole lot easier and uh for people to to want to do that and I think that's the task ahead of us but what we've called this Jose internally at bank list for a while we've been kind of predicting this for the past you know two or three years or so we've called it the D5 mullet okay which is basically the idea that you know um fintech it's fintech in the front and D5 in the back like the the parties in the backs crypto in the back and we've kind of predicted that that fintech would would take this this path because they are neutral in the sense that they are just looking for the best Payments Technology out there so they'll use the banking system they can they'll use a cdbc if they can or they'll use crypto rails if they can and if it's better and that seems to be the case and I just want to emphasize for bankless listeners this hasn't fully been activated because we don't have 400 million users with crypto wallets yet but there's that potential okay now we have the the gate open if you will and uh to me that is absolutely incredible so that that was more a comment rather than a question Jose I don't know if you'd have anything to add to that though it gets me excited yeah and I wouldn't call it the back door I think it's a front door I think that the the crypto ecosystem needs a onboarding and off-boarding connectivity I don't think that Fiat is going away we just need to make sure that you can build that you can get in and out a quickly uh one example you were talking about the defy uh more later well I'll give you one interesting case now we have Kirito says that you can hold on PayPal wallets crypto assets that you can hold on WeMo wallets and we you have on chain transfers one of the things that that enables is people acquired them more I think it's probably eight years ago so PayPal and Batman have been sister wallets for the last eight years and for those eight years you could not move value between a PayPal wallet and a memo wallet they were not connected that existed in in their own worlds today you can send value from Obama wallet to a PayPal wallet using crypto rails which is something that that is is one of those when I go back to why do you need a blockchain to do that you don't there are at least five other other ways in which you can do that but the fact is it wasn't available and it's available today so that idea that the first transfer value in a interoperable wallet between memo and PayPal was a Bitcoin transaction blows my mind it's something that has been being in payments for again 20 years that that the first movement of value that you can make between interoperable wallets has been done on crypto rails it's just one example of that Define mullet that that you guys refer to about things that are where we are abstracting the complexity from from the consumer I think that if you go back to the early days of of Internet yes you have to understand TCP and a bunch of other things to be able to to interact with it in the same way that you need to be relatively Savvy around the protocols on the wallets and the infrastructure to be able to interact in crypto today for mainstream adoption we will need to have solutions that abstract that complexity from the mainstream user and I think that this is a a first good example of that Jose the this goes back to what you were saying earlier about just the idea of network Theory and and when you have open public permissionless networks the individuals the users on those networks can grow at a very large scale and the fact that Bitcoin was able to solve this problem of interoperability between two siled Payment Systems naturally emergently is is pretty cool and you know goes down to the very essence of like why these Technologies like excite me and Ryan um and I'm wondering uh if on the other side of things because PayPal is treating these as technologies that can provide utility to the company to increase its value how does the crypto industry compare to the non-crypto industry that is also on the the Frontier technical world of payments and that comes in the world of like cbdc's or any other innovations that we just aren't familiar with because we only pay attention to the crypto industry because we're crypto people so like how do we stack up as like service provider fighters to PayPal like how we doing so there is we need to remember that the crypto industry has been around for a relatively short amount of time so the plumbing and the wiring and many of the things it is still in progress but in the short seven years that I've been involved with the space we have gone uh a long long way so things like obviously there are a implications on kyc and AML concerns for the industry we are in a much better place now with emergence of transaction monitoring platforms and and the likes of elliptic and trm and Analysis and and others in terms of the fiatu crypto connectivity we are in a better place that we use now we we compete in the market with many other companies that are providing on ramps there and we should have uh even more and obviously and I'm sure that we will talk it later on about regulation it is it is still very early days I think that we need to remember that and and again you're talking about 100 million wallets worldwide you know talking about Millions yet and sometimes people get a little bit frustrated with the state of development I think that we have gone enormous distance in the last 12 years are we fully there yet no of course we we are not there there are solutions that will be needed for better kyc and decentralized identity and self-sovering identity and uh that that will emphasize that adoption going forward but we're at a place where the numbers that we manage if you look at surveys for the USA strictly they will tell you that a little bit I think it's a little bit more than 20 of us adults have a have about or sold crypto some moment in time and that is consistent with the numbers that we get from our internal surveys we have so many users in the US that I would say that probably at this stage the paper population is a decent sample of of the general U.S population so when you have more than 20 percent of the adult base that has your script you have about 15 percent of the adult base that has engaged with the stable coins we have 12 percent of the population of the adult population who has engaged with nfts you start to be in the cusp of usually when you go beyond 10 percent you are starting to get beyond their re-adopters and you're starting to be you're not mainstream yet but you should start to get close to to mainstream so we need to remember these early days the infrastructure is much better than than it used to be I'm actually optimistic about regulation I think that what we see going on in in places from Europe to Singapore to Japan to Hong Kong to the to UAE there is a drive toward more clarity are we there yet no we're not there yet in to the full extent but again we need to we are all playing the long game here I think that we are making a ton of progress It's funny uh you say that you give those stats around usage because if you believe some uh Regulators I'm not going to name any right now or or some politicians they would have you believe that uh no one actually uses crypto but there is no use case except the use case for scamming other people what can you say about that Jose is that just uh yeah what do you say to that charge so crypto is useless look as we said before there is you cannot argue with proof of existence so if there is a 120 billion uh you know stable coins out there that is proof of existence if you have an asset class that is worth more than one trillion that is proof of existence so there are there is utility that people are are using that for for different things and again in terms of how pervasive the the penetration is it's not 80 of operation but it's 20 I don't think the other thing that we like to say is that when when reality does not respond to your model what is wrong is not reality right so the the industry is here to to stay and is and is being adopted I I don't think that genius go back into bottles I just want to take a quick peek under the hood of the actual uh how this actually works at PayPal so users can buy and store crypto they can also send crypto um where are the assets actually sourced from so who is selling PayPal users their their crypto assets and then who's also doing the the custodian chip how do how did PayPal choose its custodian I think Jose keeps it on his Ledger right his Ledger now we are we are regulated obviously in in a number of states we have uh virtual currency license out of New York we were the first company I think that we had a conditional bid licensed that then was became full a bid license we work with several companies in the space for liquidity and and custody we have a long-standing relationship with paxos out of New York and we're investors in the company too and we do custody with several custodians the relationship with the with the consumer is is with us so when somebody's engaging with crypto on the PayPal platform their user agreement is signed with with us and then we work with different providers on in on in the background okay so if Ryan's got a venmo account and I got a venmo account and I send Ryan ether from my venmo account to his venmo account does it make an update on the ethereum blockchain does it make it on chain transfer or is that a is that a transfer inside of The venmo Silo if you're doing that inside that is an internal transfer so we don't need to go we can chain two to do that and actually is is something that is that also means that the users will not be paying a network fees for that and and that is transfer actually if you think about it we were talking earlier about Landing payments if you think about it now that you can move you can do fast free instant transfers of Bitcoin between demo and bimbo wallets in between Ben one and PayPal wallets so that doesn't go on chain there's no need for that to go on chain if you're transferring to your metamask wallet or you're sending to a later wallet then then that will go on chain okay uh and then it it took a while to get to this point of actual external transfers I would assume because PayPal is a squeaky clean business that doesn't want to offend any Regulators that that's why it took a longer amount of time but can you just explain this the the trials and their hurdles that PayPal had to get over to actually enable outbound external transfers of crypto out of the silos of PayPal and venmo 2 external wallets like how hard was that yeah I think thanks for that David and thanks for giving us so much credit part of the reason that it took a while is because it is just hard to do uh this is obviously when the when you enable launching transfers is the first time that you are direct interacting with with the permissionless side of it right so it's easier and and we wanted to walk before we run so it took a while for us to build kind of the wall Garden experience at the beginning the the bifold and and sell but also to build the skill base and the Italian base and and get our regulatory charges remember that the we acquire a company in Tel Aviv called a curve that was active in in custodian multi-party computation and now they they that team still represents probably around half of our engineering base but of the team if you think about it we have in in three years built a team that is more or less 50 of them people who came who had already a PayPal a new payments inside out but didn't really have the crypto skill base and the other 50 came either from Acquisitions or from hiding from from industry we had to get the regulatory plumbing and Licensing in place we had to get a node operations infrastructure connectivity permissionless blockchains transaction monitoring systems it just takes a while I I don't want to blame The Regulators for how long it it took because it was not on them it wasn't us we just needed to build that that muscle and then we were comfortable with it say hey now we can open the tab and go and engage with with the permeability seamless side Jose you mentioned earlier that there's a 120 billion dollars in stable coins out there and I think Dave and I just checked the charts um earlier in the week and you know that's about right we got usdc we've got tether we've got um you know paxa so we've got some of some of the smaller ones as well um since you are a payments expert and I think um maybe at some level a stable coin expert if you extrapolate the term stablecoin to mean like digital dollars or something like that can you give us your thoughts on how we get to a trillion dollars right so one 120 billion right now and that's actually down so for bankless listeners I mean what the peak was like 160 170 something like that billion and now we're down a little bit um I don't think it's fatal but clearly uh we've got more use cases to generate for stable coins before we can get to a trillion dollars in market cap what do you think it's going to take I think we'll take two or three things and it's and it's funny that you bring back the one trillion because I remember I was asked what was my my five year out to be on my five year out view was among other things one trillion of outstanding and stable coins that they are doing doing transactions I I think we get there I think it will probably take three to five years to get to get there and it requires a bunch of things first of all most of that 120 billion today they they are used for crypto trading institutional trading getting it for crypto Capital markets if you want that will grow with the market so obviously crypto markets have not uh been a extremely active over the last 18 months when the market comes back that will drive additional activity and that's one chunk of it I don't think that will get us to one trillion I think that will get us to 1 trillion is the other side of it which is going back to your analogy of the defy mullet it will it will mean that you start to use that for payments which is again our our charger and and although in all those four or five verticals that I think that they are ripe for adoption uh for adoption but also I think that it will require that to get the they get used more broadly on traditional Asset Management uh one aspect what I think that actually the US is is leading and what I'm seeing a ton of innovation is the asset management space if you follow what the likes of wisdom 3 and Franklin Templeton and BlackRock and others are doing I think that in that combination of traditional Capital markets and tokenization of assets I think that's going to be another Big Driver of of assets under management and assets under custody for stable coins I think at some point in time you top out the the crypto trading side of it there's going to be some stability there uh whether that takes us to 150 or 200 or 300 I I don't know I don't think that it takes us to 1 trillion I believe that for that you need a Commerce and traditional Capital markets activity it's interesting if you see in the European Union obviously it passed a Mika the legislation their framework for for crypto markets recently and you are starting to see over the last month probably I've seen three or four companies that are making progress in in Euro denominated stable coins really and of those who are out there and usdc has an aerodominated coin and if you look at the market cap and the assets on chain they compared to the USD base they are not that big and the reason for that is that that Euro denominated stable coins and in general local currency denominated the stable coins are going to be more useful for mainstream use cases for payments again and I know this and I'm sure that if I was working in media I would bring you a bunch of use cases in in media yeah I just know my my space but I think that we need to for that trillion which again is the goal that I think we should be striving for we need to get into that mainstream side of the economy uh can you divvy up that payment segment for us real quick and in terms of stable coins okay like what kind of payments are we talking about right so I um I already use stable coins for a lot of payments I would say on-chain transaction type payments or sort of investing type payments or you know um just everybody in crypto I mean we pay for things in crypto as a company bankless is a crypto media company we we pay people in usdc so we're starting to use it but we might be on the early adopter side of the curve here but when you think about payments are we talking about like um buying a coffee at Starbucks is it kind of that level consumer payments are you talking about like integrating a pay with usdc on uh Amazon any kind of e-commerce checkout are we talking about like bigger Merchant B2B type payments uh you know settlement types of payments like you know big dollar amounts I'm sure you have a much more elegant way of dividing up the payments segment than I just gave you so please do not feel constrained uh to uh to my categories of things but yeah where's it going to come from the payments I think they're going to see that on the places where the current Plumbing for payments is uh not the the best tool in the box and that usually is in a couple of places one of them is anything that has to do with micro payments or high fluidity of payments they if you are transacting in traditional Fiat payment instruments they really struggle with high-speed very low denomination in in amount if you're trying to do transactions you're trying to pay a transaction that is cents of a dollar with your credit card it gets very clunky and there are usually there are minimum fees and and and for that is not a very good use case that's why I keep going back to things like gaming if you're buying a skin in fortnite and the way you do it today is that you need to top up a wallet and just have money left there that you're gonna use when you are when you are in game if you are if you want to do digital Goods at high speed in game without getting in the way of the experience that's one place where you will start to see things like like that the other aspect is the Other Extreme I don't believe that for multi-million dollar payments the system is that broken if you are a large Enterprise that is paying suppliers there is enough in the banking system and the corresponding banking system to get that done cost efficiently but if you are a mid-sized Merchant that is doing wire transfers and the wire transfer is costing them 50 to 100 dollars and you can only do it Monday to Friday nine to five during banking hours and all of a sudden you can do something that has instant settlement and is dollar nominated and worth scoring for seven you're just gonna go there so I believe that the next bunch of adoption and there are companies that are already working toward that I think that companies like fireblocks which have a ton of respect for they're starting to get into that B2B enablement initially for companies like yours so you're saying crypto native companies that are very used to doing that but more and more one good thing about the B2B side is that companies are very Russian electors so you put something in there again going back to the uh ideology or lack thereof and say hey you're going to show me something in which I can reduce my cost of payments by a multiple of X I'm gonna use it and I'm just gonna use the best tool for for the job so I I think that you will see a lot of that into into those extreme cases very very small payments and B2B payments one aspect where I have friends that are starting to use usdc and and other stable coins is payouts so companies here in the valley that have developers in different parts of the world and trying to get that money out to those developers and the banking channels are just not the best tool for that and and I believe that we will see more of it which is helpful because again that's going to drive volume faster than the the retail use cases with I would say by the way since you mentioned it I am very interested in this gaming payments kind of use case right and so you mentioned like fortnite dollars or I think they're called V bucks right so what is a v Buck by the way like what would be backing a v Buck is that just um money on uh you know epic games balance sheet uh somewhere or is that like one-to-one mapped into it that's not like a that's not like a stable coin in any way or it's not like the same as a PayPal dollar is it and by the way it's probably um similar to like Starbucks gift card and that that kind of class of of units maybe maybe you could share some insight because I've never asked an expert this question I I couldn't answer that either I think that's a good question for the fortnite uh Folks at nip games but I think that there are uh one of the things that I see uh not only about buying those two skins in the games if you think of at least not only fortnite days Roblox and Minecraft places where actually you have developers that are building in that ecosystem and they get compensated in that digital currency of that space but I say hey what do I do with uh be back now any dollars I need to make payroll I need to pay my my developers outside so again how do you build the value that has been created in one ecosystem how do you make that into value that can be deployed in a different ecosystem is something where where gaming is such a fascinating scenario gaming is is fascinating in many aspects for the Computing Geeks in in the audience actually a lot of the Innovation that happens single Computing happens in gaming because if you're trying to do instant rendering uh for millions of concurrent users the Computing Challenge from that is actually very very demanding and and I think that we learn a lot from from the gaming side I'm not deflecting your question or what is back in your feedback I just don't know no I I there's nothing about the Skins it's just probably an entry on the balance sheet you know basically and like I guess once it's a database one big difference right one big difference is that obviously a v bucks aren't interoperable and I'm sure epic games would not be able to get away with paying its employees in V bucks yeah they want uh money that is uh useful outside of the you know the the Epic ecosystem uh but go ahead David Jose um if you're if PayPal is interested in gaming this implies that there's going to need to be networks that PayPal integrates with that aren't the ethereum layer one because games and the high transaction fees of the ethereum layer one just aren't going to go together there's other networks out there there's ethereum layer twos I know Tron actually interestingly has been used for a lot of payment velocity as well uh Solana is a low fee blockchain and so and also since now PayPal is now integrated inside of metamask well metamask is integrated with all the ethereum layer twos so I'm wondering if if there's a known strategy here at PayPal with how to integrate and which networks to integrate with how are they playing the how's PayPal playing the the network integration game yeah so when we when we started doing the space we were saying well you have to be present in the Bitcoin ecosystem and ethereum ecosystem just there's there's no way around that uh and as I said we were very clear in the game deciding there will not be a PayPal protocol we're not in the game of of having a a private protocol we want we we have a first principle that is a developers tell us where to go we don't tell developers where to go we will follow and we monitor developer activity and and we we keep on a an eye on what's happening in the market and what is getting a adoption no pain then in the future I don't see a PayPal chain in the future no uh because think about it why would that make sense if if we wanted a permission environment we have a permission environment already so PayPal is already if you if both sides of of the transaction have PayPal accounts then we are doing we have been doing that for 20 years if you think about reliability and scalability and throughput and all those things uh there is actually I'm trying to figure out I don't have an opinion yet about whether we go to a world of a multiplicity of layer ones and and they're going to be I don't think that we're going to see 300 layer ones that are that are relevant but I'm trying to figure out what is the maximum number of layers layer once they get a scale or we will figure that one out yeah or we go to a world in which there are layer twos on two or three protocols that have different flavors the good thing is again is we don't have a horse on that race and and we follow the developer side when we were talking about gaming for instance uh we have been paying a ton of attention to what the folks are actors are doing and and we have been participating with with them and and they have decided that gaming is one of the verticals where they want to be a part of we have been looking at uh Solan and we have been looking at others I'm sure that we have this conversation six months from now the innovation in the system will have generated three other protocols either layer ones or twos that that we should be that we should be discussing David I love this uh PayPal has no tribes right they just they're like whether we're the cheap payments the secure fast and efficient will go there the devs and the users yep uh so so okay so that's the uh the network side of things um the the other interesting I think point of conversation is that PayPal when you pay into great payments and stable coins on ethereum you're actually not that far away from Financial activity right there's um there's usdc but then there's C usdc which is a yield bearing version of uscc inside a compound that is also just another erc20 token and so the question is since PayPal is so proximate to D5 stuff in addition to payments would we ever see a day where there's defy stuff D5 activities either like savings technology yield uh uh alternative assets is that something that is on PayPal's radar or is it mainly going to stick to these networks for their payment and Money Services I I would say that as of now we are definitely more interested in the payment and transactional side of side of things and we are an enabler to the to the ecosystem I don't know where where it will go in the future uh I don't know where the regulatory side of things is gonna settle on the on the staking uh side on another Sunday deal generating part of it one of the things that I have seen with with a ton of interest is how some of these deal bearing instruments are now being driven by a tokenization of money market funds and and the like which obviously are something that is in the in the province of broker dealers and and they're like I don't know where it's gonna go I think that for the time being we are very focused on the payment side and we will explore and see what what happens uh but our Focus very much now is is payments we're not trying remember that our crypto product inside PayPal and demo lives inside an app that does many other things as well so we need to be very Discerning about what we add because you don't want to have a mammoth habit that takes forever to to to load it's very cool Jose uh I think this is uh part one uh really which is what's PayPal doing in the space and um the like the tldr that I'm getting out of this is uh a lot and it's exciting and this is um your front door to a crypto for a lot of users who aren't listening to bankless right now and are scared to hold their own uh private keys and uh this is a you know a great way to get them into the ecosystem so that's exciting uh very cool I I want to move the conversation not only that I think that what we have learned is that this is definitely that public but we are finding more and more that there is a more sophisticated public that really likes a that connectivity and the EC in and out on the protections I think that we are still the only company that I know of in the US that we provide a warranty where if somebody gets access to your account we will provide up to fifty thousand dollars of protection if somebody gets into your account and and thanks to your crypto out I think that we're just one of the things that we like to think is that we are raising the bar in terms of customer service in this space both for casual and for more sophisticated users yeah I think that's important and I hope the former FTX users heard that right there is some guarantee for their accounts I think crypto could could use that leveling up from traditional Finance who's done that well for

which is interesting now we're gonna we're gonna zoom out for a second okay so I know you also have some interesting perspectives and takes on this old banking system that we have right now both internationally and then in the US and maybe the future role that stable coins and cdbcs might play in that in addition to crypto which we've talked about so far you wrote a paper co-wrote a paper called payments and the evolution of stable coins and cdbcs in the global economy and it starts like this the U.S payment system has proven to be vibrant adaptable and Innovative and yet it has also revealed areas in need of urgent Improvement I think I'll paraphrase that for you for us rather the banking system is kind of broke right now in fact I think you say as much later in the paper um I'm curious your perspective on this and let's broaden this to you to what role cdbcs might play What role staple coins might play in this but when you look at kind of payments and the banking system today what's broken about banking in the United States and I I grew up in Europe and I did a lot of working payments in in places like Latin America and others and now I've been in the US for 12 years and I and I remain a student of the payment system and regulation in the US because it is fascinating if you look at what is probably unique about the US in most other places the payment payment systems are established at the national level and even at the Supra National level if you're in Europe there is a the seba environment and there is connectivity between between different countries the U.S evolved in a different way in terms of payments so payments are regulated at the state level and that actually has been a a fantastic thing one thing that the state by state uh setup provides is what at the Justice brand is called the 50 Laboratories of Freedom so there is a ton of innovation that will happen at the state level and different states will try different things and then the things that work will get will get adopted and things that don't work will will kind of fade away and if you don't have an environment in which you have that state by state level you don't have you the Innovation that has happened here you see you even in our space on the crypto side you saw New York a few years ago coming up with their virtual currency framework and then you saw Wyoming coming up with a special purpose repository institution and you're seeing now things that are appearing in Illinois Luciana and other places so that is fantastic in terms of the effervescence of the of the system and the innovation one thing that that's set up doesn't really uh is not really conducive to is that ones that you have decided what works that system is not very conducive to robust infrastructure that rolls out to the whole of of the country and and you see that in in probing two aspects on the payment space we have been talking in the industry about fed now for quite a while which is this real-time payment systems that that the Federal Reserve will launch this year there has been an alternative to that already in the market it's called RTP from from the Clearinghouse which is a private company that has been providing that that is a very welcome progress there because what that will do is be able to settle the payments in real time which is something that has been available in many markets outside the US for a long long while what is this dance quote in the US if it's not real time so most of if you if you're using the traditional banking rails most of the the transactions that you have the settlement time is going to take two to three days probably you're using traditional uh right think about for instance the use of checks a paper checks is quite frankly it's mind-boggling that we are still using papers paper checks paper checks are expensive to process they take forever to to settle think about this I was discussing with someone the other day uh we have planes in the sky transporting physical checks from from Banks to to clean Center so it is it takes days it doesn't make sense that that you are in an environment that's a us thing right other countries don't do paper checks so much anymore is that correct most countries don't do much it checks there are others are there that are still using the review in Europe that still use them but it's definitely something that is less common than than it used to be for both reasons because there are there are just better ways to do that if you see payment Innovations like ourselves but also folks like cell the most of them sell is is a is run by a Consortium mobile Banks and they are moving toward that type of faster settlement for for smaller payments so I guess that to your point about what is what can be improved there is a need to balance that Innovation that happens at the state level with that I guess that the robustness and the speed of the of the infrastructure would you say that that is what the Arc of uh Banking and payments are because that would fit in with the idea that like technology always increases in in speed just like what is the Arc of payments like go faster they settle faster settlement assurances go faster that is the arc right uh how far if that is true how far behind is America in that Arc how much faster are payments settled elsewhere outside of America versus inside of America I think the U.S will will get there you know the moment that you have those real-time settlement mechanisms you're gonna move to t plus zero so basically saying they settlement which is what you can get doing in other markets I think that is interesting when you look at uh the payment space going back to what we were discussing earlier about why do you need X if you have why I I think there's a bit of a fallacy on why do you need the stable coins do you have Bank deposits why do you need a crypto payments if you have fed now I think that all those things should coexist because there are some things that you can do in one way that that you will not be able to do in in order for instance and real-time settlement it's a fantastic thing that should happen as soon as possible should have happened in the past we should get it as as fast as we possibly can it is still mostly going to be used for interbank uh certainly payments meaning you still need to have a bank account to be able to benefit from from that same thing with the what I think is the fallacy that pitches stable coins against cbd6 and some people are saying and you see both sides of the question in countries that are more productivity C are saying hey if we have a cbdc why do you need a stable coin in countries that are more Pro stable coin it will say let's go stable coins and forget cbdc's I do believe that that is again that's a bit of a fallacy because I those and I do believe that in the end you are going to see the stable coins that are backed by cbd6 and it look a little it looks a little bit again as total sort of all the way down but if you think about it actually makes sense because you if you think about a cbdc what a cbdc is is a digital claim on Central Bank money so and and there's a CBC I don't think is going to be is a digital currency that is deployed on a permissionless protocol like ethereum so very likely you're gonna see erc20 tokens that are backed by uh digital Euro or by a digital pound or by by a cbdc and to your question and and Brian I lost your insistence on wait what is back in this there is no reason why a cbdc could not back a stable coin and that the stable coin provides that interoperable a layer on on top of it so the difference between a cbdc central bank money so basically it's a claim against the full faith and credit of the state that issues the the cbdc a stablecoin is in essence programmable e-money and you then you see the the banking industry talking about tokenized deposits which are a good thing too but again it's a tokenized deposit so it is Commercial Bank money that has the commercial bank money risk associated with that institution all those are pieces of the puzzle but I do believe that will coexist and will be useful for different things ER but also I believe that you need to have a version of digital cash if you if you look at and this is not a us only a comment when you look at the world a people use less and less cash and again ankash is is expensive to handle but if you are if you're a central bank and you're looking at one of your the the mandates that you have is on the one side Financial stability and and also financing inclusion you need to be able to make sure that people have access to the financial system in a world without cash and without cbdcs and without stable coins the only way that you can get access to the financial system is through the banks and I live in Silicon Valley and three hours from my house in Silicon Valley there is a county Sierra County and then getting into the the Sierra Nevada where there is not one Bank banking Branch so this concept in the U.S and other regions of banking desert so places where there is a lack of banking infrastructure and there are probably good reasons for it but we cannot be just reliant on having access to a bank account we cannot be just Reliant having access to a physical Bank branch in your report Jose um there is a stat which surprised me even 30 of Americans with the household income under 30k reported making all or almost all of their work weekly purchases in cash um these these are some of the unbanked members of society that are still kind of using cash um I mean for myself personally I uh I I keep a 20 bill on me um just because there's some toll or some parking garage that's only going to take it but aside from that you know 20 bill that I they always keep on me and use in case of emergency it's almost like the break class in case of emergency I got my 20. um I don't use cash in my everyday life um I use crypto or I use kind of the traditional banking system but that is not true for a large number of unders unserved members of society who maybe aren't close uh to a local bank um or just don't have access to it for one reason or another I remember we had um a guy by the name of Richard Turin on the podcast who wrote a book and studies actually the um uh China's essential Bank digital currency system and you wrote this book called cashless and I you know being in the crypto space uh obviously we have some natural resistance against that type of um that type of setup right surveillance state cbdc is a bad C can be a bad word in this space right well that means you know the government can basically freeze your accounts tied to a social credit score inflated away into nothing where it's the autonomy where's the this you know Civic rights all of these things his counter argument to that was like China needed to uh Bank the unbanked and this quite frankly was the fastest way to do it so put a mobile app on their phone and they can use digital cash this new Chinese Central Bank digital currency in um remote areas all across the country rather than having to go physical presence to some bank and rely on their their you know the crappy banking app user experience so his argument was basically China has uh banked millions of people maybe you know given China size tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people uh using using this kind of technology I didn't fully agree with that argument but I found elements of it somewhat compelling um what do you think is like the best design for a system moving forward do you like China's design do you like some of the proposals coming out in kind of the EU what's like the best digital cash design Society I I feel like you may be indicating a blend of things but I'm curious what do you think it actually looks like I can give you a few principles that I think that that makes sense and implementations will vary depending on on the country you are uh the experiment or the experience in China is is fascinating the Chinese Financial system as you guys were saying has some particularities on what is Bank versus non-bank versus payment apps and the like which is quite unique the experience in India has been fascinating as well because the India stock went in a different way they were saying is hey let's get digital IDs for everyone and and on the back of those digital IDs then we can build a unified payment system and we can have Finance institutions that are payment Banks meaning that they are not involving in credit activity Jose I don't know much about this actually so everyone not everyone but a portion of uh Society in India has now a digital ID which would be like a almost like a digital passport passport yeah so there is India went with uh with a very broad ranging effort uh on uh on an identity protocol called R where they went and basically they they got a digital IDs issued for most of the country yeah and I know and they combine that with something that is called UPI which is a unified payment interface which means that there is a standard for bank to bank account a bank account to bank account payments so that provides a solid infrastructure on top of which people can build payments and an identity applications because they have that common layer of of payments and and they will still identified the other interesting experiment has been really successful has been picked in in Brazil where the Brazilian Central Bank implemented a way to basically do free payments from bank account to bank account because there was a very large segment of the population who did not have debit cards or or credit cards specifically on your point on on cbdcs there are the hot topics of debate on cbdc's one of them is what you're saying is what are the surveillance implications what are the probably the Privacy requirements which is information that the state should have or should not have about my monetary interactions the other aspect is what I said about in terms of inclusion what happens if a bank would not give me a bank account I I still need to have access to to the economy and and I need something that is an instrument that is issued by by the central bank and yet another aspect is this difference about Commercial Bank money and central bank money and the different risk that does have that that has there has been I really like I think it's relatively old old in the sense of a couple of years ago or three years ago the bank of England issued a paper with their initial framework where they were talking about a two-tier system meaning that the way what they were looking at at a digital pump basically said hey the central bank will issue the the currency and we'll keep The Ledger uh but the distribution will be done by financial institutions banks are known Banks which will have the apps with which the users will interact and that provides that has a number of advantages first of all it limits the information at the user level that goes back to the central bank so it helps mitigate those concerns about about surveillance and privacy uh and on the other side meets the consumers where they are today and it still gets to distribute that I think that that is a good construct when you get into the weeds we are the years away from as a deployment of cbdc's because then you need to start to think of things like what is the off-chain problem so what happens if if you have a Central Central Bank money the results in your app and the phone network is down you still need to be how do you Version Control of the database when people are interacting with their phones and then the network comes back up and how do you do how does that money movement there are once that you get into the technical side of it there are very thorny issues that I think will be solved but will be solved over over a number of years Jose let me ask you a question uh why why not just um okay it'll take a while for the US to create a central bank digital currency why not just skip all that and just use stable coins um I mean we have the infrastructure on crypto right now true a couple of years ago um we couldn't scale it in terms of you know payment networks and and low low transaction per like low transaction per second in in high fees but we're getting there now we have it seems like we have the infrastructure to essentially make a collection of stable coins the digital dollar for the United States why don't they just let the private Market handle this of course this would be uh you know Jeremy Jeremy allier and and circles uh argument why don't you just let the private sector take care of it um that's what American private sector does very well is is uh solve solves thorny tech technical problems and we've got the tech we could do this uh what do you think of that approach I I think that there is not the questions you need to ask because there is not really a choice I I'm not going to say hey let's just keep cbdc's and focus on stable coins I think that that the the right question is I know if there's a question as much as an assertion let's have stable comes we need to have stable coins in the in the US there should be a private stable coins that are Fiat back that are well back that are regulated that are safe that are secure that people can use and let's have the conversation about cptcs is not one or the other but coexist I could very well see as I was saying earlier that you have a stable coin that is backed by a cbdc what we cannot do is to wait for stable coins until we have cbd6 because then you're talking multi-years and and then the ship has a sale uh I don't think it's a neither or to the urgency of what Jeremy was saying I fully agree we need a framework for the stable coins in the in the US and it is important if you look at we were talking earlier you were saying right and and you're absolutely right that volume of stablecoins has come down a little bit the volume of USD issued and USD denominated stablecoin has come down by quite a bit if you look at from the beginning of the year until now I'm speaking of from memory but I think it's like 20 billion in in USD issue the stable coins that has disappeared either because it has been redeemed or it has moved to other places and I think that and while the stable coins that are uh outside of the US have continued to increase in in volume I think that is there is a pressing issue on clarifying the framework for the stable coins in the US and you're seeing that in the legislative action and the discussions that are happening in Congress right now so I don't think it's either or between a stable coins and cbdc's we need a stable coins and we need that now and then we need to have the process and the conversation on of how good a digital dollar look like if that's the decision the country makes yeah I certainly agree with that one of uh our theories for why stable coins are down in terms of total market cap is that there's a new yield Farm in town and that's called U.S treasuries and it's paying you know five percent and higher so people are uh going over there that is the new yield Farm it's not uh on chain so maybe there's some of that as well um Jose you've been very uh kind with your time this has been a fascinating fantastic conversation I I just have a couple more thoughts to close your questions for you and uh the first is this around regulatory so crypto in the year of 2023 we we almost we can't do a crypto podcast without talking about regulatory because it very much feels like in the wake of 2022 um the eye of Sauron is sort of like looking directly at crypto now and it's it's it's all of its malice is focused on on crypto it feels that way anyway it's probably not as worse as it seems from your Vantage Point and you guys have uh dealt with Regulators from the very beginning I'm sure the very beginning of of PayPal there was some interesting conversations uh with regulators and could you really do it and there was a time where you were sort of the startup trying to get like Regulators on board with what you're doing um from your Vantage Point what do things look like in in crypto um is this really uh you know sort of a um a very bad regulatory environment you see it improving I'd just be interested in picking your brain any thoughts you have on regulations with respect to crypto yeah and and I'm gonna I might be a little bit of a contrarian here because I'm actually looking at the glass half full so on the role of Regulation a the way we think about this we have been thinking about this all the way through is for crypto to to get traction you require access you require utility and you require the regulation in place and we have been working on all those three spaces and and more like one of the things that I've learned is if you're working on something that is remotely relevant more likely than not it's going to be regulate you it is Healthcare Financial Services education energy you name it this is going to be a regulatory framework there and there are good reasons for for that and I do think and this might not sound very glass helpful but I do think that there is a risk specifically in the US that the U.S falls behind in digital currencies versus other Britain so if you look at progress we have been talking about Mika in Europe but you see about progress in FCA in the UK you see about the progress in Japan progress in Singapore you see the progress in in Hong Kong you see the progress in UAE so the world is moving toward more regulatory Clarity and and I do think that there is a risk of the U.S falling falling behind there and when I but when I look at the US I think there are a number of assets that are there that that are getting they're being put to use first of all as we said we had the benefit of a few years of a state level and Innovation and Frameworks that that have been tried and tested I think that experience for New York The Experience from Wyoming and other places creates the substrate for say hey we know what can work in the in the US and on the other side I think that we are seeing a more urgency on the legislative side uh there are a number of hearings that are going on both in terms of stablecoin bills but also in terms of Market infrastructure so I'm actually confident that we will see a additional Clarity in the US I would be all do me and gloomy if I were thinking that that is not the case because I again I do believe that the environment that we have now is is really complicated is driving consumers and companies offshore and is and it creates a disadvantage and we're seeing now I don't know if we do have been covering the situation in Europe lately but the the there is a ton of appetite in places like France for crypto companies to get established there so I think that and and I think some of the information from the Fantastic developer report that Electric Capital issues shows that the US is losing crypto developers to other regions we are we are seeing that so again I think that the situation is not the best but I am optimistic that we will get to uh to a good place I think that is clear that this is something again the proof of existence the 120 billion the trillion in assets there is an acknowledgment that the industry is here the industry is here to to stay and the framework has to be developed and has to implement there's always the fight to fight The Regulators in the ways that helps the crypto industry Express itself and be built in the ways that we want to build this industry but then also there's the same fight where the crypto as an industry needs to make our products and tools more usable to companies like PayPal and so Jose as we come to a closer I'm wondering if I could just kind of pick your brain on on that angle I would imagine integrating with public blockchains with ethereum with Bitcoin wasn't the easiest especially when you have a very high quality app and a user base that expects quality uh what could we have done what could we do what could the crypto industry do to make your lives easier what were the big problems when it came when it came with integrating uh ethereum stable coins Bitcoin into PayPal and venmo and just overall like if we had the responsibility of making our product better to you into PayPal what should we look at first ah I uh Integrations as you were saying have to be easy at all levels not not only on the on the protocol side I think that's something that is more available now that when we started four or five years ago is that way back then you you had to do the infrastructure yourself you had to operate the notes you had two good do a lot of the relatively low level if I can call it that way that you don't use on traditional Computing you had to do it yourself because the providers were not there I think that that ecosystem has developed now and you have folks who will handle node operations that will spin up nodes for you and manage them for you I think that that it that helps what I'm thinking is we started doing this four years ago and we put a time a ton of time and effort and engineering resources behind it because we were really convinced about it I'm trying to figure out if you're a company that is less convinced than PayPal was saying I'm gonna do it but if the list is super heavy then I'm not going to do it how do we make that life easier and I think that that infrastructure folks are going to be concerned about the technical lift who do you use and and again the moment that you start to have another operators and people that will handle the infrastructure and mempools and the like for you that is getting there it's getting easier easier also the the compliance side of things both in terms of transaction monitoring and and kyc has has to be has to be more clear but I think that again the industry is in a better place that it was uh 40 years ago uh I think that we need I can't point you to something where we need things that are not available in the market today but we know that we do need more providers of those there has to be more competition in the same in the marketing many of these places would you just see two or three companies that are that are Enterprise grade and I believe that we need more entrance in that in in the market Jose thank you for spending some time with us today this has been a fascinating conversation we appreciate you thank you for having me it's been a pleasure uh bankless Nation we got 400 million users that uh in PayPal right now and venmo right now it's uh our responsibility to get them into crypto more excited about crypto we need to build solutions that uh that that make them come into our ecosystem as well so that's on us and uh Jose here has done his part um action items for you of course I want you to read the payments and evolution of stablecoins paper we talked about that you want to link to it it'll be in the show notes and of course gotta let you know risks and disclaimers none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign
