[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is your weekly recap episode we're here talking about everything interesting happening in nfts and the broader web 3 world this week and i am so excited for this week's episode because i am joined today by blake fanouken who is the head of ventures and the nft fund at pluto digital and also an advisor at resurgence games blake is so savvy about so many things nfts and web 3 related and we've been friends now in sort of funny erroneous like ways on and off for uh for months we've met a couple of different times and so i'm really glad to have you on the pod to talk through this week and some broad concepts in nfts right now thanks for joining i'm so excited to be here this is one of my favorite podcasts um so yeah super hyped to get into everything so we are going to talk about kind of the general macro situation here today as we always kick off this show doing that we're also going to deep dive on jenkins of la and 10ktf which are projects that blake is better versed than i am but i am fascinated by so really excited for for you blake to really like break those down for us um and i think you have an overarching concept this idea of storytelling as staking that i really want you to get to we're going to talk about the royalty problem that's what everyone's talking about this week in nft twitter i also want to talk about adam newman getting 350 million dollars from andrews and horowitz i actually wrote a little newsletter about this so we'll break that down a couple other topics we'll get into but before we do any of this i have two things for the audience here one we're gonna hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors and second i'm gonna ask that you please

network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets okay let's just start big picture here blake where are we right now this week in terms of what's happening in the uh the nft market broadly and uh and volumes etc yeah i mean what's been really sending out to me is just how low volumes have been on openc uh obviously that's there there is and there are other marketplaces uh which we will be talking about i'm sure a little bit later but um volumes have been lowest that they've been um this week um throughout the entire year so that's really interesting in the sense of you know i think with what's been considered around the east merge heath prices you know going up or you know with the hopes of them going up and continuing to rise i think that really affects everything um we also saw on on tuesday which i think is a really really interesting point um we saw the highest number of um wrapped e2 eth ratio buys on openc for the entire year as well at 40 percent what that means of course is that people were actually accepting offers on openc instead of um you know waiting for their uh jpegs as um this podcast is called jpegs to sell so again i think people are getting a little bit antsy um considering you know okay let's just sell it volumes are low let me just accept the general low ball offer um so so those are the two things that i'm really watching this week and perhaps like optimism about the price of eth it's like you know what i'll actually take your maybe lowballed offer on my nft so that i can have i can ride that eath wave uh total people are expecting it to go up i i you know there's a whole other rabbit hole around the the merge and whether or not the merge is properly priced in my guess is that like in a big macro sense it's not priced in but in a you know like what we usually see like the day after the merge happens or after the merge goes through we'll probably see some price falls you know it's like buy the rumor sell the sell the news um and so i don't know if that is what people are thinking and who knows we're all speculating here if they are like accepting lowball eth offers because they just want to huddle the eth through this merge period i don't know i think we've already seen a pretty healthy run-up of eth probably largely on merge news and i don't know if there's like a ton of room to grow on just the merge itself yeah um i don't know if you have a few thoughts on yeah merge being priced in or not i mean i think the general kind of understanding for nft investors is that when eth goes up you know nft prices go down and people are trying to price that in to how they're buying and trading nfts right so uh with that i mean i think that's maybe more of a micro um kind of event versus the the macro merge conversation um but i think people are are bracing um for east to continue to go up or they're still trying to recover from this big run-up that ethan's kind of had in the last month so i think it's it's kind of a mix between recovering from what's just happened and also trying to price in um and adjust for maybe what's coming um in in the next month let's talk storytelling at staking because the macro environment none of us really know we can't predict and uh there's it's sort of a wait and see thing as as time goes on one other thing too i guess the biggest you know everything's you know going down and you know nothing's working but then at the same time you know uh a golden board 8 just sold for 777 east um so it's like oh wow at the actual top yeah so at the top sorry sorry i know we've got to move on but at the top no no no talk about this we're just we're we're chill here at uh we're we're we're moving we're waving we're vibing yeah so like at that point you know at the at the very top end um i you know we're still seeing like massive sales um so it's i i i think at the top end always you know that's less effective and people will be making big calls and making big plays because i think people are are thinking okay listen you know the big buyers the big investors are thinking hey you know this might be the time to really really capitalize when people are um desperate and it'll still look like really really big buys and bids at the top we talk about will nfts decouple from crypto at any point does crypto decouple from equities at any point in terms of like their price fluctuations and in some ways i feel like what we've seen in this latest bear market is like blue chips decoupling a little bit from things right like yeah nfts maybe decoupling from crypto or even the broader equities market and um i actually think that's a beautiful segue potentially i'm not exactly sure where you're going with this but based on my hypothesis into the storytelling as staking concept um because i'm hypothesizing that there's an element of like people holding on to things when there's like a real story they're getting behind so i think maybe you're what you're about to get into is is deeper than that but um let's do it tell me storytelling as staking what is this concept and uh and we'll talk about some specific projects that you think fit into this narrative yeah i actually think it came from the 10ktf project um that's that's where i kind of um have noticed it being done really well and really so and this is a term like you've kind of like come up with okay yeah yeah you just made it up you're like the dynamic play out cool yeah yeah yeah and for me i mean you know we've seen i guess the last kind of six months as large nft projects have developed that there are staking components that's kind of been the next development you lock up your nfts you get rewarded with maybe an airdrop maybe with some type of token that's probably not doing very well now but you get rewarded with something now what i've seen um and what i think needs to be happening if we've seen the kind of next wave where the large projects or you know some of the upcoming projects what is differentiating them to it what i'm seeing is you know this gamified experience around you know nft interaction and nft usage uh so what 10ktf has done is really okay you know i have my nft um clearly we want you to be engaged with the project so let's do these little kind of gamified periods of you know locking up your nft which we call in the crypto world staking um and with that you know it's not just click a button um sign a transaction on your meta mask and it's gone and you can't you know touch it for you know a day or two or you know a month or two whatever it is what there is is there's a process of storytelling within it so there's a reason why you're staking you're getting little video clips you're getting um you know high quote-unquote stakes as to why it's why you need to lock it up you're saving a certain character in the game you're building lore so there's these there's these kind of very um entertainment based experiences um through the actual process of staking and i'm seeing that as a really important innovation in um community engagement and actually lore building and storytelling and i'm like oh that should be the absolute norm now um and that should be what projects are doing no longer can it be okay just throw your nft up with the hopes of getting something because also what we're seeing is like you know a lot of tokens ecosystems aren't working so you can't actually promise tokens because that creates whole other issues for projects going forward so why not do some type of really interesting kind of narrative scenario uh where you're still excited to go through the process and learn about the project and you're staking maybe you don't even know what the reward is but you know that you know you're learning you're getting more attached to the community so um i think it's it's a it's a really interesting thing that's been developing and i'm seeing it i'm seeing it also with jenkins um as as we go along but i'm really excited to see that to me represents development yeah that's super cool and i i want to talk more about it let's back up for a second just on 10ktf in case folks are like not familiar with this project this i remember this launching is it like the end of last year it feels like it was a while ago that it first sort of like emerged on the scene stealth launch kind of shrouded a mystery there was like um wha what's his name uh wag me son is that his name yeah or whatever like you know i remember this i remember this happening last you know the end of last year and checking it out and being like oh wow like this is cool in terms of it's incredibly well branded i've talked about this before with like azuki's i think it applies to jenkins and azerballa which we'll talk about here like these projects where when you you go to them i think goblin town was good about this right like you go to that website and you immediately get the feeling you're like i know what you're trying to make me feel and you've you've created a world for me that i'm like intrigued by so uh 10ktf clearly had that like it's like the the kind of lore even early on was like you have this kind of like older uh craftsman who creates like wearable goods for the metaverse but it's it's like it's incredibly well branded um but i was trying to find at the time like who's behind this project i couldn't get details maybe i was just a bad researcher at the end of last year it's since emerged or maybe it was always the case and again i like terribly researched this but it's beeple and gaio siri is that right that's right and what's interesting is you know with with the guy theory variety piece that came out um where he was named you know entertainment manager of the year they talked about innovative like yeah the the the man so to speak of of the whole world it seemed um that they uh you know like he they they officially talked about him being a co-founder of uh 10 ktf so i'm like um and i will be saying 10 ktf 10 kft so i completely will always mess up those letters so you're like it is she really yeah i'm like and you're like does she even know about the project she doesn't know the name i swear i've been participating in it since the beginning i swear you can trust me on it um but what happened is i was like ooh they named him as a co-founder so it's getting more public that i was like i really like that but at the beginning people would pop in and out of the discord the 10k tf uh discord so that's what i really liked about it so we did know it was b we did know it was people from the beginning yeah well he didn't like officially come out and say it was him but he was always participating up he would he would pop in and out so everyone's like oh it's got to be a people project and i learned about it because i was in the the founders dao um like the pixel vault kind of um token gated community like kind of group and they kept sharing it and i was like oh maybe if i um craft um some clothing items uh i might like lose my entire um wallet because i'm interacting with a very sketchy smart contract but i did it anyway because i was so intrigued by the story and no one it was such a stealth launch that you know it was it was kind of a risk to to interact with that contract but i did it because i was really excited about what was happening and at that time again something that they did i liked it that much and something that they did again that was really really smart um you know people always talk about like bootstrapping on other communities or leveraging other communities um followings and they actually i think has executed that better than anyone and that the only way that you could craft certain fashion items was if you had certain pfp collections being world of women um board apes um this is gonna be a dark reference on eforce uh very much dates it so you know sometimes we can't be perfect um cool cats um so at that time you know they were doing the blue chip nfts and that was the only way you have to actually have one of those in your wallet to um get a genesis clothing item so immediately they engage these talks talk about this crafting clothing explain that briefly for folks who maybe aren't familiar with it yeah and again what i love about it is it is very much connecting to the storytelling of wagnissan this master craftsman in new tokyo which is this fictional world and he is this you know amazing clothing maker so again these nfts are actually connected to the story it's it's a very kind of fluid narrative which again i think speaks to its success um and so they've kind of um at the beginning at least in the first kind of genesis drop in the level one as they're calling it kind of nfts you could you could plug in your wallet and if you owned one of these pfps um you could then meld the picture of the pfp onto um you know a backpack um for instance um so your backpack then also became a one-of-one clothing item because no one else could actually use your pfp to craft it so that was those were really really interesting and then what you were able to do kind of um they again built the story built the um kind of lore around it and when they did this staking event in this thing called battle town you were able then to um again in battle town wagnissan is being confronted by the big mafia boss called boss toads which is funny again me like talking about this in like a serious way when i understand things are called boss toads but you know um you're running from the boss toads you're fighting so you need to stake your gear to support wagnissan and in fighting against the boss toads now again what's very interesting about this is um if you stake certain things and you engage with the ecosystem then snapshots were taken and you were rewarded with different air drops of different tools whether that be like rubber or thimbles certain things to again build clothing again what i think is interesting about this and what i really like about this is they kind of you know the snapshots that they took it was no longer about okay just buy and hold this nft very passive and you get airdrop things it was like no what they were doing is they were rewarding engagement again this kind of development on what snapshots should be and how you should reward your community um so really like it for that reason i think other two things to just really quickly bring up around it um is they also did a collab with gucci which um again that was like anything that people that know me that would be like i'm all in anything collab with gucci we're doing it convinced hooked love it so to me that was still that was still when it was in super stealth mode right you're like this is a perfect project this project was built for me nothing will ever go wrong up only we're laughing we're good right so i'm like i'm like okay wow we still don't really know if guys theory is involved at this point we don't really know if people's involved but what we do know is that they got a partnership with gucci like this is means a lot in this section is involved yeah we know like like gucci is not gonna just partner with anyone so again i think you know when you look at what they did there again you could stake um you could you could actually craft your pfps to have gucci clothing on them obsessed with that idea i know that's like very simple but like i'm convinced and then you could stake those characters so again that to me incredible in terms of their collaborations and the last thing i'll say in terms of kind of the hit points of it is it's the only other project besides board api club that's done an apecoin airdrop so the that that to me speaks to their network their execution that kind of vision in terms of the level of projects if the two people that they partner with are gucci and then apecoin um i'm feeling pretty good about it you know in general so i'm going to ask you you know you your career is investing in nft projects and you run a fund that invests in nft projects so i want to get your thought on like is this undervalued is this a buy in your mind but before you answer that i want to like go through a couple other questions so this is all digital wearables right like when you talk about getting a backpack with your world of women on it there is it isn't like you can burn it or something for a physical right we're talking all digital here including with gucci okay the goal for them with having you stake could you spell that out and maybe it feels obvious to folks but i think about it like you know you've got nesting with moon birds which is obviously like people don't list their the list the project it it encourages i guess more engagement but there's like staking on like the east side which is a security mechanism so for for 10ktf like what is the what is the goal with staking do you think for this project uh i think um it's a way to really create that engaged community base get people very comfortable in actively you know um interacting with the website with the story kind of getting more attached to it um obviously not listing your nfts is a huge point that drives the floor up um and then you know the the thing that was interesting too is that they did staking like you know you would have to stake for like 24 hours and it was a smart contract in the sense that they actually didn't hold your asset so again the safety of it um was a lot better than you know throwing that asset away and putting you know your hundred thousand dollar board ape in some contract that you don't really know the safety of um so the way they actually designed their smart contracts was really um i think helpful for people because they weren't as scared because they didn't actually have to lock up their their assets uh so that makes a difference too but the the timing of staking two was really important only 24 hours or you know 72 hours basically um and then you were back up so you had to go back and engage it wasn't just a one and done so so that's that's what i was gonna say that's what's so interesting there is it's not just like you know unlike a moon birds where it's like you nest and you kind of leave it nested for some long period of time and it takes it off the market this was really a forcing function to bring you to the table they just want to consistently bring their holders back to the table it sounds like to re-engage with the project catch up on whatever like story they're weaving and this is why that story pieces is so critical because not only are you coming back to the table to stake your thing because presumably you want to get your staking rewards once you do come back oh here's the story that goes along with it that maybe sucks you in and that's getting into your this thesis here around like this is what all projects should be doing is like they're they're gonna tell you to lock up your thing like tell me why like where how does this uh you know fill in the broader vision for this project the roger story that you're telling totally and it's like it's not just now i think the stakes are higher where it's not just holding your your you know your nft for the hopes of airdrops and you know opportunities to mint more nfts in the future it's actually engagement so you know just just raising the level up and i'm happy to see that projects are doing that because that to me is a really good sign for you know the nft gaming space for the nft kind of media space just the nft entertainment space in general uh because yeah it just it it it just is represents maturity to me in terms of you know the experience you can have with these assets that you care about so much and what they can actually do for you okay i want to talk about jenkins valet here as well in tally labs and and everything that's going on there because i think it's similarly very interesting but last thing i want to touch on with this 10ktf stuff is there is rumors speculation i'm not sure if they're confirmed or not that 10ktf will in some way be integrated with other side you mentioned already they did an eight coin drop maybe tell us a little bit about that and but then fill us in on this other side 10ktf potential connection yeah there's lots of teasing again they're very good at kind of um creating speculation within their tweets and the images that they attach to their tweets again storytelling via social media i know that's like quite old in normal standards but i don't think a lot of nfp projects have actually done that very well and they have so there's a lot of little hints in in certain pictures and all the 10ktf um kind of passionate fans are like oh my gosh what does this mean what does this mean but i will flake a couple things in little easter eggs right little hints so um they did do their their latest crate sale which actually the crates revealed today so exciting about that today being august 18th again i know i shouldn't say today that doesn't make sense in a media world um so what i will say is they raise seven million dollars in eight coin for their crate sale um the actual ape dow never approved any kind of grants to 10ktf which means that they got their eight coin from somewhere else it wasn't like an official like this is this is more of like a corporate partnership to me than then you know because there was no official proposals made via um the the the ape dao um so i think that's very interesting also again guyoseri um he is the manager of the board apes he's also a co-founder of 10ktf that to me um makes a lot of sense in terms of where they're going to fit in there's also speculation that the story itself the wagney sands story that that's going to play out in other side it that makes a lot of sense to me in in that you know why wouldn't it right or why wouldn't there be a sub game quote unquote a metagame um the other side being the metagame this this this this insider game being the the wagney sen 10ktf game and and and it really being the first proof of concept for a lot of this stuff around other side um so the a partnership um the apecoin airdrop the first ever um a coin airdrop outside of board apes i mean this stuff is hard to ignore it's just like the partnership and the the officiality of it going forward i think is going to happen when you look at the founders and when you look at their relationships so last question before i get to the million dollar question here that i teased earlier so you talked about you could you could put your avatar your world of women it sounds like in this like gucci 10ktf collab wearable how did that work technically like they made a a a copy of your world of women and like how did it work yeah so yeah like you gave it permission basically to make a new avatar that looked like yours and then had this extra wearable and then you can stake those characters to get additional rewards so interesting yeah yeah and spending a lot of time with like rights and licenses and the ip and who really owns it and talking to lawyers about all that so i hear that and i'm like that's awesome and also these are all the challenges we actually really need to sort out on the legal side of things um and in 100 a lot of questions right but you know and i know we're going to talk about ip and and you know the limits of um you know certain um projects and how they've granted rights to their owners but i i i think it represents um what can be done around interesting collaborations and pushing ip rights um in terms of what you can actually do with the nfts uh that you own and you know the collaborations that can interweave within that cool well uh million dollar question blake you manage money and invested in nfts for a living is 10 ktf a buy i will say this i will say this with every single investment that i make um it depends what you're buying within the actual project itself so there's never a blanket yes or no i don't think it has to be more nuanced than that um when you're evaluating a project um and i know that i'm saying this now and it's gonna come out today or tomorrow or a week from now or people are gonna be like you told me to buy this and it's down or it's up or whatever we can do all the usual caveats this is obviously not financial advice nothing is operating off of a certain set of you know uh priors and timelines and theses that she's trying to fulfill and so yeah what she's doing is not necessarily what the rest of us should or need to be doing okay caveats aside yeah give us your like evaluation of this from a from a buy perspective yeah i think um if you wanted to get exposure so i'll also say the crates that the level two is coming out today so the the the next kind of gen um of wearables um and like weapons are coming out today and they're gonna be blanks which means you need to and today's thursday august 18th this episode will air friday the 19th so it's the day before it comes out thursday the 18th me doing the cardinal sin of media where i didn't actually date the time i'm just saying today when it's like people are gonna not be listening to it today um so thank you for that you it's certainly clear who the professional is here so um yeah i will say that you know with the blanks that are coming out today you need a pfp to actually craft onto the blank to really be able to use it within the game so the issue for people around investment with this project is do you have pfps that can actually partner with the wearables and the objects to stake now we don't i don't know the next you know version of the roadmap that's coming out but do you have things that can actually partner with the wearables to stake normally you need to have both a pfp and a wearable to actually stay so i would say if you did want to get into the project the best way to do that would probably be one of the gucci grail pieces because that represents both the profile picture and a wearable combined and you don't need to own both and those right now i think are sub 1 eth so i know that's also super expensive um so i'm telling you to spend you know thousands of dollars on this but if you did want to look at getting certain exposure i would say that would be a really um interesting way there's also some of the actual crafting material the rubbers the kind of cotton materials that are are are lower price i think they're going to be around sub 5b these are sub 0.5 east so if you wanted to get exposure those would be the best ways again from a fun perspective i'm going to be making bigger buys because you know i'm utilizing different pfp collections that i have um and you know making a bet on web3 fashion making it bet on the founders themselves making a bet on the roadmap so it's a bit more i would say i would i you know do it differently from a fun perspective but from a retail perspective and look look getting exposure there's a lot of cool opportunities under um one ease do you categorize this as a a game like under gaming under pfps a combination of the two what is their and maybe it speaks to what their kind of end game no pun intended um is or what they've alluded to it being yeah you know what's interesting is i used to categorize with the fund i used to be like okay so we have crypto art we have pfps we have virtual land and we have gaming assets done like those are the four categories you can't really do that now i've been running the fun since february of last year um you can't do that in the same way yes there's certain things like chromie squiggles or you know fidenza's that are you know iconic crypto art pieces certain things do fit more neatly into the into boxes but now we're seeing all these hybrid projects where their pfps their digital fashion their games all at once so uh from from kind of a fund organization perspective the cat which which is why everything in the nft world is so excited is because these these categories are melding and that's what makes the technology i think so dynamic is because it's going to be harder and harder to classify these different assets as one thing um but you know with this project i i see it more as like now they're moving more into gaming so i would probably put it more which is like i would say fashion gaming but there's no perfect definitions now for a lot of these projects yeah yeah it's interesting i think my initial reaction sometimes is like that project should pick a lane like i think of doodles that's like very clear they're like we're building media ip entertainment and then use something like labs that's like we're kind of like us we're kind of streetweary though i guess they haven't like totally but you know they have their their kind of fashion stuff and then they're a game and then they're sort of an ip and i and i i think even as recently as like two months ago i was being like i don't know that feels muddied and increasingly i'm like or maybe not like you know like if you can pull it off and if you're you know why not kind of play in all the different sectors you can play in and see maybe what sticks and then double down where it's working or just continue to build across a whole bunch of verticals if if that's working um so i think my my thinking on this has even evolved yeah i mean i also think not every nft project should be a fashion brand and should be a game and should be a movie and should be a comic book you know so we're seeing a lot of that and i think a lot of projects are overstepping and you know they don't have the capital they don't have the ban you know the bandwidth and the manpower but you know when when i look at something like a yuga i'm like you know you raised hundreds of millions of dollars um so if you want to go for it all that makes more sense than you know a small project trying to brand itself against um all different kind of like verticals but i think there's like an upside and downside to both and i think the kind of muddied waters with some of the projects and their identities has to do with the fact that they started not knowing where and what direction they were going and then there's all these massive opportunities in the nft space as you know is evolving so quickly all the time that it's like uh okay like let's do it all and just see what happens and we have the money to do it so let's go for it yeah for better for worse let's yeah i want to talk about the other project that i think fits into your thesis around storytelling and staking i believe you can correct me if i'm wrong on that but it's the j it's changes of la and i i want to do a similar breakdown there i i love this highlighting of 10 10 ktf i really appreciate that i'm i'm like happy because again this is a project that i've been interested in but haven't like deep dived on so getting you to like really be like sit focus carly here's what's going on it's very helpful for me and i want to do a similar thing with with jenkins of ally um so maybe let's let's do the the quick just overview i think folks know it tally labs behind it jenkins the ape himself him has he confirmed it's a he i guess so yeah i think he um is wrapped by cia and you know very clear that they want to have um you know a story world that comes out of jenkins uh they've partnered with neil strauss who's a very well-known very well i don't know celebrated author to write some of the initial stories for jenkins um i'll stop there and and say would love to get your thoughts on this why does it fit into the storytellers as a state as a state storytelling as taking storytelling and staking kind of thesis that you've put forward yeah i think where i see them is you know they at nft should be and i think we're seeing that with the previous previous example of kent 10ktf you know nfts are a new form of entertainment or that's one way that they can actually be applied and we're seeing jenkins really push this idea um when it comes to how they're leveraging social media and how they're you know leveraging the nft social media um official platform interaction um so some of the things that i think really stand out with them first of all um they have like they have actually developed in-house software where they're supporting kind of decentralized storytelling and um the dissemination of ip writes um in a way so so they're a software play as much as they're actually like uh application layer product play um and that software is like licensing marketplace software folks who listen to this podcast a lot will know i've had like feature on here before i had folks from a company called remaster who are all sort of thinking about this feature you know was the the marketplace behind that coinbase used to cast the board apes in the coinbase trilogy story they did so this this idea of like how to license these um nfts for use in stories is an interesting and kind of burgeoning field and tally labs has their own proprietary basically tech to enable that with jenkins and the stories they're telling is there there might be more is there more to the tech than that that i'm missing i know that's one part of it but it's possible there's more yeah that's that's certainly one part of it i think they're also building a native e-reader so that you'll be able to read books in a in a kind of like very authentically web-three way what that will look like and how they're gonna execute on what reading in a web 3-way looks like we shall see but i love the idea um it'll be nft gated so if you own a board ape that's been licensed to the borden dangerous book or if you own one of the nft tickets that allows to get access to have the license for the board ape then you'll be able to read the book i think that's very interesting um what what maybe the the couple things to pull out um in this storytelling is staking and where they're really going with this is um they're doing first of all a lot of their storytelling on twitter via tweet threads how jenkins the valet is actually moving through this new um world called azerbala i hope i'm saying that right which is the world that jenkins exists and all the board apes will exist within um and they're doing these travel logs and story logs which are actually first released on twitter i love that i think leveraging where your audience actually is which is crypto twitter every investor i'm sure that owns a board ape or owns one of the actual nfts that allowed you to license a four day they're all on twitter so i love they're actually leveraging that they've given each of their characters also within the story um their own twitters they give certain locations within um the worlds their own their own you know twitter profiles so again you can just click around twitter and get these little clues about okay this is like a bake shop or this is you know jenkins son or whatever and you can read through and click through that to me is really interesting so you know this this next kind of round of nfts that they dropped which i know you've previously talked about on the podcast so there's a choice and there's this gamified um aspect to these new nfts the boredom dangerous actual books first of all you know they there's an audio component to it which i love a custom audio component by murder on the beats who's probably best known for working with the king of the world but also the canadian king drake on many of his heads just in case you guys were wondering so um so you know um the audio component a very custom audio component um bringing that in again as a as a branding play for board apes like okay we're we're partnering with this you know really really really popular current um super successful producer to produce the music like okay cool that's something you didn't need to do it adds a bit of edge it really supports that board ape kind of like um street urban wear you know energy that they have so again i think that layer is really consistent so i like that a lot um and then what you're able to do and what the next round is that's going to happen throughout the summer is okay so you have your book you can this is where the gamified kind of storytelling and staking really comes you can burn your book or you can stake your book now when you're burning your book um what apparently so bear with me with this story it's a bit crazy but apparently there's this part of the azerbaija world where um you're able to go and actually burn your book and you're going to be able to get a mint pass which is then going to be turned into your pfp so they're going to actually be doing a pfp collection and drop it for your pfp for in azerbaija exactly exactly um so that's gonna be a next step for them um again i think their thesis is listen we understand that most people their biggest um purchase within their nft world is their pfp that's kind of the like um in the real world obviously like most people spend the most money on their houses most people in nft crypto world spend the most money on their pfp so we want to make one to really um show and build this up as the most important like dynamic pfp that there is you know maybe alongside board ape and again leverage and bootstrap that energy to build their own now what you're able to do go ahead well i was going to ask what's the benefit and we're working on a little bit of a lag here so i think that's part of the problem is um what what's the so that's so if you burn the book in this choice you get a mint pass for the pfp that you can use in azerballa essentially in the metaverse world they're sort of teasing what's the benefit to keeping the book the benefit to keeping the book is again staking and then you're going to be able to get the um native currency within the world and the interesting thing so it's the choice between your pfp or the currency exactly and the other interesting thing is you know when you're burning the book um i guess you know again this story telling the lore within the world is that um when people have kids within azerbaija they have to sacrifice to the gods um before they have kids so what you're gonna actually have to do to burn the book to get the med pass to like birth your pfp is go to this work this little area within the actual world and burn and you know sacrifice your book for the purpose of then birthing your pfp later on so i'm like they didn't really need to do that again it's the details it's the kind of really like the nuance of the storytelling that i really like from them and the more you hold your mint pass the more likely you are to actually the longer you hold it the more likely you are to get a um the more likely you are to get a more rare pfp so there's even gamified aspects around the burning of the mint pass to eventually convert wow that's so interesting i i'll all i guess bolster what you're saying here in terms of again when you go to the azerbaija site which you can find on twitter and we'll link to we'll put links for both the jenkins stuff and the 10ktf stuff below if you want to learn more it's it you immediately have that feeling of like there's a world here and it's like this jungle kind of wild world and you can look at this map overview it reminds me of like the map you get in the beginning of like a fantasy novel you read you know that like shows you the fictitious world that you're about to enter into it's like my heart just like starts going a little faster i'm like yes like i'm about to be immersed in some like story that's gonna take me you know i'm gonna escape my everyday life and enter some new world and um and you can like click around on the map and go into you know little corners of the map and explore there and like just across the board the details are are incredibly well done yeah and you know it's really the again there's a lot of um because the space is so new there's a lot of people talking um about kind of these conceptual ideas about you know community collectively owned media studios and you know large decentralized ip ownership but you know i do think that jenkins is really executing on this they're really the first instance where nft holders have had an opportunity at scale to capitalize on ip ownership um and and and really be a part of a collectively owned media studio um because there's also going to be a a dow that that tally is working on within within the jenkins universe so let me ask you so because this is the piece that i'd love to understand a piece i'd love to understand better like they have something called the is it the writer's token where like there's the original like 5 000 valet jenkins valet nfts and and that these are all like writer's room quote unquote nfts so explain a little bit how the community is ushered into the creative process as part of all this because i'm like sort of on the record as a little bit of a skeptic of like group creative processing like i'm like i think it can totally well when you have a couple creative visionaries at the top and i my sense of that jenkins is finding the balance between these two things and would love to hear you kind of spell that out yeah so what has happened is at the beginning when they did their initial mint um you had you know they did these these 5000 nfts and this represented um royalties of the book that they were going to publish about the apes about jenkins now what they needed with that or what they invited the community to do is um you needed to partner with a board ape or mutant ape to actually use within the book so a lot of people that obviously bought these initial nfts had their own apes or had their own mutants or they partnered with someone who did perhaps they went into the boys club dow put it on the chat room to do that's how i actually got connected with someone and licensed shout out that that um license so i could license um certain um things in the board ape universe that i owned and and you know started in the project then but but um from there when you act and that was proprietary software what they actually used around the licensing stuff there that was their own software um it was a super seamless process in terms of signing over the rights for um tallyglabs to tell a story about your ape use the you know the image rights all that stuff and then what they sent you was this form where you could add and write about your ape so the writers could read what you thought about your ape and weave that into the story so it's kind of like a process where they really kind of let the community make up their own lore about their their um their apes but also you know hey we're gonna take it from here and we're gonna read what you have to say but we're also gonna you know like do it ourselves so i remember writing some of the lore for for for my ape and i act this is like i was like attached like i was like okay like this is where they're from like i was like my apes from vancouver which is where i'm from like i made it like really personal to where to me and i was like oh my god like this is quite an emotional exercise so again in terms of actually driving value back to the board eight community i'm like people when they write lore and story tell about their asset it's harder and harder to sell um and what you got then on the licensing side was you got you're going to get if you license your ape you get 25 of the royalty sales um you of of your little piece um and the person who actually owned um the nft gets 25 percent and then the board eight uh or the jenkins took fifty percent uh pieces of of that kind of hundred percent pie of royalties but by licensing your ape you take a 25 cut of royalties uh you know and that's a ratio of there were certain levels of nfts you could buy and the more expensive rare nfts took a bigger percentage and cut of royalties versus kind of the the lower end of just the valet tickets the yachts are the biggest and those uh those were the most expensive and they also those apes that were licensed by yachts they played they're gonna play the biggest role in the story so again that leads back to driving value to your apes driving value to owner you know like getting eyes on your exact asset all of that kind of all at once so and it strikes me that much like with 10ktf like this is complicated like this is not like a project you're going to grasp in like a minute you know like it's there's a lot to kind of unpack here um but but it strikes me that that's also why you have an especially committed community right and that that is that um in-depthness to it all that creates a really engaged following for the people that do go deep like you've you've gone um but let's do what we did with with 10ktf because i think that was so helpful which is you are deep in this you're like i love talking to you because you just know it all um what would be a recommendation for folks who want to get into this project because there are a couple different ways in now there's the boring dangerous nfts that'll be the burn that on the burn mechanism down the line you've got the kind of original valet all the way up to yacht like writer's room nfts how can folks like start to break into these projects yeah i mean what's really interesting is that the lowest end of the writer room nft is almost the same price now as the board in dangerous books um and a lot of the borden dangerous books will also presumably get burned because people will want a pfp so that burning event hasn't happened yet right now um i think the boredom dangerous books are again about half an eth um give or take i think that's quite a good price again obviously it depends on your budget where uh how comfortable you're you're you're you're gonna be um but you know i obviously as well the the the the we were just talking about you know very low volume on openc you can probably throw in some really low bids and um get some offers that's always a good way to go um so you know i i think the board and dangerous is probably the best entry and right now it's the cheapest and it's also i think because these projects are so complicated um the best way to understand them always which again i think is one of the issues with crypto and nfts is oftentimes understand things you have to participate in the ecosystems and that costs money so the barrier to entry is always so extreme and it's like that's really tough because when you're when i'm explaining it to people it's like well what does this matter it's like no but i swear if you went through the process and if you own this stuff it would be different but oftentimes i think with nfts it demands ownership to really understand and you know most people don't have you know thousands of dollars lying around to invest in something that is highly highly highly speculative super speculative that they're wrapping their head around yeah well yeah we'll we'll move past this phase at some point in in kind of the journey of this test exactly totally this is the this is the the second tier i think of you know this this deep engaged storytelling which is more complicated and i think it kind of needs to get more complicated before it comes back and gets more simple but i think again it's good growth and maturity for the nft space and for these projects yep absolutely these projects and these and to your point about um jenkins like it's also driving the space forward to some extent technologically as well in terms of paving the way for this kind of thing to just be a better ui for other projects um okay we've been talking a bunch about or dancing around the idea of licensing here and and obviously that's connected to what's going on in in a in a couple of ways so i want to talk about the me bits and crypto punk's new license that came out this past week um this is a big deal to me as somebody who's again been spending a lot of time living in like the vagueness of licensing structures up to this point and talking to lawyers about like what are the implications for sort of poorly written terms and conditions which for example yuga labs their original terms and conditions are kind of a mess in terms of trying to navigate them from a legal perspective which is of course just speaks the fact that the founders the yugo lab founders did not anticipate that poor deep yacht club would be like a multi-billion dollar brand in the next 12 months and that they would need to have like a super buttoned up like highly professional and you know licensed and also speaks the fact that we're just in uncharted territory generally speaking in this space but to give some context here on this meebitz punk's license that just came out i said this on the podcast before but quick recap obviously in february march of this year yugo labs purchased me bits and punks from larval labs they said at that time that they would be giving ip rights to the holders of meebits and punks that's of course what they famously did with apes themselves larval labs did not had retained the rights to me bits and punks so you as a holder didn't have those ip rights yuga said they would be reversing that now that they owned them and this week is the week we finally actually got a look at those licenses and um i have to say like first glance i'm pretty happy with them i think they clear up a lot of areas where there have has been like misperceptions in the past the biggest one that i'll highlight is i think historically we have it's not been clear like does yoga labs also own rights to the punk or to to the ape ip or do only the holders all have the rights to the ape ip like the the narrative had always felt like oh i is the ape holder like i am the owner of this ip and i almost like alone own it so what's interesting though is when you're looking at these new meebitz punk's licenses that have come out is they are explicitly saying it's an exclusive license for you as the holder of the meebit or the um or the or the punk and so that would mean that's like sort of hugo labs like wiping their hands clean of it right and saying okay we we do not have rights to this ip you are the exclusive ip holder of this if you own this this punk or this meebit with a couple of exceptions which we'll get into because what's interesting about the exceptions they carve out here is they are slightly different the carvouts are slightly different when you look at me bits versus looking at punks so um i'll actually pull this up here it's in a section essentially called license back to you labs so this section exists for both the punx and me bits licenses it says basically that you grant to yuga labs and irrevocable perpetual exclusive universe-wide royalty fear free sub-license basically we as hugo labs still have the right to to um use your characters and publicly display your characters for the purpose of like promoting or exhibiting like the me bits collection or the punks collection you can't like sue us for using that um we have a right to use it and and then within that this is where the meebit's license gets different which is what the meebo's license says which is different than the punk's license is it says that yuga also has the right to create and authorize third parties to create avatars characters and other objects based on your meebit art designed for you to claim and use in one or more metaverse or other digital environments or applications provided however that any such claim is subject to these other things so basically this is this is a meebitz has this cryptopunx doesn't because me bits is very from from its outset has been designed to be a metaverse avatar and its goal is around like an interoperable metaverse and danny green who's now the the brand lead for me bits at yugo labs and had previously been running meet its dow has come on the pod and talk about this like me bits is really trying to be an avatar that stands for interoperability in the metaverse and so this carve out here and this license is really speaking that specifically which is giving you labs the right to partner with third parties to to create like a pixel rendition of your me bit for world wide web for example so when you go into world wide web you can log in with your wallet automatically claim your meebit in the pixel form that fits that world and that metaverse and now you can go off and run around as your your uh your avatar without having like without you having every time to like approve it with every different metaverse that you might want to use it in i think that's awesome i think that's exciting i think it shows that like the commitment with which moebits is approaching this goal of like metaverse interoperability and they being characters in the metaverse um but i've now ranted so i will pause here and let you react to all of this no i love it and i love your details of actually reading through um certain parts of the contract that stand out because i think in general on social media but you know with with the the closest reference i have to social media being crypto twitter everything kind of gets abstracted and flattened like and and put in generalities so for you to actually dig into the contract i think is super super refreshing and the specificity of that um because i think in you know people are like okay yeah granting rights done like when the real i think crux and the real kind of um insight into these projects comes in the details of the the the certain limits and the certain upsides around the ip ownership so i love that you actually just dug into that and read that out um i also think thank goodness as yeah go ahead go ahead no no finish your thought um you know i i think in general too you know as someone um you know my fun does hold um meet it's and like thank goodness for some news you know what i mean like let me rejoice in that because we need we need something so and i know that's also memed all over the place oh finally me bit something something but i'm really happy just from a pri i mean i it hasn't really affected the price which i'm also i think people are quite fatigued and quite confused by me but still and a lot of people have written them off and a lot of people have lost so much money have made really bad sales um you know way under what they so again lots of buying opportunities for people if they want them um if you believe that me bits is really um what's what what uh you know they're really going to work on i think again the placement of danny green coming over and working full time on me bits huge huge huge upside um i guess my question to be uh would be to the meebitz team around these um you know i also think super positive on that clause around being able to use me bit likeness for avatars like great continue to to create projects create products and create partnerships i would say i want to know what they're really thinking on that side of things what partnerships are they going to do are is this more of an other side play are they going to try to you know really make me bits a big avatar and that i think before that happens they need to create some bigger partnerships to drum up um and and do a proof of concept for what they're trying to do within the other side worlds yeah and i can speak to that a little bit and i'm afraid i may get certain details wrong but i know uh i i believe they were working with world wide web specifically they've worked with uh decentraland previously like they have holes in the fire i know that uh amiibos dao had been working on this stuff like to get them um avatars and partnered with um a couple different other metaverses you know it's we're in this really weird place with metaverses right which is meaning to people and and it's it's all the stuff that other side is i think trying to fix which is like metaverse sounds like this cool thing but then what we get are like these places where we just kind of run around in the forests and there's like 200 people a day logging in because there's really not that much to do yet um so i i think there's obviously this is working for yuga labs and hanging out in any of the existing sort of big names yeah it's true yeah exactly um yeah yeah so i i think the commitment is is very real in terms of not just being for other side though i'm sure that's obviously like a a big part of this um and i think the commitment i i'm fully bought in at this point the commitment from yugo labs in terms of one yes an interoperable metaverse is very real i interviewed the ceo of improbable for whom that's clearly a goal and they're building these which i love that podcast technologies ah thank you um so i i'm excited for this and i i you know i love danny he's been like a friend as well as a colleague to me at this point so um i'm i'm optimistic about him never financial advice but i'm i'm hopeful medics can have some some price action in addition to just like broader like community yeah because i think it's still yeah it's still like quite again conceptual using avatars in the metaverse when you know the crypto punk community and the board ape community are so like they have such strong identities they have strong strong values and eco like but b bits is still like i don't know what it stands for it's just going to be an avatar in the metaverse what does that mean when it doesn't really represent anything is there going to be other upsides versus just kind of putting yourself as an elephant or an alien within a metaverse what you know what what's the differentiator so to speak for me bits versus the other two big properties you know yeah i think it's a it's such a good point and i think it it it gets to the importance of storytelling because when me bits launched after punx it was really innovative in that and it it was one of the first projects if not like the first project that had these like 3d um what's the word i'm looking for like you could you could download like 3d vox files basically for your meebit so it was birthed with this intention of like you can be a real like avatar that runs around in a place because from day one essentially you could get these 3d vox files for your me bit and that spoke to like the mission of the thing but that's like a nerdy technological like cool thing it's not a storytelling i'm immersed in a world cool thing and you know notably me bits and and pong or me bits and and apes launched i think like the same week or something and there were all these people who bet on me bits and then of course apes ended up sort of being the bet and that's that key distinction is is me that's fundamentally was like a really cool tech innovation um and they're like cute little characters but maybe not even innovation right but it was like a tech play and what made it unique was a little bit more conceptual and what people loved about apes was like kind of the like irreverent middle finger like expressiveness of this apes face and it felt more like a story and you could go right on this wall and um so there's a lesson in there to be learned but i i hope that the that court ethos of interoperability and like opening up the metaverse becomes more of like a branded story for the meebits because if they can tap into that then i think there's a lot of room to grow it's there yeah it's there for them and i think now you know people just the use cases is is you know not there as much as the the storyteller like the use case for a lot of these nfts is still storytelling and community building and you know it's you know with who they've hired clearly the upside is massive so i'm feeling quite hopeful coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform

it's like it's a pretty serious one again i'll give the very quick context pass it over to you blake for thoughts but pseudoswap a decentralized like automated market maker for nft sales basically announced recently or at least we all realized recently that they uh were no longer enforcing artists royalties or creator royalties for sales of nfts that means you can sell your nft um without having to give a cut to the original creator um this is like i don't know it feels kind of existential like it feels like one of the big selling points of like nfts for artists for for tickets for all these future use cases is built around this idea of of um of royalties and um it's a little bit of like a kick and kick in the stomach to really come face to face with the fact that this is a very very hard thing to enforce at the smart contract level it's i guess arguably an impossible thing to enforce at the smart contract level and so we're really reliant on marketplaces to kind of do the right thing here which is never what you want in like a market dynamic because when you know financial incentives come up against do the right thing what we typically see is people go with financial incentives so um not doing the right thing um so blake give me your thoughts your reaction 6529 had a had a take on this i know somebody else you were you were mentioned you were looking at had an interesting take um hit me with your thoughts yeah i mean first i mean so just for for the the quick like 30 seconds of how you know i got into nfts you know i'm an art historian i was doing my master's degree um in 2016 and i thought oh my goodness crypto technology actually answers the questions that artists have been asking for a really long time around you know tracking the authenticity of their work tracking um the patronage of their work and actually allowing royalties on chain i thought that was a revolutionary idea and that's why i actually started writing about crypto art in 2016 was because of this very issue and that's what made me really excited about nft so this is a this is something that's like really close to my heart um so i i think this is really what nft culture has actually been built on is supporting artists directly um and i think it comes down to really it really you know questions of oh i'm in this for the art you know i'm not in this as an investment i'm not you know these kind of questions really get highlighted um and what also gets highlighted is you know that um people really need to make choices about what they believe in around this stuff which again these are existential i'm like i'm just trying to buy a picture do i need you know then ethics and values come into this um so i mean my thought is that all nfts are actually not created equal and there maybe can be nuances in which you know if you are supporting a one-of-one artist to really be prioritizing supporting them and paying those royalties to them i understand you know this is also a bear market question when you're down really bad when you know you see that you know you know they've done you know a thousand ethan volume it's really hard to want to take an extra 10 cut when you know they just raised a big vc round and you know they're worth you know hundreds of millions of dollars so i think that you know nfts are not all the same thing and and there might be where i see this going as specialized marketplaces um where i see this going is ways in which people need to really be actively informed and making choices on who they're supporting because it really does make a difference and if you think that not paying royalties to an independent artist isn't going to have residual effects on their work going forward um it's just it's not going to happen and it's going to change the entire nfp landscape well that's that's the financial incentive answer to the to the contrary right to that says don't use the amm because if you want your your the the thing you're holding to appreciate in value which i guess if you're selling it maybe you're whatever yeah at that point but like you need to continue to support that project and so it becomes a buyer thing too right where that's where if you're buying if there's somebody selling and you're the one who's been buying like making sure there's royalties because you want that artist supported to continue to do well for for what you're doing so it might be like a buyer side fix but i hear everything you're saying and i'm like we're screwed because like it's already so complicated to get into this world and to get into uh you know like nfts and crypto art and all this stuff and like any additional layer of like you need to be informed and do your research that that becomes part of that package is like not good for the space here's why i think we may i don't think all hope is lost because i do think this is something that we can somewhat there are some technological answers here nothing is like the foolproof thing i would love it to be but i i want to throw out a couple a couple ideas one that i've heard from a couple different camps is you know you have a centralized list of marketplaces or you know database basically of marketplaces that do enforce royalties and then baked into smart contracts you basically have a smart contract that goes and calls up that list checks whether or not you're trying to list it for sale in one of the marketplaces that's on the list and the list can be ever expanding as more marketplaces come on onto the scene and um and then automatically stops something from being listed for sale on a marketplace that doesn't enforce artist royalties again like real imperfect like kind of crazy to think that we have just like keep a list of these marketplaces and who's and who is it a dow like who's running that list like it gets um it gets a little strange there and i also have some vision of like is there some way for there to be some convention and code for how marketplaces write the the like kind of fee collection and then you have a smart contract that can basically read that standard um and so knows that fee collection is being enforced because they're basically reading the code in which it's written that it's you know that in which collection is dictated by and and that becomes a more decentralized way to do it again imperfect i actually don't i think the technical feasibility of it it feels like it's probably right but it's also a little complicated and it doesn't really solve the problem for smart contracts that are baked locked and written um for all of these sort of historical collections so um you know look i'm glad we're having this conversation now because better now than in um i don't know in like out of five years ten year whatever like better to kind of get on it earlier uh the best time to have figured all this out would have been a you know two years ago and the next best time to figure it out is immediately so um i'm glad the conversation's being raised but i almost hate having it because it makes me so uncomfortable because i really i'm like this is awful like just let's just enforce royalties according to what the artist yeah and i mean at the the issue is too there will always be incredible collectors i know you've had a lot of them on your show where they're in it for the art they're in it for the culture um they believe in that they understand the full circle spectrum of what nfts actually are and that you know if you if you start taking cuts it actually has residual effects on collections um on roy on on models in terms of how people release nft collections in the future like it'll change the whole game but there will always be an investors there will always be traders there will always be flippers which also power the nft world as you know and they will always prioritize short time short term profit for you know things going forward um and it wasn't what they won't really take into account what will happen um you know three four months or years down the road um also though on this at the same time you know as we know crypto technology is supposed to be trustless it's supposed to really give you the freedom that you for i don't mean to use the term freedom i know that's um you know a a a really intense term to use but it gives you the choice has that been like politicized yeah well i don't know i mean i know i'm i you know who's to say uh but you know yeah i i can't keep up these days i know and i'm like you know you know you know i don't wanna i don't wanna bring in these big words but it gives you the choice to actually you know make a call on you know these these are at the end of the day these are peer-to-peer transactions at a protocol level so we are working times we're engaging with nfts at the application layer which is a layer above now the beautiful thing about crypto is that you can always go to the layer below you can mint and trade directly from you know etherscan if you want you know you can you can you can really it gives you the choice to do things which is the beauty of it all so it's like how do you um kind of balance those two where it's this full kind of um just availability of whatever you want to do it reflective of your needs and your values um and and and at the same time acknowledge um creators and the real heart and crux of what nfts have really been built upon which is this greater royalty um you know i don't think board apes i don't think they they could have really been built if it wasn't for that i don't think obviously a lot of the incredible one-of-one artists um could be operating and pushing the space forward if not for creator royalties i do think all of that is super super important i also think you know we've seen you know eb ebay was a generalized marketplace and now we see etsy and airbnb and we see whatever expedia for you know you see these specialized marketplaces i hope maybe another thing that can happen is that we can move to specialized marketplaces so maybe you don't want to pay for um the royalties for board apes um even though you've probably made a bunch of money if you invested early and they've done a bunch of work but beyond that maybe you're just like nope not paying cool maybe that doesn't make a big of a difference than supporting a one-of-one artist which you know um archipelago is an interesting marketplace that's come out that's you know only i think supporting generative art you know i i think again the maturity of the space hopefully will allow different marketplaces to exist where you go and support and there's a curatorial aspect to engaging and buying with works that you know support artists which is who really needs it so i hope that's where it's going yeah you know i say i said earlier we're screwed because i do think that but i i do think that you know this is going to persist as a problem but if i'm being honest like realistically i i'm somewhat optimistic i think we can i think we can contain this to a subsect of transactions and yeah maybe in the macro sense we can this is like this space is still a win and it's still clearly a win for digital artists who whose old method methods were like i guess i'll make a print of my work and sell a printer this digitally native piece and you still now have a way to make digitally native one-of-one art in a way that was just never previously possible so um so we'll we'll end on that note of optimism and and maybe i'll say this pulling from six five two nines thread about this i think he made an interesting point which is around tipping which of course the united states has like a particularly distinct and kind of strange tipping culture because it's it makes up such a bulk of like service you know service staffs like wages but we do like you know nobody is is forcing me to tip and i would never dream of like not tipping well and so um you know we we do create cultural standards we're not literally everyone abides by them but but most people do because they believe in it so um okay let's go final topic here today and we don't have to we don't have to dwell on it for too long adam fricken newman is back the thing none of us needed or wanted or asked for um i wrote a i'll plug i started a newsletter basically had some wine and it's been something i wanted to do for a while i kind of flippantly was like i had a glass of wine and started a newsletter but the truth is the two glasses of wine were just like the liquid courage to like get me to push over the finish line because i i wanted to start one for a while so we'll link to that maybe too have you all go subscribe blake i noticed you had subscribed bless you i appreciate you yes i was gonna i subscribed and also it's a great article um carly goes through um like it it just it kind of digs outside of the kind of flattening again of kind of crypto twitter and just the headlines and actually digs into some of the stats around wework and adam newman himself also noting obviously that he's taller than jared leto and he is more handsome i the debate that people like adam newman is more no debate for me i agree that's why i brought it up so almost detected yeah so i i've been really interested in the work i love these like i i was fascinated by theranos like i like like like if there's these kinds of stories i read the books on them i will say and i say this in the article like i don't think the comparison between wework and theranose is like really a valid one like okay there's like certain like small overlaps there i think you can you could argue but like you know adam newman did build a legitimate business in the sense that like we work still exists and people still use it and it might even hit become profitable next year in the next couple of quarters like there's a huge difference between that and like a completely fraudulent blood you know non-existent like product that's hurting patients um but but i'm like fastened by these things so i've tracked the adam newman thing for a little while and i mean my thesis of this of this article is like he'll probably make a16z money like he clearly is a bit of a visionary and the reality is like he we know his flaws now really well and presumably a16z knows his flaws really well and if a16z does their job like they can put a lot of kind of fences around the the kind of adam newman pitfalls and aren't going to fall for the same kind of that went but that caused such an issue the first time around in terms of just he amassed so much power that was totally unchecked and that allowed a lot of bad behaviors to flourish and he really didn't look at like the fundamental financial proposition that was out in front of him and you know assuming they they curb that i think there's actually a chance that this will hit and i say it was such a begrudging because it sucks like it sucks that like in this world adam newman is getting more money and i don't think he's that remorseful over what went down at wework and i think he should be and so um yeah it brings me no pleasure to say that i think this actually isn't the worst bet for a16z but um but i don't think it's the worst bet for a16 yeah yeah i'm 100 with you i think um i think it's a absolutely bonkers proposition but when you really dig into um you know from a vc perspective from a fun perspective which again you know abstracts all the real nuance or details about how things got from a to b or a to z whatever um like what matters really when you look at the numbers i think which again this is begrudgingly i i look today actually and we works market cap is over four billion dollars it was at around a six or seven um until october obviously when you know every tech stock not that we work as a tech talk but you know everything kind of but it's in that growth category because it's in it's in the milieu of all of that and so okay it's at a four it's at a four billion valuation um adam started it clearly he's not involved now but when you look at um a16 now investing at a 1 billion valuation i like when you look at the numbers it's like okay easy 4x here we are and this is you know these are these are you know and and as you said we work might be profitable next year so when you dig into those you know jet not dig in just the the top line numbers you know certainly they're thinking this is a double triple you know i think they're betting on it being like a 4x just like we work is you know if we're looking at the current valuation so when you look at the numbers i'm like outside of all the other stories that really that really stands out to me um as as a as a general kind of thing on top of that um you know the the cult of the founders you know vcs are way more likely to bet on on founders that have done something for even if it's failed yeah let alone if unfortunately now it's a four billion dollar business so you know that that plays into it too yeah and you know i hear people saying and i don't want to minimize this like he rate we work raise like 22 billion dollars so it's like oh congratulations you built a four billion dollar company having raised 25 billion all you did was light 17 billion on five yeah but a couple things to flag there one his early investors still made money because his early investors who came in at the the initial valuations did fine the second thing is you know he was operating in a meta in a macro environment that was like grow grow grow dominate the category you know um masa who was the head of softbank who like famously like he asked for less money masa would give you more so you can go out and just dominate dominate this category so there were a lot of external like pressures around taking more money like that's not to say he needed 22 billion dollars to build a four billion dollar business and that that ties into the learnings that i think you can bring he can bring with himself or a16z can force him to bring with himself by putting the right checks and balances in place this time around which is fundamentally understanding the business you're in you're not on a tech business you're in a real estate business which means the margins are different it means the way you're going to calculate valuation are different but if you're really upfront and honest about that from the beginning you know you can you can buy up a bunch of real estate which he's done this is like a co-living brand you can really brand it the way he's branded wework we work as a globally understood and recognized brand and you know start leasing these apartment buildings basically for more than your you own them for more than what you owe on them because you've added some like slick marketing on top and we're in an era where people want more mobility they want to be able to move more freely and and connect with people and we're working from homes you want connections like you can market all of those things and probably make up you know and mark up the price like there's a genuine business there and um and and adam has done it in real estate already once before yeah exactly and i think the other thing to flag there is first of all what i wouldn't have given like what like to be in the room when he is pitching marc andreessen like the mesmer like i know like he is like like he is a hypnotist i would have that would have been a stunning um scene but you know also just to flag that he um invested out of his family office in a property management app and in a mortgage app so i see that i'm like okay maybe there's also again not just like a concrete kind of asset play but also a software play when you combine those two together that is like in terms of valuations from a pc perspective people love that i understand right now he's just an investor but i'm like you know that's right for kind of takeovers again in terms of like skillfully um building value and and building valuations you know um acquisitions like that brilliant so i'm like ah he's really setting himself up yeah i i also so so in that sense and it's it's a perfect kind of post-covered play um around you know co-living for young people uh like again wild buzzwords that i just used but you know what i mean it's like it's like work from home you know community building all that it's like nfts for the real world yeah yeah so um i would say that and the other thing that's interesting that i know is like not that related but that this is called flow and his previous investment that nft or that a16 also invested in it's called flow carbon i'm like where's the crypto play there's got to be one is it that you can buy with crypto there's some type of weird like staking or you know like i don't know rent to rent to own and and stake to own who's to say um but i think there's there's lots of opportunities there as well yeah that's a good point yeah i was going to flag that as well that uh hit the first time he's gotten money from injuries and horowitz in the last like six months they invested like 70 million in flow carbon um which has like delayed the launch of their token but it's you know it's essentially buying carbon credits on the blockchain to bring more transparency to that market which again i don't know enough about the carbon credit market but i know it's kind of corrupted yeah and so transparency via blockchain actually again doesn't sound like it's probably a terrible idea um it's just he's just such a joke in a headline because the wework thing was just such a like crazy just such a perfect microcosm of the excesses of that time and he was a perfect example of just like the like i'm gonna be barefoot and like it's all about we while i take a billion off the table before my company ipos like the hypocrisy there of this like it's all about like the natural flow of like who we all are but like conveniently i have a three quarters of a billion dollars you know off the backs of this thing so um he's an easy punchline i'm i don't love that uh he's the one getting this money but i also i actually understand the bet uh okay i think that is the show blake this was so much fun honestly like i want you to come back a lot because you just know so much and are just so smart and fun and this
