solana down once again closed for business hours take from frog monkey goes validators check discord is the most janky ass web 3 i've read all day what happens when discord goes down to law and so yeah it's consensus by discord channel not the best version of consensus i tweeted this out i was like if people are starting to make memes about solana being down it's starting to get pretty bad and so here's the solana is down starter pack solana made net beta intermittent issues validators please come to the discord it was a simple software bug that in no way reflects badly on our design choices not down blocks just delayed indefinitely engineers are investigating update your nodes now nakamoto coefficient yeah and look i think that there's uh there's some necessary accountability i mean solana is saying it's a layer one and like the one thing that layer one chains are supposed to do is stay up and if it's not doing these things then i do think the crypto community is right to sort of call it out
