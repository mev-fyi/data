screen i think i might have to ask one of you guys to do that because zoom zoom is just showing what what you guys see and that's not what i want oh at least for ether it is yeah it's showing it for ethan yeah on bank list it's different it's our first time streaming everyone [Laughter] want to get on this new stream right david just make your browsers full screen like yeah but then there's no people is the issue david i can do screen chair you want to do screen share yeah so what should i pull up okay here i'm going to drop him into uh our chat all right i'm gonna stop sharing so we have 25 minutes to figure this out [Laughter] if not danny's going to leave us for the foundation live stream eric you mean they're not going to just like pause the launch for us we have that ability yeah i think the masternode can shut it down right we just gotta get metallic on here i love that you guys have your matching swag by the way hey it was the it's available to you if you want to purchase one that's like 500 i don't want to buy a ponzi shirt david sorry i don't want to buy a ponzi shirt well i want you to buy my ponzi shirt two shirts [Laughter] uh does this shirt rebase oh you bet it as soon as i figure that hasn't been hacked yet it's fixed cap guys it's legit all right david what what links uh they're in discord in the oh discord okay yeah all right we fixed we can i can see us all now on the channel so who who has the craziest staking setup my money is on kevin but um i mean not awakey [Music] [Laughter] we're all here staking so in some way that's true yeah uh i got quite a setup um i'm not sure if it's necessary at this point but i'm glad that i have it in case there's anything that goes wrong um i don't know what's everyone else running i just have a mac mini macbook i have essentially like an hp version of a mac mini i got this like g4 z2 thing uh pretty powerful but very small the linux yeah i run um arch linux on it nice yeah i ended up going way more overboard than i thought like yesterday i had solved like a fallback lte modem got a power back our battery backup so we'll see in case of uh i guess tornado or something here in california which is never going to happen earthquake earthquake could but if a better earthquake happens i think my shit's going down tonight [Laughter] my box is right here my staking box yeah yeah yeah got to get the lights um in there no no i did go way overboard though like i got too carried away with it i'm like yeah i'm going to build my e2 staking box and yeah i'm going to do this this news i'm like wow i just spent a lot of money [Laughter] whenever whenever you attest to a block i just have the lights like strobe or something that'd be really good it's a good way to know that my validator hasn't died every now and again it just you know gives me a heartbeat yeah it's just blowing red for the next year [Laughter] i have that grafana dashboard up set up with some discord notifications we'll see if it actually works if i get some errors today oh nice yeah matt matt from quilt oh now he did he set up discord notifications on his well you can like custom you can custom set them through grafana so i think it like yeah feeds he's got like an alert panel so i guess it feeds into whatever you set up for your alert ryan you got those windows uh set up yeah do you want me to just do them side by side like both open yeah left left and right that would be ideal all right yeah i'll do that greatest thing about the beacon chain is no matter how great your setup is you still might not be the first block proposer and you still might only be running one validator regardless apparently the person that got block one is like known now in the east staker discord or something like that he's anonymous but he proved that it was his account or whatever yeah he signed a transaction with the source eth1 address so he gets the all the bragging rights forever i wonder what his graffiti is gonna be i guess block zero there's no graffiti yeah yeah i guess we missed an opportunity there we could have we could have embedded something in the spec uh but that probably would have been like a con a difficult thing to debate it's better to not have that honestly yeah for a while i was shooting i i sent a tweet a while ago about how it's cool that we don't actually we didn't actually know that there was going to be somebody aware that they could do this and what they were actually going to put which speaks to how large the validator set is and how many uh you know the variety of people that are participating does everyone have peers on their nodes that's like their number one health metric right now do you have peers yeah i should probably pull up that dashboard huh everyone's going to the dashboard yeah is there a way to also turn like pure because i feel like when i was doing a test net using prism at least it used to tell me the peers and the logs is there a flag to turn that on in the client itself now um it probably depends on like the level of logs uh but that's a pretty important metric like that would come in a pretty high level vlog um are you not seeing that in your locks no i'm not i'm running lighthouse over here and i get like an update every once in a while it's just like pierce colon and then the count which my account looks healthy 55. yeah the only thing i have on my note is just the countdown in genesis that's what i got also yeah it's probably the level of like the default level of logs is pretty like light um yeah i should throw that off don't don't with it right now no not right now genesis validators 21063 that the number of yeah all right so so for the viewers this slot negative 93 that's the countdown now it's not 92. that's the countdown when it hits zero eth2 goes live so that's dope know that and at the zeroth slot we don't get a block we know the block we all agreed on the block via based on the spec and the deposits but we do start seeing at the stations for that block and that slot one is the earliest we can see a block okay by slot three or four we better have seen a block well i'm glad i'm glad someone here was able to explain that better than me um and then the beacon chain explorer they have this like genesis thing set up where these are the the blocks in the first four epochs of zero one two and three um and those turn different colors depending on if they've shown up so i think they're green i don't know if they have a key but they're green if they come in maybe yellow or something or red if they get orphaned i don't know but we'll see and then these are like the key metrics uh that i'm i mean i'm looking at a lot of stuff but this stuff's like very important you know we want to see a very early block proposed you know slot one slot two um we really like key to the health of this thing is that we see participation over two-thirds so we can by the end of the zero epoch we'll start to see like initial participation numbers um and then epoch one zero and one are kind of like warm-up uh you can't really get to the meat uh and then in epoch two and three is when we start seeing uh like these like crucial health metrics um which is like crucial system in epoch two we can begin to justify things and epoch 3 at the end of epoch 3. we can we can see finality um and in an ideal world we will see you know check boxes for all those things and if not we'll be scrambling and we'll figure it out we'll fix it all right danny what's the uh what's the time to epoch 3 roughly so each epoch is 6.4 minutes so to get to the end of epoch 3 i think is like 25.6 minutes so really you know within the first half hour we're going to have a really good idea as to the health of this thing cool tell us about your emotions right now how what what's up with them i mean i'm i'm like hyped yeah that's good we're in the morning and i'm hyped um i went to bed very early after about 8 maybe 8 30 and then i woke up at two my eyes wide and uh couldn't really fall back to sleep so yeah but i you know reasonable amount of sleep for all things considered yeah but got all the metrics up very excited um and like i said i'm very confident in the launch but if something goes wrong i'm also very confident in the engineer's ability to figure out what is going on and fix it so danny what what could go wrong if something goes wrong what could go wrong um i mean it's hard to say many many things can go wrong with anything uh you know there's there's unknown unknowns but in the test nets the thing that we saw most frequently if we saw any issues at genesis would be um peering issues for example if one client cut a release for the test net and it didn't have boot nodes which we're not we're trying not to make those kind of mistakes uh but you know all of a sudden client a genesis starts and like wrestling annotations from that from that client those types of mistakes are very unlikely um but really kind of peering and connectivity issues would be i think the biggest issue we could see for example like if client a was maybe scoring client b really poorly and disconnecting and kind of fragmenting themselves from the network like that's the kind of stuff that i'd be most worried about here uh but we haven't we we've been working through those types of problems for uh months and months and i'm confident we're very likely not to see not going to see them yeah if my memory serves me correct wasn't it last december that like the um client teams had their summit and started doing uh cross client checks and yeah i mean that was we had this uh this interrupt what we called interrupt workshop and that was maybe in september uh we thought we were gonna launch in december last year by the way sorry guys but yeah we we got together and started kind of working through some of those issues well over a year ago uh but you know it's been a journey how long is each slot again is like 12 seconds or yeah and i think on that beacon chain explorer that thing that progress bar kind of ticks in the second marks like it goes like one two although it looks kind of weird in the screen share um yeah that makes sense we got 12 seconds 12 okay so current block times are around like 13 or so so fairly similar all right guys there is between bank list and ether there's 800 people watching mad hype all right so we're great i've run some uh quick sponsors from the banquet side all right [Laughter] right right as the first block comes to be proposed sponsored should we should we say like full disclaimer uh we all hold eight tell anyone non-investment advice but yeah yeah but east two's launching in like 12 minutes guys not investment advice though just life advice hey preston hey what's up guys what's up hey man yo hey preston hey preston what are you doing today what are you up to i'm i'm going to go back to sleep in a couple hours i think that's what i'm doing hopefully i will i you know everything's going to go well i i assume but i think what today it was the easiest day to wake up at 3 a.m ever i was i actually woke up at 1 just in my sleep like oh i missed it i like but then now i went back to sleep and then i woke up at three and i'm just like pop right up so i'm excited dude i actually thought i missed it too i think in my dream it was like six in the morning and i woke up and it was it was two in the morning yeah guys we are almost 10 minutes out oh my gosh it's coming up the eath price just wicked from 336 dollars down to or 636 dollars down to back up to 620. that's crazy silence did you notice it happened when you started chilling your apple bags [Laughter] say something good about eat prices youth price is just trying to keep up with the rebasing [Laughter] oh man fun fun 10 10 minutes after how many years ah geez it's crazy yeah it feels like decades honestly like i can't imagine i can't imagine how like you know danny preston and the rest of the researchers implementers feel like day in day out working on this after listening to us like talk about how how long it's been i definitely feel older than i did [Laughter] i'm sure a bunch of people on the stream have seen like comments from people talking about you know how it's not really uh it doesn't really do anything or you know eth2 is is basically just a test net so i'm curious if we can hear from preston or danny you know what are the the big leaps that are being made here what are the what are the big features that haven't been done before in other proof of stake systems that are being um rolled out with beacon chain you can go um and then i have to bounce in like one minute uh i've double booked i'm sorry but the uh [Music] they're the theorem proof of stake mechanism through the beacon chain uh is focuses like highly on decentralization so you can participate with 32 eth and it uses like very sophisticated cryptographic methods signature aggregation to be able to do that and by having so many consensus particip participants in this proof-of-stake mechanism uh it lays the foundation for um random sampling to do shorter data availability uh and to do bring massive scale um and so although quote it doesn't do anything um it's lays the foundation for the um a new home for ethereum that is scalable more secure uh and more sustainable and you know it what it does is it comes to consensus it comes to consensus on itself um but it has the ability now to come to consensus on much more sophisticated things um and that's what we'll be doing over the next couple years um i gotta bounce have fun guys thank you for having me talk to you all soon hey congratulations danny great work congratulations congratulations but yeah all those tweets all those tweets are just ridiculous i mean it's just i mean i'll just say it though like a decentralized live proof of state completely undermines a lot of the narratives we're used to seeing out there in crypto especially around proof of work so i think a lot of people are a little scared for their bags right now if they're not well there were a lot of narratives around like eth2 never shipping like this not happening there's so many narratives that get invalidated today well right a lot of competing blockchains basically their entire premise was based around this that eth2 would never ship and this kind of throws a wrinkle into you into those narratives i think yeah for sure a wrench all right so what are we looking at here for viewers who just jumped on and missed um what danny was saying earlier earlier so on the left is the beacon chain explorer right and what are we expecting to see here green squares right is that what we want we've got our countdown here so in seven minutes uh we're expecting to start to see epoch zero is that correct the first screen square squares ryan i i hate to interrupt you but you have just got notifications on the screen share i'll be trying to ping you [Laughter] just in case anyone sends you some some you know [Laughter] we're looking at the first four um basically the slots across the first four epochs i believe so we should see those blocks or slots essentially start to fill in green as we go along so it's kind of like a um a launch monitor i guess i would say so that's the launch monitor on the left yep and they got like a little checklist there too like was the first block actually proposed do we need participation of active validators is above two-thirds um and then yeah it just kind of moves on from there so we should see that start to fill it and be happy and that's gonna happen eric in the first like 25 minutes or so 25 to 30 minutes yep very good there's a combined 1100 people watching pretty awesome everyone on ethereum is on youtube watching that's the biggest ethereum stream ever i'm pretty sure i can't think of a bigger one than that and then on the right this uh this monitor is showing the actual slots in the epochs progress across the clients is that what we're looking at yep yeah preston can probably speak best to that one but basically are the are the clients moving along in sync i think yeah so this is the fork monitor or chain monitor and what it's trying to do is it's running one or more of each client and seeing what do what does that client think the head of the chain is this is going to help us understand if if prism is on a different branch the lighthouse or or nibis is doing something different um we want to know that because if there's a you know like the chain split is kind of what we're looking for as the worst case scenario we hope there's not one but that's kind of what the purpose of of the chain monitor is and we're seeing right now this progress bar is it's just counting through slots um we're kind of in in the earlier than the chain has started so our epoch negative one um this is the you know final epoch before the change starts but uh that's what the blue bar is just going counting through time it's not not really measuring anything else cool guys i have a question if if someone deposited into the deposit contract let's pretend they like sleep in this morning they didn't set up their validator over the last several days um is there any is there any like uh follow-up for them i mean are they are they just out of of that 32-b or do they have an opportunity to uh redeem themselves they'll start to leak slowly over i believe it's like what you would earn in a year divided by 365 and essentially is like what you would leak something along those lines so it's it's slow and yeah the second thing so if they miss a block proposal or an attestation they were signed they would start to lose some heath um but yeah if they come back online say tomorrow or something you know they would just lose a very small amount scheme of things i'm sure there's gonna be plenty of folks that that happens to and yeah if anyone sees that and you're worried just don't freak out uh uh i had super fizz on yield tv recently and uh that was really helpful to me just to understand what leakage was and that like you were saying if if uh if if i'm offline for a day like let's even pretend like later in the year i move across the country again and i'm out for like five days uh i really just need another five days to recover whatever i've um potentially lost during that time so yeah anyways don't freak out if you just woke up and are like oh i think there's a lot of like misinformation around that because like originally the penalties were a lot larger and they were reduced over time so i think a lot of people think oh if i miss one i lose a lot of eat that's just not true now if you get slashed so like if you double sign or something like that that's a larger penalty but just simply being offline isn't as bad here it goes guys we are less than three minutes out now oh getting into this three minutes out i can't watch it feels like the new year's countdown only a thousand times more fun yeah way better yeah and way earlier [Laughter] well technically later or way earlier in the year yeah yeah yeah yeah new year's countdown says it doesn't happen at four in the morning everyone's all right now so uh what did we finalize on wow 880 000 over 880 remember when we thought we wouldn't hit that yeah it was close guys it was close i feel like we're going to see a big second wave like once everything is well and people see it stable we're going to see like that double in my mind yeah anyone want to share their most memorable eth2 moment from the last year well eth2 hasn't started yet so how could we have memories of it up to youtube today obviously yeah i think madasha going live was a turning point right that's when it it became like super like super hype super real right for multi-client testing long-running you know that's that was my one of my favorite moments pre e3 launch yeah that was great well one minute i think yeah yeah we're getting close now we just have to watch so one minute we're looking for green blocks all right we like green my my note actually says genesis time is 23 seconds after the hour so that's true you technically have oh man there's a final countdown on the note now it was only updating every minute or something now it's updating every second that's what i got you prism okay so each of these epochs we're looking at on the left here um for the first four epochs which are the most important right and each of these epochs have what 32 slots how long is each slot again 13 13 13 seconds okay 23 seconds to go person system everyone get the tweets already 30 seconds out and what we want are these first four epochs is we want enough participation so that it finalizes that's the best scenario enough participation so it finalizes guys are we going to do a 10 second countdown live here we go i think you're right yeah changes in this is this time you have testations oh my validator just spat out chain genesis time reached my i thought you were going to take my validator to start spitting out eth well i mean technically i did get right here wow look at it oh there's a little rocket ship whoever made this all right so oh yeah all right we got block zero first block proposed in slot one all right epoch zero we're live genesis block wow they're turning green that looks good yeah we like the color green that's what i know eric how's your dashboard filling up with uh vote summaries uh looking good i got one air at the start could not submit slot signature to beacon node but since then everything's good so it cannot locate validator index in db slot zero yeah that's all right so you're seeing that because it asks you to aggregate it at the station and there was really nothing to aggregate yet because it literally just started um yeah i'm a testing a testing block so that looks good oh yeah we're wow we already have one proposed blocks for slots one through four two so pressing the uh this monitor on the right changed a little bit um i suppose that's because yeah what changed here slot eight looks like the the list of the clients kind of disappeared yeah and uh maybe you refresh this page it looks like all the information dropped off i i'm not familiar with how this works in detail i know that it's asking for data from multiple clients but it seems like it it might be broken maybe maybe we hugged it too hard i don't know well to clarify the monitor's down there's nothing who's not down the monitor's down someone quoted one of you guys on twitter and said e2 is down just now so so slot one which was the first buck that could have graffiti was signed to mr f was here mr f huh wait so that is is that our equivalent that that's it so we're going away it's inspiring it's history guys in a thousand years when they read about the genesis they'll form a religion around mr f no you know what you know what vitalik just needs to change his his name now to fatalic right guys have seen that meme he could be mr f anthony religions have been formed over much sillier things so that's a good chance well what did mr f mean what i mean finance mr f f for finance melody for freedom finality finality freedom yeah oh we're here yeah we're here it looks like everything's going well right at least on my end yeah same got ass testations coming through all right guys i'm gonna go to bed see you guys later looks like things are in good hands here two people missed slot five and slot seven were missed that just means that they didn't set up the validator or something along those lines i guess so because those were assigned to someone specific right and so someone specific would have had to have signed for those so is it is it a problem that we're seeing some red right here is that what you're talking about eric these are yes someone missed their assignment so i guess it could be multiple things but i think it probably means that person just hasn't fired up their setup or wasn't had a problem so they are getting leaked or not yet they would they would so instead of receiving a very small amount of ether they lost a very small amount of ether losers i blame mr f okay so what about these uh squares that are staying gray is like we just haven't heard a report from them yeah they eventually fill in so there's yeah that's right so when the when the windows blocks was gray it just means it it's still waiting for the block and it doesn't want to call that it's not coming yet so it won't turn red for a couple extra slots i think so preston should we be concerned about these like four red blocks that we see at all um maybe um i want to know why obviously but it's most likely just that someone wasn't online already at that time [Music] that's what i think it was they don't think it's really something else they just think that maybe that they didn't wake up at that so early or whatever um did no one let them know what that is today i i guess i don't know we're what we're really trying to watch here is the on-chain at the station rate so looking at participation um and if you if you scroll down a little bit you can see most recent epochs and there's this like voted uh column and that's climbing up to 100 we want to see that which is already um over two-thirds so that's good um so that's what we need we want it over two-thirds yeah we want that number to be at least over two-thirds for the first four epochs so we can get fidelity and we want that obviously to keep going beyond but that's a really good sign that's a good number to stare at is how many percent of people are are participating uh in attestations which is the most common thing 77 all right it looks like it's tracking it with this green bar here nice oh yeah yeah nice so did we only know block assignments for the first for epoch zero is that all we knew or do we know yeah that's right um we we know just early we know this uh uh first sinus and now we know that the next epoch we know basically uh just in time what's going to be happening in the next epoch oh yeah i just got my new attestation wow right now all right so epoch zero is done now and the two things that we wanted to happen happen we got our first block proposed in slot one and we've got participation over two thirds now we're on so yeah you participate that's huge that's high yeah let's get ahead of the fud here it's working hey preston president i just had a question it um on that beacon chain page it says eligible eath as 674 000. does that mean that there's roughly 200 thousand each that's deposited but not necessarily activated or ready to go yeah that's right so there's already uh several days long activation cue for validators and what we're expecting to see later today is e2 uh validators vote on what's going on in eth1 they do this every [Music] 2048 slots so by around slot 1024 we should see the system has reached consensus and now we're going to start accepting those pending deposits again after that november 24th uh date and then those guys will enter in the queue and then the queue will start processing at uh four validators per epoch 900 per day and i think there's like 2 000 3 000 in it expected to be in the queue already something like that so if anyone's curious you can go on the beacon chain site and look for your uh look for your index validator index to see if you're proposing blocks in the latest cpod new question what if my validator index is still pending that's fine it will activate over uh what the the time timeline that preston was just talking about yeah no the thing was confusing is that i deposited before what was it november 24th and it still says what up hudson welcome what's up y'all yeah hey hudson hey hudson welcome welcome uh yeah are you feeling okay how's it going doing great i got my fuzzy pajama pants on i got my peanut butter whiskey [Laughter] i wish i hudson if you ever want you can come live with me so you could wake me up at 5 00 a.m if i had you walking me like hey what's up dude got my peanut butter whiskey to be clear i've never drank this early in my life by a long time it's still it's still nighttime i know it's it's still it's late it's not early it's late [Laughter] if you just call me some night i'll just like i'll just read you a bedtime story to sleep just hit me up yeah the spirit of ethereums here i think the one thing i wanted to call it here is uh you know like over the last year as as i've like learned more about how eth2 would work i've always been uh surprised pleasantly by like how not fragile this system is like that i'm just so like impressed by the coordination between all the client teams to create something where like in this case you know no big deal you know people whatever sleep in i don't know they didn't set up their validator correctly um i i think there's a lot of people out there that don't understand like just how well designed this is and like knock on wood i realize like we're we're still early here but it's it's just really reassuring and i think it's uh it's a testament to the community and just i don't know man preston i don't know how the hell you guys do this but thank you i i i i am just like i am in shock at like just how well this has continued to go over the last few weeks and months so congrats man thanks yeah it's it's certainly been an adventure and really fun i mean we're we're honored to be able to do it uh to be a part of something so cool and exciting and impactful really like when we started prismatic labs is all about trying to make ethereum better and in any way we could and this seemed to be the the biggest opportunity we had and we're really excited that it's finally coming to uh fruition here yeah i don't think like there were people lined up to fight you for that for that honor so again it's it's just mind-blowing everything that that you guys have accomplished here so wow wow does anyone else feel like this i'm just like holy this is finally like this is working and like yeah it's surreal to watch the blocks come in like there's too much to like watch right now yeah i think like some of us are in disbelief that you know it's finally you know yeah after so long um yeah i don't know there's a there's just a huge community gathering right now like by the way our streams are getting smoke is getting smoked by the ethereum foundation east staker stream which has i was just there three thousand five hundred people watching it yeah we got hunters so we're fine awesome the crowd's gonna follow hudson over now that hudson's here they're all coming over i i switched with danny because i think dan was it wasn't danny on a different stream he was always here yeah okay he was here cool oh also um ryan you're running the shared screen go to eth2.ninja and there's a really cool visualization looks kind of 90s um that i think aditya did if i'm not mistaken um it should just work it shouldn't be https let's see if it loads yep we've got like 30 seconds before we hug this site to death oh no we already hugged the other one there was a two fork monitor yeah yeah yeah we did that so hudson what are we looking at here um i'm not a i'm not a core devs yeah i don't know preston what are we looking at here uh so we have a straight line with squares on it a couple of numbers i don't that's the first time i've seen this so i i'm guessing this is uh showing the progress of the chain and if i'm interpreting it correctly there are no forks yet it's all one sequential chain oh well that's good straight line no forks yep that's what we want to see well i can redraw what's this too wait no don't draw a fork that's bad oh wow this is did i just log into the master node here two dot ninja yeah it's probably better to go back to beacon chain this i don't know what this is that was cool though it was neat yeah cool side quest all right so we are we just finished epoch one as well okay so what does it mean that the finalization percentage for these epochs are getting higher and higher more validators could be random yeah i mean maybe just for some reason in the first it looks like we missed five of the 32 blocks in the first one so or yeah people are waking up and saying oh i'm supposed to be on my way but it's good that it's climbing so for an epoch what happens if we're under two-thirds for one individual epoch does that cause some major problem or does that have to happen a number of times um so if it's like a one-off thing it's not that big of a deal what we need is uh for it to get justified first and it can only be justified if there's more than two-thirds uh and now we're i mean we're seeing this like genesis checklist that's going through and we we want epoch 2 to be justified so when it's complete or most of the way through and we have two thirds uh voting then we'll see that check mark check if they're of course if they're agreeing i mean you have to have the two thirds voting on the same fork or part of the chain if they're voting randomly that doesn't help but um yeah that so if if we don't get that it doesn't justify you need two justifications or three in a three in uh four recent epochs for for those to be for the fourth one to be finalized um so if we miss one that's not a big deal if we missed two okay might slow things down uh just a little bit but if we're missing them consistently then we're gonna have a hard time finalizing got it so it's kind of like bowling in a sense that like your future score impacts your previous score i think so cool sports ball how does this relate to plants [Laughter] i mean the the thing i was thinking about this morning waking up at one o'clock in the morning and not being able to fall back to sleep until 4am is like the ethos of ethereum in my experience over the last two years has been one of permissionlessness decentralization and like representations from various uh outlets that ascribe to these things and communicate them to the community uh really uh are are very much um imbued in in what's happening right now the decentralization of this new beacon chain having the ability to with you know uh some amount of your stake commit to supporting the network going forward and being rewarded for that like is there anything just that represents what if even wants to be better than this moment and i don't know it's super cool it's like it's like the early days of like krypto when people were mining from home right now we're doing that we can mine from home and all of this without proof of work is pretty pretty phenomenal so this is all staked capital yeah proof of work and your living room oil and water yeah that doesn't work as somebody who currently has four mining rigs in my apartment and three of them are turned off david you can turn them into uh plant pots my friend just could you know car carve them out yeah just something that's something i'll be interested to see how many nodes i think we should be able to start getting node data soon right now that everything's kind of going i'll be interested to see how many unique e2 nodes are out there um because you know we've got i think 20 000 validators but those could be owned by you know a few people or whatever hundreds of people thousands we're not really sure i feel like seeing the node data will give us a good indication of um the distribution of across validators eric do you have a good link for that um i feel like i was looking at something the other day but it wasn't live yet and i was thinking just because the network wasn't live let me try to pull where was i oh yeah actually beacon chain has it but it's on modasha right now so i'm assuming they're going to flip over it's eth2.ethernodes.org but it's on the old test net so i'm hoping at some point they're going to flip that over to maintenance i'm sure they will so what about the eth1 stats have we talked about that at all or did i miss that because i think that's really important too knowing that all these people are starting to run local not everyone people are going to use infuria but a lot of people are running local eth1 nodes and i like that some of the minority clients are gaining percentages if you go to ethernodes.org there is a chart or there's a graph and geth is still the majority client but like nethermine grew a whole percent uh open ethereum i think grew a little bit i haven't looked in a while but yeah yeah the overall node count there's also a spike in just overall nodes not necessarily percentage changes which is nice to see yeah yeah absolutely personally i love my other my node it's been running real smooth what was the sync time like you know i had a like two terabyte ssd pretty good i7 processor and i think it took 17 hours full mode so we are at a total of over 11 300 eth onenotes there hudson pretty impressive what what was that say last month two months ago you know i don't remember below 10k i'm pretty sure yeah i think so yeah it was i think it was around 7 or 8k wow it's impressive yeah until very recently because of the yeah everyone running a node for eighth two so that's really good i also think we have more nodes in bitcoin now we do yeah yeah unless you use this important thing but these aren't actually used yeah luke's magical tool that tells you there's a hundred thousand these aren't full nodes man like come on we all know that no one can run an ethereum full node i hate to be that guy but just just for anybody listening that's not true yeah i'm joking it's their classic australian humor everything's upside down yeah yeah at least i didn't have to wake up before i embraced so so preston not to keep hitting you with questions but what does epoch 3 justified mean and why would they just show four epochs here and then have that so does something special happen every four epochs right so you need three justifications in for epochs for things to start finalizing so looking at these four this is the minimum we can we can process to get our first finalized epoch so we want we want e5 one to be finalized when and that would happen if epoch 1 is justified epoch 2 is justified and then epoch 3 is justified finalization is the first sign that things are going really well so that's kind of why we're looking at these four and why we're counting these first four epochs and what we're expecting to see so it looks like we've got epoch zero justified now we're waiting on epoch one it also looks like we're starting to get a lot more green which is interesting we haven't had a red slot now in like almost 15 or 20 slots yeah curious to know what's up with a lot of those missed slots early on do people just not have software up was there a small hiccup somewhere i would imagine naturally like the first epoch would all be the most rough just for if there's ever going to be a problem it's going to be right at the start yeah yeah i think it'll take a while for you know people who weren't um ready to go at the time or didn't have their stakings set up it will take them a bit to get shaken out or alternatively get set up properly and then hopefully there will be a better statistics down the line so one thing i was going to say real quick one thing that happened on the eath staker discord is mr fahrenheit one of the users proved at least we think that they were the first non-genesis block to like be able to post graffiti did we look at have you all looked at the first block after genesis is that is that who mr f is i mean yes yes mr f yeah mr f's block no that's not it's already a meme wow that's the fastest meme to ever just like come around ever i'm telling you there's gonna be like a religion around it someday so wait did he do what what what's the name mr f mister yeah let's explain that again i missed this earlier what is okay mr fahrenheit is a user he actually like has some apps and stuff and apparently and like someone someone figured out who or maybe he told everyone who he was and um and so so everyone he was like hey i think i'm the first uh i'm the first proposer or whatever the the phrase the uh terminology is and everyone was like what are you really and he like proved it by like sending someone uniswap tokens and was like no this is really my address here look at this and everyone was like oh no wow you really are you should make your graffiti like really cool and then everyone gave terrible suggestions like eath melt still beams and ethers again i don't even know there's just a bunch of bad suggestions and so i was hoping they wouldn't do something bad apparently they're watching this live with their wife like the eat staker live stream um with their wife or something and uh they're just chilling hudson i saw someone propose in the uh eath staker reddit thread uh it was like i came for eth2 and all i got was this lousy block i was like i thought that was a great idea that's really good it's very like honestly i thought it reflected the community like like such a like significant like milestone and yet you know people at the end of the day are acting like people and i don't know just not taking themselves too seriously but at the same time i don't know it's just it's it's something about the community i'm i'm blown away by like everyone's online you know there's there's obviously thousands of people like not just following the live stream but in general participating and i mean it's crazy like we've been through like a pandemic this year and you know i feel like i honestly feel like the pandemic strength in the ethereum community i feel like we've all been online more we've connected more people are able to skip going to  conferences and and be able to focus on work and it's it's thank you pandemic i think i think it actually helped uh i won't hear that ever again i know i know right like empathetic to everyone else who's lost their job sorry sorry but you picked the wrong industry overlining that's the silver lining yeah i i do clearly think as a community we've been more productive without all the conferences there's like no debating it yeah but we haven't seen anybody in real life only on zoom yeah i know i know nine months we all know as soon as it's possible to travel again everybody's going to be traveling because because that's a i don't know it's kind of a big part of ethereum culture at least it's going and meeting these people that you only talk to online there's also this in-person connection for some people that's a really big part of it totally all right guys just watching my client locally we just finalized so congrats nice wow mr f strikes again thank you mr f it's also a arrested development reference by the way mr f yeah i was going to mention that but i thought it was too niche [Laughter] wow congrats guys this is huge so can we say now eth2 is successfully launched like i think there's like the enablers that have a qualm with that okay well all right but can we say it though david so like it feels like the the rocket has launched successfully and now we've just like broken out of the atmosphere and we're in outer space right now yeah that's right smashing the champagne bottle against the uh beacon chain yacht here yeah exactly wow guys what other website should we be following for progress thinking of like everyone out there who's you know um uh you know not a developer even those that aren't running a validator what other interesting stats should we be following the eth2 fork mons backup um it looks like so people jumped off that yeah i would say the best two sites are this beacon chain and then beacon scan so ether scan has a site as well so they're kind of i mean they're like the block explorers now right so that that's kind of going to be the go-to for these two and what's up i said gg ether scan yeah right yeah and they own beacon scan but the beacon chain i mean they're both pretty good um but you can follow the blocks and so like pretty familiar the best is if you're validating you can plug in your validator indexes to both and track them in dashboards so you can kind of see how everything is going for you so one connection i want to point out that not a lot of people realize is that beacon chain the website um is run by bitfly and it fly is run by a guy named peter i think he's the ceo and he also runs ethermine which is the largest ethereum mining pool with at least 25 to 30 percent of the hash power so people who claim um that uh you know the miners aren't on board with eth2 and stuff like that they're really some of the most involved people with getting eth1 clients uh ready for eth2 as far as sending in bug reports and building tools and infrastructure for this type of thing the second biggest mining pool i believe is um uh what is it it's not spark pool they are no it is spark pool spark pool and they also i think have done some stuff around staking so um there's there's not going to be any disruption as far as miners are concerned that i can see uh most i haven't heard of any kind of insurrection or anything like that so hudson is that like a general uh case that a lot of the proof of work miners have been like acquiring eth acquiring essentially their tokenized a6 and that are now making the transition to proof of stake binding you know i don't know if it's the majority of them i haven't talked to enough of them and once we get past the top two mining pools that make up a majority of the network i it gets to smaller ones i know f2 pool has been preparing and they're a bigger one um i don't know about like two miners and other uh like medium to small size mining pools but that that's that's definitely a fair uh guess that they are preparing for something like that because they've known this has been coming for a while it also seems like uh more news is coming out that the exchanges have been preparing there was that bit of coinbase news yesterday that coinbase in q1 is going to enable eth2 staking which is very interesting definitely right in time for the retail stampede if that's what's going to happen early next year so interesting timing on that front yeah absolutely yeah the coinbase news is interesting basically you can stake with them now but you get an iou centralized type token for your e-stake so i mean that was expected still yeah for sure every exchange is going to do it i i think i would just caution people i would still suggest to run your own stuff it's not as hard as how hard how hard how hard is it eric would you say like for somebody who's you know slightly technical but doesn't know how to work the command line for instance knows computers but doesn't know code well if you don't know how to work the command line you're probably in trouble because everything runs through it but so i will say it was way harder during the test nets but the documentation so i'm running prism their documentation is great now it's come a long way you can if you know compute like how to work a computer you could probably figure it out um you know are you going to feel 100 comfy in the first couple days with what you're doing probably not but i would still even suggest looking at like a rocket pool or like you know some kind of staking service over exchange staking personally um but you know it's not i'm not gonna lie and say it's super easy but it's also not as as tough as it once was does anybody have any insight as to how this might get easier for less technical users who don't want to put their ether on an exchange other than custodial services which are going to be like the coin base and if kraken decides to do it in other groups um there are some online interfaces with groups i think it's stake pool might be one of them that's kind of a still a custodial service but not a major exchange so it's going to be less trustworthy but very very easy to just send your ether in whether it's one ether or 32 ether and then as far as individuals the documentation hopefully will get better we're going to learn from these first few weeks you know the pitfalls and what people are having trouble with and some of the flaws and the clients and things like that so far it looks like all clients are running fairly smoothly from what i can tell from being on the other call i haven't seen much go wrong there so yeah in summary there's going to be better documentation there's going to be better walk throughs and things like avato and dap note are going to evolve so as long as you can you know buy a pre-configured dap node box you don't even have to know command line and you can run that thing yeah i think as far as that's oh sorry go ahead trump oh uh eric no i was just gonna say uh is that is that eric yeah yeah i was just gonna say as far as like the clients themselves and the interface is getting better like to me so there's already some graphical interfaces being launched by the teams that make things easier so you can see the status so really for me the hardest part is the diagnostics and making sure when something goes wrong you you're notified and you know what it is right so getting there's like a grafana dashboard out there you can set up notifications to discord a few of the client teams are launching their own uis i think that's going to be the next big step in you know making this easier i don't think we're going to move away from running it from the command line for a while but honestly once it's there it's all really about the monitoring of everything this this is what hudson was talking about like dap node you can basically buy a box right so you don't even have to buy hardware just it's all pre-configured and you can get it set up really quickly i haven't been told this for sure or i've been told this but i haven't looked into it for sure i should say there are ethereum foundation grants for eth2 related work and one of them is to make a graphical interface client for eth2 staking so if you're listening to this and you're a developer and you want to jump into that mission there is money out there for you i actually think the fact that it does require a little bit of learning curve is a feature not a bug at this stage i was getting dms from people when we started talking about staking and like returns that sort of thing asking like how do i state right like um and where do i go to stake where do i go what's the like button to press what's the user interface and these are people that aren't necessarily educated enough to know that like once you're once you start staking on eth2 yeah uh it's like the east is burnt you know like you can't come back it's locked up for two years and yeah so it was a nice gate to uh make sure that people um were educated to understand what they were actually doing before jumping into the main chain so i honestly see it as a feature that it was a slight learning curve and uh and not a bug but that will get easier over time i'm sure that guide ryan that that you guys had written up in bankless is i think that's one of the best guides out there and i i think i think what everyone's basically saying is you know don't be afraid to run your own validator but also don't be afraid if you don't fit that profile you know if if you own exactly 32 eth sure you could selflessly you know stake it and and take that risk for the next two years um i think the main the main concern there is if someone stakes 32 eth and let's pretend that's most of their portfolio the question is whether they might need to reach into that 32 eth over the next two years like just financial situations can change really quickly for anyone so i think it's what what percentage of of your portfolio is the amount of eat that you're staking how comfortable are you with all of these mechanisms that are very reliant upon you as an individual you know if you're someone who's never used metamask probably not the greatest idea for you to hop into this and and sort of uh uh be patient keep reading and and i think with like the eath steak or reddit like they really can take someone from like zero to one if you fall down that rabbit hole um and then yeah just generally i think it it per usual it requires someone who's just that curious and and that willing to continue to learn because you know there's there's a lot there to keep track of uh especially just the simple stuff too like you know being able to maintain uh a consistent internet connection like that's something that a lot of people might not you know have access to and and again there's no shame in that you know it may maybe you maybe you will use something like rocket pool that's what i'm personally looking forward to is i i'm looking to a decentralized staking pool like rocket pool right in addition to all the infrastructure that rocket pool needs to build out in order to be working operation i really hope that they also like make aggressive moves into the whole ux um world as well um because like to me like rocket pool rocket pool is like an extension of the values of ethereum right and so like all the labor that went into making it possible to stake at home with 32 east like rocket pool takes like finishes does like the last mile of like well now we can do 16 or 8 or 2 eth with rocket pool right which is you know are arguably much harder but if they can solve that problem like the whole idea of like the that that like it's your patriotic duty to stake well if it's less than 32 eth like well what do what do i do well the answer is rocket pool right because it's an extension of the ethos of ethereum and so i think i think with people that are having trouble running their own node or just like are intimidated or just don't kind of want that hands-on responsibility i'm hoping that rocket pool makes that really easy for people in a way that like retains the ethos of ethereum of the nature of decentralization that's what i'm optimistic about i think one thing as well for people that maybe feel intimidated at stake or haven't got there yet to remember is previously there were no real incentives on the line it was all test nets so a lot of people didn't spend a lot of time doing this or writing guides or helping people now that we have money on the line right or a lot of money on the line for a lot of people that are staking there's going to be better guides there's going to be you know people willing to help to do this um it's a totally different ballgame now so and just because maybe you weren't in the first few you know days of staking i i would probably suggest to people that don't feel comfortable to do it to give it like a week or two see how things go were there any bugs you know it looks good so far but who knows something could still happen um and then and then go from there guys there's a team that's uh working to enable you to to stake with a raspberry pi right and that if that's looking good like it's not we're not ready to be able to do that but i know that's something i was um hoping to be able to do is uh run this on on a raspberry pi 4 or whatever's the the newest raspberry pi it's sitting on my shelf i basically bought all the parts for for to run a validator and then i was like you know what i'm actually not ready myself to set this up so i i've been you know considering rocket pull versus running it on this raspberry pi um when that becomes available yeah um that that account i believe that you're referring to is ethereum on arm on twitter i think they had i think they're running i don't know if they had a public release or not but if not they're close but yeah definitely people should follow follow that if so the other stream has ended i just clicked the end button a little bit ago so get ready for an influx of other people watching maybe we outlasted the foundation uh people desperate is super fizz on another live stream like i feel like he was he was running the other one he's he's uh he's off now oh man he should come on here he's he's he's the he's so good at explaining he's that he is a goat for sure oh man and um we got vitalik saying congrats on the launch all like he like he's not super responsible for it or something he's he's just some guy you just gotta remember yeah just some guy i always loved uh seeing that on reddit you know when 2017 was all about reddit and then you'd see vitalik comment and it just had like just some guy on his reddit name yeah he's read it tag i loved seeing that that was funny well i mean there's a lot there's a lot to um to congratulate the community for and congratulate the the researchers this is this is pretty historic i mean for people who don't realize right so this has got to be the largest proof-of-stake genesis ever launched in terms of it like maybe by any metric right in terms of number of clients in terms of the amount of capital at stake over half a billion dollars in terms of the number of active validators 21 000 in terms of the amount of participation seems like it's the most decentralized proof of stake network ever created and it got off the launch pad like we had a successful launch so that's huge it's pretty it's pretty historic yeah definitely welcome super fast not all proof of stake networks are built equally right like this one is truly decentralized and has a lot of validators not delegated all that good stuff yeah proof of stake as it was supposed to be not some sort of like honestly anything that's like a delegated proof of stake that says we're proof of stake like no you're not like that's not real that's called a database point oh super fears is already already firing shots sorry well i didn't name names yeah yeah oh wasn't that awesome yeah that was great it was awesome hey can you break down like so where are we right now like what are you paying attention to and congrats man i feel like you deserve as much credit as anyone you've educated so many people on staking and just way to go man yeah thank you like i try not to be an egoist but i am really proud of the community like that encouraged people to take that risk and do something that many felt was beyond their reach um and you know i feel like if if we left the community behind we might have a little bit higher network participation right now on the metric but we wouldn't really have this uh cadre of home stakers who are able to participate in something this significant so um honestly what i'm watching right now are my validators performance like the the network has launched everyone is is going and i just want to make sure that i'm doing my part now to um to attest and propose as i'm supposed to do so it's great i just talked to mr fahrenheit and it's not an arrested development reference it's it's uh it's short for mr fahrenheit as in the queen's song or if you're looking at my vitalik autograph it's short for mr fahrenheit instead it looks like vitalik posted about him in uh twitter and i think that's what he's referring to hello i am glad that we identified him like it was just so so odd he came in uh to the east acre discord at like um three hours ago and was like hey i'm having trouble with uh my wi-fi um can you guys offer some hints and um he just sort of posted something that included i i think that that index number um and we were like hey is that you it was it was awesome like he didn't know before that that he had the uh the first proposal this is hilarious whoa that's wow whoever whoever has the graffiti welcome to the new beginning has quite the deposits because they already have 13 blocks proposed don't dox me yeah right sorry could that have gone better i don't think so no i mean that was amazing eric is is that what was written in the first block the welcome i think it was the second block the first block was the mr f1 i think this person got blocked let me look um they got block four slot four gotta get used to saying slots instead of blocks or i guess they're one in the same technically but i i do the same like yeah i i still uh consider myself a minor gonna stop sharing your screen because that um page is now kind of concluded yeah it's dead awesome well no no the bigger chain's not dead oh my god i can't believe i said that sorry guys [Laughter] do you know of any resources that are showing the amount of nodes online we were talking earlier about the e2 nodes or ethereum nodes.org but it's still on modasha do you know of any way to track currently so um even if uh are you talking about e2 stats i think is that right um yeah youtube.e2.ethernodes.org but they're still on the test net i'm curious if we can get any stats around how many nodes are being run i know that's a tricky thing to do even yeah um you know the thing that i've kind of learned is that the way the network is structured you only see a view of the network and no one can actually see the whole network and so um i i don't know that there's a way to actually so you can estimate the actual number of nodes but you can't actually know that the total number of notes because no one sees the entire network people only see one view of the network gotcha yeah because i was curious how i was saying you know technically someone one whale could have made all the deposits it'd be cool to see how how spread out we really are as far as the decentralization of this goes i mean obviously i know that didn't happen but i'd still like to know i feel like the number of nodes would give us a good indication of that yeah yeah wow i just really love the graffiti field i think that's really unique and it's gonna it's gonna be some fun had with that for sure it was cool yeah to do in there you can encode antsy characters in there so it might take a little bit of fiddling but it won't be long before it gets uh used abused and manipulated you guys you guys know the number numbers game where like uh every people just a group of people like us for example start counting like one and then somebody counts two and somebody counts three but if you trip over each other like you gotta start over again that's what we should we should play the numbers game with graffiti see how far we can get before two people attest to the same number so that's something similar to the graffiti wall on the beacon chain site if you go into the more section uh this has been there since i think and you can actually paint on a thousand by thousand pixel grid using your graffiti which i haven't seen anyone do yet i've been uh kind of peeking in on it from oh that's not during a test net jim from addison did like a big logo am i right awesome yeah that's great it was neat because it took a week to begin filling in so you could kind of see that somebody was doing something there but you couldn't quite tell what it was and then eventually it sort of like appeared as the attestant logo that's pretty cool all our friends on the stream if you want to go to beacon. in beacon cha dot in slash graffiti wall and uh right now there's nothing on there but uh we got a whole lifetime to fill it up how does if someone claims your spot does it get overwritten if they have the latest block okay yeah i tried to mess with it on the test net but the instructions were a little bit over my head so i need to go dedicate some time to it yeah it looks like they might have updated the way that you can uh draw on a pixel because it looks like it's a little easier than it was in some of the earlier test nets so i value poeps so much that i'm like i don't want to waste my proposal on anything and i know like i get they're just stickers and i get they have no actual value but damn if it's not the most exciting thing to me to like have that little sticker book don't let patricia here you say they're just stickers man like yeah i know well [Laughter] i can say what i want right i'm a free agent i've got my my physical popes as well um i like them too you're not alone in that yeah did you guys watch the vitalik video that we put out on banquet's youtube uh yesterday i haven't had a chance to i was listening to the bellagi uh uh podcast today um yeah that's really really interesting i got through like an hour of it yeah wow as somebody who i know for a fact doesn't listen to every single bank bacon class uh podcast i'm surprised that you picked the two and a half hour one with balochi to listen to it well no i started riding my bike again and i figured you know what better times listen to podcasts and you know you guys put out some really great ones so yeah for sure i have that same problem like i listened while i drive and we're in quarantine world now so i don't drive at all so like i don't really listen to anything anymore mm-hmm that's what i used to do what were some of the highlights from the bellagi interview i i haven't listened to it either yet but yeah it looked beloved is like unironically not a joke trying to make a country like yeah i can see that yeah like he's starting he's starting like a country a nation like in the cloud and then he's gonna figure out how to make it real wow like buying land and stuff yeah no like for real he probably has enough money to start a nation as well so no surprise there i mean it takes a lot of time yeah it takes a village of very wealthy people to do this yeah yeah he's definitely one of the most revered people in all of crypto and it's it's cool to to see what interests him and in ethereum and bitcoin um but yeah he he is he he's definitely one to think outside the box is the question for super fizz are you still just watching the beacon chain website or is there somewhere else where you're actively monitoring i primarily watch um so i'm watching my syslog um because it combines uh you know the all of the feeds from all of the logs from my server in one place so i can see if there's any problems but then i really just watch um my beacon chain stored uh list of validators i only have a few um it's being modest no i mean i really do like i i it's funny like as much as much time as i put into this you'd think that like i was a baller um but i'll be honest i have four and that is you know plenty for me i should not have said that out loud um but like i watch my server logs and i watch uh beacon chain primarily i know that there are a lot of other great services cropping up but those two sources tell me everything i need if you're running any of the metric stuff like the grafana dashboard alongside your setup you should already see your total earnings uh being accrued and then hourly earn will have data populated in it in a couple of minutes so uh if you want another milestone to celebrate this morning what are the other milestones today i think we were talking about this earlier with preston um what else should people be paying attention to um oh go ahead superfist well i was going to say that that really what i was looking for for the health of the network was the early finalized epochs um beyond that the rest of the day i'll i'll be looking for uh participation rate increases and at some point we'll begin um actually looking for validators who are linked and repeatedly offline so that we'll do a little bit of digging to see if we can reach out to someone who either may be stuck or may not be aware that they're not validating so that we can offer support so if you see like um you know when you when you pull out the data for all of the missed proposers proposals or missed stations you can often see a trend that that kind of groups those people together and you can begin to see if maybe that's somebody who um you've encountered somewhere else that you can reach out to and say hey i noticed you're offline i'll be like oh no um remember you know this is all pseudo-anonymous so people love to tout the anonymity of cryptocurrency but you know it's all pseudo-anonymous so in many cases we can associate a validator with a person do you think there's any chance that a number of people did deposit 32 ethan just had no idea like basically got caught up in all the excitement are now waking up to the fact that they're like oh i have to do something after that well it began it began with a deposit contract when we saw a few people repeatedly sending 32 eth to the to the contract address without going through the launch pad and that's that kind of indication that they didn't really get what was going on but they were ready to fomo in anyway way and so i'm very certain that there are people who blindly clicked through the prompts on launch pad and checked all the boxes and sent their funds and are now waiting for money to magically accrue in their in their wallet and when they get that figured out we will uh help them to set up some kind of service to get their validator going yeah there's a comment in the youtube chat about two of the top ten addresses not uh not active yet um the validity is not active apparently apparently it's 50 000 worth yeah i just saw number five is missing blocks so it's interesting that's that's an expensive lesson that's the kind of detective work that we'll be doing for the next few days to help everyone get up and on stage yeah yeah i'd like i mean i'd like to see it over 90 constantly that'd be cool um i think that's achievable we're at eighty seven percent or something right guys i that was the last time i looked i promised my dog a walk i have to leave it's been awesome congratulations everyone fantastic happy eat launch day see you later bankless date of the nation which is happening in like six years always showing up baby abs abs i'm gonna i'm gonna stop listening to the podcast now because you just shield it too much what a shiller okay it's hard so east sticker we have the same trouble like uh we had a list of like eight things eight programs we wanted to show but you kind of get to that whole like when is it obnoxious and when is it beneficial like wow it's always beneficial yeah i mean i think if you're like educating people and not just like shilling your bags on a stream or a video or whatever i think it's always fine unless it's easy i'm really proud of the east staker collaboration groups now this is a special group where you can join five up i'm just kidding i'm actually gonna that's all the end right i don't i don't think anybody's gonna stop you there i wasn't really going to do it reddit.com eatstaker we'll shut the stream down when david starts showing the ample i have that lined up in the schedule should i bump that oh man okay so i have a confession all through the call i've had my uh my pixel butt in and i've been rocking out to my happy taylor swift music yes like just uh like be chill and just be happy and so uh taylor swift again for getting me through uh through the launch i'm sure i'm sure she's watching the stream right now i heard she's a big ethereum fan oh yeah i think is that is that the folklore album we're talking about the most you know i don't actually know folklore uh getting back to the driving thing um i would listen to that while i was driving um and i just i haven't listened to much so um i'm actually on nineteen very good it's also on disney plus so oh god day by dad showing disney plus now my sister is like six months pregnant or something and so i just bought her a b for uh to put in her stocking uh in christmas so i just bought her a an ethereum themed uh children's book so i am indoctrinating that kid hard as soon as you try to convince them to like to like name name them bethany if it's a girl i was going with with elizabeth but bethany works too elizabeth would work too you know what it needs to be like bethany elizabeth like to get the double whammy in there yeah is this a book and someone made it a children's book do you not know about the b for the b is for buffalo corn that's cause you've never been to eastern ever eat denver yeah yeah that's because somebody proposed decided to propose to the wife around valentine's day oh wait no is that is that what happens or is it just valentine's day uh valentine's day and wife's birthday it's always that weekend yeah i i got pretty close did you ever confirm at the last um denver did people get covered like that was like right on the cusp of the u.s starting to get hit you mean a 3 000 person conference in early february yeah no yeah a lot of people got sick and yeah i mean i i didn't i don't i don't personally i was there i don't really remember anybody any reports of it maybe a few but ecc week or so after and there were there were quite a few people yeah i mean i got sick after 8th dan barr but i mean i never got tested if it was covered or anything i just assumed it was a cold and then all these other people got sick and i'm like okay so i guess i'll say this but like i went to eat denver with a cold and i'm pr i probably it's probably who i gave i could probably give it to anthony and i were hanging out the entire time we did hang out a lot actually yeah yeah um denver is a cohort of like pretty young individuals right so like it covered could have gone all the way through eat denver and everyone was like yeah i had a cold okay yeah i think it was like paris or something where it was like confirmed that it went around right yes it was cc yeah eat cc someone just did some effective shilling because i just bought this buffalo corn for a little fizz yeah nice oh buffalo is that's great i love it put a link in youtube chat i keep trying to teach you john paulers validator server but all he does is eject the drives and i'm like bro you can't be ejecting drives on my validating server but he loves to push the buttons hey kevin how is um so get coin grants round eight that starts in is that tomorrow or or okay yeah um that's right how's it looking in terms of funding like i didn't you have record um donations in whatever the last round round seven is it any anything that you can share about yeah people have pledged already or sure well first i'll just stick to the topic and say that i'm still trying to get my youth tube here to to sink uh i did not do the test net so shame shame on you working on that i've lost like point zero zero one eight so far from not we'll get you launched yeah yeah um chris lane is helping me on the prismatic discord um and kevin was helping me on discord as well so that's why i've been clients quiet um yeah dude we're um we're doing well for for funding um the i think we raised like 800k for around uh round seven and um so far a couple hundred k for for round eight and number go up in between now and then so i think that um we're looking in good shape to do my mark our goal is to do a one million dollar bitcoin grants round for for around eight and we have the matching funding so it's just a matter of whether the community rallies around the grants or not and so um and even with that we would have plenty of fresh pow it's what we call capital in colorado [Music] um in february so i think looking good from a fundraising standpoint and yeah the launch kicks off in december december 2nd which i guess is already tomorrow and then get and then the bitcoin public chess for public goods is on friday so if you guys that's right you can participate in the chess tournament you got to sign up oh that's cool i'll be there take me on yeah oh i will i know how hudson apes into every like trading test games poker games doesn't matter he's all in yep yeah pretty pretty much i'm not gonna like bet on poker unless it's on the side and only with bch so it doesn't matter that's great yeah we were uh we were playing poker the other night and uh i want a couple bch from from hudson so not full bch that'd be a little ridiculous some satoshi's worth of bch yeah yeah we after playing poker for like 30 minutes we all discovered that we realized that we're playing with like 10 to 15 cents bets [Laughter] i think i finally connected to piers so it just becomes a little bit stronger yeah i've been stressfully looking at my node to make sure it's still running but like i trust the lighthouse team but anything could go wrong so it's been running really smoothly so far same with nethermind after the recent update i had a lot of trouble with nethermine but it was really a configuration problem on my end with the way i set up my server so i fixed that and uh it's working really smooth now so i'd recommend nethermind i'd recommend lighthouse if you're wanting to stake and you know about command line interfaces and keeping a computer alive for two years or more very fun watching very fun watching my eth count up right now i will say that that's really the only like the best thing about mining is like you get to watch that you know it's it's really an eighth of a cent every time it ticks but right it's so fun to watch let's get kevin back up to 32. yeah i'm down by point zero zero zero four three now how will you ever recover well correct and so the good news is the network has only been up for an hour so in the next hour if you have good participation you should completely recover that yeah if you're a good boy kevin he'll get your eath back this is when we find out that kevin actually has 13 of the deposits and we got a 100 100 i want to i want to fire marine more more like i'm getting the fomo right now now that i know i can run a node i'm thinking about throwing more of my station now that it yeah this is how it starts selling the liquidity crisis we're going to see a big wave over the next two weeks i think of morning yeah yeah kevin what was the issue or what what did you what was the fix you found um i just put it into the discord chat that we're on um apparently some users were running nodes with genesis states derived before the main net release of prismatic labs update yeah this is what i get for not thinking about this until they did tweet they did tweet about that yeah well it's hard to keep up like lighthouse dropped a release last night and yeah um it's hard really yeah i guess that's kind of my you know the role of eastshakers to keep people up to date on these updates but it is really hard to keep up with yeah no chris chris talk me through it and and thank you to him for being really patient with me as i walk through a lot of aws security stuff um i also am now running a guest you've one node and no longer connecting to infuria so wow we need more client diversity on each one yeah kevin come on get with it man i am going to be that guy i'm off the stuff i'm off the hard stuff okay [Laughter] i'm just gonna be that guy sorry it's just geth like i know that they run a really good client and yeah well i'm the same i'm over here promoting client diversity and like i cannot get myself to get away from death like it is what i know so well i cannot get away from it i'm just ah i'm just using zap node with open ethereum it's pretty pretty straightforward i talk the talk and i walk the walk you never mind over here in the jameson household [Laughter] okay so kevin why is your tv leaking steam from the logo move your head why is your tv leaking steam is that where 13 percent of the network is not leaking putting on a virtual background you guys aren't supposed to talk about the steam the sustainable mystery check out this virtual background that i get pointed out to you it's got a heath logo that's the wrong spot for virgil it's gonna say it's like it should be like to the side you guys um the reason is that so uh hudson i live in colorado and we have really dry air here and um uh it's a humidifier i wish it was like a cool answer like like i had superpowers or something where did you get that crazy background you were just showing that that's that is epic ethereum background it's from bitcoin it's a place where you can get coins yeah i know i paid a designer so just like i was like here's some heath make some uh some of your outcomes that's so freaking cool this one's one of my favorite it's got like little guitar hero i have them all on my desktop i'll make a little quick zip pile and i'll send it to you oh my gosh thanks that that is so cool i love it we're talking about like the significance of eth2 and i'm just like man that background's so red give me some of that um i uh one other thing uh anthony was mentioning uh dap note for for anyone who's just getting started staking i i feel like i've just heard repeatedly from uh those who are less sophisticated that they're they love it so i i and i would put myself into that box in terms of like my knowledge is still pretty limited i don't have a validator set up but i'm thinking dap node might be an option for myself and i've actually uh been talking with the avato people too uh so dapnode and novato are similar styled solutions um i think they're they're both incredible offerings um both supported by bitcoin grants too back to get coins the thing i'm really looking for from those two providers is multi-client support um and so essentially what that means is if i'm staking with that note or evado i need to be able to easily switch from they run prison by default i need to be able to switch to any other client because there's not a lot of opportunity for home users for end users to recover if there's a fatal fault with prismatic somehow and as much as we don't want to think about it that is at some point a likely occurrence and what dapnode nevado really need to offer is the ability to say switch from prism to nimbus or switch to tekku or switch to lighthouse so that those users can quickly uh mitigate any kind of potential disaster when they do that i will sing their praises and champion them lighthouse has a fallback option now for eth1 nodes and that's what you're talking about right uh not exactly so um that would be like if gas or nether mine goes down then you can hit alchemy or infera i'm talking about one of the eth2 clients having discovering a protocol fault forking and missing out on the main chain and um right now if you're running dapnode or avata you're you're limited to prism which is fine there's a great chance prism will run fine for years but there's also a risk that prism will encounter a fault and it will take dapnode and avato a day let's say to get those back up and running when what end users really need to be able to do is an easy opportunity to switch to a different eth2 client with a click of a button and when they have that they'll be a far more robust solution so i basically i can mitigate i can move my keys to a different staking client if something goes wrong like if i'm running nimbus and nimbus encounters an error and it starts going on a fork and suddenly we've lost a big part of the network i can then take those keys and stake with tekku instead and suddenly i'm back in the network i need to have that opportunity with with pre-packaged solutions as well i think we'll get there i think it'll take a while so i've actually been kind of chatting a little about it and i think it's going to be sooner than later um i i would optimistically predict within a month or two that those options will exist that's probably overly optimistic but i do feel like they are finally beginning to hear that concern and push it well that's great is this is this you mean uh by they you mean well so can be honest or something i've been speaking with avato i have not had a lot of interaction with dap note even though i have tried the product and i like it um but i've had direct interactions with ovato and shared that my the biggest limiter for me to promoting their product is uh that i would need to see support for two chains um and uh they responded that that's something that they'll move up their priority list um and so i felt confident that that they heard that concern i hope to change the rapper eventually endorses aetherium as the one true chain so you're gonna get a yeah i'll get like a branded staking box like dan helt yeah yeah we still have i think akon's been to some conferences and he's a rapper isn't the tradition that two months after that uh ethereum will be declared a security and a lot of people go to jail isn't that how that works [Laughter] sorry did i see dan held video of him wearing a bitcoin shirt with the with the moon as the background the guy just looks like more and more of a jester every single day i took sorry i took the one dan related comment for the entire stream you're going to have oh we hit the cap there that's fair one is plenty is there a question about him in the live stream no no no we hit we hit the cap we're moving on we should probably shut the stream down now has been live for over an hour now yeah we're already talking about nonsense like all right guys so yeah i mean what's we're just bullshitting now um like what what should we be expecting next uh what are the big things we've already hit debates on crypto twitter all week all week that's that's what happens next yes meanwhile e2 keeps on chugging along just fine i'm going to pay particular attention to to the validator queue just we have our um uh determined activation time and i just want to kind of see that continue to go forward that's a really healthy metric for the network as well yeah i think right now that's a week out so if you try to deposit now you got to wait till december 8th as of now to even get in as a validator and i yeah i expect that to keep growing i think now that things look to be going smoothly i look forward to rapid updates on ethub that i can look at read and share with friends who are interested in staking nice show thank you don't forget to like and subscribe i'm just a licensed embodied eat staker what more do you want from me the first scheduled fork is in five months um and so right now the network is in a bit of a safety mode where uh penalties are reduced while the bugs and kinks that are likely will be worked out and so it'll be interesting to see in five months uh how far the network has progressed um i kind of feel like we'll be seeing the high 90s participation up to that point but don't forget people who are offline aren't going to be ejected anytime anytime soon like you could be online for a year and still leaking funds so um if someone deposited and forgot that they submitted a 32 ether deposit um and just never intend to go online they will continually be um shows a non-active proposal for a very long time yeah you can only get down to 16 ether right they don't take all of it that's yeah that's right um aside from a coordinated a very severe coordinated attack against the network um so if if i today get slashed my slashing is likely to be um less than one ether and that would be something like running two validators in this in different locations and i would be slashed but if there were a coordinated attack where someone commanded 10 000 validators to act maliciously in that case they could actually be slashed their entire hold but if you're just leaking if you're just like not online validating you're going to lose like a nickel a day um and eventually after a quite a long period you'll be ejected with 30 with 16 ether remaining that makes sense yeah oh man or does anyone know if there is a place to see the validator queue yes there is i'll put it in the um youtube chat you think cool perfect all right guys well i think i'm gonna bounce getting a little tired over here he did thanks for the invite power nap perhaps it's time to write good times yeah i might follow suit all right i think i think i think the stream is ending thanks everyone for watching and attending congratulations congratulations congrats thanks everyone thanks for joining us there's a correct order of operations just shutting this thing down just you and me david and we're still live should we should we keep going just kidding we're keeping it going
