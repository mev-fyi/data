can't you know the fully diluted valuation of Aptos right now at 18.6 billion dollars did you further know the fully diluted valuation of coinbase is 12 billion who the hell is buying this this is a 6X from January 8th it's going real it is an empty blockchain there's nothing going on there if you do that math of total locked value divided by fully diluted valuation that means Aptos is 53x more in terms of its value in the market than ethereum I'm having trouble understanding why I'm not one to be so foolish to short anything in crypto but you just manage that really an enticing short
