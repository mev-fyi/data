it's very difficult for me to paint a picture that doesn't involve a lot more time spent online a lot more time organizing social behavior in digital spaces and having a digital form of money that's decentralized and easily accessible to a lot of people is going to be a precondition to enabling a lot of those future worlds welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys this is a canonical bankless episode all right we're going to talk about moneyness in the digital age what does that mean money-ness what is the nature of money a few things to take away from this episode with Brendan Malone from Paradigm number one what is money has it changed at all in the digital age and what's more why are people even asking this question why are they questioning this thing called money number two we discuss the hierarchy of money and the moneyness Spectrum and what that means number three where do crypto assets sit on the money in a spectrum eth Bitcoin stable coins how much moneyness do they have and how are these assets different than digital dollars in a bank account and number four we summarize what all of this means for crypto investing and for the broader World David why was this episode significant to you everyone I think starts their crypto Journey asking themselves the question what is money like that's how you know you're at this start the top of the crypto Rabbit Hole uh and that's also where this industry started Bitcoin uh redefining what money could be and the people that saw Bitcoin as money when it was like 2011 2012 really early you know front ran the opportunity and this is this is the story of crypto everyone goes down the crypto Rabbit Hole understanding that you know money says it's just a meme it's a shelling point it's a social construct and then they go down the crypto Rabbit Hole from there and now we are in year 2023 and all of a sudden more people other than the crypto industry are starting to ask the question hey what really is money and there are a bunch of current events that really have thrown the idea of what's a dollar into question uh covid uh the Silicon Valley banking crisis uh Russia and the D platforming of an entire country from the dollar network has posed some very interesting seeing unique questions as to what is money what is a dollar and can money be something else other than the dollar these are all questions that I think crypto people have been asking themselves for a very long time in our exploration to make our crypto assets into crypto monies now this question has penetrated beyond the crypto sphere and so we are revisiting this conversation uh like I said like like Ryan said a canonical conversation uh about just something that's very very deep in the crypto space yeah I think sometimes we forget how just that if you innovate if you change the nature of money if you create a better money system that's the only use case that crypto needs to be worth trillions and trillions of dollars like that is big enough when it comes to impact uh in the world that is certainly the foundation of crypto in fact David I think we started talking about moneyness on our second episode at bank list it was literally episode number two so David I'm excited to talk to you more about this episode during the debrief I got lots of thoughts for you including I want to talk about more detail

Paradigm Brendan actually worked in the belly of the beast at the Federal Reserve he also focused on policy issues there as it relates to the crypto space and we are here to talk about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts I think a subject that really kick-started the bankless podcast and that is the subject of money and money-ness uh so excited to get to that with Brendan today uh how are you doing Brandon welcome backless I'm I'm good thanks guys uh I'm just wondering am I the first Fiat Defector that you've had on here oh we've had plenty of theater actors I don't know how um in fact we're all defectors of Fiat aren't we after a matter of fashion well Brendan how would you define d Fiat Defector we've had a lot of flavors of Fiat defection what was yours maybe you're the most effector of them all yeah yeah no no that I mean that's a a great uh question to kick things off so uh I I should confess I am not uh a Fiat minimalist I guess as as you might say um you know do believe in the kind of value of Fiat in the overall Mosaic of items and instruments that we call Money uh but do increasingly think that we're in a period of intense change a time where it's really worth asking deep questions about what is money uh how might money look in the future and how can we think about better orienting our systems of social organization around a type of money that works for the digital age that we live in today yeah maybe we could start there Brennan because I think David and I are hoping this could be sort of a canonical episode for people um when they um because we're talking about some basic questions here um most people I would say maybe 98 of people out there particularly those in mainstream outside of crypto they don't even think about money I I used to be one of those people went through my entire life before crypto not really thinking about the instrument of money it was something I took for granted without fully understanding what it actually is maybe we could start there Brendan what is money yeah so I mean first off the your experience really resonates with me uh there's a famous David Foster Wallace uh quote from a speech he gave uh where he tells a story of two fish that are swimming around and old fish swims by and says how's the water boy and one of the two fish uh looks at the other one and says what's water and the purpose of the illustration is is meant to just signify that some of the most obvious important truths that are around us every single day are the hardest ones to see and I think the kind of experience that most people have with money and how people relate to money is most likely I think the best and most resonant example of of this type of thing uh money has evolved over time and we've come to know of it as pieces of paper and as entries in our bank account but qualitatively those are two very different things and something that in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank and a few of the other bank failures that happened earlier this year people are starting to wake up to and they're starting to ask deep probing questions about whether or not the assumptions that they had backing their belief in the money that they use were really things that were Ironclad and sturdy and kind of all future incarnations of the world I think what I like about that metaphor the most is that it implies that when you are noticing the water something's up and I think like when we talk about money when we talk about money-ness it's because something's going wrong you're actually not supposed to talk about money it's supposed to just work it's supposed to be in the background it's supposed to be invisible so so Brendan maybe perhaps as a road map to this conversation why is this question of moneyness arising in the first place because this is a this is a question that the crypto industry is built on but this is a question that we are seeing tradfi start to ask especially in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank but really even so the the whole banking crime this wasn't even the first it started with covid and then Ukraine versus Russia and then also Silicon Valley so I'm wondering like what about 2023 makes this question of moneyness so relevant yeah you hit the nail in the head I think there's a few trend lines that have been percolating for a while with uh significant geopolitical changes China Russia uh covet being another one technological change which I'm sure we'll we'll chat about a little bit later and uh I think on top of that just the crisis in the banking sector which it has been uh a bit of a like punctuation point on 10 plus years of Federal Reserve monetary policy that led to a lot of cheap money floating throughout the system and at the beginning of this year after 10 months or so of interest rate hikes uh I think we kind of finally saw the effect of loose monetary policy for for 10 plus years in the crash of an institution that was due to liability mismatch and like overall insolvency of the liabilities that it issues uh in the form of money which are ostensibly supposed to be a a safe claim on assets that that institution holds and a lot of the kind of money system that we've grown up experiencing and learning about is really built on this system of claims or credit based claims that institutions give that we hold and that we use believing that at some point in the future we'll be able to redeem those claims for something that is more like money so that it starts to unpack the actual definition of money and maybe we can start there again like first we have the current events of 2023 but we also need to ground those in this idea of money-ness in the first place right money money from first principles so so maybe we can start there you talked about claims on things that are money but then you know it's a little bit self-referential of a definition how do we actually start the conversation of like money-ness and how Society uh defines what money is yeah for sure I think uh as as kind of like a a priming Point uh I think about money and money systems as being in a state of equilibrium and there are complex systems with a lot of legal technical psychological uh structures that build them up uh and so there's a lot of ways using that frame to triangulate different definitions or different meanings of money one way that people kind of commonly frame money is as what it does a means a payment a store of value and a unit of account I think those are kind of aspirational and and one lens to think about money and what might constitute money I think the other side that I uh typically ground my thinking in is this spectrum or hierarchy of different instruments that you can rank in an ordinal manner where at the bottom of the spectrum are it effectively just promises or ious and as you move up the Spectrum the ious are exchangeable for things that people believe are like the the final means of settling a transaction or any obligation that they might have so inherently in this kind of notion of a spectrum and the notion that at the top of the spectrum there are instruments that people will accept for the discharge of obligations is a need to kind of understand that where you are sitting relatively on the Spectrum determines whether or not you will accept something as money or or a final means of settlement so the way that we see this play out in practice is that most people will accept Bank deposits as money or a final means of settlement if you look at by contrast at the kind of national level how Sovereign nations are settling International Trade balances they don't typically accept uh Bank deposits or Commercial Bank money as that form of money they'll look to something more like reserves or a higher order form of money in the past this was gold and in the future it could be something like Bitcoin or uh ethereum okay so uh let's talk about this because I think this is actually I would say an essential mental model for anyone on the the crypto journey and on the bank list journey I would say this idea that Bren is talking about of a spectrum of moneyness okay so you first established when whenever someone asks you kind of what's the definition of maniness you hear this sort of this three-term kind of definition unit of account meaning of exchange and a store of value right and so that's one way to define it I think Brennan is absolutely right though this other way to define it as a spectrum of how money something a money can be how much moneyness a given instrument actually has is maybe a more practical more useful way to define what money is and so if you imagine the Spectrum and we're looking at it um on screen right now the spectrum of of moneyness where you have kind of at the top something that is uh maximally money it is a means of final settlement that is the most money type of instrument you have at the at the bottom of the spectrum something that is more like credit and credit of course is a promise to pay whereas um you know something that has more moneyness is a means of final settlement so it has stronger settlement guarantees the more money-ness uh and a given instrument has and so we've seen it at various stages like in the 1900s Brennan has this depiction in his article um gold was kind of one of the most probably the most worldwide money-ness instruments it had the highest degree of moneyness whereas a Central Bank Reserves it was kind of somewhere in the middle you have Bank deposits uh more at the bottom now of course we're in the the world of the 2020s and that has changed gold is still up there it has still strong moneyness but most Central Bank Fiat deposits like most money is actually settled using a central bank type reserves and they are a higher moneyness instrument than Bank deposits so the money in your Wells Fargo account or Securities and so you often see nation states kind of using the instrument to settle with each other that occupies the most moneyness at a given period of of History it's interesting to me Brendan that kind of the like this can fluctuate right like the moneyness of a given instrument there's one point at time um where you know silver might have had a far higher degree of moneyness than than even something like gold and it sort of depends on the society and all of these things um but this is a useful framing of of where we are today and that is again the water that most of us swim in but we don't actually see that's all around us and it's to David's point we only start to notice and ask these questions when something's kind of wrong with the water right so that's why we're we're asking these these questions today so in the 2000s that we occupy now what what's kind of the the spectrum of instruments when it comes to to money-ness like how would something like gold rank how would something like oil rank how is something like t-bills rank how would something like the Juan uh or the Euro or some other instrument rank in this moneyness spectrum yeah I think it depends a little bit on and the perspective of the the person or thing or uh entity trying to to do the ranking um it's a good question though I mean I think gold t-bills have both experienced some interesting changes over the past uh five to ten years or so so I think even quite recently there's been an uptick in the uh gold Holdings of several Sovereign nations in particular the Nations that are not aligned with the US and the broader G20 so uh you could like potentially interpret this as a set of concerns that they might have about their ability to use the US dollar either via official reserves held at the New York fed or via fixed income securities government bonds uh as like potentially being live uh potentially being unusable in the future as a means of final settlement for them uh which is sort of what happened to Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine so um like conceivably there's kind of a point at which some of these different instruments that have been historically used might come back into the fold and some that have been used increasingly over the years might reseed a little bit so it's basically a matter of so Russia or let's say China or something that is less U.S a country that is less U.S aligned they look at something like the dollar maybe and they see an erosion of settlement assurances when the U.S treasury apparatus can simply freeze Russian Holdings and Russian bank accounts right and so then they migrate to a money with higher moneyness which according your definition Brendan just means stronger final settlement assurances and of course the US you know Janet Yellen and company cannot freeze go gold anyways as long as Russia actually owns sort of the the physical gold it cannot be frozen so therefore it has stronger settlement assurances so that's very interesting how different um money instruments can lose their financial their their settlement assurances and thereby lose some aspect of their moneyness over time yeah for sure I mean there's kind of uh uh like a theory in the international role of the dollar space around the the stealth erosion of dollar dominance and there's a lot of contributing factors to that one of them uh of course is the increase in the use of economic sanctions as the primary tool of statecraft and I think U.S policymakers are in a difficult position because the international role of the dollar is incredibly valuable to the United States at the same time using that that power uh and and you know effectively not letting the dollar be credibly neutral has an undercutting effect at the I guess in the demand sense of the ability or want of people in Nations to to hold dollars I think the Russia Ukraine incident was probably the the biggest shifting point over the past five to ten years but there were other uh moments earlier where the US has gone down this path that has caused people to kind of question whether or not the dollar is uh that guaranteed International settlement currency that it it was uh you know for a long time prior human's historically throughout history we like discover money we discover like uses and and things that can be money and then sometimes it's imparted upon us right like the dollar and humans like even inside of the United States where like you have to use the dollar we also will discover that that's actually the best use of money or else we go to jail like that still counts as discovering it uh we discover that the dollar is still the best thing to use and over time like that always that Discovery process can always shift uh so like like you said right in the in the modern age we have some misaligned countries that have deemed that the dollar is not the best assurances of their wealth because of the ability for the United States dollar Network the Federal Reserve the government to cut off Russia and other countries right and so when you open up that door you allow other countries who are maybe less misaligned than Russia to still see that possibility and that's one that's one half of the equation that is really important to Define is like the actual politicization and settlement insurances of money and I think this also goes back all the way back into we can start this conversation at like a World War II post World War II the United States had all the gold and dollars had backed by gold written on them and then we rugged that in 1971 and so that settlement Assurance uh decayed and for the whole world and that like lasted for a while like even though it was not backed by gold since 1971 it still took time for that to like seep into the world but that's only one half of the equation is like the settlement assurance that a dollar is a dollar the other half of the equation is again similarly when we defaulted on the gold window we said these are no longer backed by dollars we also did something else that I also want to talk about which is we started to lose the assurance that a dollar is a dollar that one dollar is worth one dollar so not only do we have the equation of some countries are going to be cut off from the money network and lose their settlement assurances that their dollars are actually anything but then there's the other half of the equation of inflation and devaluation of a dollar that a dollar is actually not one dollar at least it won't be in the future so Bren can you kind of put these two pieces together they the actual settlement assurances of a dollar and also the value assurances of a dollar and how these all relate in the Modern Age yeah and I mean I think you can even uh like trace the erosion of the gold standard to to kind of earlier events like the Bretton Woods agreement which basically kind of said that uh currencies have to be redeemable into other currencies that are backed by gold so it intermediated the Redemption promise of uh regular Fiat currencies that are not the dollar so that the dollar could stay on the gold standard and as long as other currencies were redeemable for dollars dollars could be redeemable for gold and you had uh inner position of the dollar in the money-ness Spectrum uh before 1971 and everything just kind of blew up I think the other question you asked is sort of what is the value of a dollar and and kind of is that really worth anything uh today our dollars physical cash uh is redeemable for it's basically a claim on the balance sheet of the Fed so a dollar gets you a claim on an equivalent amount of the asset side of the fed's balance sheet well what's on the asset side of the fence balance sheet as you said in 1971 we uh changed from the gold standard when a dollar was a claim on a pile of gold into a system where a dollar is now a claim on a pile of Treasury bonds so it's a claim effectively on the future ability of the United States to collect more dollars from people as they pay taxes uh and uh like uh other sources essentially it's like a debt instrument of the US economy like exactly your faith in kind of the US economy exactly my favorite meme is um dollars backed by aircraft carriers and so there's the like kind of USD full node carrier Fleet um image that I think is in some ways uh a little bit accurate here because what you have is a claim on this pool of government debt if you believe that that pool of government debt is worth something uh then you can talk yourself into believing that the money has value and the way the system currently works is you can kind of always create more of those liabilities in the form of money as long as you have the ability to create more of the assets which are government securities and over the past uh I think 20 years or so the amount of outstanding U.S government debt that is I guess in some ways backing all of this money has ballooned and I mean we saw just a few weeks ago there are questions about whether all of it will be paid and and whether some of that money uh will be redeemable in the future in practice no one tries to redeem their dollars for government securities there's no like window at the FED where you could walk up to and ask for the the equivalent amount of government debt but uh conceptually that's how it's supposed to work yeah that's the part that I actually have a really hard time wrapping my head around so like when we have with dollars backed by gold it was very simple and obvious what the money was like if I want gold I go to the Federal Reserve and I give them one dollar and I get one dollars worth of gold whatever whatever it's backed by and that is just clear as day and then when we remove from the gold standard and we go back to buy debt which is denominated in dollars and the government collects dollars to pay the debts which are it seems very self-referential and which is like both the kind of the point but also the demise can you just help help me and the listeners understand that like self referentiality of a dollar like why is that in what ways is that a feature and what in what ways is that a bug yeah I mean it's a feature in the sense that uh it gives policy makers tools for uh controlling the amount of outstanding currency in circulation which has implications for the prices of goods employment and a host of other things that the FED thinks about when it implements monetary policy uh in like prior regimes when money was backed by hard assets like gold it was impossible to flexibly or elastically control the amount of money in circulation in order to try to hit other Target it's like price targets or employment targets like try to do a stimulus check if it's all gold and you're the exact government ain't gonna happen unless you find a lot of gold right right um you know and so you could like think about scenarios and I think this is like effectively what happened where inflows of gold would uh would come to the United States be somewhat uh unexpected or uncontrollable and they would result in subsequent expansions of credit in the United States and and changes in economic conditions and so the transition to this more self-referential system that's backed by government securities comes with a degree of flexibility that ostensibly lets policy makers more finely tune the amount of credit in an economy in order to get better economic conditions for everyday people um of course that you know at some point there are are downside effects of of all of that I think um it's your earlier question to David I think Brendan's definition of of money-ness as a means of final settlement sort of explains both um the idea like so final settlement to me means both that no third party can kind of freeze the account or or censor or prevent it and also that a third party can't debase it and so the purchasing power doesn't isn't affected materially by a third party and um so that's why I think in times where money money instruments like the dollar are going through the basement or um censorship or freezing and they start to lose their credible neutrality and they start to be more political we revert to money that is farther up the money-ness spectrum that is more credibly neutral and I by we I mean different nation states because because Brennan you also make the point that's why I sort of think the money in this spectrum almost explains everything like it just explains so much like if you are a nation state you certainly um can't trust Other Nation States if you're engaging in statecraft or you have to be selective as far as what your alliances are specifically as we move from a you know us dominated unipolar world to a multi like a bilateral world where we have multiple large Powers you sort of you can't put all of your trust eggs in that basket and so at the nation state level you have different needs with respect to moneyness then you might at the individual level right so like a transaction uh Brendan between you and I right like you don't need to give me gold nuggets like I'll just give you dollars right that's at the individual level and that kind of works because we exist in a similar economy and we use a similar unit of exchange but at the nation-state level things get much different and um this the Spectrum as well starts to explain almost a um I think a two schools of thought that people have about money which is like the Austrian School of thought the money is a commodity it's based on a barter system that's how it sort of arose and kind of like this low trust environment and the David Graber um kind of you know debt credit theory of money that that money is sort of a social system well both are kind of represented in the money in a spectrum right and in times of of low trust you sort of revert up to more of the commodity money that requires a lot less stress trust it's not a credit type instrument it's sort of like a gold or like an ether or like a a Bitcoin right um and then in times of higher trust then you can go down the Spectrum more towards credit forms of money and credit of course is um a promise to pay it it it's layered so at the bottom of credit there is that final settlement settlement of something either the dollar or gold or some other instrument but in higher trust context you can actually get down to credit and actually credit's not a bad thing I think that's what maybe the the Austrian School of thought don't um appreciate or like credit can be a good thing it's a way to scale Society so long as you have trust but when you have corruption and that starts to overload the trust of the instrument well then credit can turn sort of bad and then people naturally revert up the chain of moneyness to that means of final settlement to kind of closer to the bare metal um I'm wondering if you could uh you know reflect on on some of that um you know how much is explained by this money in a spectrum am I am I reading too much into it yeah I mean I like personally think I kind of believe that uh it it's good for us to have both sides of the spectrum and uh as long as you believe that states are a kind of useful way to organize society and have people doing things working for the common good uh you know I think there's probably going to be the existence of some credit based official Monies at the same time like having other higher order forms of money available and free to use for when there is more uncertainty or more ambiguity as just one very specific use case but also as a a check on uh you know Democratic use of power and authority I think you know in a lot of ways the idea of the dollar is credibly neutral reflects American values around freedom and and self-sovereignty and the less the dollar kind of behaves that way uh there's some Downstream effects for just the nature of the the country the United States and in sort of whether or not it it's operating in a way that's kind of aligned with the founding principles and I think to the extent that like higher order forms of money are more closely aligned to some of those principles of kind of censorship resistance freedom from authoritarianism uh having a set of instruments that are available for people to use as uh better forms of digital commodity money is is a good thing I also think it it's kind of to sort of go to your point about uh contrasting individuals and nation states I almost think about this in terms of concentric circles where even from the perspective of a single nation state that might be the largest Circle in a series of concentric circles whether or not you believe in certain principles of money is going to depend on what your reference point is to the smaller circles within so if you imagine the United States occupying like the largest ring uh you can think of like Iran occupying the next ring and you can think of an individual person in Iran representing the the smallest Circle in this set of three circles for the United States it's going to want to have some ability of to control what the Iranian state does as kind of geopolitical grand strategy and the use of money as a means of economic statecraft at the same time it's going to want to have more free censorship resistant money for Iranian people who might be trying to look for ways to uh engage in just normal behavior and avoid a regime that the United States might not be aligned with so even from the perspective of like a nation state like the US how it might think about money and promoting different types of money is going to be different depending on who the the person is uh kind of at the end of this this set of circles I really appreciate the the trust model for money um back when we had back when we used gold it was in a society in a world uh in a phase of of humanity where we just had less credit and trust and I think when try when credit is high on the money-ness Spectrum it's actually indicative of a high trust environment like that's actually like the kpi that we are going for that's like that's what what we want although I do see that once you get to a high credit when environment a high trust environment it's also dubious because then you will allow for distrustful people to enter into a trusted space and kind of ruin it for the rest of us but but I I see like at gold as actually in the background and some sort of credit as money is actually the place where the most economic activity is happening and it's only when uh something like gold needs to arise as the only form as the dominant form of money is is because we are in a distrustful environment uh there's something like very holy about having gold in your hand there's that Meme that like possession is nine tenths of the law and then also uh since gold is gold like it the economic security of gold is is written in explosions of stars like you're not going to be able to reproduce that like you can reproduce a dollar and so like that is the most trustless form of money in your hand possible like gold in your hand is the most trustless high assurances form of money that exists but it's also not what we want to have a society based around right because we want trust we want trust and we want as much trust as possible and so Brendan I'm hoping we can move forward into the Modern Age of 2020 because since since covid there has been not so many great um things happening to the trust around the dollar starting with covid and then we have Russia and China and then Silicon Valley Bank in that order so so far the 2020s has been a bad year for the dollar um so maybe we can unpack like the the story of the dollar this decade and and how it's kind of lost its position in the world um or maybe currently losing its position in the world and then we can go into the world of crypto money after that yeah like overall there's just been an erosion of State capacity in general where I mean in the 60s and 70s the place you wanted to go if you were the top engineer graduating from Caltech was to like a US Government lab or to NASA and I think there's just been a broader shift in public trust and the value that the public places on public institutions and so like one narrative here is just I think around the experience that most people have had with monetary policy and uh the current posture of the FED which is to basically be a par Maxi buy everything when there's a crisis and uh deal with bigger systemic issues that might be affecting the system as a whole uh as something for a later day so for uh Silicon Valley Bank and like the kind of entire system that we have I think there was a presumption that people could trust that Banks were not engaging in Risky Business and Bank Regulators were there to make sure that if they were consumers were protected and when svb went down individual users were made whole kind of system was uh dealt with in a way that uh LED people to not lose significant amounts of money but a lot of people I think are are you know rightfully asking the questions whether we should have been able to get to that place in the first place and and you know do we need to have a system that relies on emergency actions uh to make people whole instead of one that is architected so that those emergency actions are never necessary in the first place and when you have uh and kind of going back to our sort of previous thread on uh low trust environments making a stronger case for higher order forms of money when you have a low trust environment and uh primary monetary instruments are a promise for an institution like a bank and you have relatively little ability as an individual to verify that those promises are credible uh there's just an overall scenario that creates a lot of complications for individual people and when you kind of light a torch and get rid of the entire uh uh foundational belief that lets everyone like kind of willfully ignore the fact that a commercial bank deposit is credit to a bank and credit exposure for an individual to a bank uh you know you start really opening their eyes and and uh getting to the the point where you can ask some really interesting questions about the future of money and if there's a way to better design a system that is inherently lower in its Baseline requirement for trust I think the conversation of the bank failures that we saw recently in 2023 the the four banks that that went under there's a good conversation to be had about like okay the safety of our money system in our banks um but but the other half of the conversation is the federal reserve's reaction to it or the FDIC specifically's reaction to it where all of a sudden like Banks uh M2 the monetary Supply uh money goes into the banks and then the banks 10 exit and like lend it out as credit and then some banks uh irresponsible ones go under and then the FDIC insured every single dollar that was ever uh deposited into that bank which really warps distorts what actually money actually is if these Banks which all with all of their loans and all their credit lens uh gets covered one to one it really distorts how people think about their Banks and so Brenda maybe we could definitely it though guys like so I'm I'm what's interesting is I I feel like what the FDIC did is actually they said oh yeah that credit money that you know s svb dollar that you thought that that you thought you had okay we're actually going to change that to a higher order of money where it's basically FDI insured svb dollars and so if you have your money in in Silicon Valley Bank you're you're happy about that so didn't the FDIC essentially do its job like so what are you saying the implications are there David like aren't they there to make sure that Silicon Valley Bank um dollar holders have their money restored and did they accomplish that task by saying hey it's actually we'll give you better settlement assurances like they're there to preserve the settlement assurances I think of um you know Savers in their bank account basically so yeah they they distorted the nature of money by turning credit into money like pure Alchemy they snap their fingers Jesus turns water into wine and the Federal Reserves turns credit into money right uh and and so like use individuals that have that that credit owed to them are happy yes but the broader system is like yo that you just turned not my money into into more money and so the system is distorted as a whole right Brendan the fundamental question is like is it because you know this is not uh like a clearly choreographed and uh firmly legally enshrined policy change to like overnight turn the broader set of Commercial Bank money into effectively government-backed central bank money uh it was done as emergency action for a small bank but it does sort of beg the question would this apply to every Bank are we in a system where we have like sort of Schrodinger's uh central bank money where all of the money in your Commercial Bank is simultaneously a liability of that Commercial Bank but in some effect guaranteed implicitly by the government and if that's the case isn't this what biology was worried about where like every all of the credit that was issued by Banks they're all all the banks are going to fail and that credit is going to be with the snap of the fingers of the Federal Reserve turned into money isn't that more or less what biology was saying with his whole Bitcoin to a million uh meme yeah yeah I think that that's kind of the core premise and there's like a question of whether you were to like sort of overnight narrow Bank the entire banking system uh if you could do that and ensure that all of the commercial Banks stayed narrow banked so they weren't able to go like further uh in a fractionalized way off of that kind of initial expansion of harder money then conceivably the kind of like hyper inflation uh effects wouldn't necessarily really happen that way but it is I think easier to conceptualize his argument as just one of sort of what sorts of emergent phenomena are possible as we think about a pretty fundamental change to the nature of money Banking and the role of the State uh overnight or or over the weekend but I feel like that's what that's totally what the government basically said is your dollars are backed it doesn't matter how much you have an account in any Bank in the U.S they didn't write it you know in it's not legal right they didn't kind of craft a bill pass this through legislation but it is part of the social contract now and by making that part of the social contract they prevented a wider spread Bank Run bank failure right but like implicitly all M2 this is Money commercial uh deposited money just became the kind of like Federal reserve-based money didn't it I feel like that's what happened so if that that's what everyone thinks I mean that's why I'm I didn't rush out to like pull all of my money from Wells Fargo and like you know turn it into crypto um I just do that more slowly um but like I I didn't do that overnight because I was Wells Fargo man yeah exactly and by the way Wells Fargo is one of those Banks which is also on the you know top 10 too big to fill um you know bankless you know so that makes me feel uh nice and secure but like that that does beg the question is like what's the downside of this isn't this what the FDIC isn't this what you know kind of the treasuring the FED is this what they're supposed to do is in times of stress they're supposed to restore confidence and uh yeah that credit money is is essentially um you know has stronger settlement assurances and will come in and make it so are there are there bad effects to this David you were talking about systemic effects to this are there um dangers of doing this or is this what they should be doing in the first place yeah I mean this is the big uh like meta debate among fed Watchers now uh Gina smalik from The New York Times just wrote a book called Limitless about the fed's increasing role over the past 15 years as a crisis fighter so like sort of traditionally think of the FED as being responsible for uh monetary conditions in the form of employment and prices but there's also you know an argument that the the fed and and the kind of broader crisis fighting apparatus in the United States is really best suited for dealing with liquidity problems dealing with problems where people have uh assets that are effectively credit and they need cash today and the place that's kind of best suited to deliver the high order form of government-backed money whenever it's needed is the central bank and they can take illiquid kind of more credit based assets turn them into Cash day and break the the system not in the um the the kind of sense that it's broken but arrest kind of any further uh Spirals and saw this with kovid where one of the first things the the FED did uh in 2020 was roll out a bunch of facilities that just accepted assets and gave cash um and you know that there's a longer debate that we'll probably have over like multiple Decades of whether or not dealing with short-term pain in the form of crises is worth the longer term effects of creating a system where losses aren't deeply internalized by the actors that incur them you know sometimes those are actors that are doing like bad or or Reckless things but other times that those are just individual people and we've collectively and socially made a decision that it's better uh to not have to deal with the effects of of crises but we've also kind of blown out the the discipline side side of the equation this is very interesting this idea of like these socialized losses right because I found myself personally it's like when a depositor deposits their money into a bank account should um they uh be undertaking the risk of Bank management basically and I feel like myself personally I'm much more comfortable with um that loss being socialized then with like Equity holder Bank Equity holders getting a bailout right and socializing that loss right and that's just me personally other people might feel different and there might be some underlying systemic um moral hazards that occur as a result of this maybe it is a better system if we all have to like think very carefully before we put our money in a bank account as to the management and a trustworthiness of this particular bank account but when you broaden that and you look outside of the U.S and you think about the us being a the global Reserve currency where um you know other countries essentially store their wealth in the dollar and you think about those countries uh taking the socialized losses of the United States economy and the mistakes that that we're making that becomes pretty unpalatable right and so like I would not be I would not want to be in a position where I am a different nation state with my own kind of you know sovereignty and I am responsible for the mistakes of um the fiscal policy of the US government or for like you know bailing out um the generation of of baby boomers maybe uh for instance or whatever you know political decision the US makes right and so that starts to arose erode The credibility of of the dollar for other nation states so this idea of socializing losses is is very interesting and I think that is effectively what when you have the reserve uh currency you can sort of socialize the losses or the or the mistakes that your country is making to the rest of the world as long as they are holding those dollars that's kind of the game that that maybe the US is playing and other countries other nation states can effectively opt out of that game at any point in time by what by purchasing non-us based assets maybe that's what they're are starting to do yeah I mean they're I think there are uh there's a lot of theories on on this right now and and like a lot of questions whether large nation states are aping into crypto and I don't know that we have uh like good evidence that that's happening but there's there's certainly uh like directionally some anecdotal evidence that uh some countries are thinking more critically about their dollar exposure for a variety of these reasons learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask

so there's a line in your article that stood out to me Brendan that says maybe it's time to replace credit worthiness with collateral worthiness and I'm wondering if you just unpacked that statement and overall just juxtapose this digital Financial system that is being built uh versus the entrenched Fiat system which kind of seems to be a little shaky yeah I mean you know that uh that line in particular is a a bit of a cheeky reference to like a few writers uh who've like written more publicly about the nature of money-ness in the financial Plumbing context um you know and and kind of in in the context of Shadow Banking and broader activities that really large institutions and countries are doing in the the space of uh of money markets and uh the original reference is referring to a an article written by Nathan tankus looking at the situation that happened with credit Swiss and uh you know kind of effectively the one of the like sort of big problems in money markets is that you have a lot of large institutions that end up holding Securities like uh government securities or uh mortgage-backed Securities and at different points in time particularly in times of Crisis they need to figure out whether those promises to pay are uh like actually worth something and measuring the economic value of some of these credit based instruments is very difficult in normal times it's incredibly difficult in in times of Crisis how do you figure out what uh mortgage-backed security is worth you can't just like walk out on the street and kind of ask someone to buy your mortgage-backed security especially when an entire Market might be on fire and full of dysfunction and so there's uh like a kind of I think point at which you can make a very strong case that having assets that are not ious or promises that are uh tradable and kind of readily priceable is incredibly valuable and I think you have that with with crypto which you can hold uh you know like in a self-custody manner free of of credit risk or credit exposure to an institution and uh you can also like readily price it so you get some of the same kind of benefits of moving up uh the money-ness spectrum that you would going from cash or something else to Gold but you don't have to deal with some of the more like kind of cumbersome uh features that that come with something like gold can we talk about the moneyness Spectrum as it applies to the digital age and I'm wondering if maybe we can we can pull up the same chart we've been using the Spectrum and now um talk about some of the various uh digital instruments but let's um let's first start by saying it it is probably increasingly obvious which almost goes without saying to everyone that is listening to this that um Humanity has squarely entered the digital age okay like um this is the internet age our financial instruments aren't going to manifest physically and while we have things like nuggets of gold and you know gold bars these are sort of vestiges of the past as is you know cash money right um right when I was growing up at a paper route you know we got paid in kind of you know Cash Cash Money basically door-to-door and I'd have to come collecting every weekend this is a thing of the past that this is a thing that is is quite uh quaint um by today's standards and we are no longer going to have um where there's a phasing out process of actual cash a physical bills so we have entered the digital age and uh in the digital age when we have these digital instruments there's a spectrum of moneyness for each type of instrument so I it's very interesting by the way last week um Gary Gensler came out and said we already have digital money there's no need for crypto we are it's it's called digital dollars in your bank account right I want to say but Gary the those digital dollars in my bank account do not have the same settlement assurances as some of my crypto assets do so let's look at this chart and apply kind of the the digital money to it uh at the one end of the spectrum on the credit side of the spectrum we have Bank deposits that's the digital dollars that Gary Gensler is talking about and we already have digital money right um that is very far on the the credit side of the moneyness spectrum a little bit to the left of that we have stable coins in your chart here a little bit to the left of that we have reserves that have more moneyness and all the way to on the money in a spectrum we have assets like Bitcoin and ether that are not credit they are almost like gold in these uh economic systems they have the strongest settlement assurances Brandon I'm wondering if you could kind of comment on the Spectrum here and why you place these Assets in these various locations yeah I first started thinking about this when I they joined the FED in I think it was 2016. and this is like a very different time when the entire U.S government was a lot more open to engaging with crypto companies and one of the first projects I worked on when I started was a bit of an industry stock take and um in some ways a little bit of crystal ball gazing we we set out to meet with as many companies as we could and crypto companies you're talking about crypto companies um and hypothesize what the emergence of blockchains meant for payment clearing and settlement systems and our remit was to try to think about how to make the payment system and the the broader set of financial infrastructures used for transferring assets safer and more efficient and some of that was a kind of constant in the moment game of looking at the current landscape and then there was also a a set of projects related to kind of thinking more deeply about what the feature evolution of our financial architecture looks like and what that means for some of the things that we we kind of care about and I think the kind of first round of Industry Outreach reach we did we met with probably 30 or so companies and talked to them about the projects that they were working on in the crypto and blockchain space and almost everyone at the time said the exact same thing which was that they needed a native form of money a native dollar effectively that they could integrate with these systems in order to settle transactions and make payments and for me that was a bridge into this broader notion that a lot of the systems that we have for transferring value and exchanging things of value require a form of money inherent to them that let you make payments and exchange obligations and as you look like kind of low down on the money-ness Spectrum to things like Bank deposits these are very digital obviously but they're also very narrowly constrained so they are it fundamentally a promise of the bank but also exists mostly on a narrow set of databases that the bank runs they don't have a lot of like functional use for a broad set of applications that you can imagine being the case for uh other financial instruments and this was really the like first foray that I had into thinking kind of more deeply about what the digital age looks like what kind of use cases are going to be coming about and emerging from this wave of innovation and what types of monetary instruments might be useful to have in an emerging digital ecosystem and and what might those look like stable coins really became the I think like first most prominent one um largely because I think they're the easy way to get something that is functionally similar to a central bank digital currency without dealing with any of the thorny questions about uh you know like cbdc that um has created a like very particular landscape and political economy that is supercharged and and full of a lot of interesting and and heated debates but um fundamentally if we're going to be spending more of our time in digital environments engaging with open Digital ecosystems we need forms of money that are native to those environments and that can function seamlessly in them without needing to rely on third parties to gatekeep or approve entry and exit to them going back to the current events of the 2020s decade again covid Russia Silicon Valley bank failures inflation et cetera uh what what Tailwinds are the big Tailwinds that you see for the crypto monies the Bitcoins and the in the ethers out there or all the other aspiring crypto monies why is now why is this decade the right decade for crypto Monies to emerge like what void are the are we filling here yeah I mean it depends on the like specific uh cryptocurrency and questions I you know I think the um maybe just crypto assets as an archetype not any specific one yeah yeah I mean I think having a a digitally native form of money that is censorship resistant is a super powerful use case going to be increasingly so so I think the like transactional ability on a like payment side is one um I think having an asset that is like durable that is Supply controlled uh is another one which gets at the question of whether a dollar is always worth a dollar um like we know that one Bitcoin is always worth the Bitcoin and that is mathematically true and and will always be true and you can like sort of think about fluctuations against the dollar but that is like a separate set of uh consider in a separate set of use cases going another step further I think there's just the platform angle which is that when you have assets that are built on top of platforms that allow for a lot of different potential uses and use cases you have what like functions almost like a digital form of oil that can be the uh necessary commodity to kind of Grease the wheels of a ton of possible use cases I also wrote in my piece a little bit about the potential for AI agents that are going out and conducting things for us on the internet needing to have access to a digital form of money that is native to the environment that that they uh they live in and I I haven't seen any um specific implementations of this yet but it you know it I would feel a lot more comfortable giving an llm trained on my own personal data access to a wallet with a fixed amount of crypto in it rather than just giving it kind of like carte blanche access to my bank account and everything else yeah it's interesting as we just as we unpack like the definition of money-ness um I think we all everyone understands the inevitability of AI uh coming down the pipeline and all of a sudden like ai's get an opinion too they don't need to even be like sentient or conscious this isn't even a conversation about that it's just about it being economic agents in the world of Finance which money suits them better well first of all you know they're going to prefer digital right the ultimate uh uh like hedge against AI existential risk is like the their ultimate aversion to physical cash and gold like at some point when they they get rid of all of us we'll just have to like exit to the the paper and gold where we back to Cath yeah yeah we'll be using gold as a form of moneyness that the AI overlords can't censor us from using I I think it just illustrates really really well there's two forces moving us towards digital money and digital Finance there's the gaping hole that the current Fiat system is creating um for Like For Better or Worse choices by the money managers of the world um and we've already talked about that again like covid inflation Silicon Valley Bank Russia the politicization of the dollar the decay of the dollar all that stuff like that all of that Trad world is creating demand for digital Finance New World money and then there's also just other Innovations out there other Frontier technologies that are producing new new use cases that specifically only crypto monies can can truly enable or or just can enable far better than than our old system um and so I I it's just a nice way to frame this conversation as like man it just feels so inevitable I mean that's what I feel do you feel the inevitability Brendan yeah for sure I mean I I if you look at the like average time spent in front of a screen uh over the past 10 years it's like always gone up every year people are increasingly spending more and more time online uh like we we knocked the word metaverse as like being a little cringe sometimes but the fact that Boomers and and other people like so quickly were able to hear the word metaverse understand what it meant and then like start making jokes about it tells me that there was a deep uh like unsatiated latent demand for having a way to talk about this idea of like digital worlds that people are going to be living in uh there was like immediate product Market fit of the term metaverse like the day it started becoming popular and whether or not people like truly believe that it's going to be a thing uh then we admit it's almost let me just say it's almost like gold and Fiat kind of had a baby because remember this point we were making earlier about um you said Brendan the dollar is you know your favorite meme of the dollar is it the settlement assurances it's backed by aircraft carriers right and you see that kind of like and the aircraft carriers are obviously backed by American taxpayers which are backed by um the US economy right so the aircraft carriers are just power projection of the US economy is one way of thinking well an asset like ether is kind of like power projection of the ethereum economy and its blocks based sales essentially right it's so it and and the way ethereum sort of taxes everyone in the ethereum economy is through transaction fees and in the future probably Mev ordering type fees so it's almost like it's not Fiat in terms of of Supply but it is backed by an economy isn't it like I almost not a nation-state economy but like a blockchain decentralized economy and its power will scale so long as economic activity increases and the economy of ethereum uh continues to increase so it's it's almost a little bit like not like Fiat I hate to say that somebody's gonna you know take this quote out of context and say Ryan just said ethereum is Fiat but um there is something that parallels kind of the nation-state right uh and yeah I'm wondering if maybe I'm like what what would you say to that kind of uh analog that I just laid out is there something similar here and for me that's actually bullish I don't know what you guys would say but uh yeah grab onto something for me here yeah I mean like one of the reasons why the US is I've kind of seen as a symbol of economic growth and Innovation is all of these preconditions that the nation has enabled that allows other things to be built on top of it so it's things like a legal system it's a highly educated Workforce it's uh you know like technology investment all of these things create like a platform which is a country on which things can be built and the more things that are built there the more clustering and agglomeration effects you have which make it even more valuable to build feature stuff and I do think at some point l1's like there's kind of a parallel to the the nation state at the L1 level where like kind of having uh a platform that enables the creation of uh rules and other use cases and generates Network effects is kind of a helpful frame for for thinking about the future growth and there there's also the kind of like cross cross country or across L1 comparison where you can like sort of think about the purchasing purchasing power parity uh of ethereum versus another L1 where like what you can do and how you can transact on the the network is in some ways uh like a function of what it costs to to do that from a block space perspective which is uh like a relative price compared to to another Network so like transacting on uh like something like Solano which might be like incredibly cheap is uh you know on some level comparable to the idea that like different countries have cheaper labor costs or cheaper manufacturing costs and there's like kind of opportunities to are across those for for different use cases I really like the idea of like the hybridization of the Fiat and hard money worlds in the world of of crypto and it just kind of fits the pattern of Technology convert converging different components into the same system so we have like the the triple point asset thesis about ether it's a commodity it is a security and it is a uh hold on what's my own actually don't say security I would restate that yes big time uh commodity Capital assets and and um commodity Capital asset in store Value Store Value Store Value Store value yeah security that's a great way to put that um like ether the triple point asset thesis it's a commodity and a capital asset and a store of value right and so to me it's not just like we're not compromising like hey we have Fiat properties and hard money properties it's actually we have the best of nation state economics and then we also have the best of hard money Austrian economics so so we have the strengths of both you have the strength of the ethereum economy and the assurances of gold of Supply changes of algorithmic monetary policy uh and so like to me the the hybridization that you're talking about Ryan is actually bullish just because it seems such like a logical conclusion of where money and finance goes yeah I totally agree and I think I think the the mental model and of course you know bankless is um just trying to understand the asset space we've been on a quest to try to understand what is this what is this crypto thing but the best mental model um I I've seen and I subscribe to for understanding at least layer ones Bitcoin ether salon and all of these things is like it's like investing in an emerging economy that's kind of what you're doing right uh the monetary asset and almost the stock market of an emerging economy that's sort of what we're doing here and I hope bankless listener you understood the lesson of what money actually is here money there is a spectrum of moneyness all the way on one of the spectrum is is credit a promise to pay that is kind of weak and it's a form of moneyness and on the other side of the spectrum the maximally money type of instruments are a means of final settlement so I hope you bring that lens with you when you're evaluating crypto and evaluating all of the digital money instruments that are about to hit us in the 20 2020s and Beyond Brendan thank you so much for joining us today this has been very helpful thanks guys bankless listeners we will leave you with one action item which is read Brendan's fantastic article it's called moneyness in the digital age we'll include a link in the show notes for you to access that as always rest and disclaimers gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you [Music]
