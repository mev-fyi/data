what's the opinion of gensler's administration by your fellow Regulators I have been arguing with Gary Gensler publicly and privately for two years now since he took this job my central problem is to say Mr chairman you have repeatedly stated that virtually every token is a security I don't happen to agree with that but given your assertion you owe it to us to lay out publicly a very clear way in which people who want to comply with the law and regulation can do so it's different in crypto and my big criticism of chairman Gensler is he has never laid out that Clarity and the problem with this uncertainty that hangs over just about everyone who's developing a protocol is they don't know whether it's going to be a knock at their door from the SEC about what they've done and so the SEC has created the incentive for people to go offshore
