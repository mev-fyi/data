how many months of winter did SBF set us back I think it's probably several years I'm asking specifically what SPF you think added to the crypto winter yeah yeah several Edition oh added several years yeah yeah he'll be the most recognizable crypto face to a lot of politicians regulators and he went and blatantly lied to their face if you think about the amount of people who will have lost money there the amount of builders that will have treasuries there how many projects are secretly dead now because they've lost everything and we don't know yet how many industry participants will have had a relationship with Alameda and FTX that their business is now significantly worn down but not gonna affect that all these people lose their jobs so trust is down like actual progress in the industry is moved backwards so I think it's well probably smaller industry-wide impact than Mount gox much worse timing and probably much worse knock-on effects
