one of the cool things about the moment of in time that we're in is that we're all going to be able to reinvent ourselves as we step into the digital world 50 years ago if things just went south for you in one city you could move to another city and have a clean slate and so the virtual world in many ways gives us that opportunity to try on different identities to just be playful and to have that ready player one moment where you can create a space that you decorate in whatever way you want with things that you have an affinity for to show up however you want looking like yourself looking like your aspirational self looking like a dragon whatever and so avatar is meant to give people that ability to come in and to build yourself piece by piece into whoever you want to be and to have this really fun game like level up mechanic where you can level up based on things you do in the real world based on things you're doing in the in-game world and by doing that hopefully gamify important things in your life as well as purely entertaining things
