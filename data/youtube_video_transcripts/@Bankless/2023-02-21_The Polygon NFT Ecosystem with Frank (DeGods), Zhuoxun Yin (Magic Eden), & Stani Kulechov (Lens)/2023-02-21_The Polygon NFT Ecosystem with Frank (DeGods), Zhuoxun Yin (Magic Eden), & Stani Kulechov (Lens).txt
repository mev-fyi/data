welcome to say the nation guys we've got a special episode for you talking about the polygon nft ecosystem okay our panelists today tell us that this is the third largest ecosystem for nfts in crypto and one worth paying attention to David who do we have on what are we going to cover today first and foremost we got Frank D Gods from the D Gods project which is an nft projects Bond on Solana currently migrating to polygon so we will talk about some of those decisions and why they decided to move over to polygon in this day and age uh and then second we got Z the co-founder and CEO of magic Eden which is an nft Marketplace also on Solana and recently migrated to polygon so we'll and we have two perspectives like this last up we got stani kulikov who is the founder and CEO of the Ave companies which is bootstrapping lens a social media ecosystem on top of polygon where your profile is an nft your content is an nft loss of surface area for nfts and so just to recap the project we got D Gods which is a pfp nft project that is in process of migrating to polygon we have magic Eden which is an nft Marketplace that is also recently migrated to polygon and then we got lens which is a social media platform where your profiles in nft all the content that you make as an nft your Trend your interactions or transactions on polygon and so we're going to ask all of these uh participants on the polygon ecosystem why polygon what about polygon brought them there what about polygon is is unique and different is polygon really the third largest nft ecosystem after Solana so these are some of my questions what do you want to know in this in this interview Ryan yeah I think I have those same questions and particularly for these two projects um let's remember magic Eden and D Gods both migrated they're the massive projects in Solana huge successes and they are migrating and moving to a polygon I shouldn't say full migration because they're continuing to support Solana but at least the digods youth project is doing a full migration over to polygons the question is why is there something are there greener pastures over the polygon side what are the cultural differences between these projects that's a big topic today as well one disclosure before we get in I am in advisor on the polygon project I have material exposure to the Matic token David is not an advisor but he also owns somatic and polygon has also been a sponsor of the bankless podcast in the past we take disclosure seriously at bank list we think everyone in crypto should and so that's why

on polygon show in the top left corner we got Frank D Gods from the D Gods project which is an nft project recently migrated to polygon uh well it seems like d-gods might be his last name it's not but it might as well be frank welcome to the show yo yo super excited and then in the bottom left corner we got Z the co-founder and COO of magic Eden an nft Marketplace also on polygon Z welcome to the show yo what's up fellas thanks for having me and last but definitely not least in the top right corner we got stani kulikov founder and CEO of the Ave companies which is bootstrapping lens a social media ecosystem on top of polygon stani welcome back to bank list for like the fifth or sixth time however time the number of times it's been it's good to see you again Sony gmgm happy to be back again so we really want to take this opportunity to really explore why your guys's projects chose polygon how has that experience been what is the nft ecosystem like on polygon and really just get a snapshot a flavor of the polygon nft ecosystem so we'll start with that that very basic question why polygon and we'll go in the order that I introduce you guys in so Frank we'll start with you why did why did the D Gods project choose polygon of all of all chains to pick I I think that there's like a clear traction with the consumers on polygon and so it's something that we're just excited about being an nft project I always and I might be more controversial in this take but I just look at all the blockchains as different databases with uh you know different trade-offs and so for an nft project right like being associated with a lot of really cool Brands a lot of really smart Builders um that just excited us and I'm sure I'll get more into details there but at a high level like keep it simple stupid like it's a kind of a no-brainer in 2023 to be launching on polygon and we're going to take a moment to dive into each of your guys's respective projects and the details behind each one of these but uh Frank and Z from D gods and and Magic Eden previously were both projects on Solana uh and so we have some diverse perspectives to bring to this conversation uh Frank when did D Gods come to polygon yeah so to clarify D gods are going to mainnet eat we have two projects uh Utes is our second project and that's the one that's going to polygon so we have announced that we're migrating in q1 so we're looking at around end of q1 for the actual migration and you know working on some pretty cool Tech to to do it in a unique way that hasn't been done before um so yeah and like around end of q1 is what we're looking at beautiful beautiful actual migration yeah and z uh question to you and Magic Eden when when was it decided that magic Eden would uh onboard Salon excuse me the polygon Network and and why polygon of all chains yeah yeah for sure um Frank I was expecting some spicier takes from you to kick off man come on oh I'll get into it I'm learning you know you keep it simple lure them in and then we started giving the hard-hitting controversial takes yeah we'll uh we'll warm up um yeah as everyone knows we started on Solana we we actually launched a polygon in December and the thesis for us is really around two things one is that we can we can uh we want to serve the gaming ecosystem really really well and um clearly which we can get into as well it's it's not like a one chain rules them all from a gaming standpoint it's clearly there's some fragmentation uh uh across the ecosystems and there's some some good Traction in terms of uh what three native games but also like traditional game studios that have been been working with polygon then the second thing is obviously you know an nft Community needs a lot of different things one is you need some really crypto native what three native creators like amazing ones like Frank you also need experimentation from uh Brands you know influences whoever else that's in that ecosystem and that there's clearly some movement and traction that polygon is making around trying to sign up a lot of those guys and I think that us being a very very Community Centric and and Grassroots uh nft platform um we saw a pretty cool opportunity to work with like many many sides of the market and that's what got us excited to go to polygon in December so we launched then we've been doing a lot um a lot of like uh a lot of our Focus has been on Launchpad and obviously our Marketplace which is sort of tied in together it's like we help launch projects and then they also are available for trading on Magic Eden and we have like a massive March coming up in the theme of General March Madness for those of you that are in the US we have I think like 17 launches lined up in in March so it's going to be a huge a huge one so we're working with guys like like Frank and the D God team and there's many others in the ecosystem that I think are feeling pretty bullish and um yeah we're pumped it's a fun place honestly it's it's very different vibe which we can get into as well some of the differences that we've noticed between some of the different nft ecosystems yeah that's definitely a line of questioning that I have is what is the specific culture that has arisen on polygon but before we get there we gotta of course talk to tostani Sonny I'm sure that you're connected to all of the layer twos in the space and so I'm sure every single layer two would have loved to have hosted lens uh what about the architecture or design choices or relationships with the polygon team made the polygon Network specifically the right Network for for lens can you talk about that for a little bit yeah definitely I I mean um we've we started to build uh originally on the um ethereum community and and we we feel that we're kind of like a heavily part of uh that community and that's also where uh polygon has its roots as well so very early upon um uh polygon was the network where you know a lot of the uh bandwidth from ethereum was was actually happening um specifically uh polymon had uh The Gaming Community very early so that was um happening before the nft boom so there's sort of NFD activity before we saw the uh nft summer uh and and obviously something that is very valuable for uh a social player like uh lenses that you know you you're able to do a lot of transactioning um and one is that the way uh polygon is constructed today uh it allows that um capacity to transact on the lower transactioning uh cost uh but more importantly what what is valuable is that uh the team and the ecosystem has this kind of like a bigger vision of how actually the scalability will happen um and and you can go beyond what what is the limits of today that that polygon um has and also I like the the uh the blue color my first car was uh uh blue color so you know that's something that tries attention as well for me wait isn't polygon purple for me it's kind of like a uh like very dark blue it's uh definitely purple it's definitely purple maybe maybe your first car was purple too though so that's like uh yeah yeah yeah but yeah what's the difference clip back flip that purple what's the cooler version of Blue anyway um yeah well guys guys I I have kind of a follow-up question and and see yours is enticing it's just like let the spice flow a little bit here so so maybe we'll uh unleash the spice flow Gates here so um both both you Frank and Uzi uh migrated from or not fully migrated you're still on Solana but um also chose to expand into polygon is kind of uh the next chain could you guys do a quick compare and contrast for us um you know crypto is so like tribal about things and so um people are are mad no matter what chain you you choose right so if you stand in Salon you're gonna piss off people if you move to something else you're gonna piss off you're always going to make people mad that's what you know happens in crypto um but you guys have both been in the belly of the Beast now in both of these ecosystems in both these communities I'm sure you have identified strengths and weaknesses differences across the two let's start with you Frank so what's the difference between Solana and and polygon from a culture perspective like what are some of the things that you've noticed yeah definitely getting into the spicier stuff now so I mean for me I'm still like a huge fan of Solana and I think that uh I think in the long term Solana's gonna find its core killer gaps and like obviously magic Eden was the biggest killer Dap You Know thus far so far on on uh Solana but there's gonna be more defy Etc I think that when I think about it at a very high level it's just the difference between like evm and non-evm chains and I think like what you see there's a lot of Entourage effects with being on an evm chain that you know be grow growing up and building our project on Solano we just never got that benefit um so I think that that's the core difference I'll say this like where the polygon ecosystem feels today is just a lot less built out honestly than where Solana is at because Solana has been forced to just like rebuild everything that existed on eat in terms of a lot of infrastructure from the early days and there was a lot of opportunity in the early days to like launch something like you know magic Eden obviously came out of nowhere and has become one of the biggest marketplaces in the world even with d-gods when we first launched you know there wasn't like a lot of Solana nft activity and now it's a vibrant ecosystem so I think the biggest trade-offs at a high level are just polygon feels a lot earlier today in terms of the community and uh culture side of the pfp the ecosystem where Solana's definitely gotten its own brand and I think oncelona projects focus more around utility more around like Builders has definitely been been the main narrative where are they on eat that's more branded culture and I think that's just where we honestly fit in more towards and I think yeah it's just that's where I would start off with so I think before you before you go so um why did you guys decide to move again so I remember at the at the time there were stories like this kind of breaking the polygon paid youths collection three million dollars to leave Solana I don't know if that's true is it kind of like a a you know money type play is that is that part of it or I I didn't really follow this when it came out but can you give us some context yeah let's do it um so the best way to put it is I think at the time when we made the announcement of migrating the gods and Utes combined were doing which is our two collections we're doing about uh 40 to 50 of all the trading volume on Solana like for nfts generally and right now the market cap of like the gods and Utes is almost bigger than the rest of the Solana nft ecosystem like combined and so we were just hitting a little bit and this has been hotly debated uh on Twitter but I I think a lot of people including myself believe we were hitting a little bit of a ceiling on Solana in terms of growth where I mean even right now on Solana D Gods is by market cap I think the number four biggest uh pfp project in the world uh that's come either on eth or soul and so we just thought we were we felt a little bit like we were capped and we were big experimenters and we're like uh our one of our core models with the community is it's f-i-w-b which stands for it we ball um and so you know it was one of these things where we were getting offers honestly from a lot of chains post FTX uh to migrate there wasn't like a single blockchain that didn't send us something or was it wasn't interested in like Utes in our potential migration polygon was definitely not the largest number that we were offered but again like that's not the core reasoning behind the decision there's a lot of Entourage effects and a lot of you know brand Equity that polygon has spent a lot of time working hard to build and uh that's what the ultimate decision maker was but I'm all about transparency and so I think we're like the first team to actually like announce like yeah this is how much we got in our grant I didn't really care at the time I still don't care people know the behind the scenes or the financials behind it but the honest answer was every blockchain was offering us something yeah so give us that inside baseball so is that you guys have a super popular nft collection yeah that's really what happens is other chains want to go compete for for you to deploying their their platform their ecosystem this is pretty common it sounds like yeah and I'm like obviously biased where I think it's a the deal of it like lifetime honestly for polygon and I think it would have been a great deal for anyone because I think it's really hard to get a like an initial spark of a strong community be like really strong IP that's crypto native to launch on your chain like I think every chain is pretty good with getting like big web 2 Brands to a certain degree obviously polygons crushing son has had some big deals avax BMB they've all like BMV had Cristiano Ronaldo so I think the harder thing is to actually get crypto native projects that are much more in line with what the community is looking for today as opposed to future you know too future looking and so yeah I think that that's definitely the inside baseball there is that there's a lot of those conversations that happen uh constantly and I think the thing that people be surprised on is I do believe we are one of the biggest if not the biggest official like polygon Grant and people have this perception that polygons out here are strictly pay to play the reality is and whether people like it or not polygon has gotten so many Brands under their umbrella now their pitch is actually really easy and they're not shelling out a lot of money because if you're like a big web tube brand do you want to go on another chain or do you want to go on the chain that meta Nike you know all these other massive brands are already on it makes their pitch a lot easier and so yeah like that's this is one thing that everyone even competitors kind of you know say about polygon is their business development just absolutely crushes it and so I guess this can be thought of as a marketing business development expense but what's your take on the same question Z so give us a contrast between Solana and polygon yeah so the first thing I'll say uh I'll make sure like more macro points one macro Point number one I think is that this kind of thing like what Frank is talking about and what do you gots did this will become much more normalized over a period of time and so it takes obviously some some guts and some balls to do it as transparently as they did so I think that you know credit where credit is is due there right so you're talking about that it's to attract projects is common is it good or just even just like whether it's grads or some other incentive or even no incentives just to move and do things on different chains that's hard that's like objectively just like a hard thing to do so it's not a not the easy path actually I think it's easier to actually stay on Solana just be the King right that's the easy path um so that's like the first point I think um this will become more normalized over time and I think it's cool to see and it's funny because I was sort of laughing earlier about the us being in the the belly of the belly of the Beast like I feel like Frank and us there's no one else that has been in that more than than us over the last like six to six to nine months um the second macro point I was gonna make was that um the a lot of the really interesting things to point out about the salon ecosystem today is is that it reminds me a lot actually of of 2018 on eth so as you guys know I was a dydx at the time I was you know a second employee at dydx massively into the D5 ecosystem and at the time it was like a really bad year for me created a there was a tribalism that created that was really really good for the ecosystem it was actually amazing for it and long term that was one of the best things that happened I really feel like that's happening and has happened in the last three four months after all of the really negative events that happened on Solana so the thing the statements around like being long-term really bullish on soul but also wanting to do things on different chains in the short term those two things can definitely coexist and we absolutely feel that way like you know we've done over three billion dollars in in trading volume on Magic eat and on Solana right and we still have a big stable of creators that are wanting to launch things all the time on Solana so that's that's like not going to go away but it's kind of to France point it's like there's a separate set of opportunities that uh polygon is trying to make themselves known for and whether that's Brands whether that's whatever whatever they invest a lot of time and effort being a BD engine to sign those deals and ultimately the bet that they're trying to make it's it's almost like a different go to market as a chain the bet they're trying to make is that they want all these Brands to coexist and then eventually that ecosystem becomes rich enough that rich not in the monetary sense but Rich from a cultural sense that everyone wants to do some  together and that's a bet whether that actually plays out we don't know yet but that's the bet that I think you know Frank is making the bet that we make in terms of we want to have a play there too um and as a Marketplace the role that we have is more being the connector of all those dots right so if there is a brand that wants to do something they should do it with magic Eden because we can help them get connected with someone that's web3 native that knows how to be successful in this space or vice versa right if a web 3 native brand wants to do something with a big traditional brand that can also happen through a lot of the connections that we have and the dots that we can connect so um I feel like culturally that's just a just accept it'll set the scene a little bit for everyone in terms of like day to day uh sort of things that are interesting that we've noticed because a lot of obviously has more of a trading culture I would say like yeah really I mean the roots of it more yeah like a d-gen culture would you say Vegan trading culture for sure oh hardcore hardcore hardcore because the fees are so low right and so what happens is there's the spread of like a few dollars it's like a meme right like people undercut by 10 cents 15 cents because you can and uh so it just makes it a much more yeah like people are just down to speculate and talk about these projects all the time I think the other thing that's really great about Solana is it's a very and you guys will appreciate this because I I'm definitely more on the content creation I'm really passionate about content creation I I believe a lot of the value in crypto especially nfts literally just come from Twitter and like Discord and like if you think about it what would these collections be valued today if there was no Twitter if there was no Discord probably closer to zero than anything and so Solana has had a very strong content creator uh ecosystem that is actually like really hard to bootstrap and one of the biggest challenges polygon has you know going forward where we have this thing called DJ news where this guy is just like live tweeting like reality shows style tweets about stuff that's beefed between random Solana nft influencers and you know people can follow a few accounts and be constantly spewed 24 7 content around specifically what's happening on Solana and I think obviously each nfts have this certain parts of beef I have this but it's pretty rare to see across crypto where it's a self-sustainable like The Tick Tock of like you know of crypto is it like just moves faster attracts this kind of gender yeah I will say I definitely think it moves as faster like all the stuff that we're seeing now with like open scene blur yeah Matt that played out three months ago yeah we've seen this movie yeah interesting it was almost five five months ago yeah how did it play out in Solana attention sure [Laughter] I'm obviously like I'm so I'm 23 right now I'm like definitely a Zoomer and that's what also attracted us to Solana early days is just it's just that the bar is so high for no reason like like everyone's spending like five dollars ten dollars on a myth or whatever but their bar is as if this thing is like you know the next coming of Jesus and so that just makes it a very Cutthroat like intense environment where if you're not delivering something on a day-to-day basis if you're not showing up every day you were just like getting lost in this overall content like Whirlwind which is why honestly like we we locked in on doing like Twitter spaces because if there's what like ten thousand fifteen thousand daily active Traders on Solana or just an nfts broadly um and and we're doing Twitter spaces that are pulling 500 people a thousand people you know that's almost like three percent of the entire like ecosystem and so when you extrapolate that out to just all the different types of content that's being made it kind of like is nice the the whole meme of Solana early day especially is that you go to Solana for engagement because because it's so fast and everything is happening so quickly you have people that are way more engaged on a day-to-day basis way more engaged on every random GM post or every random thing that's happening and I honestly think that even it made that eat doesn't have this as much where you know you kind of wait for the big official announcements but you're not following a lot of these creators on the day-to-day which is where I think the puck is going by the way and this is why I think what Z said about Solana being early is very accurate because you look at the projects that nfts today that are popping off even on Main net youth you have Jack butcher obviously and you also like this other project kid called beast and a lot of these projects that are new that are actually outperforming the rest of the market are very clearly High engagement constantly things are happening Community is constantly engaged so this is where the puck is going because in a bear Market when everything is consolidating I think everyone has a hard time figuring out what's going to be relevant in the next year in the next two years a lot of the narratives that we saw in the bull market are just like collapsing in front of our eyes and so day-to-day engagement is becoming I think a lot more important of a metric with nfts because otherwise if you don't have that you're not going to be relevant and not being relevant means no bids no bids means the floor keeps going down the floor keeps going down and people get more angry and that is the debt cycle now in 2023 for a lot of a lot of projects this is a really interesting perspective and actually not the conversation I thought we'd be having uh so far into the show uh Frank and Z sends both of your projects now span both chains uh I want to get a little bit more dive into that perspective a little bit more the way that you guys are describing this uh and maybe this is my ethereum bias but it's like Solana is your bootstrapping ground as in you get tested on Solana you find user acquisition on Solana but as soon as you have meaningful adoption and sticking power you graduate to ethereum or at least one ethereum layer two perhaps like polygon and that seems to be what both uh Magic 8 in and D gods have done is that they bootstrapped on Solana and then with once they had sufficient uh Network effects and sufficient brand of the end of their its own right it found that it could actually also uh latch on to the ethereum ecosystem as well because it had grown to that size on polygon is that a fair description of like the trajectory yeah I can I can I can start I think that's probably a little too too much of a utilitarian kind of view for us we kind of think about it more like uh we want to serve it's like we're a product driven company so we want to serve different use cases and the use case that we obviously served on Solana and got became very successful as a result was really focused on like yes this sort of pfp use case a little bit of gaming but it's like High Velocity content like economy like I don't know how to really articulate it super super well but that's really what it feels like and I think just to tie a bow on the previous Point um I really do think that this is anecdotal but I really feel that actually the users on Salon are also younger than what we see on ebm and that that maybe also marries well with why some of those points that we are making around like attention speed all this kind of stuff Rings true um anyway that's just a typo on the previous point but the way we think about it is use cases so on when we think about going to polygon for example that was a very intentional thing like we knew that the nft ecosystem there was small like everyone knows that if you look at the data it's it's obvious right it's objectively much smaller than Solana and it's objectively not it doesn't have an organic um nft Creator sort of ecosystem yet but you go there because you believe that the way that they are putting the pieces together that there's something probably will end up happening there and that use case there is going to look a little bit different whether it's gaming just like you know for example of the 17 minutes that we're doing in March a bunch of those are actually free minutes and that's like a you know the free mid meta for gaming and even for nfts in general is starting to uh take forth a little bit more um and then the second thing I would say is that because of uh different technological gaps or reasons because of different needs that creators have of goals that they have they will decide where like they will they will have a view or they should have a view they will form a view on whether it makes sense to launch on which chain over time that will again become more normalized where it's like maybe I'll just do some on every chain or I will you know maybe marry to one I I don't know if we'll really at that point yet but because of that decision then as a Marketplace we obviously want to work and serve as many creators as possible right so if creators are basically making those choices then we want to absolutely be there to serve them and the products will will look different the vanilla like you know icon Marketplace that kind of thing that is not that's not the end State here I think a lot of these creators will need different things and we should build the things that serve them so that's sort of how we see it rather than like a uh graduation uh thing yeah that that's what I was thinking in what you guys are describing there Dave is like what they're describing is not so much a graduation but just like different sort of medium and culture it's sort of the way if we're thinking about in the content world the way we think of like uh try doing a long form two-hour podcast on Tick Tock with vitalik buterin right like that shit's not gonna work no no one cares what you have to do is like I don't know 30 seconds some sort of Highly mimetic you know vitalik dancing back and forth like Tick Tock style content and so you have to sort of adapt your project and what you're doing for kind of the culture and the network and what it rewards and you could probably repurpose like we can repurpose bankless content into like a tick tock form or a Twitter form it's the same message throughout it but the medium and the expression is it's much different from Network to network that was that's kind of an unlock from what I'm hearing from from Frank and Z about these different chains and and where they um where they um shine and it sounds like polygon is really shining in this ability to kind of bring together all of these like web to you Brands you know you have like Nike you have meta you have like you know Instagram there and it's just sort of this meeting place and that's what you guys are saying it's like oh these are the early blocks forming you can kind of see how this ecosystem will differentiate itself um something that I've noticed when I look at um the nft ecosystem and also kind of the um the activity that is happening on um across the lens applications because you see a lot of nfts being emitted in the the protocol itself but it's it's basically a distribution channel to to share um nft projects that um the users are interested in is that like you cannot see that all these brands that are on polygon day somehow create this uh symbiosis of um brand value to to that to the new brands as well so it's it it's actually quite interesting to see it it's kind of like looking into you know a um if you go to a street where you have a lot of designer Brands and your designer brand is next to some of these Brands it basically elevates so and that just like elevates but um it's really twice the value uh together so for me it makes quite a lot of sense is that uh if you want to capture that value getting all these different brands that are excited about the tree and also the projects that are very native and getting them into the same place that really is is something that creates some sort of uh uh new traction Tony since we're talking about multi-chain conversations uh was there ever any sort of analysis about um lens on something like arbitrum Nova uh I don't think arbitrum Nova was out by the time lens lens had come around but was really the for for Len specifically polygon the only game in town at the time of deployment yeah yeah so at that time even Layer Two so if an arbitrary of optimism burned uh there uh at that point and and when we're deploying on on the um test net already it was like layer twos were very early and even such is quite you know quite novel you know many of the later Tuesdays still they're pretty centralized you know there's one sequencer um the interesting part about something like Victory social is that uh you might need less less of the security that you will need in decentralized finance for example um but but at the same time like we had to choose something where uh you have a bit more of the scalability that uh you would have for example using ethereum um and the the way the protocol works is that um it has this exciting infrastructure that is on chain um and then an infrastructure that is off chain and and based on whatever you're building in web3 Social uh you're picking different kinds of pieces and the more heavily you're relying to um on the own chain transactions you're kind of like um you're bound by whatever is the security and a Blog space of a particular Network so collagen in that sense made made a lot of sense um but also kind of like the division that uh we're now in the in the situation where there's this uh proof of stake Network and um you have everyone pretty much main thing in the same place I mean we have a lot of issues at the moment because there's a lot of traction uh on lens and at the same time there might be something else happening on polygon from times that it can be like created entertainment thing happening but the bigger vision is that uh from there you actually go and scale into supernets and and you kind of have more dedicated bandwidth for uh your project so that is something that's going to be interesting uh to see down the line and actually the the lower transaction fee it's it's really affects into the audiences and how the actual audiences are built because you know if you mint nfts on um mainnet and that's where you know a lot of the activity happened during the nft summer and before that uh being able to Mint and even um transact you know that has a cost so being able to do that on a lower level um and having also this compatibility so pergan effectively it's not only about and a thief there's also gaming and you know avegachi is a big part of the uh polygon community and and being able to benefit with the whole infrastructure is very fascinating so I I think polygon is just like so progressed and and The Branding kind of like a play is it's like a the latest ad that that's been happening over the past years so so that's definitely something that is value add as well stani you just mentioned supernets I just want to get a quick definition from you on that what is a supernet I'm looking at a page here is this um on polygon yeah so supernet is um I could say it's a layer Tree in some ways so if you think about it that way so polygon is a proof of stake network uh with certain amount of uh validators and that validator amount uh uh reflects the cost that will be to operate on that Network and supernet is uh another Network on top of the uh Polo Network that you can have um for your project for example and you can use validators from the actual proof of stake Network and and have your own validators as well so that's the the kind of interesting part and when you have a supernet you can also decide that you can use a CK approver for example to prove actually your state of the supernet periodically on top of uh onto ethereum so like sometimes we're kind of like segregating quite a lot um you know what's happening in polygon ethereum but actually you you can use a lot of this infrastructure uh together and supernet is one of the examples where you can have more transactioning um on a supernet you can use the proof of stake validators of the actual uh polygon network but then you can take your supernet state um and and and deposit it to the ethereum periodically to have additional security so everything can be actually like combined in some some levels depending on what the use case you you have yeah this is a pretty similar to a lot of the the other narratives out of the layer two space like ZK Sync has their fractal scaling optimism has their super chain I didn't actually know that polygon was playing in this ecosystem but it kind of seems inevitable that all layer twos move into this design design case so that's what evacs is doing too right with uh their subnet with uh yeah the subnets subnets aren't it's not shared security the security parameters aren't the same no it's different but yes never mind um Sonya I got a I got a question for you about just the community that's arrived inside of lens specifically uh lens I kind of in my mind I picture as like its own kind of contained environment inside of polygon as in when you go to polygon to do lens stuff there's there's like a boundary around like the lens Community versus the rest of polygon just in the nature of lens is this big social organization and then and then you have to like the rest of polygon but I'm wondering if that's even the rest the right like perspective to even take here like what what is the lens community and how much does it overlap with the polygon community so for example like are there people talking about magic Eden or D Gods on lens and just like overall how what is the conversation like and how much polygon focal how much of a polygon focal point is there yeah so short answer is uh there's definitely a little uh talking discussion so what the data shows is that and how lens protocol was actually um uh initiated on on mainnet is that we started to list a lot of the uh nft communities endows and down members that could actually get a early access to meet their lens profiles and also developers and periodically whoever asked for a plans profile um and they they had that eagerness to test protocol we basically mean that uh them profiles so you have based on the data and that's the beautiful thing about pep3 is that all this data that is computable it's public right so you have a lot of people from from the ethereum community or um they're in in the polygon community and and they're participating in different kinds of nft activity D5 activity and and also uh Dao uh voting as well but there is also a lot of new addresses that just are excited about uh which we're building and you know they want to um use uh web 3 social deadline especially what is happening now in in the traditional uh social social media space uh the particular thing is that the users in lens uh they're pretty much talking about everything but like most of the conversations are actually around uh web tree so that might be different kinds of nft projects they might be sharing uh Magic Eden links or um uh their nfts uh and and people are talking about them or if they find something so it's kind of a way to discover things so you can obviously you can whenever you post on lens uh you can make that content actually as collectible as well and it will actually show in Magic Eden and the profiles are token as nfds as well and Magic heater has actually done a lot of great work of showing the the your latest uh profile picture in that inside of the nft which is very uh cool but effectively the way we see it is that with with lens you basically own your online profile and and the connections you make um and then that's basically your distribution channel to your audience so if I find something interesting I can basically share it on on lens and amplify uh my engagement for example if I have a and a theme happening somewhere or I want to share the nfts that I might have uh to to my audience and across the whole lens protocol so it's it's a kind of like an early community of of web3 native users and we're quite quite happy about it so we weren't actually targeting that you know lens is going to be something where everyone is going to migrate from Twitter uh and Instagram and it's going to be like the whole and creative solution of everything uh for uh like future of online presence in fact our goal is to basically just focus on uh how we get all the uh web3 projects and audiences into lens uh and use it as a base uh the pre-social layer and then as as the infrastructure scales uh we can actually open up for larger audiences so as we move into the the second half of the show I've asked each of you from each of the respective projects to bring some numbers and some metrics to really Flex about how awesome each respective project is uh because we because after that we want to talk about the future uh Stony hinted at some early stages of composability between lens and Magic Eden and I'm sure there's a bunch of other other projects that have more stitching together to do it as this polygon ecosystem expands but really I want to pick your guys's brains as to the Future state of polygon and what you guys see on the horizon there along with all these hot numbers that we're going to talk about right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you can go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide your uglies burn the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and bankless Nation we are back and we're going to start off the second half of this conversation talking about some metrics and some numbers uh and so right before I kind of blind signed it uh our guests here right before recording the show I asked each of our guests to to do some research on as to their own project the numbers and metrics to flex about the current health of their own ecosystem so Frank we're going to start with you D Gods well show us some of the numbers what are the best numbers that you can give us in terms of the Vitality of your community I don't have uh screen share stuff but I could share uh because I'm following this stuff all day so I think right now the Gods in terms of 10K Pro and nft projects is number four in the world right behind azuki and then crypto punks and then board Apes um and so yeah that's been pretty sick to see the growth there and uh doing that in terms of like volume or market cap like flower price kind of yeah for right you know the basic market cap I think is like two it's either average sale times uh total number and or uh floor price setting on both those metrics right now we're top five for sure and then use that uh like 130 mil marker cap wow for jpegs yeah for jpegs yeah that's exactly used to this by now Ryan yeah Oh no you're super proud and I think I've been very open from day one it's kind of one of the things that's rallied our community so for context for people that are new uh to D gods and Utes I remember when we first minted d-gods we were one of the more hyped projects on Solana but that followed a five-month period of everyone kind of  on us and labeling the gods a dead project and you know we were kind of like there was no trading volume super low like floor all this stuff and the whole time I was rallying the community and saying hey like we're figuring things out right now we're  around we're finding out and uh we're gonna try to become the number one project on Solana and at this time we were like number 100 or something like that and uh you know within the next two months the gods grew so quickly and we ended up becoming number one and have kind of held that spot for the last year plus now and so it's been like a big rallying cry for our community like we just want to shoot for the top and so we want to be the biggest nft projects in the world and everyone that's Indie gods and youths today knows that that's the goal and yeah it's been pretty incredible to watch that growth happen with d Gods Utes on the other hand I believe right now is in the top 10 for anything over a 10K Supply so there's 15 000 Utes and yeah I think the thought process here and this is coming back to the whole numbers and and the decision behind polygon specifically is hey like when we launched Utes we were already really big on Solana uh and and it's now the number two project on Solana right behind D gods and both of the market caps of those projects make up almost the rest of the salon Market combined and so we wanted to give Utes a chance to shine on its own and become like the quote unquote you know Top Dog of the its own ecosystem and so that's kind of the goal with the polygon and we just want to help other builders launch on on polygon outside of just Utes itself so that there can be a more vibrant ecosystem and that's how I think about the polygon if I'm being the most Degen person on this a panel right now and just being very real I just think that polygon is extremely early and everyone loves being really early in crypto because uh that means that there's a lot of opportunity and so when I think about the polygon ecosystem I think that there's a lot that they can learn steal and borrow from from all the good stuff that's happened over the last year and start to grow out that infrastructure really quickly and we just hope to be one of the main catalysts uh towards that happening and so yeah that's kind of where our projects are at right now you guys are you know if you're gonna be listening to this in 2024 or end of 2023 maybe our predictions have come through and the gods is a number one project in the world and uh YouTube is also very high up there so just uh I like to manifest it into reality uh people in the audience that are listening you heard it here first so if you just peaked a listener if that was the case uh what is the road map that they should be excited about with the Degas project and if that also piques them where would they go to to learn more yeah I think a lot of the stuff this is like a strategic thing and I'm pretty open about how we think strategically I think it just makes more sense to release a lot of information post-migration because like right now everyone is kind of just waiting for the migration which is happening around q1 uh and to q1 so why why like blow our load metaphorically early here uh and and to kind of like talk about it whenever there's gonna be a lot more attention on it around the migration and then use that to kind of catapult more of the excitement hyphen momentum oh that's just metaphorical uh yeah that definitely just metaphorical uh and that could mean a variety of things you know could mean a gun in a chamber obviously like that's what I was uh referring to so no I I I'm very also open about how important to me it is to build hype and excitement around projects because I think that that often gets a bad rap and I've been on the front lines saying like hey look people are mad that D Gods is doing so well people are mad that youtubing so well they're like oh what have you guys built and my I think you guys are just looking at the game of nfts wrong and one of my more famous tweets was I said you know nftm efforts always talking about utility and then it was like a picture of a infomercial purse that has like a touch screen on it and it's like got all these kind of utilities to them but it just looks super cheap compared to like a simple Louis Vuitton bag it's just like oh it's just a white background it's just a Louis Vuitton bag and it's like nftm members would probably pick the the purse with the touchscreen on it because they're not understanding that so much of this space is driven by you know what people value for themselves and so our job as nft projects is to make people proud to be a part of the community and so when I think about the gods and I think about Utes I think every holder is proud to be it he got older proud to be a you told her and that actually scales so much more than any nascent utility could possibly uh scale and you've seen this at the top layer with obviously the biggest projects in the space sport Apes uh you know crypto punks azuki and so yeah that's kind of our thesis as well and we just have a much more more degenerate like viral content tilt were we always talk about breaking the internet and so um for me when I think about the polygon move to wrap it all up in a bow uh I just think it gives us more vectors where we can go extremely viral and have everybody in the ecosystem talking about us uh constantly and that's the game plan is just build a lot of content and do things that make our holders proud of being in the community and watch the results of that turning the conversation to Z and Magic eat and Z what are the numbers or metrics that you look at in order to understand the vitality and health of the the magic Eden ecosystem and what are those numbers Yeah official I just want to say though on the yeah probably like a lot of memories when you pop out that video on on the D God's website just like paper hands text feels like a long time ago unbelievable it's crazy crazy it's crazy bro it's crazy uh okay so imagine stuff there's a few stats that I think are pretty interesting one is um we recently did a bunch of analysis around our creator business so as everyone knows like we spend a lot of our time thinking about how to make products and services and experiences that help creators either get started with nfts or make them more successful once they once they decide to launch something um that's sort of grounded all of that decision making around How We Do discovery on Magic Eden so you'll see like the carousels you'll see like announcements those are announcements that creators can make directly on Magic Eden so you can see that that's why I'm like really bullish on some of the stuff that stani was talking about around like different ways that social can play out this is one of those ways where a Creator can and immediately make an announcement around something that is very very uh specific knowing that the audience on Magic Eden is very very engaged right they are already on Magic even on the collection page thinking about some stuff um but one of the things that we were looking into was hey like how did creators do in Magic Eden in the last 12 months and a couple of really amazing stats one is they made around 250 million on Magic Eden last year um and the second thing what does that mean that 200 that 250 million dollars flowed into the hands of creators exactly who do the art that they created on exactly yeah exactly wow yep that's a lot that's huge that's not it's huge so like I think people some people don't really realize how big the Solana nft ecosystem actually is it's by far the second biggest by far um and obviously there's still a step change to get to eat but it's it's uh it stands on its own feet um the second really interesting stat and this is one that's been more topical for us recently as we've been you know as part of us going to polygon we've been talking to more and more like web 2 platforms who are thinking about hey how do we use magic Eden or nfts as a as another Channel or another another way to engage our community whether that's whether you're a brand or if you're a different kind of Creator whether you're an artist whether you're an influencer and I'll keep it unnamed what you know one of the really big web to social media platforms has a goal that's like hey we need our creators to make like a thousand bucks a month right that's that's an aspirational goal the average creator of magic Eden last year who launched our launch pad and our Launchpad is basically like more of a premium sort of uh we partner with creators and help them launch and Magic Eden we did about 400 of them last year and the average Creator made over three hundred thousand dollars damn pretty insane that's average insane average average and that to me basically tells me it gets me really fired up because this is a Creator should think about this as a as it should not be like a black and white like let me replace the things that I'm already doing but it should be another way to augment and amplify their existing content their existing ways of engaging their community and working and and and and keeping the community happy all this kind of stuff and I think entity entities is a as a fundamental concept it's like a really good way to do that um so that's like one of the really cool things that we're trying to push on the last stat I'll tell you I mentioned the three billion dollars that before the last ad I'll tell you is more of a product thing because as I said we're like a very very product driven company um but the average um session time on Magic eating is 15 minutes so you like our users come and spend a lot of time just discovering new content and um that that I think is a really big Testament to number one the sheer amount of content that's being created currently on Solana and hopefully what we see on on polygon and on and on if imagine in the future but secondly it says a lot about like what people are fundamentally trying to do they're trying to discover new communities and they're doing their diligence and they're they're trying to learn about what Frank is doing and what others are doing and that's a that kind of browsing and Discovery is going to become even more important over time and um whether that's through like specific features but also through um you know if we go to places like polygon and have to tell like different stories different narratives work with different creators like these are all just different and new things that we will have to build and have to be built into a marketplace right and that's why I think in the over the long term um there will be some sort of verticalization of some marketplaces but in general I think people will want places where you can discover a lot of things and that you know if we are successful it's sort of like we want to be the home we want to be the home of entities in that sense that's the aspiration that we have so anyway I'll uh I'll stop Shilling that's basically some some high level steps Z before we get to stania on uh lens just real quick I want to ask both of you guys so um For You Frank and yuzi um ethereum clear number one as far as nfts Solana you're saying is actually a clear number two as far as nft Community do you think polygon is the number three and is your presence there like sort of King making polygon as maybe the number three Community or do you think that number three title is is kind of up for grabs this year yeah I think for me I definitely think it's a pretty clear number three I mean I think uh as whatever people might feel about it I remember when the Trump nfts came out and I watched uh them do I think it was like six or seven million dollars trading volume on the first day and I was on like polygon and uh I think they're almost at like all-time highs even today join us on uh Magic Eden here yeah are they on Magic eating sir this is it no no no different one uh if you go to the go to that toggle that old chains toggle yeah head poly and then you should you should see the Trump one yeah there you go yeah no it's not yeah yeah yeah some quality stuff though yeah so I think when I saw them mint out at the time it was like 100 which at that time would have been I think eight eight Soul which is a pretty high mint price typically for a really high mid price you know on Solana and they did a 45 000 Supply and then they minted that thing out in like a few hours and then it proceeded it to do a top trading volume of that week um and it still gets traction today so I think similar with the Reddit ft stuff where again they've like unlocked a part of a market that uh frankly nobody else not even made na it has unlocked to a certain degree and so that's where we think the advantages are and if I'm being totally honest here I just think that each mfers are going to uh love polygon once there are more projects on there for them to trade because you know I'm friends with a lot of people at this point in the nft space and especially on the Gen side like people are doing dejaminants even to this day on eat and it's just a little too cost prohibitive to a point where you know a lot of them have a much more likelihood of trending to Zero have less of a crazy run-up where I think in a loafy environment you could see that change uh so yeah I just think it's gonna be a no-brainer it's gonna be a no-brainer yeah with like with ethereum though with evm change there's so many right now and there's so many up and coming uh layer twos now so unlike kind of Solana with you know this Solana virtual machine it's kind of just Salon is the only game in town but with evm it's it's fairly simple to go from change to change a change do you think there's enough of a mode um with all this competition coming after polygon yeah I mean I don't think that the moat is actually like to me the moat is just good IP on the Chain uh like I look at it actually closer to HBO versus Netflix where you know someone might sign up for HBO because they're a big fan of Game of Thrones or they might sign up for Apple TV because they want to watch Ted lasso and I think that at least I mean we are like the prime case study of this where you'll hear the story very often of the gods or Utes being the only Solana nft that like certain people that trade very often on eat it's the only one that they hold it's like the reason that they braged over like capital and I think we've seen this firsthand a lot of people in our community we talk to them a lot about that and so like the reason that you try out a new chain is not because of the technology of the chain but it's actually because of the projects that are on that on that content is still King like it's always King I mean like I'm I'm so deep on this thesis where like all that really matters to me at the end of the day is like are we putting out moral content and is that content getting more reached than anybody else and I think everyone has the wrong coach a lot of people have the wrong approach to it today where they're trying to like Branch out and go for this mythical like mainstream audience where to me I think that the highest value audience is the people that care about crypto nfts today and if you give them an incredible experience and you give them content that they can follow 24 7 and constantly be entertained with it'll continue to grow concentrically and the best example of this is most people that buy nfts if you talk to them and you ask them especially higher ticket nfts what made you buy it they'll say something along the lines of a trusted influencer talked about it a friend told me about it you know we were talking about this at work like it's usually actually more interpersonal connections than it is like at the Super Bowl or from a massive drip email campaign it's actually personal connections that drive people to make real purchase decisions when it comes to nfts so if you really want to grow smart when it comes to these Ro approach has been referral based like Word of Mouth type of marketing because that drives real metrics and real numbers and I think that's the same approach that we're taking with polygon where how do we get more High pull you can't take shortcuts how do we just get more high quality projects on polygon if there are more that have constantly new things that are coming out that are exciting for people to follow more of the attention will get shifted and diverted over to polygon and there's nothing a blockchain with their technology can do to change the fact that people just want to be part of cool communities and that's what has product Market fit with nfts right now I don't even think I need to ask my next question because this dovetails so nicely into Stony and what lens is doing with when it comes to just content and conversation in a web 3 fashion so so like Stony the the high level question is tell us about the Vitality of lens but really I want to hear about like the conversation like what Frank was saying when it comes like content is King and how it's routing a bunch of value uh using conversations using community members talking about stuff how is this activity uh arriving on lens and what are the metrics that you can show us uh just tell us about how how much Vitality that Community has yeah no I I definitely agree that that it's it's quite a lot about the the actual content and and distribution so yeah content uh I would say like um the content is is uh is is the king but also the like the the curation is the player that is is very very much that actually uh makes some of the nft projects um more valuable what we heard recently as well so for example that where where you can actually hear about different projects you know one one way is to you know be in different Discord groups or group to Twitter or telegram groups but something that is very interesting about lens is that um you can actually incentivize also the sharing of the the content so uh lens as a social layer it also has a monetization layer so for example how people are sharing um content for example uh and incentivizing a lot of people to share and amplify that content to you to your audience I mean in general the the lens protocol is still a beta so we've uh we we don't have it as completely open and and permissionless minting yet but we're going towards that direction as we're now building the uh lens version too but out of uh 100 um uh 10 000 profiles uh that has been given and granted and minted uh roughly we have uh average users of uh 35 000 uh per day which is quite High number of users coming back to lens and and just talk about different things uh different projects NSD communities and just sharing content and also like where we look at in into the different numbers uh currently on average uh profile is is earning uh roughly 75 dollars uh per profile in terms of revenue for just sharing that content and I think that's very exciting in the sense that if you compare it to uh traditional social media um you really don't get anything like you might have like five million views and you earn five dollars uh at a maximum so the the the curation I think is going to be very valuable part so like who who are those influencers how they're curated but also seeing the transparency like how people are getting actually uh paid when their share content and distribute to their audiences and if you see all that activity also on chain it's very valuable for the users because it brings sort of transparency and accountability so if someone shares their project to you and and you see effectively that you know there's that's content amplification that might be paid but you might be seeing it because it's valuable for uh you and you value that particular uh influencer for example so I'm I'm personally super bullish on um seeing a lot of nft stuff happening on on lens uh and also like down the roadmap what we're trying to also figure out is that you know if you um create content on direct your lens how you could actually make it directly in in Magic Eden or whatever protocol you want to actually use um outside of lens and have that kind of like a compatibility uh there as well so so definitely like it's very early uh but at the same time I I feel that that's that lens protocol has created this kind of a layer of uh sharing and curating content to a website native audience and the discussions are very good three native as well so kind of going back to the point what France said that it's like it really doesn't make sense now to reach to the whole world at this point but actually focusing like how you can how you can Master the audience of web train native users and give them the best experience that they could have it's Donnie if somebody wants to uh go down the lens Rabbit Hole where do they find that rabbit hole where should they get started so Carter if you want to Mint a lens profile just hit me a uh DM uh on Twitter um oh it could Discord and and I can help you out uh and you can mint your first lens profile because lens has like a terrible bot problem right like everyone's trying to get their Bots onto lens because they're trying to farm a an airdrop right is that kind of the idea well basically in terms of the Bots the last protocol itself is is pure raw data but actually how you see that um activity on your front and it depends on the front ends and the algorithms uh in between so for example um you have the ability as a front-end to minimize what you actually see and and that can be actually reduced but end of the day like we want to uh focus on the idea that uh lens should be permissionless in the future and it's available to anyone so you can uh mint a profile but once you're admit once you minted your profile you can actually attach any of those uh identity pieces that you might have that might be uh your lens handle that might be your ens name um that might be some other piece of identity that is actually creates a social reputation it can be also your own shame balance sheet at the same time and based on that and and your activity um and reputation score we can actually uh create a reach uh for you as a user so effectively what's going to be different compared to lens uh and the traditional social media is that it's basically accessible to anyone uh you can create a profile and have ownership of your online presence follow other uh profiles and users but end of the day it's your activities that that actually reflects how your content reaches out the all the contents out there guys this has been really cool uh what a great panel and I appreciated your insights today I guess um my takeaway is um we're still kind of finding that content is King the the cool uh set of Tools around web3 and crypto is that means creators can be king rather than the aggregators the web 2 aggregator so we've got content as king creators being King it seems like polygon
