[Music] hey bankless nation this is a conversation between david and brantley milligan of ens that is the ethereum name service so if you've seen folks on twitter with their name or gamertag followed by dot eth you know what i'm talking about ens gives you an nft that represents your wallet's key pair and that key pair the public and private keys are the cryptographic building blocks of this whole movement public key cryptography is extremely powerful m was invented by cryptographers in the 20th century well it's math so maybe it was discovered in the 20th century either way this technology emerged and is finding massive use cases in crypto giving each of your citizens a key pair is a huge level up for individuality security and identity and these things are increasingly important as we move into a digital society enos domains is doing really cool things like designating nft avatars for your wallet and integrating with the more familiar dns domain names to me it feels like we're watching the user experience of web3 emerge right before our eyes from first principles we see public key cryptography build into new standards of naming identifying and authenticating on the web this is a fascinating conversation with somebody who's building new digital standards from the ground up but first we need to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the default apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and now it's live with over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on the ethereum l1 sucks too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization that's why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrom many defy applications that are on the ethereum layer one are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrary and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer twos there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.albertrum.io and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed and start having a defy experience that you've always wanted everyone i'm here with brantley milligan from the ens team brantley what's up hey long time no see david yeah a long time it's good good to talk to you man you recently put out an article in the bankless newsletter all about signing in with ethereum and overall more just using your private keys to do things that are not just making a transaction on the ethereum blockchain so uh to start to start us off here why don't you talk about why what what is the greater thing to talk about about like sign in with ethereum and using your private keys that's not just like finance stuff on d5 yeah well i'd say the really really deep big picture thing is that uh public private key cryptography is extremely powerful it's one of the most important discoveries or inventions it's depending on how you want to think about since the 1970s okay and it was actually like illegal for most for a lot of different uses for a while because the u.s government recognized its power in the 90s it became legal after the pgp movement um and then the the cypherpunks were like hey let's get everybody a private key and it's going to change the world and basically nobody adopted it right because it turns out you know appeal like moral appeals to like privacy in liberty which i believe in by the way just doesn't move most people we all know this right but uh money does move people and so what what crypto incentives um have done is got uh two things one they've incentivized millions of people to get a private key they don't even know they're getting a private key they think they're getting a cryptocurrency wallet okay you have that and then the other part is that it's hard for people to manage a private key and uh again goodwill is not enough to like have businesses help people do that but with cryptocurrency there is a huge incentive so you have this massive highly competitive market for wallet providers we all know is extremely crowded and in the last five years we've seen an insane amount of innovation improvement on helping people manage your private key now it turns out if you get a private key so you can you know watch the number go up right it has all these other happy side effects like you could do authentication you can do private messaging you know you can sign things to prove uh you know time stamps and things like this so just to just to recap we had the we had the power to do a lot of what we're doing with private keys we had this forever ago we and like the cypherpunks were probably like you guys like we can we don't have to do things the old way we can do things the new way which is new private keys uh whatever the old way way is like we have all these magical powers and people like oh that's that's great that that is like technically a an option that we have but everyone was like no i'm not going to really bother with this but you're saying like now that like we have this these multiple use cases of a private key one of which is largely like managing and storing wealth uh it's now like 100x more convenient to do all the other like non-money-related things because everyone has like good private key like management and ownership exactly so think of a private key so it's like let's talk about the username password paradigm which is the web 2 paradigm your password is like a very very weak user-generated private key like i think in the future when we make this flip okay we're going to look back at the as like that was the early web this crazy time how do people survive oh you had to create your own private key that's stupid it's crazy right nobody would do that your user birthday or your pet's name or your child's middle name or something like everyone would do that it's stupid okay right so we can do authentication um that's uh one part of sign with ethereum um the second half of sign of ethereum is of course you need like a human readable layer new layer to store information like some sort of profile and that's where ens comes in and again it's it's a similar thing where enos was not designed to be a user name or web3 username or profile or anything like this it was designed for this other use case which is like simplify payments which turned out to be like this really easy to understand killer use case which then like got huge numbers of people their e s names and then oh it turns out we can also use it for this other thing so even like on twitter we've seen this happening just naturally you know people are like identifying with it they're signaling with it you know with their twitter display name um and uh so those are the two parts it's the private key plus decentralized naming system equals your single internet account that you own without a trust without depending on trusted third party okay so is this so this is fixing like the whole sign in with facebook sign in with google thing uh explain the connection between the ens name and a private key a little bit more because that's actually that's actually that part is new to me is this like an identity conversation as in like i have the private keys that go with davidhoffman.eth so not only can i like identify it on my web to twitter account but it also acts as some sort of like pseudo venmo like surface layer by just telling everyone how to pay me or is the conversation go broader than that yeah so there's this thing called reverse resolution um and we need to just like rename it web3 username or something like this because it's confusing okay so basically here's the idea most people when they think of ens they think of what's called forward resolution which is that you provide or enter a name and it resolves to let's say a cryptocurrency address right by the way it could be any cryptocurrency address or it really could be any information okay reverse resolution is the opposite reverse resolution is i already have an ethereum address and i can look up to see if enos name is associated with that now this confuses a lot of people because they think well what if i have 20 e s names how do you know which one well that's what reverse resolution is there's actually a separate like registry where everything is switched your ethereum address is in the position of the name and then you have a record and then you designate basically one of your ens names as the ens name that represents your ethereum account right so the one is the actual name of the account the others are like just assets that it owns correct so the way that the flow goes is i um this happens on openc right now okay i'm logging in it opens the open c says okay you connect your wallet you sign this message which basically proves um your the existence of your private key okay then now they have your public key then they then do a reverse lookup okay which what ens name do you have the reverse record oh let's grab that now you can start doing things with that you can display that as the username you can also now check the records of that name and grab other information you could grab an avatar you can grab your twitter handle you could grab whatever information you want okay so this is without a trusted third party involved right this is all a protocol so okay so is this is the real unlock here some like early primitives of identity right so like identity routing as in like we can connect a name to an ethereum address and then also pull up properties that are associated with this name and and ens address because ens addresses are nfts that sort of does establish some sort of like identity layer because of the serialization that goes into nfts right and so we are connecting uh certain private keys along with it is this like largely an identity conversation yeah so so dotty's names are nfc are well all enos names or nfts like by definition okay right yes dot ether names follow the erc sensor 721 standard we're actually coming out coming out with something that can upgrade them to 11 55 that's another conversation okay okay the fact that nfts though is not really relevant here what's relevant is just simply the fact that you can go from your theme address to the name and the name to other information and um yeah this becomes your identity so wait is it sorry is the information tied to the name and not the ethereum address the ens name so you go from ethereum address to name and then from name to other information okay right right okay yes yeah and this is like this is not just an idea so like you know i had this thread that went viral right then you guys asked me to make it to an article and everything like this i i was just nobody set out to do this stuff this stuff was just happening naturally in the ecosystem there's no standard or anything like this and i just sort of like and other people have been talking about it and it just sort of crystallized my mind of like whoa this is happening and this is like a really big deal because this is something that a lot of people have tried to do over many years i'm not trying to bash anybody but i'll say the idea of a single sign-on for the internet's been around a long time even in the blockchain space for you know for a long time there's been a lot of talk of identity and i would just say at least so far like very little to show for it okay it's a hard problem i'm not bashing but it's a hard problem but what can often happen in the world is problems are solved best when they are accidentally discovered by the market so if if i had set out i'm going to try to give everybody a private key and then and then in the world i'm gonna try to get everybody uh this decentralized name for your identity right nobody cared when the cypherpunk has tried to do that right but if i say hey get a private key for cryptocurrency get a name for for payments and oh actually you can already now just do this other stuff now that catches on okay right and that's kind of what i was going with identity right because especially in the middle of this nft phenomena like establishing a relationship between like the nft like crypto punk that you own or like the art that you have actually goes in line with uh having that be like part of the brand of the person behind the ens name but when you when you said like goes from ens name to like more data is that that extra data could that be stuff like um i don't know in theory like your age so that you can like check into a 21 and only if you can somehow like establish like legitimacy with a nation state for example can you somehow input your age or like uh i don't know any other like personal identifying information that we are used to and if regardless of like the trust behind that is that kind of like where you could like add extra data is that kind of what you're seeing or what could really bolster what data in that data layer could really bolster like the identity behind someone yeah so uh one you can store any arbitrary data that you want um at all it could be your mailing address it could be your favorite type of dog it could be anything right uh two um right now we have no means for for keeping data private any data that you put on e s is d is always public right um and i i would say if you try to sort of like try to solve too many problems at once you can end up like not solving anything right i would say i think we have momentum on this and basically what we're doing at ens is that we're trying to build into this natural momentum and as we go along maybe we can like you know add other features or things okay so you guys are letting the market lead yeah so like one another great example of this um is of course you know on twitter there's the whole nft profile pic phenomenon totally naturally happened nobody set out to do that right crypto punks were not created for that or something it's naturally happened so what we have naturally manually happening on twitter is people putting their enos names as their name and this nft profile pic manually well on web3 we can um and we can actually do this automatically so we've always we've already had an avatar record although it's not something we promoted much but we actually are in the midst of creating and implementing a standard that will allow you to designate an nft of your that you own as your avatar which then adapt can like even check oh do you actually own that nft and then display it um that's sick as yes and so we're gonna do this for a header image we have this idea of you could maybe designate your top six favorite nfts so basically right now there's this guy actually srinivasan who's a great designer we're working with we're redesigning our entire manager app around this concept so the current manager app was created back like like two or like three years ago or two or three years ago with like many of these things even exists but now they do and so the new manager app will look more like a profile that yeah you have your addresses you have links to your social media things you have your avatar your header that's the vision but it's us responding to what people were already doing naturally right no this makes a ton of sense um yeah because it's attaching so many things the nft aspect about this is so important right because it's um while fungible tokens can go in and out of wallets and get like mixed and lost nfts can't right and that's why that's why any ens name nft is like obviously a unique identifier but then if you start adding on like a crypto punk as like a secondary unique identifier and then you can i don't know what else comes after that but like there's just more and more unique things coming to ethereum that well they don't like promise that there's any sort of connection to any sort of like specific human behind the scenes like you do get more and more assurances that there is one single entity there sure yeah and i have this idea that it's um web3 fashion so nft avatars nft headers i think is going to be a big thing in particular when we get come out with this new manager thing other things like that like people are like i don't get it like you can get you can just use an avatar for free like just your picture or something else that's true but that doesn't have the same like social value and so it's like do i think about it i think it's possible that in you know in the future like if we if we said this was maximally successful this vision in the future like everyone in the world would have an ethereum account would have an ens name would have some sort of nft profile pick you know avatar maybe a header that doesn't mean by the way that everybody is going to own like or try to buy expensive ones right they see something most people go you know they get used clothes or they shop at walmart like whatever that's fine some people like get really into it they like get gucci or you know that's like an air like that to me that's like nft profile pics it's gonna be that type of thing totally which is fine you know yeah no i think that's exactly i think that's exactly right oh man that's something who wants a gucci purse when you can have a crypto punk i mean crypto punks are cooler now all right 100 they're cooler oh this this is fantastic okay so okay so this is just like kind of the early building blocks for some and i i think the reason why having uh your profile picture actually be an nft like on chain on ethereum is because like well everything else is on chain on ethereum right so like if your profile picture isn't on ethereum doesn't even exist because we're talking about like the financial layer of the internet so if it doesn't exist on the financial layer of the internet like what is it like it's just like it's kind of like the blank you know profile like gray profile of a facebook person that hasn't uploaded a profile picture yet like that's kind of what it is yeah yeah well i mean so there was a similar flip of the internet right 20 years ago or so this idea i mean there's the famous phrase if it's not on the internet it doesn't exist right yeah that's not you know i that i had a tweet recently that was like you know if it's not a theorem it doesn't exist you know take off of that it's not literally true obviously right but it's like a proverb right it's like a general principle that's pointing at the fact increasingly so it does sort of feel like that right i mean if you just think now like if i want to get a book and i can't get on amazon or kindle or audible it might as well not exist because i mean unless it's really really really important i'm probably not going to go digging for it right no and and it's also taking the perspective of ethereum right like if it's not on ethereum it doesn't exist that statement comes from the perspective of of the ethereum the protocol itself right like if ethereum doesn't know it exists then and then according to that it doesn't really exist and and then there's the connection of ethereum being related to like a nation state and nation states liking to account for everything and know that all things exist under its domain uh which is actually something i'm writing about uh but brantley this is great thanks for just hopping on and shooting the with it about this hey do we have a few more could we chat briefly yeah you got more ideas got more ideas out let's do it okay yeah i mean so uh we launched full dns name space integration today what does that mean what it means is that uh if you own a domain name on dns you can import that name into ens with the same suffix so like bcmilligan.com on dns i can have bcmilligan.com on enos okay is that doesn't all ens names end with dieth they don't okay so dot eth is so and ending the term the technical term is top level demand or tld maybe producer before select.com.net like dot eat is like that just like on dns you can have you know 1500 different tlds ens can have as whatever as many teal diseases as you want now is the like native topical domain to ens and because it's native to ethereum it has you know self custody and there's certain security benefits things like this but we've created a system where you can if you own a name on dns you can cryptographically prove that you own that name to a smart contract on ethereum and then you can have that name on ens so basically it's like if you want to use ens but for whatever reason you don't want to use okay there could be other reasons okay you can we're not going to create more topical domains because we want to remain forward compatible with dns and dns expands its top level domain space over time a lot of people don't know that uh so this is actually differentiator uh for us from other blockchain naming projects which is just like trading tlds and selling things a big problem is that i'd say there's a very high degree of likelihood if they're not already colliding with dns that they will in the future and then if they collide with dns they'll also collide with ens because ens is just integrating the dns name space so the way that we're basically offering more possibilities beyond.eth if you don't want that for some reason is we're just integrating the global name space uh so this was a big deal this was years in the making uh with lots of twists and turns um we just launched that today on mainnet congratulations just so i'm fully understanding like all these the uh uh other in other naming service projects they're making every one of them is making this own entire universe it's all like silo universe and that their naming system works for their universe but what you're saying is happening with ethereum and the way that ens is separating itself is that ens is intentionally not trying to collide with dns the the legacy web and instead trying to work and can be compatible with it and so does that make there like these two universes as in you have like the dns and the ens side and these things actually speak to each other can you just talk a little bit more about the benefits behind that yeah so think about it as here's how i think about it uh dns actually has like three different parts that we usually conflate because they usually just go together so this is often the case that things that usually correlate people confuse as being the same thing but actually they can be unbundled okay for dns you have the name space which is like the social agreement of who has what name okay then you have like the social process by which that's decided and then you have like the software and hardware that like technically runs everything okay we right now are not attempting to so so these are all different things you could challenge say hey i want to manage the name space differently there's a certain process that the world has agreed on to do this okay or i want to challenge who owns what name where i want to challenge the infrastructure is running on um ens is for the most part just challenging like the infrastructure part and then even there we're not really challenging it because we're running in parallel so we're not necessarily in competition so think of it as you know davidhoffman.com you own that name the rights to that name in the world and then that name can run on dns and it can run on ens and we've built a system to make sure that it's always the same owner the same person who owns it on both so so one benefit would be you have a dns website davidhoffman.com you know which most you know everybody can access and then say hey send me dogecoin to davidhoffman.com so just kind of and now from a user perspective they don't have to even know there's two different systems in the background there's no there's just a name davidhoffman.com the back end though you know maybe the website's using dns maybe that the payments using ens that's one benefits uh uh argent actually was a huge early adopter of this so our test case tld for this feature that's been around a long time was dot xyz so you know they give like brainly.xyz they used to gas prices have stopped it but those were things yeah those are you that's ems name and their idea was if you have david.xyz you can use that for payments but then also hey go to go to that in a browser and it's like your profile your urgent profile and maybe it loads up my uh pro punk profile pic too it could yeah awesome that's really cool matcha everyone's favorite dex aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eath and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various d5 exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage matra has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price austra also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stable coin into the alchemics vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stable coin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcemix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al-eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f-i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomix-fi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance you said yeah is there more stuff coming out of the world of vns anytime soon that how like how big uh big of an announcement or partnership is that is that like a big deal the dns thing yeah the dns thing like help me put that into perspective yeah i would say so there's no partnership this is just something that we're doing integration sure yeah um because we're doing it in a way that it doesn't require the involvement of anybody on dns oh that assumes important like an important property yeah so we didn't have to get anyone's permission for it just we're just using things already exists that's key um i would say this is i don't initially oversay this but one of the most historic days in the history of ens and potentially in like internet naming because wow this like what this does is makes ens an extension of this like ethereum based extension of dns which is like huge and basically like brings an enormous amount of new use cases to potentially all dns names which is a huge number of things kind of merges them uh from a user perspective in a certain way and long term this could be the first step towards actually an ethereum based like an ethereum first base naming system what i mean by that is that currently you have to own the name on dns first and then you import in the ens and the dns side is the canonical source of truth but we're not trying to do this anytime soon but let's say 10 20 years from now if enough people have done that eventually an ethereum becomes more important that source of truth could flip and then ethereum just becomes it's the thing it yes and then all these names could actually have the benefits of being fully blockchain native so like a dot east name um its benefits are like you have self custody nobody can take the name from you it's censorship resistance you can trade it around easily and things like this because ethereum is its ultimate source of truth right dns is your ultimate source of truth you can't even if it's on a thing you can't trade it as easily and things because you have to match up what's on dns right um but it's like a first step this this seems to follow like similar patterns of other ways like ethereum gets adopted and it seems like a little bit like a rug pull right like first you build the bridges over to dns and it's it's a it seems to be a little bit of like a customer acquisition strategy right like you're going towards the people that already exist that already have domain names and saying all right like you can it's like an air you're air dropping them a free domain name is that like a fair like way to describe it on ethereum on ens because they already have one in the dns world so it's kind of kind of the way that like bitcoin fair the fair launch phenomenon for bitcoin they would airdrop new tokens to bitcoin holders right or we've seen this also in the d5 space right so like you're air dropping an ens high level like top level domain towards the dns like legacy system trying to get them on over to ethereum and then in the future when the time comes to it like all of a sudden more value is being settled on ens over the dns and all of a sudden people prioritize ens more and then boom ethereum has like kind of rug pulled the legacy system correct i i the only thing i would say is it's not like oh we have this like scheming plan to like right no that's my that's my propaganda right there right it's more like i'm saying i could just foresee things going this way eventually as we both know the ethereum world gets like increasingly what like the more most important part of the internet which is happening this is like a first step towards that right but i say key thing is that we're doing this in a way that maintains continuity um uh doesn't break the old system okay it's not it's not um combative with it right i think that's better for users it's not helpful to users to have to break things and things are con confusing or what's going on and two it makes it far more likely to success to succeed because dns is um within dns is an insanely um successful protocol it's something that the entire world uses like that's insane like that's incredible and everybody uses it and i think to try to like take that head on in a way that's like oh we're going to beat it in a couple years or something i think that's almost that's like insane that's unnecessary we must extend it and live in parallel and if at some point we make the flip then great then it makes sense at the time right we don't have to be compatible about it yeah humans have already created so much value in this protocol and there's no reason that we can like destroy all that coordination value we can just like carbon copy it and then take it to the next level is that the attitude yeah it wouldn't even be desirable to like destroy i think what we currently have yeah 100 that's really cool bradley that's awesome yeah anything else to talk about with oh man um so a layer two stuff so everything right now on ens is on layer one which is obviously uh extremely expensive and we're aware of this people you know tell us um seems appropriate for like the ethereum naming service thing to be on the layer one ethereum though that seems like right yeah so what we've come up with is i think some of the core logic will always remain on ethereum layer one like the root zone i don't want to get into all this stuff but some of the details but basically a year ago vitalik made a proposal so here's this idea we could like use leveraged layer twos to help scale ens we had some like public meetings about it and then nick johnson is the creator and lead developer of enos kind of refined it down to his own idea and he calls it durin from the doors of durham from from lawrence and it's basically a system that is very clever will allow people to store records and sub-domains at any external location of their choice arbitrarily without wallets having to support every single possible external location so like right now what's going on wallets have to like they have to specifically support optimism and arbitrarily and polygon but like so that's like highly limiting because they're not going to support everything with our system we have this gateway system that if you're using layer 2 actually doesn't um create any additional trust so you just have to support this one standard and then you can access data from any external location so this could be another layer one because you can store your records on freaking bitcoin if you wanted to or solana you know anywhere you want you could store it on any layer too you want you could sort out a web server you could store something you know anywhere um as long as you set it up with the standard so that should be coming hopefully by end of year so for records and sub domains so that should make that much cheaper then when it comes to the registration process itself so this would be registering a dot eth name or claiming or importing a dns name we could use the same system to basically put that process on a layer two the problem is that we'd have to like pick a one layer two that's like that is where dot e's name registrations happen which we may do at some point but it's like we have to wait for the space to mature because like if we pick a place like we move there we're not moving again for a long time you know because it's hard to do right so what if you do make a mistake like what what's say say you deploy on uh an l2 and something goes wrong and you have to do something what's that process look like no we could always fix it we could just move it over so i'm just saying it you know there's always a fail safe i'm saying it's not to be like oh every month we're like picking the latest you know it's hot new l2 yeah so we'll wait for that to kind of play itself out right cool man yeah so that l2 thing's huge my expectation though is that even that by itself may be enough to really spur a huge amount of adoption because it's always been our vision that most people actually don't have what are called second level domains so second level domains like davidhoffman.if our vision's always been that you know that's fine many people will or like savvy people will our visions has been that most people have sub domains like given to them by their wallets it's like a gmail account everybody in the world can have their own email address on their own domain but it's kind of too hard right so like coinbase could be like you know coinbase.com using our dns integration you know importing and then give every user a sub domain of coinbase.com which doubles as their profile and their cr and to receive any crypto on ens and if it's using this layer 2 system it could have no cost for issuing all the sub domains yeah right right so we have um we have uh banklist.eth and so in theory we can make a platform that could be like davidhoffman.banklist.eth or you know your name here.banklist.eth and if we decided to make some sort of like big platform and wallet identity system we could make our own like sort of ecosystem right yes at little to no cost you could do this now in layer one it just costs a lot right another thing to link up with that is that we've been working on something we're calling the wrapper which is basically a smart contract that we will be releasing soon that you wrap you can wrap your ens names and we're debating we should make it default or not for new names going forward we'll see about that but it would always be an option that will hugely upgrade the nft capabilities of all ens names and then also will make it possible to create subdomains and then lock away your control of the subdomain without giving up control of your main domain right now this is not possible right now like if you have david hoffman.if and you want to give someone a subdomain either you always have kind of control you could take that subdomain back because it's hierarchical authority or you'd if you don't don't have that you'd have to give up control david hoffman dot ease to a contract so that nobody controls it it's like this binary thing which is not very nice with this wrapper though you could keep control of davidhoffman.if give someone else a subdomain and then lock your control away from that so that they truly have self custody of that so i think that combined with our layer two stuff combined with even like our dns stuff means like six from months from now we could have like a whole different world of e s names but we will see do you think there's a world out there where like ens becomes a um a target of rampant speculation in the way that we've seen icos and nfts and we there's definitely enough speculation but i'm talking about like you know huge right yeah some sort of manic fever yeah i mean i think there could be i'll say that uh at the ens team we have always downplayed any you know speculation stuff you people are going to do and it's fine it's not like evil or something like this but um the problem is that we're trying to build a naming system and like we want it to be useful and people actually using it if you build a naming system that everyone's speculating that's like no one's using for naming you failed right so we've designed our pricing our incentives specifically trying to at least have some discouragement of squatting um i'll also say like we have a discord channel and we actually don't allow sale uh discussion at all like if you want to discuss do it somewhere else but not our discord channel we don't promote that at all from our brand account even most of our personal accounts we rarely you know we see like oh a big sale might be like oh that's cool but we don't promote it at all and we even say publicly like if you're squatting on some cool brand name ourselves name our recommendation is give it to the person for free and take the social credit because otherwise you're just like holding back adoption which we think ultimately hurts everybody like we all benefit if all the subs and and brands and people adopt ens that's better for everybody right that's the easiest you have to be bigger you know right we it would be better for everyone if the dust settled in the right spots yeah yeah awesome bradley this is a fantastic conversation anything else don't want to miss anything um what happened with with a pov crypto oh we still do it every now and then have you been watching twitter lately no just last time i i did a podcast interview with you it was with pov crypto two years ago oh yeah no uh i mean he and christian got sucked down into uh bitcoin media and i got sucked into bank list we still do like maybe one or two episodes a month that's awesome yeah so it's still going on but like it's very much like kind of it's on maintenance yeah mm-hmm great how's banko style going absolutely fantastic yeah yeah pretty pretty explodey i would say we have a show for every single day of the week now wow okay i gotta say it's pretty uh it's cutting edge and innovative the idea of having like a newsletter and podcast show having a dow mm-hmm like it actually works and it's cool and congratulations oh yeah no it's it's been fun watching the dow grow by itself uh me and ryan actually aren't like super involved with adele we kind of like let it have a mind of its own just kind of decentralized right absolutely yeah and plus like we're busy as like we can't do an llc and a dow so like the dallas very much has like a life of its own and like it's again it's it's still to this day like one of the most vibrant like dallas that's out there oh yeah here's something um i i can say so we've been hiring a lot okay uh one job that we've been publicly looking to hire for a long time is a governance lead and so when enos launched back in may 2017 like the only significant doubt had been the dao that was obviously we're very early so we there are most of ens it just runs by itself and we don't even have control of it like we can't take away names or anything like that okay but there's a few things that still require human discretion like like you have set pricing like that'd be really hard to automate completely because like 50 years from now are you going to be sure it's still going to be working right so there's a few things like also the funds raised from dottie thames like what's going to happen to that we vote we've always put on our website we'd like to use uh dowser better decentralized governance mechanisms as they develop and we think that maybe they've developed enough so we're looking for somebody who can help us figure out what is the best thing for ens then implement it and then manage it for us going forward um so we're that's a big thing that we're looking for as a governance lead the problem is all the people who are called qualified to do that are like rich like owning it in their life and it's hard to hire them yeah that is that is a problem throughout crypto is that you get so many people who like have all the talent in the brains but none of the motivation because it's just so much more lucrative to do other things well you guys heard the man if anyone is looking to be a governance lead i think if you are an upstanding individual with a track record of of uh credible neutrality and legitimacy and also perhaps understand some mechanism design maybe that's a job for you great all
