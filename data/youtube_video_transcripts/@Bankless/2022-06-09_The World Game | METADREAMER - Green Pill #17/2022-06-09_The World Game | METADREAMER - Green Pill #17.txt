[Music] hey hey hey coordination today's episode is with metadreamer the founder of meta factory we actually don't talk about betta factory at all in this episode um i'd say this episode is like going for a long walk with a really good friend and exploring the possibility space of humanity's impact on this planet we talk about the world game we talk about grounding perspectives for what we're building in the web 3 space in this episode we talk about what is even money what is stability how do we solve some of our contemporary societal problems with web3 uh we talk about unlearning before we start learning so basically how do we unlearn what we learned in the old economic system and then learn in the new economic system iterating and experimenting together to find the new direction for a more sustainable solar punk future meta dreamer is the meta dreamer meta means the most efficient effective tactic available and dreaming is just imagining what the world could be and i think this is actually in a way a really fun follow-up on my episode that we did with solar punk girl about different imaginations of the world because metadreamer is the meta imaginer so you're gonna really enjoy this episode of coordination without further ado i give you metadreamer the founder of metafactory enjoy refi summer has arrived and sello is here for it cello is the layer one blockchain for

about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] what's up metadreamer hey kevin how's it going um everything's down but uh my my hopes for solar punk feature are up yeah markets are down but hopes for a solar funk future are up yup i love that why are your hopes up uh i think it'll we can actually focus on building now i think which is nice i think all the most awesome stuff happened in the bear market um and even i see for me like i've been focused on on the dow space and i think for it for dao's not much changes it's more so hit on d5 space and you know all the yield farms and you know all that stuff going on which to be honest i think it was kind of getting overdone anyways and you know too much focus was there because like a lot of money was being made there um but if if that gets a damper then i think it's actually bullish for for the dial space because dallas will actually get people to coordinate to do things and doing things is what will bring back a bull market um you said my magic word coordination so what are you coordinating towards coordinating towards a lot of things um i think you know getting meta like coordinating towards better coordination um just kind of cyclical but i think you know the whole idea of coordination being the root of everything um i think for more specifically um my focus is right now there's this uh concept of the world game um by buck minster fuller uh i don't know if you've seen it but um would you mind just giving us a tldr just in case the audience hasn't heard of it for sure yeah so the concept of the world game is so buckminster fuller he's like this um like crazy super genius inventor guy he came up with the buckyball like geodesic domes he had like a lot of crazy ideas on sort of how to like fix a lot of the world's problems um so he proposed this thing called like a the world game it's essentially like a great logistics game or the world peace game um of like you know how to like solve a lot of these problems and he said the issue is that the way we're tackling these problems is not from like a systemic way of like dealing with the world as a whole but a piecemeal approach we call it a a local focus hocus pocus strategy that we're you know trying to like it's like the fire's under the hand but we're trying to like pour water on the top to like stop the burning in different locations so his idea for this world game is um and i'll quote him here uh it needed like uh a comprehensive database that would provide the players of the world game with better data than their politically elected or appointed counterparts they needed an inventory of the world's vital statistics where everything was and what quantities and qualities from minerals to manufactured goods and services to humans and their unmet needs as well as capabilities so basically once you can like gather all this information and put it in sort of one common shared state or view on the state of the world um that's when you can then better coordinate around it um because the the people right now who really have access to that kind of data are these top-level governments so you know the value and we think about value i think you know value is a lot of the times downstream of data um if you think about all the world's most valuable companies right now they're that valuable because of the data they have access to um so i think it's really interesting to think you know how beyond just using crypto for data or crypto for like money but also how we coordinate around data and you know sharing information with each other on like who did what what's happening like what's the situation um and for meta factory on our projects where it's more literal in that it's like logistics of like you know uh distribution supply chain of like apparel and fashion but i think the same underlying problem exists when you're trying to coordinate human labor and get people to do things in a digital context it's it's all sort of uh you know it's all about shipping stuff it's funny we talk about shipping as in like you ship a product but it's also you know shipping as in ups and fedex and stuff so it's all it's really like the whole the game of everything is about taking things and moving them from one place to another arbitrage it's like that too you know you're shipping some value here there so once you can have a better plane of information on you know what are the needs and necessities and what are the capabilities and assets where they are then you can more rapidly distribute them to exactly where they're needed to be at the exact right time right so it sounds like this game is a game let me say back to you what i heard and you tell me if i'm on the right page uh so basically uh there's a coordination game in order to meet all of humanity's needs and having the data about where the needs are sort of allows you to sort of elaborate where to put resources and create an arbitrage between different types of capital financial capital social capital material capital in all of these different places and before ethereum and coordination technology that could only be done top down but now we can sort of do it bottoms up local communities can put their information on a global substrate and there's sort of a network effect of that is that directionally close to what you're saying yeah basically um and it's interesting too because bucky's idea for this was pre-internet this was in the 1960s when he proposed this so like the internet didn't exist and the concept of it probably you know was very uh like not common at all so but the internet is very much the start of this you know you could consider that as hey here's all the world's information in one place it kind of is but it's not at the same time um and i think blockchain you know takes us a step further towards bridging that gap between like the real world and the digital world um and you know people talk about the metaverse i think this is what they forget or the the people are sort of missing out on right now is people are sort of focused on this idea of like this digital like 3d environment when that's maybe like 10 of it it's way more about the sort of making indistinguishable digital reality and physical reality where they are informed and in sync with one another right yeah yeah i think that you know one of the my definition of the metaverse is it's a substrate through which humanity's experience of the world is intermediated by the digital and for me the existential question is like do we want zuckerberg to own that interface between us in the world or we want it to be open source and free software and i think that that that it that confers that that metaverse that interface works for us the people that are behind the interface not some corporation that's trying to extract from the interface and so i guess that sort of like leads me to my next well i i know would you sort of agree with the the summation that the so it's about routing the material world's resources the real world's resources is what we should be focusing on the metaverse not like better 3d gaming yeah exactly um i think you know the the 3d environment might it might be a means to like enhance that experience where you know it could feel more like the physical world as well or simulate it like run rapid prototypes of yeah exactly but it's not it's not like the end game or sort of it's not our sort of purpose to like you know people i feel like a lot of people see it as like we're exiting the real world and you know creating this new reality when i think it's like really the opposite of that i think the current landscape of like social media and like you know phone addiction and doom scrolling like i think that's detaching us from reality and this is the metaverse is more means for us to like go back to you know come out of our screens and allow the screens to like whatever's in our screens instead of looking through the screens we're perceiving it through the physical world um just like everything else and that that is pretty solar punk i think um so i guess i want to ask you know at the end of this bucky fuller essay he basically states his end game is make the world work for 100 of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone um is that the end game what do you think the game is is here um yeah i'd say i'd say that's probably the end game for like most people um i think there's you know if you want to get um like metaphysical with it i think there's like you know a larger end game too where um if you think about i kind of touched on this in the layer zero podcast but the cycle of like life and death and existence you know um and sort of and did we discuss this a lot at medicamp actually um sort of people's like a version of uh negative things or or death um but you know sort of coming to the coming to terms of the fact that this will all be over at some point um like this too will pass and at a certain point none of this you know we we individually will die but i think at a certain point all of society and existence it will come to an end um so again i think it's really about zooming out and realizing it's more about the journey um and the journey we're on all as travelers uh and bucky also coined this term of like spaceship earth you know we're all crew members of spaceship earth and we're traveling together um and it's not really about any destination we're going to but sort of taking care of each other as like you know the crew while we're here as travelers and you know not really getting too attached either um to the world because again we're just like we're just travelers here we're visiting um for a moment in time um and you know when you're traveling somewhere you're not gonna immediately like you know just like get permanently attached and be like okay you know hey i went to paris once so now i'm like you know i have a house here i'm like doing all this but it's you know you're enjoying that your time there and doing the best you can for people and you around you but um the at the end of it there's a bigger destination you know right yeah you know we just had solar punk or solar punk girl on the podcast and she talks a lot about imagination activation activist and basically like shifting your perspective forward in time so what will not only like looking at your life in the broad spectrum of humanity as one generation among tens of thousands and that helps you appreciate your life in the temporal nature the the the ephemeral nature of it but also expanding out into having empathy for the rest of humanity and the rest of the planet over that time and i couldn't help but notice the parallel between what you said and what she said about that imagination of just it seems like gaining perspective is is the main thing there and you know this is for me for me been a i didn't call it imagination activist but it's been a tool for me to kind of say like okay like i have my basic needs met like what good is the is a lambo if the sky is on fire you know like what's the point of increasing my wealth to the point where i have luxury when we're destroying the planet for future generations or for each other um you know like what kind of things comfort come for you when you gain when you gain this perspective of what comes up for you yeah um i think it's uh it's it's interesting too because um if you actually think about it the buying the lambo and buying the fancy house it doesn't actually lead to more happiness so if you are if your goal is to actually optimize your personal happiness in life um that ends up not being the best path and the best path does actually end up being you know making some sort of impactful meaningful difference in other people's lives and making other people happier so just that study where like above 100k a year your more wealth doesn't give you more happiness but actually giving away your health or giving away your wealth and impacting the lives of others will create more happiness i i think we may be talking about the same data point here yeah basically um there's a different parables here but it's it's uh the same idea where there's a certain um zach from coordinates said it once it's like uh money is a problem or sorry like it's something about you know money is great um until you have enough of it you know and once you have enough of it then it becomes a problem anything more than that um so and and really i think it's about moving beyond this like scarcity mentality um that we've been sort of raised in and sort of ingrained in humanity from the very beginning uh if we can for example have these like cryptographic guarantees that people will have you know um a flow of value coming to them continuously that will support them you know as long as they are as long as whatever's downstream of them is creating value um and you have that connectivity then i think people will be much more likely to you know allocate their capital towards um you know things like bring them happiness and like make others happy because that's how essentially buy happiness is make spend it on other people to make them happy um yeah i wonder you know this leads me to the natural question that i in in some form or another ask everyone on this podcast but how do we program that perspective into our global open source financial system because right now i i really feel like i'm i'm swimming against the stream i feel like one of those salmon swimming up a stream right now when i try to explain to a journalist that it's not just all decentralized casinos and wealth maximalization in the ethereum space and you know i i i guess i'm just wondering you know how do we build more defy games or nft games that that have the benefit of this perspective in them yeah i think um i'm really like uh interested in this like next generation of dow tools that's going to enable a lot of this to happen um because i i do think it's really about turning it into these like game cycles where uh the game acts as sort of a trojan horse to be able to capture meaningful data about interactions in the world and then once you have captured that meaningful data and interactions in the world and you've made it you know interoperable and sort of you know standardized then you can start to use that data to like program value around it you know so we got with with defy so cryptocurrency bitcoin like it just gave us you know digital money ethereum allowed us to program that digital money um and then you know d5 it's it was still again kind of focused on the money because it was just really about we money was all we had so it was about like how do we move this money around in different ways and do different things with it but like moving forward with daos now it's like okay human labor is coming into the picture and if you think about it you know the foundation of any economy is productive human labor where if people aren't actually doing things um and the any of the markets or money like none of that is worth anything if there's not like real stuff happening um so if dallas can enable humans to like do real stuff and a lot of real stuff to happen then i think it anchors a lot of the like people's oh cryptocurrency isn't real it's just this like made-up thing it anchors that into reality because then the money starts to like power and serve this like engine of coordination rather than the money itself being the you know this thing on its own or this like self-contained system that's just like you know d5 is really just a bunch of money moving around in different you know protocols um and you know different incentives at different times it's not there's no like uh uh it's just kind of like free energy in the ether this is kind of buzzing around it hasn't been like captured and you know put to work uh in a real meaningful way for the world yet right so my big takeaway from that is that the any economic system at its base layer has to have some amount of labor where there's productive goods being created by human labor or maybe you know there could be mechanical labor or animals or something like that but it kind of like before we started recording we started talking about we're recording this in the week where ust is collapsed collapsing and we kind of talked about it kind of draws out of you this this meta question of what is stability and what you just said about labor being at the foundational building block of any economy sort of reminds me of that conversation that we had before we started recording do you want to say more about about that do you think that the the cornerstone of human labor in any economy is the foundation of the stability like if those goods if the if the needs of those people in that economy can be met is that stability how do you think about stability between this point and ust collapsing this week yeah so stability is interesting especially like you know in in recent times because it's it's relative right like where's that that you know ust is stable relative to the us dollar but the you know us dollar has not been stable for example against my house you know the like real estate prices are going up like crazy you know um like the the value here is like 20 higher this year than it was last year so like our the our anchor point just because you know everything's denominated in this like has become that like numerical value but you know um if you look at food prices right now food prices are going way up so you know you could imag like i think uh a more accurate measure of stability for example could be you know like what's the minimum like productivity you need to like produce and distribute enough food for everyone um you know food or like the literally like seeds to grow things like the the value of that you know so because that that sort of stability because you know money can't buy you food if there's no food so um you know if you want things to be stable as a society then we need sort of consistent food for everyone at a baseline um so yeah in that sense it's it's different and you know money and i said this in my like myself coordination talk to where money is sort of invented as an abstraction to convert you know one one form of value to another but it's not value itself you know value is everything outside of money um right and the like with like ust collapsing it's like the it they called it a stable coin but it was very unstable you know so in terms of oh it actually crashed and it didn't you know the when you when you hear stable it seems like it's something safe you know that that ponzi coin called safe moon you know just because it was add the word safe in it yeah but also the word is like a contradiction of a name i think there is this like deeper you know political and economic motive to really anchor this whole new crypto economy on this idea of stable coins which is what it has been up to this point but i think we should consider and explore opportunities to like move into a world where that isn't a part of the picture you know what does that look like if we can if we all have efficient ways of like you know distributing food amongst each other and like coordinating our labor together to like you know produce the things that we want to happen um and we minimize how much we have to go through this like you know stable coin layer which you know the only purpose of that really is to you know anchor it in some level of consistency but again if we can codify and measure like the state of what happened in a verifiable cryptographic way uh then we can start to like you know settle those essentially like off chain or off the order book of like you know fiat currency um and you know minimize how much we have to do there so even you look at like projects to like raise capital you know it's uh you raise all this money from one set of people which is the investors to then pay this other set of people which is your employees or you know contributors or whatnot um and then you know all the ownership and value accrues investors and over time the effect that has is you know capital concentration at the top um you know at a systemic level and same same with the concept of interest right uh the concept of if you have money to land you can extract money from people who need money to borrow fundamentally when you like average it all together you know the effect that causes is capital concentration at the time so you know if you look at these systems in a really like zoomed out way we think okay how can we like you know work against that and and create systems that are like the opposite of that where it's you know um more about giving and you have mechanisms for example to like reallocate capital um for example i think one really interesting uh place to look is islamic finance in islam they have this concept of zakat which is uh every year you essentially have to pay 2.5 percent of your net worth to directly to um this essentially the poorest people in your society so it's not a tax that the government takes that you know they decide how it's allocated it's like essentially like a pure ub ubi of like um the top basically like the top 80 percent of society has to pay this 2.5 on their net worth to the bottom 20 um and fundamentally if you look throughout history um there was like uh poverty and homelessness and that that was never an issue in any sort of like um islamic society throughout history so it's interesting you know that is actually like i'm pretty sure you could create like it's not too much to ask you know and actually helps to like disincentivize you know uh hoarding capital too um because you're not just paying taxes every on your income but you're paying taxes on your net worth um every year so you know there's these interesting concepts of how we can create these intentional mechanisms and you know sort of subscribe to them uh and sort of you know create our digital nation states that could you know have these sort of value flows encoded and then you know then instead of value from our like group of people leaking out and extracting we're able to like distribute more value to each other and then grow um as a as a little you know pod uh or little society of our of our own um so i think that that's an interesting design space for me uh is creating those intentional structures that allow uh not for value to like leak out continuously but for it to accrue continuously and it's all about ownership and you know um incentivizing people to like spend you know within their own communities uh and you know i think you know the future of venture capital even it's not going to be you know career vcs and like everyone else i think everyone is gonna become a venture capitalist in that community vc exactly yeah like every individual will be you know allocating small amounts of capital no matter how much they have to the things they believe in and the changes they want to see in the world and if they have a way you know because right now you know venture capital it's like there's all these like legal things and yet that got in the way like about connections you have all this stuff but you know fundamentally like venture capital doesn't have to be something that's restricted to you know a specific set of people and when you even when you like get into it you realize it's really not that complicated and you know they don't really have any you know uh special skills more than anyone else more than just you know contacts and information so if you can better distribute context and information then um everyone can be a capital allocator and will get a much more nuanced uh and sort of self-sustaining you know biomim biomedic system uh to to lift each other up wow um i have so many threads i want to pull on and then part of me during your what you just said just wanted to like sit back and kind of enjoy the ride as as we sort of went through the world game landscape that it's in your head it's very profound um but i guess since we ended on biomimicry that's the thread that i'll pull uh i just recently read your shelling point talk or i guess i didn't read your selling point talk i listened to your selling point talk which was entitled mycelio coordination you talked about how you take a lot of inspiration from nature and mycelium networks and and i'm wondering if we could kind of go there so what it what what inspiration do you take from biomimicry as you're designing these systems what are your favorite natural systems that and how do they resemble the world game that that we teed off the episode with yeah for sure um i think mycelium is definitely a big one uh just from the fact that essentially it's like nature's internet um right it acts as you explain what it is real quick just because i'm not sure everyone will know yeah mycelium is essentially the uh it's a you can consider it like the common ancestor between plants and animals um it's the fungal networks that essentially act as a communication so they distribute resources um and also like electrical signals and it can mycelium it's a it is a living organism it can like stretch to be like many kilometers wide and it connects like you know large ecosystems and forests and the mushrooms is essentially the fruit of mycelium um so the interesting part about mycelium is they're you know for example if there's a tree and it like catches some illness uh it'll communicate those stress signals through this mycelial network to other trees and then other trees can actually send resources back to help you know heal that tree um and for that reason it's like you know no trees horizon or forest alone and if we you know how do we recreate that in our systems you know for me i've like i've done this just individually where you know just in the community i see a lot of people or like you know some i'll come across someone who's like really high potential but they're not like you know struggling financially a bit you know like we're really like eager and interested in getting web three i would literally just like send them a bunch of tokens you know from you know like whatever dow tokens i earned that you know it ends up being a large amount or like a decently sized amount if you launched any dial and you got like a a good allocation and you know you're not going to be dumping those tokens uh you know maybe just a little bit to pay your expenses but overall it's like that those tokens aren't doing me any good just sitting there yeah it's like inflates my portfolio number but you know that that can all disappear in two days like crazy so is that my ceiling or is that like a zakat like a cut i mean it's it's it's it's both kind of it's for me it's like it's actually advantageous for me to do this because like the the meta game of it is that they're going to actually like you know really appreciate that and then right like loyalty i guess if you want to look at it as like a zero something it builds loyalty exactly yeah yeah that's the interesting thing is like there's the um the human brain there's like the immediate thing it wants to do from like it's like the three levels of self which is like the lowest self you know you think about my wife's a dietitian so i like to use food analogies too if you only eat what your brain like thinks is good to eat you'd be eating like candy and pizza and chocolate and all that and it would actually be very bad for you right but if you actually go against that instinct and you know eat like vegetables and things that you don't want to eat that's actually what's best for you you know and this applies to everything in life where um if you sort of listen to that instinctual thing that you want and then do the exact opposite of that that's actually the path to like happiness um and and fulfillment and counter-intuitively so so you know that's the thing is like the positive sum thing actually in a way you could twist or you could say it becomes like a zero something or that also could be the most like self-optimal method long term because it does result in the most like you know net happiness for everyone and others people's happiness is actually you know a function of your happiness which is what people don't realize you know they think uh if they increase their happiness with at the expense of everyone else but because you know spending money on others for example you know increases your happiness you know that right in that way it's like you know uh much better for you and if you're attuned to that and you start to like like disassociate yourself from that sort of you know version of yourself that's like really kind of uh the animalistic self essentially that's like you know i think that's kind of the thing a lot of the time that separates you know animals and humans and i think what makes like humans so special is that ability to act against that sort of baseline animalistic off yeah sometimes sometimes the default is high functioning sometimes it's not yeah um yeah back to the nature thing real quick uh so um my cellular networks it's interesting because they serve a bunch of different functions in nature and we've started to like replicate those the the structure of these mycelial networks basically looks the exact same as the structure of the neurons in your brain um looks the exact same as like you know river systems and tree branches and also the structure of the internet um so the internet you know started serving one purpose that the mycelium served as communicating information between you know all these entities where instead of just going through like mainstream media we now had the internet to communicate at the edges of the network um so that's one thing that's one checkbox we did the other thing mycelium does that i mentioned is distributing resources and i think now with ethereum we have the ability to like you know move around resources and distribute them rapidly uh in this digital context so you know the internet with ethereum has now been able to you do information and resources just like mycelium the other thing that mycelium does that we haven't actually figured out yet is mycelium decomposes things so anytime you know if you have some fruit that's just lying on the ground eventually it'll rot and decompose and you know uh get consumed by nature and you know it's garb the idea of garbage is actually invented by humans garbage did not exist before humans everything in nature would otherwise get sort of decomposed and reuse into something else and you know something that'll actually grow you know into something bigger and better than the thing that died so the the cycle of death that the death there is feature a feature not a bug you know we see it as a bug because we're sort of seeing it from our individual perspective and our fear of death um but the in a larger system if that if mycelium wasn't able to decompose and then redistribute those resources like nature and the world we have would have never existed because things would just you know um accumulate into chaos and or you know accumulate and just you know uh like a cancer basically the cancer is the only thing in nature that you know grows forever and doesn't die and get recycled until it consumes its host right exactly yeah so that's that's the trajectory we're on right now and it's you know mycelium is the thing that's you know prevents nature as a whole from getting there and i think once we you know realize that i think where like humanity as a whole is kind of in its like it's like college era like phase of existence you are is that what you're saying yeah like we party too hard we like realize we're getting you know like we can't handle it like we could before you know where it's starting to move out of our like rebellious teen phase and starting to be a bit more mature as a society as whole so i think you know um the this is what i'm really interested in is how do we bring this idea of decomposition um into the picture and what does that look like you know that's that that for me is like going to be like you know just as like what the internet did for information and what ethereum did for resources this decomposition piece is i think what will really be that you know engine that will allow things to flourish much better it kind of reminds me of you know we talk about product funerals like if you try to launch a product and it doesn't work out have a funeral for it and say your piece and that allows people to emotionally let go and say goodbye to the product and learn things and then the people get reallocated to other products whether within the organization or in another organization feels like that would be a dow equivalent of decomposition yeah basically um i think even so another example from meta factory is where like we've grown to a size that we're now decomposing ourselves into a bunch of different like child dials um so you know we have a metaverse team that's focused purely on the digital side and the nfts and the virtual worlds we have our fashion team that's focused on like the actual fabrics and the construction and all that we have our logistics team that's focused on like the um shipping and you know all that side of things then the dow team so essentially like you know instead of growing this one entity forever we sort of created a bunch of like child entities that in a way is decomposition um and allows for like a new like cycle of regrowth um and you know the it's like when things decompose it's like fertilizer um and we always people talk about like coin um and i i make i like to make this joke where you know coin is only good if you like spread it around everywhere just like you know if you take and spread around everywhere it's fertilizer and helps things grow but if you just hold on to it and accumulate it it's going to like just make you smelly and gross i think we'll be have been successful meaning mycelium if coin becomes not a pejorative but a good thing yeah no it's about yeah and i think that's some of these you know this future of you know mapping out this world game will look a lot like that where we have you know and this kind of goes into vitalik's essay or not i mean the one he this decentralized society essay of finding web through seoul um the idea that you know people can create sold bonded tokens which is some sort of recognition or affirmation that someone you know is of value to you or has created some value and i think if we all have our coins and we're all you know being diligent of where we're spreading our coins then that those are all just data points on you know mapping out our value networks our value graphs bring this back to the marketing team at get coin new grants get coin grand slogan be diligent about where you spread around your coins to the ethereum network they're gonna be like kevin why'd you say that on the podcast because i was drinking the kool-aid from meta meta dreamer that's why when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet

[Music] i want to ask you a question that's been sort of like at the tip of my tongue since we started talking about biomimicry um and it's uh you know in your in your mycelial coordination talk we we talked a little bit about money as a means and not as an end and one of the problems with the traditional financial system is money becoming an end for people and the fact that investment bankers make so much more than teachers despite the fact that teachers create value for the ecosystem investment bankers are in in the center of the capital um or like the flow of capital and so they can kind of pinch off more for themselves and so i guess i guess what this leads me to is like you know my view the problem with the traditional financial system is that it like it has these like intermediaries that capture the value and they're not always the the people who are creating value for the system so why is it that like trees in these underground networks with my serial networks don't have that problem let's say like a tree equivalent of like an investment banker who's like pulling the resources from tree a taking a cut for itself and then sending it over to tree tree b is it just a matter of scale or is nature just smarter than we are do you even agree with the premise of the question does nature have investment bankers is what i'm asking you met a dreamer yeah so this is really interesting um because i think fundamentally the the difference is um the concept of interest if you eliminated the concept of interest from society or financial systems i think then it'll start behaving a lot more like it does in nature um i think you know this this idea of because again money isn't value it's this like ephemeral sort of you know um undefined like state that it's a channel for value it's a channel for value but with interest what you're saying is like this is a real thing that is valuable that then you know uh you're gonna like allow people to like rent essentially interest is like renting out money and like you know as an asset and you know earning off that so what that happens is like that acts as like extractive of like all of the value around it and it becomes like maximizing gdp maximizing this number game um but if you created a system in which like people aren't making money just off of like lending other people money uh and instead they have to invest in other people like you know because like interest is like you're taking a you're essentially investing people without any risk on your side or downside on your side it's not your investment you know in that way so if you then if you limited interest then everyone starts to switch their mind into like actually creating value and not just extracting it from everyone else because to get to generate value themselves they can't just like accumulate more and more value and let that grow on its own that's like that's the cancerous part um they didn't have to like actually like put like decompose and destroy that value into you know something real that could then in the future generate more value and i think that's what nature you know and that's why i think like the concept of interest is fundamentally you know against the nature of reality or how nature should operate and that's why you know nature doesn't have that issue um so it's i mean this is pretty like controversial thing to say in in d5 which is like it's like everything here is built off of you know interest off stable coins and lending and all this stuff um so saying that we should like throw that all away is pretty bold but i think it's you know if we try it out and really like project out what what changes that would make um in how different how these systems work and what incentives it changes i think it really would drive us towards a much better place um that is you know much more positive sum right yeah for me that's the big takeaway from what you said is positive some games instead of zero-sum games uh in this forest uh basically the creation the consumption of energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil allows the growth of these organisms and all of the organisms are sort of co-mingled with each other you know i uh aya from the ethereum foundation the executive director of the ethereum foundation talks about this infinite garden of ethereum where you've got this substrate through which all these different fauna are growing next to each other and on top of each other and the most beautiful thing that we can create is this sort of symbiotic relationship between metacartel and gitcoin and compound and coordinate and all of these different projects in which we each inhabit our own little niche in the ecosystem but are modularly good citizens to each other in a different way and you know the bi that's where the biomimicry thing for me gets really exciting is is thinking about not the gdp but the the gross domestic utility of that infinite garden that we're that we're building here and you know i'm wondering what that brings up for you yeah for sure um i definitely love the infinite garden um meme i think it's super appropriate um the there's like one project i'm working on too called astro drop and the idea for it is to be like the irrigation system for the infinite garden um and you know i think even what we're talking about it's like right now the infinite garden the way capital allocation happens is just like you know people walking around with buckets of water um and like dumping it where they think it should and like you know drinking half a bucket on the way there because they got thirsty and then you know versus a system in which we have like moisture sensors like in a grid all over the ground and we can detect exactly where it's more dry and then have like a advanced like you know irrigation system that can spray the right amount of water exactly where it's needed right and you know then it eliminates the because humans aren't good at that stuff computers are good that stuff yeah you talked about this in oh sorry go ahead no go ahead you see i was gonna say you talked about this a bit in your talk which is basically we've got all these ways of like raising money in this space we're not like a good way of distributing value to a multitude of and i think that you're you know the irrigation you know that's like kind of what you're talking about with irrigation exactly is how do we distribute to a group of people it's almost like multiplayer money multiplayer distribution games um i think there's gonna be a pluralism of them which is the coolest thing for sure um yeah that's that's definitely it is you know crypto right now is really good at concentrating capital really rapidly you know new nft drop you know to a few hundred million in sales uh new d5 protocol like billions in tpl um and doing that rapidly but we haven't ever thought like hey how do we rapidly distribute money effectively like let's say someone has like a billion dollars they need to like liquidate to make the most impact possible in the shortest amount of time how can you create systems to do that and i think there hasn't been too much focus on that thus far but i think there will be an increasing amount of focus as we you know start to move to these systems where you know labor and the the state of the world and who's doing what and people's relationships do start to get encoded on chain as well um instead of you know because cryptography is so much more than just you know keeping track of uh a number and a contract you know that's all what tokens and the finance part is is like moving around numbers in a contract but we can use cryptography to keep you know make statements and attestations and signal our value and do like much much more richer things with so you know this i think is that that would be like the fertilizer for for the infinite garden um and you know it's very much like permaculture um rather than you know like an industrialized you know farm where we're maximizing yield yeah i mean i think it kind of brings me back to the where we started in this episode was was this world game in the end game being maximizing the utility for the 100 of the humans and in labor being a cornerstone of any economy it's easy to hear the world game thing and think oh they're just moralizing like the bucky fuller thing maximizing the utility for 100 of the humans is is moralizing but when you consider that the humans are the foundation of this economy it almost looks like you're creating this infinite loop in which you distribute money to the humans so they can pay their rent and pay their mortgages and feed their families and they can continue generating value back for the infinite garden which creates this closed loop where there's just more utility being created because you're distributing more money to more of the humans so um i know it just feels like this very beautiful thing in which in which by solving for distributive distribution of capital to the world's workers to the workers in the infinite garden you're able to create more growth like more alpha in the in the infinite garden uh how does how does that land with you yeah um i think it makes a lot of sense uh but one one thing i think might be different is you know instead of people like giving money to everyone so they can pay their rent and pay them for their food we have a system in which food is just free um and you know so there's so much abundance yeah like that it's more of like an abundance mentality either like food is free or for example for living like um that the system is set up in that you know the the value you create you know downstream is like accounted for with like you know the living so if you're living here you're also you know for example drew he has his farm he's building out in colorado um and his idea is like to build out these yurts where you know anyone who's a contributor to meta factory can like you know stay there and like live for free for a percentage of the um like a percentage of like the tokens they'll earn um as a contributor uh so that's really interesting because it's then again not people extracting value from others just you know um but actually like taking a bet on others because there is a risk on for both parties you know participating in that in that you know they are trusting the other to actually pull through and do this thing um versus you know like loans like student loans it's like the the school or the bank is not right the the the banks don't get paid no matter how well your school goes or not there's no like that's not a symbiotic relationship um so yeah i think you know it'll also look more like moving into a post-money world where we don't we're not forced to go through this channel of money um because the the money is also a form of control um by you know the people that issue the money and it's there is an incentive for them to like keep the focal point that that form of money um but if we can like detach ourselves from that a bit then it allows us to be a lot more like self-sustainable in like local zones um without needing you know uh the rest of the system and it really does go into like agriculture and food production and everything like that too where if you look at like the food supply chain it is very centralized and it doesn't need to be at all and it's like highly inefficient um you know if you if you actually did it if you set it up right you could grow enough food for the entire world and like the like in like half of texas um if if you just you know mapped it all correctly um so yeah beautiful well we are coming up on time i got about five minutes left so i i want to ask you i want to ask you if there's anything that we didn't cover that you that you want to say um nothing in particular per se um i just think uh one thing i always like to say is you know whatever we're doing here um and people who are sort of listening or interested in this sort of stuff it's not really about learning these new concepts it's more so about unlearning all the like legacy stuff or sort of these assumptions that you made because these new concepts are much they're sort of innate in ourselves and in nature and you know we we can sort of intuit how things should be it's just the you know the external influence of you know um even you think about consumerism and media and advertising like those really shift and shape like how people want you to think but um right the answer is in nature itself because nature you know is an incredibly complex system that's highly coordinated and you know extremely you know uh effective and we are a product of nature you know ourselves so you know we shouldn't sort of think down on nature or think that we're smarter than it but look to it actually for inspiration um and you know the uh the way it operates like the the the answers are already there basically we're just dusting for the fingerprints you know it's like the sacred geometry the patterns we have to like try things out do iterative games um you know instead of having cycles of failure of like you know 70 years or these large sort of you know boom bust cycles try to have like failures and game loops every single day even you know because the faster we can start and end the game and learn a lesson and iterate and play many many games together the faster will you know move together instead of being afraid of losing and therefore trying to keep this game going forever you know like embrace death embrace loss uh you know embrace like getting dirty um the the idea of cleanliness too this is interesting like you know uh cleanliness is only like good if there's also like dirtiness if you have you know complete sterile cleanliness then no life can survive you know like it's just completely sterile and that's a dystopia but if you have like complete filth then it like it it's like disease and disgust and all that in humans we have a natural aversion to cleanliness or a natural aversion to you know uh filth um and you know it's biological but if we the cleanliness is not about eliminating the filth entirely it's about cleaning up so you can get back in the filth again and you know then clean up again and you know continue to iterate you know it's just it's about people you take it too far and you're like oh filth is bad therefore we must eliminate it entirely and when you do that then no life can happen so um i think you know thinking about these polars and dualisms and in nature and you know understanding the balance of it the thing that you oppose or hate you know maybe it's actually a necessity um to allow this system to function and keep its balance um yeah amazing um and you're you're you're definitely too humble to do it uh so i'm gonna show meta factory for you meta factory makes some of the best swag in the web 3 space so our listeners should check out meta factory and pick up some of the some of the swag that you all sell where can people find you online metadreamer uh i'm on twitter at meta underscore dreamer um you'll find everything else from there sounds good any any any parting thoughts as we close the episode um no just uh gm and hopefully the we'll all make it together through this bear gm wag me all right thanks so much meta appreciate you man appreciate you too [Music] you
