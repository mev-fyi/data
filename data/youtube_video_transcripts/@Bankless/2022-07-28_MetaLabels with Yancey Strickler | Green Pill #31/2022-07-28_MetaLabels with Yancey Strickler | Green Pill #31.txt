foreign [Music] what's up coordination how you doing on the Pod today we got Yancy strickler the founder of Kickstarter also wrote a book called this could be your future that introduced me to the concept of bentoism Beyond near term orientation the idea of going from Naomi to Future us how do we build economies and companies and dowels that optimize for all of us and optimize for beyond your term orientation it's called bentoism yes he's been a huge inspiration for me as I've gone down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and the Bitcoin Dow rabbit hole and also as I wrote green pill bentoism is actually one of the first ideas that we put into the book and so it's really cool to hear about his new project meta label which is basically Creation in multiplayer mode and so Yancey is deeply talented deeply networked and has a lot of really great thoughts about how creators can work together in order to create what he calls meta labels so I think this is a really fun episode and it's been a lot of it's it's just Vince he's like a mentor and like an idol to me so it's it's really great to green pill him on this episode so without further Ado I'll give you Yancy strickler the founder of

going hey what's up Kevin how you doing pretty good thanks uh jumping between all the things I think we we both might be doing that so uh can you tell us about meta-label and what what took you here or got you to to metal label uh yeah so um so my name is Yancy strickler I'm one of six co-founders of meta label meta labels a a project that began a year ago and was really born out of a pain I felt as a what I came to realize was a lonely Creator trapped in the Creator economy where I was um leading a community had had written a book I was like doing doing all the hustles and uh but really felt isolated alone in this experience and I ended up my my original background is in music and I ended up thinking about how a lot of indie record labels work and how they are effectively groups of people who just all care about the same genre or idea and they're collaborating to release work together they're releasing work by others they're like every time Discord records would put out a new Punk record it's like manifesting more punkness in the world and I connected that that structure with my experience and what I was experiencing with a group of people I was collaborating with and what this has evolved into is is meta-label and a meta label like like we as a group a meta label is a release Club where groups of people who share the same interests collaboratively drop and support each other's work and so uh Punk record label is a meta label it's a group of people who care about Punk releasing work but there are a lot of projects that fit this structure that we don't really think of as being labels um like in the web today there's something like Mischief I think is an example of a of a meta label and a really evocative way right can you say more about Mischief just yeah I'm not sure everyone knows what it is yeah so mischief.xyz uh although not a web 3 project uh but they have a drop every two weeks that's always some different absurd comment on basically how manipulative capitalism is by always being these highly manipulative capitalist drops they made skateboard shoes with Jimmy Fallon last week they they paid people's medical beer bills and sweepstakes and they have all these distinct releases that ultimately create a kind of a world view that if you're in on the joke you get it but I think I think git coin is also an example of a meta-label where you all are a group of people who are inspired by public goods and you produce distinct releases whether it's your funding Grant rounds or kernel or shelling point or the Dow that are all meant to manifest a greater appreciation for public goods in the world and so I think that this structure where a group of people who care about the same aesthetic goal cultural goal activist goal uh where they can pool resources where they can drop work as a group I believe that this is a needed piece of infrastructure and and it's something that describes a lot of really powerful projects in history and I personally have experienced going from the lonely Creator who's just like competing with everyone else for subscribers in the Creator economy to now feeling more like I'm creating a multiplayer mode where I'm collaborating with five or six other people and sometimes a drop is more mind to lead and other people are supporting me and we talk about how we hold each other's hands during a drop like so because those are anxious moments before you release something but in other projects like a drop meta label is going to do this week other people are the lead and I get to support them and I get to help their vision and so it is a different way of working but yet also produces shared economic uh structures and a lot more so I I you know so I I'm exploring something that brought me a lot of value personally in my life and that we are building tools in a world to let other people do the same it's quite beautiful so a metal label you said is creativity multiplayer mode a model for collaboration Collective World building and mutual support and I always see this as an extension of your past work which is as the founder of Kickstarter which was kind of fundraising in multiplayer mode and cutting out the existing structures there do you see it on that continuum yeah absolutely I mean I think that um you know Kickstarter created a new piece of infrastructure it was a new model for how to fund work it was a a new model for how the public could be involved in a work or could validate a work and I mean it's to this date it's like six billion dollars have flown through to creative projects through Kickstarter I believe something like that that's amazing yeah you probably touched millions of lives then the million the lives of millions create of creators through that quite indirectly but sure they're very very highly indirectly but yes I mean I feel you know I I definitely look at Kickstarter as a model I mean like for example there was four years of us going around and pitching the idea of what now people call crowdfunding four years of pitching without anything to point to and it would take forever to explain what crowdfunding was forever to explain you know the intricacies of this and then when you would show someone a web page it took like less than 10 seconds people like oh why didn't you tell me and I'm like I was you know we were trying we're trying it's just some some things are either easier to experience than explain but but yeah I mean I I see Kickstarter as no one knew that there needed to be a door there and then one appeared and that door represented a way for Creative people to go straight to their audiences to get support and I believe that the door that does not exist that is going to feel very obvious to people is what are simple structures for us to collaborate together and and the beauty of the way we're building a meta label is you know it is a it is an on-chain entity it's plumbing will be on chain but that will have a shared treasury where a certain percentage every meta label will Design their own economic structure but a certain percentage of the revenue will all return to the metal label treasury which can be used to invest in new projects or people can withdraw from and it becomes growing Capital over time and and that this is something that can happen just around a specific cause if you and I just care about uh solar Punk and we're like all right we're going to make solar Punk Comics together at all revenue from solar Punk Comics are going to our solar Punk comic publisher that we're going to create and we're going to give out Apple grand every month to a new solar Punk artist because we want more people to appreciate that like that becomes not um some pie in the sky idea that actually becomes a viable business model that becomes something that for which there is infrastructure for which there is tooling and for which there is a term um and so we we first announced the meta-label concept uh in February like I wrote We published this essay I had written and been working on for about a year thinking about it and you know since then we've heard from several hundred groups riding in being like I think you've just described what I am and I didn't know I didn't know what I was and I struggled to say what I was and you know currently right now we're running a cohort program called assembly where we invited groups to apply and we picked 39 um amazing groups all around the world half of which I'd say are web 3 half are not web at all they're cultural and we're all together learning how to collaborate how to release work how to create catalogs having people like stolen camp in to talk about how to collaborate or Extinction rebellions Extinction rebellions and as a cohort in a member of the cohort and so you know this idea has definitely found people for whom this is already like a very valuable way of working but it's one that hasn't fit in and um and so we think that much like you know crowdfunding was a door that needed to exist I I very much think the same for meta labels and that it's a it's like a model that's in between a for-profit and a non-profit and it's it's a model that maximizes for cultural impact and that's what great record labels have always been that's what great art galleries have been that's always what great magazines have been and they struggle to survive in the for-profit context but I believe this is a context where they can flourish and last right so so take me forward let's call it 10 15 years if metal label is really successful what will that have Unleashed can you paint me a picture of that world well I think that meta-label is a part of a larger series of changes that I I believe that the uh that the internet this is going to sound like so Boomer but I'm gonna build on this uh the internet like re-individualized us all before the internet we our lives are determined by where we grew up and who our families were and what we looked like to a large degree after the internet we've now had this Infinite Space going deeper in this imaginary world of the web that is over wrapped and enveloped everything and it's becoming more powerful than the physical world that gave birth to it in the first place and and so on the web we are discovering these infinite cells this is a concept I call being a post-individual where you can create these infinite different individualized selves and alts that are all real to some degree or not and online life is filled with how all those alts and people interact with each other and what I believe is that in a in an individualistic world what matters is something like it's a Creator economy thing how many followers do I have how many people listen to my broadcast is like an individualist way of thinking a post-individual is thinking way of thinking which is what I think the world is moving into it's more like what private chats am I a part of what what DMS who's dming me and who do I DM back what is the quality of my network to what groups do I belong because what you discover is if you look back to the moment when humans were first individualized there's two great books on this the weirdest people in the world by Joseph Heinrich and inventing the individual by Larry seidentop and they both say point to a moment when the Catholic church in about 1000 A.D roughly the Catholic Church began to ban cousin marriage not a phrase you're expecting to hear on the green pillow podcast today um but the the church decided to ban because of marriage and what happened was that until that point families acted more like Clans and cousins within families would marry each other to create more centralized familial Clan power and when the church prohibited this gradually and then very quickly it changed Society because suddenly you the young people had to meet people in other clans and so there had to be new spaces where people could meet each other and it was within about a hundred years of this happening that the city the university the guild and the monastery were all invented and so what happened when people became individuals they had to create new structures that allowed them context to coordinate to make meaning to do things together um and so that that's quickly what they discovered and what they did the web has similarly re-individualized it's pulled us from our familial context in a different kind of way and online we're we're individuals in in you know in a very multiplicitous kind of way and I think that what we're moving to towards is a world where we are creating the institutions of the 21st century and the next several centuries that are going to be based on online kind of first principles that are um and in that world the groups that we are all members of that we can call ourselves members of become incredibly meaningful and in that world I believe that creative people need a kind of a squad structure to work together that they will similarly need the economic resources and the allyship and the mutual support that a lot of other forms of identity will also create and so in that world it's in that world that I think a meta-label or a structure very much like it becomes incredibly important because he's ultimately become new sources of income and solidarity and you know sustainability for their members and and you know so I believe a world where you know right right now labels are seen as elitist but that's just because there aren't enough of them I wanna where there's millions of labels and everyone belongs to multiple communities through which feed them in different ways economic ways creative ways emotional ways and and that's what I think that's what where I think we're going and and so I would say like Dows and meta labels I think they're more the smoke than the fire and the fire is the way that the internet continues to change society and we are you know moving along through those changes with eyes semi-open that's where colliding colliding and trying to make it yeah so so it sounds like the meta label is part of a broader context in which the the internet it has re-individualized ourselves and and now we're kind of like talking about a post-individualist uh Squad that is creating together and this actually feels like a great segue into talking really briefly for The Listener about the concept of bentoism which I first read about when I read your book uh this this can be our future this could be our uh future do you want to talk about bentoism because I think the idea of uh future us and now us kind of kind of fits into into that yeah um the Bento is a a basically a a thought structure a decision-making framework that I worked on and built a community around for for several years and the Bento is an acronym that stands for Beyond near-term orientation and um one day I was thinking about the concept of self-interest and I was doodling in a notebook a hockey stick graph and I thought this you know this is our image of self-interest today like see in your slide deck that yeah revenue is going up that's it right yeah up and to the right and um and I just I I don't know I just tried extending the lines of the X and Y axis because I thought you know the the time axis keeps going as far into the future as we want and also the axis measuring self-interest I also that think that keeps growing like that can go infinitely and also the more your self-interest grows like other things happen too and so when I when I expanded this suddenly there's this giant space and this like hockey stick graph is just this tiny tiny little Mark in one corner of it it ended up turning this into a basic sort of two by two of four quadrants and and the bottom left was the bottom left box is now me and that's where that uh that hockey stick graphs lives and that's that's the concept of self-interest that we all live with generally today which is you know what I need want and need right now is what matters and these are like low things on Maslow's hierarchy but if you move to the bottom right box you see future me which is the person that you will become or you hope to become and what you quickly realize is you see that is that person becomes real or not real at any given moment based on what now me is doing if you move up to the top left uh above now me you have now us um you know because as your decisions uh as your self-interest grows you have responsibilities your decisions affect your family the people around you so thinking about them and their needs is also part of your self-interest and finally you have future Us in the top right corner which represents your kids if you have them or future kids and you see how the choices you make you should make them thinking about their interests and uh and just like filtering your choices yeah through what it would do for them and what's important for them and as you as I like Came Upon This form for the first time uh it instantly felt very true to me um and I wrote written down a written down a very basic description Beyond near-term orientation that's what this was a picture of and I realized that made an acronym for bento like the the bento box and the bento box is great because it the whole idea is that it's honoring this Japanese dieting tradition called harahachibu which says the goal of a meal is to be 80 full that way you're still hungry for tomorrow so a Bento is like a similar idea it's a way to make you aware of these other spaces in which your decisions live in which they have impact and in which like you have deep vested interests but generally we struggle to think about with much Clarity and and so the Bento is a is a tool it's a tool to just make you more aware of what's already happening for you and what you want to have happen um and so it's it's still something I I use uh frequently and the Bento Society who's a amazing Community I led for a couple years that had couple thousand numbers and um you know just uh something I believe very strongly in beautiful I mean I I think it was kind of a a mind-blowing moment for me to learn about bentoism in that two by two Matrix of now me now US future me and future us and one of the things that I did in the green pill book which is this book that I wrote about how crypto could regenerate the world was I actually played with expanding that up from a two by two Matrix to like a 16 by 16 Matrix and so I spended the time out from Naomi plus one hour me plus one day me plus one week me plus one month me plus you get the idea and then I expanded the uh the collective angle from from me to uh me and my wife to me and my wife and our kids me and my wife and my family me and my wife and get coin Dao me uh like like basically out until all of humanity and you know like the dunbar's number thing about how you can only care about 500 people at once and so I'm actually wondering just to just to kind of ask you point blank if you have any if you have any problem with that like forking it and adding a bunch of different is because the gradient of that is quite beautiful you know when you're thinking about your Dow and how many people you're you're kind of thinking about when you're governing it uh I thought it was interesting to expand and build on top of bentoism I I love it let's let's make it Canon you know I I'm I'm I'm into it um yeah I saw someone else made a Bento that expanded it to past me and past us I've seen others go like more boxes on top to go to more of like Universal values um that that is my hope I mean I you know I I came to recognize and and thinking about a meta-label concept that like the Bento is a release by me and it's a release in a series of projects that are all related to exploring concepts of value in the self and like the Dark Forest theory of the internet of piece I did a few years ago is example of this a lot of the work on Kickstarter even the work on metal label is all in a similar place but there's a real power when you as an individual or you as a group of people can come to see like that deeper through line in your work can come to understand like what it really is is you're trying to reinforce with your projects um and then that allows you to be be more creative in how you express them right like I feel like forget coin the the clarity of public goods creates a lot of permission to like mean more easily and to do a lot of other things right and directional in meme space for everyone yeah yeah there's a there's a great line that um Charlie Waterhouse who's the one of the creative directors of Extinction Rebellion said in our assembly thing the other day which is um if you're if he's talking to a group of meta labels and he says if you're a meta-label and he sees Extinction rebellions and metal label if you're a meta-label and you have your purpose right then it doesn't matter if your releases are good or bad what matters is like you're telling a story in the long run and you are like creating you're creating a world you know you're building a world for other people to participate in in the case of something like like XR you're trying to make your world so powerful it comes to overtake you know certain levels of power in the in the wider world but for other communities it's probably just to be recognized or just to not feel alone or just to have a collaborator when you need one and so that you know if I think about what where the Creator economy has left us of like we all have our own subscription lists we're trying to build and all this sort of stuff um to me it says the goal clearly the goal of like we're all the star of our show is like not a great goal and a goal and a goal where part of a group of people who are successful in expressing themselves the way the way they wish to express you know and but we're more like a boy band than Bieber you know like I think that's uh yeah I I think that's a viable path and I think it's one that a lot of people will will gladly opt into yeah I mean there's nothing really better than seeing your friends in your squad succeed and I think that the joint success is more powerful than the individual success in a lot of ways and you know I guess I'm wondering like how these groups find each other I actually just had biology us for us and on the podcast and he was talking about the network State and how each Network state has to have what he calls a one commandment which is something that you think is wrong with the world that you want to correct and that becomes your sort of aggregator your memetic filter would you say that each meta label has to have a one commandment or can it just be based off of the vibe of a certain group or something else um we we have it designated and we have a tool on our site metalabel.xyz it's the one called elements of a metal label to help you do this but the way I would classify that as purpose you know every meta label has to have a purpose and that purpose is expressed through releases um so a meta label is not just like a passive social club like it exists to create work and put it into the world and how it does that is incredibly open-ended it can be software events whatever protests but but what what makes it powerful is if you have disparate voices uh disparate artifacts that are all reinforcing that same core purpose but that purpose could be for Discord records it was like you're you're kind of a punk band or a hard band around Washington DC you know if you are the Royal Society which is the group started in the late 17th century that literally inspired the enlightenment um you know they've been like a credentialed society of people who believe in science for like 600 years and they've made scenes that are scientific journals um and so there I believe that there is that there is that calling um because really like why do you why do you join something you join someone to be a part of something bigger than you so it's going to need to have something at its heart that moves you that speaks to your spirit I don't think you're going to do these things in my mind a meta label is not an investment Club you're not doing it because it's like let's get rich together you're doing it because you believe in a shared Vision or future you believe that an idea is unappreciated yeah yeah but you know in a Balaji language yeah saying it's about a disagreement with the world that like you know some some maybe some groups would use that language maybe other groups would object to the language and would see it in a softer way but but I think that that might be that might be a reasonable way to put a it's just interesting to me the sort of pluralism of different ways that people are talking about Collective action online from literally talking about it in an academic language collective intelligence to talking about it as a doubt talking about a squad wealth to talking about Network states to talking about meta-label I kind of IM Envision I see like a cheat sheet of what attributes each of these has and how they relate to each other but I'm on metal label.xyz which we'll definitely put in the show notes and it says that the elements of a meta label are the purpose a squad releases and then participation so I found that quite quite interesting Yeah so basically if you you know if if your group of people if you do if you define what your purpose is why your group if you define who the members are if you define what type of releases you want to put out we're going to write posts we're going to do a podcast we're going to throw events and you determine your rules of participation which is who owns what how does money work if you if you come to decisions about those things as a group of people it will create just organically a shape and an output of your work we're going to have case studies soon on the metal label site where we'll show how this how this applies to someone like the Royal Society or someone like the gorilla girls these great activists in the 80s and and today and and demonstrate how that really how that framework and structure really does produce a consistent output and uh and so that that I think is becomes really powerful and and allows these labels to build a catalog okay got it so the releases form a catalog and over time I guess that like is the vessel through which the cultural impact of the metal meta label happens exactly immutable X is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive

about now I know that you're running your first cohort right now but in might be too early to talk through through any of them can you can you say more about tangible examples yeah sure I mean I think I mean I would look at song Camp which is a project I imagine uh some of your listeners know about of um of their releases there was the first song camp Camp then there was Elektra and then chaos but each of those were a distinct drop by a group of musicians dedicated to reimagining what it is to release music how to release music and together they've made three drops today and their last drop made you know over a half a million dollars in each when they released the chaos packs last month and so you know Matthew cham the the founders on Camp he joined us at assembly and he talks about um his work and really he sees a meta label as being a container designer where it allows a group of people to collaborate together on a project um you know we also have in in that group several Dows like uh the Voyager Dao or even a project like catalog that also like very much connect with the metal label framing because um there are groups of people who maybe care about independent music or about certain types of culture uh and they they have a lot of different skill sets in their group and they want to drop different kinds of releases and they're interested in funding works and so the meta-label model is something that fits with them quite well um and then you know a personal favorite of mine is a group called The Wide awakes which is started by the artist Hank Willis Thomas members of The Roots uh our members it's a group of activists and artists who uh decided that they wanted to do all their political work together under one name and through that they've done things like put Billboards and all 50 U.S states uh created a mobile soup kitchen they throw big street parties celebrating Community activists they find interesting ways to fund their projects and they do all these disparate drops that are all quite unexpected and they all have this Core theme of helping people become wide awake to their community and uh it's just it's just a beautiful project that is is hard to tell what it is from the outside but once you begin to see the world through this lens of there are groups of people who have a shared purpose and they just do different releases together then suddenly you could see the underlying structure um and so I I personally think that there are there are many examples around us and that uh a number of dowels will end up creating meta labels so creating explicit arms of um of their activity that is about dropping things creating releases creating culture I mean FWB I think is like the gold standard at this with so much of what they do nouns is a as another fun example um but so I think that this is a form that is is kind of Internet native is rising and uh and I think something that more and more people are going to want to be a part of right yeah I gotta say the meta-label.xyz website is just beautiful and I know that this is an audio only pod so it can't transmit that to to anyone who's listening out there but if it strikes me as just this totally genuine High Fidelity look in into into these meta labels and and it just feels so much more beautiful the the art that I'm seeing at these meta labels that I'm checking out then anything that could be created by some uh top down monolithic record label and and I wonder I wonder if that's a feature because of the bottoms up nature or the the type the caliber of people that are involved in meta label you just kind of get better art or more sincere storytelling is that an attribute of meta labels you think yeah uh well yeah I mean the art is Ilya udanov who's amazing and it's one of our one of our co-founders I mean there yes so one I think because the meta-label structure is I mean it it is in our experience only speaking from the experience of us as a group like it's extremely collaborative where we are seven people who are all all have amazing pedigrees of projects and we are bringing our best selves to improve each other's work and and there is a way that this project just speaks to us and has and that we have been extremely um authentic and how we've expressed it where like maybe it's been a little bit opaque sometimes but also like we're figuring it out and we're trying to express things as well as we can and like it's all been a very genuine process of discovery that has come to a place of such Clarity that it's like did we plan this like this is this is kind of weird um how how how well it's evolved and um kind of by listening but I do think that the ability of a if you have the right mix of people the ability of a meta-label structure uh to allow a range of contributions to guide them directly towards a focused release I mean we we use a film set a lots of metaphor for how we work together we're in a in a film set it's made up of all people who are experts at their craft and everyone has a has their own say in their own craft and there's also a director level Vision that's just holding like what is this all meant to add up to and so for each meta-label release we're all Crafts People handling our different parts but the director is different on each project and that director will be the holder of this is what it should be like or shouldn't be like and so forms like that are they're naturally egalitarian you know I think that or they they they're like both expert driven and egalitarian in their structure a bit and uh and so even the way that we have approached our work it's very it's very meta where we're thinking about the way we do things is maybe how other groups will do things so let's document what we do um but that has produced a lot a lot of great outcomes and and you know we're working on a on a structure of Lifetime planning to have a Max of 12 full-time seats at meta-label each of those seats um having the same pay um you know similar ownership we'll have a wider pool of liquid contributors and Community contributors to which we're rewarding in all kinds of ways and can you is it possible to make a great product and stay and also be like a a creative Studio that has different kinds of drops and has fun and isn't locking itself into extractive platform economics and so I think like for myself having done Kickstarter from my co-founder Rob Kalin who made Etsy ran Etsy um you know we are both very inspired by the power that platforms can create and that the web can create for Creative people but we're also not inspired to um you know create overly big or uh overly extractive or overly complicated uh or overly you know uh just like business maximizing projects I think there's more interesting ways to go about things these days right um so you so in the Bento analogy you're kind of creating it for future us uh it feels like you've expanded out in those directions yeah well I think I mean I think the I I wrote a piece for um FWB a few weeks ago called after crypto and just thinking about like I look at the all the infrastructure that's been laid through the last 12 years of uh you know blockchain development and I think a lot about Carlotta Perez's book uh technological revolutions and financial Capital where she analyzes all these past economic booms and major technological transformations in which she finds over and over is that initially there's a huge burst of Interest Euphoria um uh people ordinary people get wrapped up in the Euphoria everyone's like yeah let's build the railroad from Harrisburg Pennsylvania we're all going to get rich we're going to build the railroad and they build the railroad and there's no utility and it crashes and the bubble bursts and the and the whole technology just seems to die and she shows over and over this happens but then it's after that period that there becomes this uh real implementation and deployment period as other people find utility out of all these literal sometimes literal rails or in other cases just like infrastructure that gets made and when I look at the infrastructure of a blockchain the infrastructure of like the group of projects we'll call web3 you know to me cross-platform post-platform utility is like once you see it you can't unsee it you know for us from the moment someone builds their creates their metal label using our tools we that group will be portable and able to create utility on all kinds of other places and move together as a group not as a single player mode but in multiplayer mode uh you know once you begin to once you see the way you can distribute influence and even ownership beyond the walls of your employee base and investors like you can't unsee it once you see the way that content and data and our histories you know can be held in perpetuity and not taken down at the whims of a single company or if they go out of business your all your Vines are gone like all of these things are just answer to me would have been fundamental structural challenges and and how can you not build on these things and so I think from other vantage point of today that does feel future us but to me that feels like I don't think it's far I don't I don't I don't think that type of utility and people really feeling a meaningful difference in their lives based on some of the things that happen as a result of that I don't think that's far and and my my feeling is that meta-label is a part of a wave of projects which will include projects from the last waves um that you know the the gnosis the gnosis of the world um they're going to keep just crushing it but I think that I think that we might be a part of a of a new set of projects that isn't centering crypto but is deriving a lot of value from its infrastructure from its tools uh is using the tools in a lot of ways that they were intended but that uh you know I think might hit a little different um so we'll see we'll see whether that ends up being the case yeah you know it's it's so beautiful to hear you talk about this Vision that you have and have it be deeply informed by your experience in supporting creators in many different parts of your career but but you know I gotta ask because after uh I think it I think it was after East Denver you had written a a post about about crypto and your in your experiences at East Denver and I think that some of it was kind of critic critical of of East Denver of of crypto and I know that you're you're kind of not all sold on different parts of the web 3 ecosystem and so you know I I hear I hear using different language when when you talk about meta-label than we typically use in in crypto we we hear you talk about Metal labels and not Dows you're designing the long-term incentives of your metal label which we would call governance and and I just got to ask you what what do you say when people say you're you're what do you say when people critique working in web 3 I mean I think there's so many people out there that think that web3 is just scams and there are some scams out there but do you how do we not throw the baby out with the bath water when it comes to building these the these systems for Collective action yeah yeah I mean I think that I I've been using the terms that make sense to my brain has been you know it's not it's not intentionally trying to create an ALT vocabulary I think it's just how I have come to make sense of it um but yeah you know I think that I would say I I um you know I've I believe very much in um the technology and I and I'm like not a hater on uh in in on nfts in any way or form or really anything of like that um but I do think that there is a uh hyper financialized culture that is antithetical to everything a creative person cares about uh I do believe that there is a most viral Twitter threads are people like a b testing extreme positions to try to see if they can get caught up in you know the hive mind for the day and so what is seen is you know someone's like all Dows are going to do this in the future and it's someone who has no experience building anything real you know they've never had a job there's no and yet and yet these are opinions that we are using you know that shaping anyone who's exposed to that is like having some shape on on how you feel um and so I guess I think that there are a lot of turn offs there are a lot of turn offs that are cultural turn-offs where I would say if people in my life of creative people in my life um I think there are very few of them who think anything good about crypto except for things I've talked about it because they're just like this is just the is this the worst like what what um and and you know and I I know the reasons why that's not true but I also think that is true I think they're not wrong um and so I think that part of part of part of validating a space I think is about just speaking what's true and and if things are it's good to talk about what's um and it's great when communities police themselves and uh and so you know I'm I'm just interested in in that in the in the long term um and so yeah nothing strategic here just I think just sort of like a genuine uh processing out loud what my own feelings have been and you know so where that what where that's led me is to like tune out Twitter but to work a lot on you know product implementation realities and spend a lot of time studying uh you know white papers and standards and protocols and just focusing on what's real and not what people want to be real and and I think that there's an an immense amount there and uh and I'm excited to I'm excited to to be you know building with it yeah you wrote this really great article for FWB called after crypto which is kind of a critique of of what it can and can't do and I'll just link that in the show notes here you know your critiques of crypto and people sort of racing to the bottom of the brainstorm on Twitter trying to create some sort of controversy for themselves and then like you know the the pump and dumps and the hyper financialization stuff it's hard for me just hearing you say it to me not put that into your previous framing about moving to post individualist society and and for me you know it almost feels like what you and Toby from other internet are doing with Squad wealth and what you're doing with meta label is like you're almost taking the atomic unit of am I optimizing for now now me that marshmallow test the instant gratification to you're moving it to now us or future us because you're making the atomic unit of how we do economics The Meta label and the a squad and and what to me is deeply meaningful about that is that is that we can all have complementary skill sets and and work together in order to create something that's meaningful and it becomes something that's shared and and by expanding from this like marshmallow test of just what's good for me now and out into the squad uh it feels like more meaningful structures can can be created there I I don't know if that's just my interpretation though I'd be curious for your critique of that a trillion percent a trillion percent um when I when I started writing this could be our future it was you know I I was really spending a lot of time asking myself this question of like um what plausible change could I imagine that would like most most benefit you know the most people or whatever not not like an effective altruism way of thinking but just like it's reading a lot of philosophy and just trying to think about these things and where I arrived was thinking expanding our concept of the self expanding self-interest to include a a wider set of actors than just ourselves today I believe even that even if just like we're all taking care of our families slightly better like that might be the biggest reachable step change towards like a better world as you know as hopelessly optimistic as that may seem um but really that like it's not from expecting people to become enlightened in certain ways it's just like just ex just expand your circle of who you feel responsible for who you care about who your decisions are incorporating like maybe that is the best we can hope for and so the Bento was like a you know a toolkit way of approaching that and a metal label is a structural way it's exactly I mean it's all on the same like I I began thinking and making notes on the post individual concept while also working on the Bento in that book and they're all they're all in the same package of like kind of me answering my own questions of who am I and feeling lonely and finding my people um you know creating your chosen family uh you know I think a lot of it is like a self-processing I think is certainly involved but yeah it's it's all part of a larger package and and I do you know I do think about that that like like my dream with meta labels that a release Club becomes an accepted piece of infrastructure and that right now three sub-stack Riders who all write about the environment who all are secretly feel they're uh competing with one another for attention the moment the three of them are like yo why don't we do this together how about we each write a thing you know every other week and we edit each other and we all promote each other's posts and we create some money that we use to put towards things we care about like that doesn't negate them having their own solo practices it's just creating a space where their incentives can be aligned and their work can be adding up to something greater than them and that the feeling when you get that the feeling when you have that it's like they're only so many times in life that you get the feeling of being a part of something greater than you like you know I've maybe had it three or four times in a real way you know and it's I don't know that there's anything better and and so I think that making that accessible to more people I think it's a transforming kind of experience you know and um and so yeah so I think making that connection is I think you're you're right on and I I appreciate that depth of recognition yeah well I mean in no small way uh this could be our future and this the story of bentoism really influenced me and you know one of the ways I sort of frame the term that I would like to see in in web3 you know everyone's kind of looking for the next wave all the time but for me I'd love to see us move into a more regenerative Direction which means that resource allocation moves over time or it moves up over time which is the future Dimension and then a you know the whole thing about public goods is basically taking the Bento all the way from the individual all the way out to the uh to the whole world which is kind of you know maybe overshooting the Overton window of what's possible now but uh you know I guess how would we build a more bentoist web three uh you know is that is that a rotation that you wanna that you want to see and how do we program our values into into our money in in order to create a more bentoist web3 yeah I mean well I mean it was when I had already been uh following you know blockchain projects um for a while but you know it was when I saw you sharing the Bento on Twitter and then uh Peter Pan joined the Bando society and Scott Moore from get coin joined the Bender Society um John long from from optimism uh joined the Bento society and then I discovered like this ideological alignment I didn't even I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I was like I kind of became aware of it through you um and so to see to find a community of people that was thinking about public goods was thinking about these other spaces was imagining creating infrastructure for the next generation of Builders even as they're getting started um you know to me that's just like uh that's that's like apex apex kind of um you know of just like so it feels like the starting point is creating like a social shelling point where we're all talking about it at least and then yeah well it's like we've all you know it's like I forget there are so many great lines about what maps are but it's like we're just we're starting with a map that includes those spaces and like and so the fact that like any web3 project in a way you know because if because of Bitcoin in a way they have to be like what is your public goods position you know what are what are you doing what are you doing for public goods like you're stepping into this space like you know prove your Bona fides um so I you know I think that there is um there's there's a lot of really pro-social values that are already deeply ingrained whether it's you know having to publish tokenomics and The Insider Outsider ownership of you know uh the structures of these projects in the very beginning that creates a different impact on the outcome um there's a lot of different ways that I think that the scales are balanced a bit more um but it's still as always going to be a tension between capital and social movements and it's going to be a tension between near-term desires and you know long-term goals and you know and I think that the work that you all have done has done a lot to um and like you know hyperstructures from Jacob and all kinds of great folks it's like very much tilted to cultural scales towards One Direction and the question is as web3 and crypto gets even bigger and if people start like actually getting customers at scale will it will it persist because web2 of course also began with lots of wonderful beliefs that you know eventually Facebook ate the world and then Facebook seemed like the only company that represented all internet companies you have it you know so it could just be you know it could just be Malik again we'll see we'll see yeah do you think we're on that path with web3 uh not so far not so far but I think that there are it's hard you know it's hard to say I've I've I've had people Express a lot of you know concern about the degree of stakes uh VCS will have in a lot of different projects and what happens if like someone controls Us in every percentage of like almost every major protocol like what what dangerous does that create um so I don't you know it's it's hard to say but I think in general you just have to assume that everything has the light and the shadow and that they will constantly be in tension with one another and you yeah there's no there's no such thing of of only one so uh I think you have to be prepared for that yeah I kind of feel like the internet of value gives us the ability to distribute value across the computer network and for the first time we can program our values into our money and do it in a global scale and what's so interesting to me about that is that you know in the meat space I I grew up in Pennsylvania in this small town and my Social Circle and who I married and what I'd be doing for work would just be based out of a geographic area but now any interest I have is I have immediate access through the internet to creators who are like me this allowed us to index on interests and beams instead of instead of physical geography and and you know that gives me a lot of hope that we can assemble these hyperstructures that that support people along that infrastructure and I think that you're doing really really important work there but I'd like to really think that we can if we can program our values into our money we can we can move from don't be evil to can't be evil and and build these institutions that will be pro-social uh approvably and from the ground up but uh I think I might be kind of smoking my own hopium given the the state of the market today so it's good to know that you that you sort of toss around these debates as well yeah definitely well I mean I think you just uh I can I would say this go around making metal label I can feel my experience I can feel that I've gone through things before that have wisened me that have made me a little more patient or you know and um and I think one of the things I take from that is just that there's the there is a constant balancing that you that you know you want to be prepared for and uh and and yeah just like human nature is never just one way um so I you know I I think that there is a so you know in the same way that a lot of people might look and say oh we're all on our phones and so everyone is like hyper individuals at this moment and it's never been more individualistic than now but I believe at the same time that that is true there's this other thing that is rising at the same moment because we're all realizing the hollowness of just being a sovereign individual that actually that's an extremely limited experience and that to get anywhere to do anything it takes coordination and alignment with others and the better coordinated aligned you are the more influential and meaningful your work and your life will be and you know you've had to work hard to have that life experience you know you've had to like go out of go beyond the lines of like the single player mode of how we're all taught to think to do that and you know metal able is going to be a part of a slew of web 3 projects that are going to make being a part of a squad being a part of something bigger than you like as trivial and as easy as anything else and and I think that's going to really change how how people think about this kind of work and how willing they are to do it yeah yeah I sure hope so um I'm realizing we're over the hour right now so I think we should probably get to wrapping up I could spend another five minutes I don't know how abruptly you want to wrap up but um is there anything I didn't ask you that you want to say before we do I don't think so um no no this was great this was great I really appreciate it well well I gotta say against you've been such an inspiration for me both for your work at Kickstarter with uh your book this could be our future which we'll Link in the show notes and uh meta labels can't wait to see where it goes and uh where can people find you online where can people learn about what you're up to Why strickler.com or uh Twitter handle why strickler yeah come say what's up okay all right thanks so much Nancy yeah thanks man appreciate it foreign [Music]
