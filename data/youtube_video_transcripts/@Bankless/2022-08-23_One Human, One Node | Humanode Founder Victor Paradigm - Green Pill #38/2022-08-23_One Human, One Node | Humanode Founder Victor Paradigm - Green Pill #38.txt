what's up coordination how you doing we are continuing our series on civil resistance fifa last civil resistance the point of civil resistance is to get to more one human one vote dallas more democratic dows that could enable genie coefficient measurement ubi quadratic voting quadratic funding and i have as a guest on the pod today victor from human node which is a quite interesting civil resistance project they are working on a biometric approach to civil resistance and have a decentralized network that they're going to be launching soon related to that so victor is extremely smart he's got skills in all these different areas and is pushing forward human node which is uh one human one node system so uh i hope that you enjoy this episode with victor from human note i found it

on mobile with android and ios apps and on desktop too all right i am here with victor from human node what's up victor hey doing great how about you kevin pretty good um yeah i i'm really excited to talk to you about human nodes so you can tell me like how you got into crypto and how you came to be a part of human node well uh crypto was uh pretty pretty on hype at our university in 2013 that's when we got it but there was nothing but bitcoin and a few others so we didn't really get into that full time until the smart contracts became a thing in 2016 when we started to research non-stop we gather team of analysts still working there and actually now we're doing not only crypto research but on other convergent sciences because you know the innovation is always uh in between right now i had a few projects encrypted the previous one was to facilitate the uh staking basically for regular users uh to make it easy but uh since 2017 uh me and my founder datto co-founder for 10 years already we clearly understood that unfortunately the crypt infrastructure is not pretty decentralized due to its capitalistic nature and we always wanted to change that but had no idea how and this is how in 2020 we started working on humanoid to well which i will tell you about later i suppose right got it so it's not just about crypto only it's more about a convergence and it was these insights that that led to human nodes so i mean what got you pulling the threat of human nodes specifically uh well i'm one of the co-founders right so it was uh looking through different sciences to solve the question how we can create a system where one person cannot launch more than one node to finally bring proper distribution to the most important thing to the crypt infrastructure and the servers it runs on and we've been following biometrics for a while and there were so many achievements in that field in terms of increase of accuracy in terms of uh finding out if there's a real human in front of the camera as well as a lot of research and privacy of biometrics which is crucial for the crypto when we understood that it is finally there and it's getting better each year with a great pace we kind of started to think about the architecture of how we can create network like that got it okay so it sounds like sort of solving the not one human one vote question but one human one node uh i'm just piecing it together for the day of human node here uh it also applies to the one human one vote right but uh in our heads i mean if the crypt infrastructure is not decentralized itself right all the one person one vote system we built on on a capitalistic system which is not decentralized what was the reason for it i think we should care about each of the layers including the most basic one so it goes two ways uh we're talking about uh private biometric solutions here where we can verify that the person is unique and real with uh pretty high accuracy but yeah at the same time it works both for the infrastructure so we can check it before granting access to launch note the person uh that's what we focused on but as we were building this one of the first private biometric solutions in the whole biometric industry not talking about crypto particularly we understood that it can be applied to so many projects that need it right now to fight sible in order to save their economies got it so uh how does the mechanism work i'm kind of poking through your deck right now and it talks about a unique list uniqueness check and an aliveness check um you know i'm curious how the mechanism works so yeah these are the two uh major things that biometrics are based on so first thing is uh matching one person like comparing it to all the other people to see if he's unique this is a neural network basically that checks if you are same or not and this is a probabilistic neural network but as you can see the accuracy has gone pretty high so a chance that another person would enter for example your account is one in 125 million this year so last year it was just one in 10 million and soon it will get to 7 billion where we can be pretty sure that we can check that this is you and the other part which actually why we didn't do that in 2017 because it was not there at all uh is called in biometrics liveness checks uh it checks whether there is a real human being through many computer vision models like in front of the camera we're talking about facial recognition only because it's the most accurate for now and uh well it uses 50 different modules to see how the light bends on your face see small movements of your face and it is also it captures this liveness data during the session and it actually protects us from spoofing an identity that doesn't exist so we call it artifacts and biometrics this can be a face mask that's how we usually uh try different biometric providers this can be a wax doll this can be a hacker trying to bypass the video feed and uh like inject the deep fake for example so this is also something that that we can check during the like five to ten second process of uh taking your biometrics so these are the two things that are like all by major biometric companies are doing and the thing that they didn't care a lot before recently is privacy and this is completely another task to complete in order to achieve private biometric solutions for sibling resistance right okay cool how do you do you worry at all about the sort of like dystopian uh problems with biometrics if they're not sort of like the data is managed in a private way you know you you have like biometric stuff that's kind of like immutable attached to you and i know there's a lot of privacy concerns around biometrics like how do you think about privacy well i actually our developers think that this battle this is a battle we already lost but we still have to fight for it because right now there is no privacy in biometrics whatsoever uh companies don't care about it even even large banks don't care about it so and uh yeah this is something we fight for this is something that we have already implemented in the first version where we based it on uh hardware like trusted solution environments right but in the second version what we want to do is uh completely open source biometric neural networks which do both liveness and uniqueness checks and they are processed by the nodes who have no idea what's inside because every layer of the neural network is encrypted so well this is something what we need to do to protect us from this dystopian future you're talking about some of the dystopian events are of course the control of your biometrics by governments or corporations but if we go further and think about the general ai problem right so basically if we don't have that control of the infrastructure uh by people that means that well if we still have capital based control he can buy it out and control all the ledgers we have and if he has our biometric data if it's not encrypted he can again use our biometric data to get control so okay you know both blockchains and biometrics can lead to dystopia or to for the future we strive for got it okay cool so it sounds like you're working on it but you're at kind of like a disadvantage because there's other projects working in the space that aren't spending a lot of time on privacy so it's it's it it sounds like it's it's sort of something that that uh that you're managing at least trying to yeah like at least a year ahead how many people are are using humanoid right now oh so uh our test nets were running for 10 months now we had more than 10k people participating as human nodes participating consensus dating transactions and uh we also made them scan their faces regularly every three days actually in the first test net in order to make sure that these people are still there you know to fight the problems uh of uh dead people running notes and receiving fees when they don't need it anymore or to fight the problems of indian farmers who just uh we call it so because we had an inquiry like that a year ago the person want to just go to many many farmers out there and make them human notes so uh over 10k people ran notes uh right now we have proper consensus with penalization with the 800 people running it for now the interesting part was that we really cared about privacy but we it wasn't there 10 months ago and we explicitly told everybody well we have no privacy and you will have no incentive so you're doing it completely because of the idea and people still went for it they most of them don't really care about privacy only anonymous developers and privacy geeks who really read the cryptography papers every week i think really care about it yeah the majority of that's a question yeah it's like one of those things where you're going through one of these use cases maybe you just want to get a reward for putting in your biometric data and you're not thinking about the second order effects of what if my biometric data is out there and you know especially we're very privileged to not be living paycheck to paycheck working in this space but i think that there might be people out there who are just trying to survive week over week and and so it's like a second order effect effect um that's how i think about it i'm i'm curious if you think about it differently though well i i don't have problems to to pay checks really but i also don't care about my privacy a lot uh yeah because uh well sometimes if the biometric protocol is really bad right and uh you take the data from it then you bring it to another really bad biometric product protocol you well it actually can be used by just you know using your photo but if you're talking about a good biometric protocol well uh you know liveness and and and in your unique traits they go together only so if you take my unique traits if you even make a mask out of my face but i won't be there as a human you won't be able to enter the account so i mean it's all about education of people on how biometrics work especially because they all work differently right okay we're so uh so what's next for y'all what's on the roadmap on the roadmap uh is actually the main at launch pretty soon in in september october because we've been testing that a lot and we finally i think already launched the first network without proof of stake proof of work anybody can join and uh participate the thing is that of course there are scalability issues as for any project out there in the crypto market and uh if there will be too many people that want to go and join the network they will have to go through other different actions to get there so it's not only about biometric checks uh in current blockchains it's all about capital right it's all capital incentive it's capital you have to bring to participate we're taking like other forms of capital not financial capital for people to take part in the network it's not only about checking the human existence but also are they participating in governance yes or no are they proposing ideas or executing on them yes or no and by this way you're able to stay in the validator set because it will be limited uh until we update the consensus okay got it um seems like the details are fairly ironed out at this point uh is there any alpha you can leach about leak about the uh the network and the mainnet launch at this point or should we all uh wait for the for the main announcement oh well there is not the exact date so should i just join the network right now try it out and uh see what is it becoming humanoid because otherwise it's hard to understand even from people who have been crypt industry for three years unless they go through it themselves and now biometrics are private you can understand like what bitcoin is unless you send the first one okay got it so uh where could you go play play with it i think the the website is humanoid.io yeah you can see the destinats there yeah um i wanted to say uh people who are listening this on audio probably can't see it but your brand is just really incredible you've got these really kind of futuristic line line art and it's very beautiful the brand that you all put together for this thanks yeah the only task we gave to our designer is do something completely different not like crypto not these nodes you know yeah that's great uh so you know uh how do you how do you sort of see civil resistance in the web 3 ecosystem evolving my sort of take is that there's a bunch of different players trying a bunch of different approaches and some are biometric some are web of trust some are proof of liveliness and i'm just kind of curious to see how it all fits together when the uh you know like when when we start spinning this flywheel of more users who have one human one vote expectations and that drives more daps to have one human one vote as part of them you know what is what is your sort of vision for for human node being maximally successful or civil resistance in web 3 being maximally successful well of course you shouldn't rely just in one technology it's all about cooperating together i actually have seen the proof humanity also trying the biometric checks but they just put the simple neural network there which could be fooled by photos but still uh we're working with projects in in ubi space as well who have web of trust model which works pretty fine unless you can spoof a lot of identities that all trust each other and the only way to well get it really secure is the combination of course i do not believe a lot into turing tests where you have to go and do the tasks that can be bought for five cents to solve them on mechanical turk but the web of trust with certain thresholds combined with biometric checks is great tandem got it okay but um you know so so getting out of the mechanics of civil resistance though what is the utility you think this this brings to every users in the space to have to have these passports out like once we've solved the checks what do people get i mean i guess like ubi is one thing that you talked about yeah ubi is just one thing uh we can solve the airdrop problem right because it is cb is a big problem there i mean we already had project on using our biometric tech uh creating nft minter so to say which checks that and if he goes just to one person not like ten if he's to one person and uh there are things we can do in d5 when the whales come and they report the rewards out of the reward pool uh so that you could limit them per person then uh we had like 20 ideas of what you can build with civil resistant tech we think that there is no proper uh mmorpg still on blockchain with normal gaming economy because mmo economies are broken with rapid inflation right and the only thing you can do that is by also limiting the activity of the bots who lead to this inflation i mean the ideas come every week to us what else we can do with civil resistant tech of course daos is the most evident thing and yeah we will see a lot of you know taos even emerging on top of current dows because uh you have seen awful cases when team just says this wallet is uh under our control now because we have enough votes to do anything with our network and uh well this at least if if not changed right away it should be indicated by real community where you have this signaling uh one person one vote dows which do not really execute anything but still the community can clearly see that the direction of the community is different from the direction of the whales or the founders what else we can with civil resistance we can actually establish the checks for proof of stake networks as well so in ethereum due to the fact that there is a 32 f per node you never know how many nodes one person keeps right you also have the centralization points due to those who help people with less ethereum uh stake their earth through the third provider we could the well we could tell hey people if you want to see how really this network is decentralized and who it belongs to please go and like verify that your validator of these notes uh and like only one person stays behind it otherwise we will never really know the commodity coefficient of ethereum and how many people is needed to coordinate to hold the

drops would be huge maybe staking uh some of these l ones could be civil resistant and that like it's it's sort of like that horizon of of of apps is what is is going to be enabled if if humanoid and other apps are are successful here that's something what just right now in my mind as major problems but there's also a lot of fun you can do though one of our team members came up with a wonderful game which for some reason wasn't yet created that is like when you enter the game you have just one life for one person then you die and that's the end of the game so there are more interesting funny things you can do with civil resistance yeah yeah got it is is in and how do you think it like are you all going to build some of those uh apps at human node or you just want to expose an api the civil resistance layer and enable other developers to do that well of course that's uh what we already did in the demo mode because we're not in the main map yet but there are like five good projects that have already built in us on the hackathon of course yeah we're providing them with the ap so to say api yeah more like biometric service got it okay cool um man you should talk to the people at get coin dao they just launched a proof of personhood passport called get coin passport and that'd be an interesting integration for getcoindale to to consider yeah for sure uh may i ask you a question regarding this so this is what me and uh my like friends analysts from republic were really interested in in uh bitcoin passport you have for example eight options of uh proving your real person right yeah yeah and uh well is there at least one which you have to go through 100 or not because i could for example either eight options i could have eight identities yeah so um i think that git coin dao is still working through a lot of how this is gonna work and i should say uh i think i'm known as the founder of git coin but i've actually just affiliated from leadership in the dao so i'm not speaking on behalf of the dao when i answer here yeah well working on it um but yeah basically part of the idea i think is is on get coindao there's a trust bonus which basically every bitcoin grants contribution will be metered up or metered down by how about civil resistant you are and then you know there's also a fraud defense team that is doing data analysis and looking for the civil attackers and trying to find them but i think that the final destination of where this is going might be around something like a cost of forgery for an identity or a personhood score and basically the idea is that you've got uh eight stamps in your passport and maybe each individually stamp is worth ten cents one dollar ten dollars a hundred dollars so if you do all of them then you have a hundred and ten dollars and no 111 dollars in in 10 cents worth of civil resistance and that would enable you to get that much amount of matching and so you know if you're that one person and you have eight different identities with eight different stamps then you would have an identity with ten cents one dollar ten dollars a hundred dollars worth of matching and so you know choose which way you how you want your identity to compound so it's early days but i think that's how they're thinking about doing it and you know if you have any feedback there's get coined out people who listen to this podcast i'm sure who who may have comments on that that the feedback is that um if there is a person who came he registered like he got three points out of 10 right uh but he was a scammer indeed and he just took the money he never delivered for some reason it happened of course there are some production things that you put in place but still how can you ban this person from creating another account going through verifications of other civil reserve providers there is no way this is you know why asking this question because if you want a really bad person there should be one at least method which is which should be used 100 by every grantee so this is the only thing i wanted to say here yeah i think that that is interesting feedback and maybe we can pass that along to the people that get coined out who are working on this i do think that um you know how like whether there's and gates or or gates on each of those individual stamps is something that's subject to intense vigorous debate but then there's a question of who even makes the legitimate decision of how these stamps compound with each other and then you get into kind of like some governance questions there but also acknowledging that anytime you have an economic system that has any value in it that there's going to be uh people who attack it and so looking away from trying to create the perfect system to creating this like red team blue team type exercise in which the attackers attack the system the blue team studies the data goes back to governance makes changes to it and then the system evolves like every epoch is kind of i think how get coindao is thinking about it but um you know maybe there's a more solid way to solve it in one fell swoop with biometrics any comments on that i feel like we've we've flipped the switch and now you're interviewing me which is not what i intended but the tick tock between get get coin and human node might be sort of interesting for people uh since they're both working on simple resistance well uh i i really don't have a clear answer to this but uh i think i would i would just go to bitcoin now and talk on the forum sorted out okay yeah that sounds that sounds good that's how get going down does its governance um any any sort of preview on how human node is going to do its governance i mean obviously there'll be civil resistance sort of baked into it but how is how is that going to work well uh we wanted to to make the network democratic right so that one person has one vote but at the same time there are certain limitations i mean let's start with the fact that many people can launch notes but not all of them will vote this leads to the fact that you can get enough votes on proposals the proposal gets stuck and your system is ineffective that's why we decided that those who do not actively vote and the threshold is uh 22 of all the proposals they are out of the quorum to always have the quorum out of at least active voters those who are not active can just delegate and uh the quorum will be reached better then uh the next point is that imagine tomorrow there will be like one small village anywhere in the world will coordinate put another 5 000 nodes in the network and it gets all the power now right so this way it could do anything to the network and we should protect from this thing as well so what we did is that still everybody has one vote but not everybody can propose on the things that can damage the network on the on the things that are crucial to the network if you just entered the validator set you can propose only on some minor things but which are which are really uh crucial for community at the same time product marketing i don't know partnerships whatever but if you want to put proposals uh on on chain voting for for example changing the structure of the dow changing the fee structure or changing the blockchain attack itself consensus for example you have to have a certain tier of governance which we based on two things proof of time running the node and participating in the voting and proof of devotion which is just an on-chain check whether you propose something and it got accepted or whether you executed something as a developer of another's person proposal and by that you earn yourself a certain tier throughout time so for example well we keep the network more or less autocratic during the first year because otherwise it can all go wrong and the network will halt and die we don't want to do that but in the four years time many people will have the same rights as the founders and uh they will be able to propose the things on changing the tech changing the dao itself and the economic system okay it sounds like i'm sorry i mean to cut you off i was just gonna say it sounds like progressive decentralization yep yep exactly exactly it usually takes four years to build a republic but you have to have autocracy in the beginning cool uh that's that's all the questions i had for you i'm curious if there's anything that i didn't ask that you want to say well uh actually as with the other people on the podcast they thought we'd be talking more about the the world disease you know how we can change it and the what what what a change in crypto because apparently it went wrong way right a little bit apart from few projects that uh often are underfunded that's what of course bitcoin wants to solve but um i wanted the command of where the industry went wrong right so uh first it was all right uh even when we came up with uh and started proof of stake network it still seemed all right but when we had this uh defy tokens reward on reward on reward coming out i think that people are thinking too much about the positive loops but the positive loops in their systems like you do this you get more then you get more from the other source and the positive loops work great if uh if it goes up right if everything is going well it uh is getting better and better accelerates but as in our today's like uh boom and bust credit cycles right in traditional when things go down the positive loop makes things go down really really far and i think that this is i had that idea in my mind that we should do completely we should do it in completely opposite way we shouldn't create positive loops but negative loops to have stable growth and and sustainable growth without much of ups and downs to for the network to grow at the pace of its uh productivity growth not the pace of its hype growth hmm got it yeah i um i i don't know how to engineer that but it's quite an interesting idea yeah sorry i'm an economist so uh yeah i mean this is something you can get from the complex system modeling as an engineer right and actually test out those systems we actually think that eventually if we will be wise humanity well this is what we should think uh of on a micro scale of our economies of national economies you see we should make the cycles uh smaller not not bigger and well otherwise you went up a lot then you wasted a lot of money that you created on the stuff that you don't need and then you go down a lot and you also had a lot of environmental impact while going through that yeah yeah i mean i think that you know there's a lot of criticisms of web3 i feel like it's evolving in a much a bunch of different directions at once and you know you can program your values into your money right and there's a whole spectrum of human values and they're going to evolve in multiple different directions but what i think is neat is that someone like you can take the value system that you have and bootstrap an economy based off of that and there's kind of a merit-based approach of you know what's the gdp of the human node economy and and uh there's an evolutionary sort of fitness game between it and someone else so um i'm not saying that i don't want to brush aside your criticisms i think they're valid but that's kind of like my my macro view on the space is is that everyone's sort of experimenting and and hopefully the ecosystem selects for the right winners but i'm actually not very optimistic on that you see the growth of stuff like tara luna and and meanwhile there's public goods that can't get funded it makes you a little bit less optimistic about the market selection mechanism yeah i mean but if we keep developing and uh with our this uh more stable you know systems eventually in five years time we could match those who are growing on hype like mushrooms so we just have to survive and uh keep building i think without getting a lot of hype uh for no reason yeah because eventually those things that starting slow or those who survive right yeah i mean i think that um you know slow and steady wins the race is the children's tale the tortoise and the hare but one of the things that i sort of saw with these these like giant uh ponzi things like like tara is that they collapse uh sort of on their own and then the ones that are left standing are the ones that were sort of slowly and steady build it building and you know there's everywhere in between those two things but so so maybe it's not even going faster than them it's just waiting for them to implode because their growth was cancerous and unsustainable yeah i just hope that after all these lessons uh we won't do the same things again and uh kinda research negative loops instead of positive loops yeah totally what's that whole saying once bitten twice shy uh so at least within human memory of of what's recently happened then then at least hopefully uh like people will not make the same mistakes but i i find the the idea of the fourth turning quite compelling basically the idea that there's only three living generations in my family my kids myself and my parents and so you have a fourth turning every fourth generation of human memory of of people forget history and so you know maybe it's gonna differ as you know people have shorter attention spans with the internet and everything like that but that's kind of how i how i think about that evolution yeah unfortunately i think it it will be even less soon and the only thing we can change it with this education that yeah this is the main thing that we have in our world this is the root thing that can change how we live yeah yeah it's quite interesting to see the evolution and um you know i'm really interested to see human node evolve and can't wait to see how it turns out uh in the end so we'll be looking forward to the main net launch um let me know if you want an intro to the people that get coined out to do an integration from uh the get coin dial side of things and and and yeah i guess is there anything else to say any any sort of parting thoughts not really i i said everything but i just wanted to share with you that pretty interesting thing we came up with so even though it is looking for its future like long ahead we're also fans of neuro technology uh just for a final note and for people to have something to say to their friends we uh as you have heard neuralink is testing its technology mostly on peaks so one day we think we will have the biometric authorization from the envirometric signatures right from our brain and from the brain computer interfaces so we actually one day want to launch the test net uh on proof of pigs not proof of humans to test out the yeah uh blockchain running on there's there's probably a lot of meters in there sorry go ahead just one day you want to test out blockchain running on brain computer interfaces because we think that's that's where we're going yeah that's really crazy uh i i studied hci which for the uninitiated stands for human computer interaction in college and there's some really wild stuff that you can do there but as soon as you said uh proof of fig my mind was just filled with one pig one vote memes uh so well uh i think we won't vote but we at least can get some uh universal basic income for them uh okay universal basic truffles i don't know this is probably a good great place to wrap the episode because uh we're descending into delirium but um it was so great to have you on the on the pod man i'm i'm just really passionate about civil resistance and i know you are too and i think it's going to create a more democratic web three so thank you for your work in the space and looking forward to seeing how it grows thank you for it kevin we'll make it together um okay so last question where uh where can people find you online humannode.io is there is there anything else and then you go to social channels twitter discord this card is very active got it okay and uh so just a human node on twitter is that right sure sure it is cool all right well thanks so much victor see you on the ethernets [Music]
