and uh david before we get in because it is march tober march october no merge merch timber excuse me merge timber oh did i just curse this yeah yes hey bankless nation it is the first friday of september or david should i say merge timber because that's what month it is it is the merch month and that means that all the bankless episodes in september are called merge casts on podcasts how'd you like that i did not know this i did not know that's about our podcast you're ready for that anyway guys this is the the weekly roll up i said it this time not david what should people do when listening to the weekly weekly roll up david what beverage should they be drinking oh of course you know i'm not saying that everyone has to be drinking coffee but you know it's the coffee that i drink when i listen to the week they roll up every friday morning because sometimes i do actually listen to it you know to catch up in the week in crypto because that's the coffee that you drink yeah i think you meant to say it's the beverage that you drink is coffee but you said it's the coffee that you drink is the best yes that's what i meant that's what i meant yeah same thing sometimes i mix up trillions and billions sometimes i mix up beverage and coffee you know friday of course if you are a weekly roll up fan you will know that if you add anything to your coffee david considers that a beverage no longer a coffee the only real coffee is black coffee that's what i learned from david black coffee espresso water and coffee that's how it works that's that's i don't write the rules no milk all right guys we got some interesting topics this week david do you want to tease some of them up yeah we got some shenanigans going on this week uh first off avalanche playing dirty question mark using uh nation state legal systems to sue other alt layer ones in order to get ahead kind of just like taking a hack at your opponent's legs as you try and run a foot race uh you know you know not totally completely proven so we'll go back on the details on that but also michael saylor getting sued in the district of columbia for not paying taxes perhaps creating a forced bitcoin seller we're going to cover that that drama and then also maker dow wants to d-peg die uh no longer one the dollar equals one die perhaps uh at least these the conversations going on in the maker dow discourse we're going to summarize all of this and more but also a bunch rather than all the like the negative stuff there's also some positive stuff of course also happened this week ryan what were some of the good things that happened all right you got the bad things a few of the good things some highlights are a new liquid staking token eath staking token just launched on the scene and it's from one of the largest exchanges i don't know if you guys can guess which one but we will tell you in the roll-up as it progresses also a roll-up itself just upgraded and made ethereum seven times bigger that was the news this week uh starts with an a i'll tell you which one until we get into the episode and then facebook and instagram just expanded their nft offering so there's definitely a lot to talk about on the good side and of course if you like these rollups you're listening on your podcast player make sure you like it make sure you write us a review give us five stars if you think we are worthy of five stars and then also if you're listening to this on youtube watching it i should say make sure you hit that subscribe button and david before we get in because it is march tober merged october no merch merch september excuse me merch oh did i just curse this yeah well september day one of september are you off to a bad start this might redeem me with listeners is did you know you can go get a commemorative merge nft badge collectible i suppose i should say consensus is putting this out what is the program that they're running david oh yeah they're doing a free nft mint it's going to be the first i think this is the plan the first nft mint post merge therefore the first like green naturally green ethereum nft mint uh and so this is just and then a free nft uh there's no like whitelist there's no nothing everyone's available to to mint one uh one per transaction uh and this is going to happen so you can uh sign up in the link in the show notes to get notified of course when the merge actually happens and then also a 72-hour mint window to celebrate the achievement of all the ethereum core dabs client teams and researchers so free nft mint marking the the merge so cool this this is a way to prove to your your your grandkids you were there right yes i was here i was present and encountered my nft to show it uh you can find out more about that make sure you sign up at bankless.cc slash consensus for some more details all right david let's get to the markets man what is bitcoin doing this week uh going down it's going down ryan uh bitcoin started the week at twenty one thousand seven hundred dollars it went down nine point five percent to where it is now at nineteen thousand six hundred dollars we are below twenty thousand dollars oof that's just about double digits man that's a pretty steep drop yeah we're below 2017 all-time highs okay and eth is that showing us anything better because the merge is coming david yeah yeah the the mur the ether also down also down down ten percent down start of the week at seventeen thousand ten dollars currently at fifteen thousand thirty dollars down a little bit more than bitcoin yeah we're going to talk about this in a minute but this feels awfully correlated to the nasdaq in the stock market coming on the back of some of powell's recent comments in jackson hole as he gave them we'll get to that in a minute but uh how about the ratio is that giving us any signal uh yeah it did the same thing it did last week where it plummeted down to like point zero seven three point zero seven two uh but it then recovered back to point zero seven eight three so it's overall down one point three percent on the week it started the week at point zero seven nine currently down to point zero seven eight but it hit point zero seven three intro week and and bounced back up so still life in the in the uh in the ratio still life in the ratio how about a global cryptocurrency market cap are we above a trillion still barely we are barely above a trillion we started the week at 1.085 trillion and we are 1.002 trillion so 20 billion dollars away from one trillion dollars no wait into two bill two two billion dollars two billion dollars all right so what is ether right now so it is 40 or 15 30 something 15 30. okay so it's still floating above the uh 2017 all-time high i guess or 2018 all-time high i don't even know if people care about that number anymore do you think that's like old news yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure yeah it feels kind of old news all right um this is a prediction for the merge date which of course we've explained is is somewhat uh changing ever-changing what is this showing us yeah so this is bortle.wtf and there was another merge predictor website that we showed last week that predicted the merge had like moved up to like early morning september and it even flashed into late tuesday but that was one calculation and here's bortle.wtf which is a more conservative calculation so this one moves a little bit slower as hash rate comes and goes the merge date changes uh and so like people don't really know uh and so the other the calculation that we showed last week was pretty like aggressive in how much it updates faces based off of recent uh hash power uh the portal.wt site changes a little bit slower and this one is still showing that we are going to likely merge around thursday noon utc time which is about 8 a.m eastern time um we will see all right so um what happens with the hash rate how is that related to the merch date whether it's like sooner or later yeah so total terminal difficulty this is that ttd number it's a replacement for block height so right then this is why the date hops around every now and then we didn't choose a block we chose a ttd a total terminal difficulty what the hell is tdd you don't really need to know this don't like carve out space in your brain this is really like the one time thing that's gonna be relevant but it's basically the raw number of hashes so total number of hashes that goes into proof of work once the total number of hashes hits that ttd number of five eight seven five and then what looks like 20 zeros after that i'm not don't even know what number that is a significantly large number uh then we merge and so the faster the more hash power there is the more that miners come online and do proof-of-work mining the faster we grow the hashes the faster we approach that ttd number if miners drop off the network then we approach that number slower and so it's a function of like how many miners are mining on ethereum and as that goes up merge comes sooner as it goes down merge goes further away i wonder if we'll see any drop because if we see some drop like hash rate go down as as the thursday of september 15th excuse me march 10 15 a purchase then um like that could extend it into like friday i personally i'm i'm hopeful it it um hash rate uh goes down a little bit so that we get like you know like 2 3 p.m or so in the afternoon it's just nice and casual right we could just kick back and relax and this doesn't go super early into the like wee hours i would like to have a margarita while the merge happens yes same yeah just like afternoon early evening that would be so relaxing uh but yeah there's nothing we could do i guess we don't really know what the hash rate is going to do is there any reason to believe that miners might drop off as as the merch gets closer it makes sense for miners to not come online as we get closer to the merge so that that makes sense to me uh like if you have late no one's investing in ethereum proof of work now that's too late um and so it only makes sense for it to stay the same or drop off um it's one of those things there's a little bit of game theory behind this right so if like 50 of miners the day before the merge just like all right let's like pack up shop uh well then you're actually making it twice as profitable for the 50 of miners to stick around for that last remaining day right uh and so like i don't know i kind of think the if you will have a minor minor the only reason why you would want to shut down your mining rigs is to sell your gpus before the rest of miners sell their gpus but i don't really know how liquid the gpu market is or how relevant that is i don't know i don't know it's it's probably likely that they'll just stay and continue to squeeze the remaining proof of work juice out of this uh so it's still extremely profitable to be a minor so yeah uh all right dave let's get to our fed watch that was our merge watch uh coming soon man just next couple of weeks of course the merge but the fed watch so as i said earlier jerome powell was out in jackson hole wyoming he gave a policy speech and this sent markets tubbling here is a cnbc article powell warns of some pain in quotes ahead as the fed fights to bring down inflation the fed chairman jerome powell on friday pledged that's last friday that the central bank will use our tools forcefully to attack inflation it's still running and it's running near its highest level in more than 40 years so he he gave a speech he said it would take some time i think the tldr of this is powell is saying the fed reserve the federal reserve has to continue raising rates and even hold them at the higher level that's coming soon until at least inflation is under control and that's at the cost of jobs possibly so unemployment could continue to rise and powell is saying he'll continue to be to be hawkish so even though he's saying that though david what's interesting is the market is still predicting that rate cuts will start around summer of next year june of like 2023 if you kind of look at the like what the market is pricing in so today the fed rate uh the target rate um is between you know two and a half uh two and a quarter to two point five percent and the market is pricing it a seventy percent chance that we increase by another 75 basis points september 21st right so that would be the next time the fed might increase rates so powell continuing to be hawkish of course this sent markets for a tumble the nasdaq the s p and people are blaming this on the crypto dive as well this is why ethan is down 10 on the week i think uh the other take i heard was that we had one month of uh inflation that didn't get higher and then everyone was like it's reversing over it's over and then we were like wait no that was just like one month worth of data like we're still in a few more months yeah and this is powell playing kind of the bad cop and saying yeah we need more time inflation is not dead yet and i will continue to try to squeeze it out of resist out of existence this reminds me though david next week we have arthur hayes on the podcast oh yeah and you ask him a really interesting question that i think you've asked a number of our macro guests and our merge guests trying to get the answer i want yeah and that question is which is more powerful in the trading world in the price world the merge or macro i've been asking this question so many times to so many people and i finally got someone to give me the answer that i wanted and now we all know that that becomes the bona fide correct answer in my opinion i think we all know what answer you wanted so we won't even say it but tune in to that episode this is a special episode coming out on the bankless podcast on wednesday and youtube on wednesday of next week wednesday arthur harris on my class what do we got coming up next david oh god avalanche playing dirty suing other blockchains blockchain suing blockchains is that even allowed apparently it is uh michael saylor gonna have to sell bitcoin not because he wants to of course but because he got in trouble with the law naughty naughty and of course maker dow die drama is dye gonna depeg from maker dao on purpose uh so all of these stories and so much more after that are coming right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure crosstrain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across his bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of across the story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitram or boba networks there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your

battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets all right guys we are back with the first news item of this segment is avalanche playing dirty there's some drama in the space maybe some legal uh things flying around i gotta be honest david with with uh some of these stories coming out i haven't been following them in depth because i guess maybe i'm at that point with like i just don't care that much well that makes sense coming from you because this is something strictly outside of crypto economics this is like meets based lawyer stuff and that's why this story is what it is is because like you you got like the claim is that avalanche is playing a game outside of the game uh and that's probably why you don't care that's right yeah so so catch me up like what what actually happened and then maybe at the end i'll tell you whether i care or not yeah so this uh website crypto leaks dot info this is actually the first time i've ever discovered this uh website uh crypto league site info published a very long and with lots of like content uh uh whistleblower article that is basically claiming that ava labs and this one lawyer law firm rosh friedman is suing like systemically suing as many different like blockchains l ones as they can in order just to like play dirty uh and so player number one we have ava labs the for-profit company behind avalanche uh led by ceo emin emin good sir employs about 150 people player number two roche rosh friedman a law firm that widely sues people in crypto currently running 25 class action lawsuits including binance uh avalanche competitor solana dfinity and a few others and it's being led by kyle roche who's another big player in the story and employs about 30 lawyers the claim here is that some years ago ava labs and roche friedman made a deal a pact that was formed that involved ava labs granting rosh friedman raj friedman how do you pronounce this guy's name rashford r-o-c-h-e friedman a massive quantity of ava lab stock and avalanche cryptocurrency avax now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in its game for for ross friedman agreeing to pursue a hidden purpose and this is uh what this uh this claim this this whistleblower crypto leaks on info is claiming what that hidden purpose is purpose number one surreptitiously causing harm to competitors if there are two horses competing in a race you can hack at the leg of the other and the other one will win their horses avax and avalab stock and initiating a class action lawsuit against competitors can harm them in multiple ways so they have secretly weaponized the legal system to do this even when they only make a weak case such that with a high broad even with a high probability that they lose their own litigation this can still cause harm to their target targets greatly profiting them in the long run moving the price of avax by only a small amount by harming competitors can produce big gains for them while they make sales from their huge hoard of avax tokens and ava lab stock basically the idea here is that you go and sue your competitors and then they have to take resources to fight this this class-action lawsuit whatever this litigation uh in order to defend themselves uh and so like you only spend five to ten million dollars on like trying to sue them and they spend tens plus millions of dollars trying to defend themselves and then the second purpose luring regulators including including the sec and cftc away from ava labs they often litigate against competitors in ways that make them look guilty of regulatory transgressions directing the intentions of regulators towards competitors can cause further harm to them and also serves to lure regulators away from ava labs and their ravenously commercial behavior which regulators would otherwise be very interested in kyle tells that he litigates to create other magnets for regulators to go after and they do this to crypto actors actors who are not obvious competitors basically throwing other teams organization companies under the bus to make sure that ava labs doesn't become a target of the sec or cftc can i pause here and make sure you're following so far all right so there's this website called crypto leaks and they claim to be a website that supports like whistleblowers so if you see something you know skeevy and scammy and sketchy you email them you give them the evidence the data and they'll report it on your behalf right yep so what we have is a whole blog post full of maybe some evidence looks like some video evidence of this dubious law firm roche and the charge that basically ava labs gave this lawyer tokens inequity and equity in exchange for him going after their competitors in like kind of like sleep legal type ways yeah which is just like um suing them for kind of dubious reasons right and like costing them money yes but then also like drawing attention from regulators away from like your entity your organization and towards the other entity so this is the charge so far is this correct yeah there's like videos to support this is this yeah i've watched some of these videos and like it it's a combination of these videos and this fact that this law firm does indeed own like i used to own over one percent of all avax tokens and now owns uh less but then also you know we would assume it also goes with ava labs capital as well uh and so like there's just like a lot of dots that all seem to line up to support these claims uh now there there is some skeptic skepticism to the legitimacy of this website that we're looking at in the first place we'll get to that at the end um but let's continue into the story uh the the the concept that why this works is like kind of like a exploit of the american legal system using class actions in which uh you know class actions can claim to be representing groups of people who they claim to be harmed so like rosh friedman says i represent the token holders of solana and solana is actually illegal security and swan went down in price and so because i'm going to represent salon holders i'm going to sue the solana foundation regardless of whether roach friedman actually is a solana holder or cares about solana holders or actually believes the thing that he's saying so for example they they actually did file a lawsuit against the dfinity foundation essentially parroting the false claims of arkham intelligence i don't know who that is the purpose is to damage the reputation of their targets and and surround their brands in fud uh and so oh also importantly once roach friedman goes into litigation against a target when one of their their enemies the so-called they can harvest and collect confidential information which they are using them using in legal discovery and then they can pass that discovery phase information over to ava lab so avalon can ava labs can see what dfinity is doing like it's like an espionage we're like spy stuff it's ridiculous this is like corporate um legal like sleaze type stuff really what's going on really is that that's that's allegedly going on because it's legitimately going right so last little bit here rosh reidman can spend a few million dollars litigating against an avalabs competitor and lose the case and still come out on top if their actions harm or suppress a blockchain that competes with avalanche since their actions may drive the price of avax significantly higher such that the size of their sold links and they can make a substantial profit uh and so kyle roche issued a response in his medium article that basically says that like this is all fake um he says uh a posting on recently uh launch anonymous crypto leaks website about me my firm and ava labs contain numerous unsourced false statements and illegally obtained highly edited video clips that are not presented with accurate context these videos were recorded without my consent during private meetings with kristin eager hanson who whom i now know works for dominic williams the creator of icp token and the defendant is a high profile securities fraud litigation my firm brought against him mr edgar hansen requested a meeting with me under false pretenses of venture capital investment in a technology startup but his real motives are now clear to deceive and entrap me when i agreed to the meeting i was unaware that mr edgar hansen specializes what he calls conflict management for eccentric billionaires like mr williams where he uses illegal and underhanded means including covert recordings and social engineering to to solve their legal issues basically uh kyle's saying like like yeah this is framed i was framed yeah but also like if you do watch the videos like yeah like i also if i was kyle would not want those videos to go public uh so we're not gonna play these videos you can go link them into the show notes uh also a tweet from emin of avalanche uh he who says how could anyone believe something so ridiculous as the conspiracy theory nonsense on crypto leaks uh we would never engage in the unlawful unethical just plain wrong behavior claimed in these self-serving videos and inflammatory articles our team and tech speak for themselves uh there's also some interesting uh tweets cited by some people in the community uh below this one uh where emin is uh uh retweeting uh one of kyle roche's lawsuit against tether in the manipulation of uh cryptocurrency prices and then another one back in 2020 the avalanche twitter account and avalanche blog makes a tweet citing introducing the initial litigation offering bringing the 10 billion dollar asset class of litigation financing to avalanche and retail investors for the first time again another like roche kyle roche law firm like partnership with ava labs so like the part and this partnership and this weird like litigation fascination with avalanche has a history and so that's one of these dots that are being played out here's ari paul's ari david paul who is the cio of block tower capital unrelated to all parties so like kind of a neutral onlooker uh and he uh he's reading this case and his take is that i assume it's correct and it's as bad as it looks fits with everything i've seen previously from both syria and roche from a lawyer's framed on roach a few weeks ago dumb version of mob lawyers bottom of the barrel oof but then he also continues further down and says i will say some credible lawyers at ava labs i respect tell me russia's claims are false they can't won't share any evidence of that due to attorney-client privilege i don't know what evidence they could have absence of a private conversation but i respect them enough to a believe they're not lying and b remain but and b remain open-minded to see what evidence becomes available uh and so and also this crypto leaks website is generally assumed by also neutral third-party onlookers to be like a front for uh icp uh dfinity what yeah yeah so apparently the crypto leaks website is like something that the icp so this is not like an open source like anonymous someone trusted from the community it's just this also could be a large corporation behind this crypto leaks website and these could be just two uh crypto networks battling it back and forth covertly yeah how dumb is just it is quite does this have a resolution in any way it's like it just seems like back and forth uh it seems sketchy on like all sides concerned possibly it's just like this is some bear market stuff you know our lawyer ones like start slinging mud at each other during the bear market um my take on this is that you know i was going down this rabbit hole to understand how to report on it on it for this particular uh this particular story that we're talking about right now and there's a click on that link that i'm quote retweeting ryan there's this guy that tweets out a couple screenshots uh from uh ava avalanche like you know twitter supporters uh and then this one twitter account says this this is their intention to just make fud i believe avalanche and emin as the father of blockchain would never do such a thing their only goal is to prevent emergence of avax but they are not and will not succeed fast forward to the next screenshot copy and paste the same thing fast forward to the next crypto twitter account who's like supporting avalanche copy and paste the same thing like this text a little bit different but it says it says basically the same thing uh and so like and this goes this reminds me of this uh article i wrote back in late 2020 about avalanche and how they uh this is verified true like this is this is not like conspiracy would pay uh like frog accounts fraud crypto twitter accounts in abac tokens for engagement on crypto twitter frog twitter accounts are just like pseudo-anonymous crypto accounts that tend to represent themselves as like frogs and they seem like they're kind of bot controlled or robot controlled right yes very like uh puppet like sock puppet twitter accounts that put on like both a pepe frog uh image but also with like an avalanche hat and they're like oh i'm an avalanche supporter but like there's just fake engagement and then for social engineering purposes social engineering yeah and like we know this is true there were chat rooms and then i wrote this story called on frogs back in 2020 when i was going my first war with the frogs of like there's been like three now uh and like there you there was actually just like concerted telegram rooms where like you would post your engagements like oh i made a tweet about avalanche here's my tweet and then you would be given a tip in avax tokens like we know that this happened uh and and so like this culturally in my opinion is like very aligned like they're willing to play dirty and they always have uh and so allegedly david we don't know for sure but you know what i gotta say that the the spidey sense that we've had about this sort of thing and i think like you've had when you see these like sock puppet accounts and it feels organized and it feels concerted and they're all chanting the same chant um the probably there have been like four times i've seen it like at a fever pitch um one is like chain link back in like 2019 2020 and then that kind of died down yeah the other is avalanche as you said um the the other is uh danny sesta yeah they he controlled the frogs for a while too and he was a frog puppeteer and like we all know how that ended earlier this year uh and the other was kind of like the terra community uh and dokwan yeah uh and this felt like a lot of stock puppet accounts again and i'm not sure that it that totally was but like all of those communities when you kind of dip to toe in the water and you like put forward arguments uh it just something felt off something felt like not quite right something felt rotten in those cases and it turned out to be like at least in two out of the four so far things were kind of bad yeah right right yeah i mean doing there's like a deal with a devil that you make when you try and promote your blockchain and your asset and without doing like the things that you should be doing which is straight up innovative protocol engineering and you start like you know shooting people in the hamstrings in order to get ahead well here's a call for everyone to get back to building yes and uh to stop with kind of shenanigans and stop with kind of the legal shenanigans because we are sick i'm sick i think you are sick of talking about it in the roll-ups but that's what that was a big thing making waves this week so we had to cover it uh what else we got david uh god michael saylor is getting sued for tax fraud so the district of columbia is suing michael saylor for over a hundred million dollars of uh unreported income or untaxed income that should have been paid to the district of columbia but michael saylor claimed to be living in florida when he was actually living in his very large apartment in the district of columbia so yeah so michael saylor and his company facing legal accusations that led to systemic tax fraud and penalties that could amount to more than a hundred million dollars attorney general for washington dc said in a statement that sailor has lived in the district of columbia for more than a decade and has never paid local income taxes despite earning hundreds of million dollars in cash and micro strategy equity options over that period uh and so there is a tweet and an actual tweet out from the district of columbia attorney general yes saying today we are suing michael saylor a billionaire tech executive that has lived in dc for more than a decade but has never paid any dc income uh income before tax fraud uh blah blah sailor personally avoided more than 25 million dollars of dc taxes by pretending to be a resident of other jurisdictions with significantly lower personal income taxes taxes michael's strategy is also named as a defendant in this ryan alleging that the firm conspired to help him evade taxes uh i mean since michael taylor is the controlling owner of michael of microstrategy he can just tell microstrategy that that's how it's going to be um uh and then so a quote uh says michael or sailor is going to have to probably peel off some bitcoin depending on where that bitcoin is in the eventual judgment comes down almost nobody beats tax fraud uh fraud allegations but we'll see there's a nearly 130 000 bitcoins that microstrategy held as of june 30th and was purchased for an average price of 30 600 a piece uh bitcoin is now trading at below 20 000 by the close of uh new york stock trading hours on wednesday and microstrategy also reported a net loss of 1.1 billion due to the drop in btc price and still sailor during the recent earnings call says that the company would seek to continue acquiring and holding bitcoin long term with no eventual plans of selling and another quote from the article says everyone knows he's long bitcoin if bitcoin continues to decline microstrategy stock could go down by another 30 and get absolutely hammered uh and at what point can you turn around to your shareholders with a straight face and say that you are not selling end quote oof oof yeah so i guess the summary is there could be some cell pressure cell pressure on bitcoin but of course microsoft's got to pay taxes yeah yeah this this has to get settled in court so yeah right this is a prosecutor going after a defendant i'm sure sailor will bring a case forward and the courts will decide whether this indeed was tax fraud or not um hard for me to like i mean definitely could have happened i could definitely see it happening but also in our system we have to obviously presume innocence and the court systems are the things that that decide the outcome here so um you know presuming definitely in presume innocence of course however uh michael saylor there's a quote from tier 10k that says tldr taylor pretend to live in florida for taxes but i actually lived in d.c frequent flexing on facebook private jet flight logs and talking about tax evasion on podcasts got him nabbed by the feds so yeah sailor was known to talk about like all like the tax evasion taxes oh that'll get you very as a very public person so uh you know i there's always that rule that i like to live by ryan is don't do more than one illegal thing at once um otherwise you'll get now for them all that is now recorded on a podcast dude you happy to know that here's uh somebody replying to this tweet noted if committing a crime don't talk about it on public i'm talking about crimes on a podcast yeah all right we'll try and apply this to my own life is what the poster says good lesson for us all there okay maker drama what is happening with maker trauma just keeps on coming okay so maker is a stable coin it is one to one pegged with a dollar always has been always will be question mark and this is what uh so my following of this i haven't read this the summary from greg here which we're about to get into is uh roon christensen one of the founders of maker and kind of representative of uh you know a core core cohort of maker is really spooked and really freaked out by the recent tornado cash offac sanction action and he's worried that the current plan which is backing uh die up by rwas real world assets which has really been the the strategy of multicollateral die might not be resilient enough uh for nation state level attack that he seems to think is like on its way or imminent and so is his answer to this again david i haven't read all the posts i've gone into all the details his answer to this we d pegged from the dollar and so we nev no longer use the dollar as a uh as our unit of account uh and we start to become a free-floating currency in order to get around this maybe use different collateral assets that aren't as real-world dependent is that what's going on yeah so we we could read this like 38 tweet thread which i think really does a fantastic job summarizing the complete date of maker dao yeah um uh but like ultimately roone christensen just put forth what greg depricio and the sweet thread calls a decently like radical plan such as uh d-pegging die uh and so greg says roone's latest plans are nothing short of radical to d-peg die from the dollar and to push all core units and non-crypto vaults into the theoretical contract of metadows which has been part of roone's endgame plan for a long time uh he has the support of fellow futurists and the decentralists which greg has put maker dow's like political parties into three camps you got the futuristic decentralists and then the centrists uh maker or roon uh was it definitely in the futurist camp but this like ted and like people like amin solomony and chris black have found themselves in like the decentralist camp like get rid of all real old assets uh and anything that's like you know potentially censorable like uscc uh and so like roon used to be a leader of the futurist camp still is but now has like taken a large leap out of the decentralist camp to make maker down more censorship resistant uh so that's a quick tldr of the state of maker right now it's very strange that they've gone from like um lending funds to like a tesla uh subsidiary or something like this and like lending funds to like banks in pennsylvania to a reaction from the community to say like let's get rid of real world assets entirely let's not even peg to the dollar um real world assets has been in in maker dao's core ethos since day one yeah right like that has been the whole shift to multi-collateral to die and that you know shift what roon was a key part of that shift so it's very interesting to see this emerging and like for for my part i don't know which party you would kind of represent like the futurist or the sen uh centralists or the decentralists i probably always viewed a bit more towards the decentralist side of things but also like i was very glad that the multi-collateral die experiment was playing out so i also very much valued kind of this the the centralist and the futurist approach that i was taking because other projects have taken the decentralist type approach where all of their collateral is just like backed by eth and they've de-pegged like uh rye is an example of this uh and that is a free-floating asset that you can purchase right now it um tries to dampen the volatility of eth but is incredibly decentralized relative to like die and the uh real world asset type strategy so what a pr like what's your take on this maker the reason why there's three political parties is for good reason like they all have justifiable grounds to support the thing that they support well this is i'm just like shooting from the hip here but like why don't we fork maker dowel and have the futurist maker dow and the centrist maker dell and the decentralist maker dow and each one can produce their own stable coin like we'll have to sacrifice that like net liquidity that we get from having one central stable coin but then we have like the super decentralized dollar pegged die stable coin uh we have the futurist die dollar peg die stable coin that's based off of real world assets that plays nice with nation states and makes them happy uh and like we can make a version of maker dao that corresponds to each one of these like ethos and i think there's also a world where we do that and that actually the mkr token is like the thing that's shared between all three of these models so like and you have like the mkr governance token but then you have like three maker dow commercial banks that are governed by the same mkr token uh that's like my quick take i don't know how feasible that is yeah that i i think that is an interesting take and that indeed might be what happens but um you said it yourself like the sacrifice there is you lose the shared liquidity of die which is but i was talking to um uh kirk from volt yeah from volt protocol and he's a big fan of just like we don't really get super robust stability until we have many stable coins uh and so like having many options uh is good uh and so there's also synergies that happens as a result of that too so you create all of these options and then maybe you kind of like tokenize those options together into kind of one basket one basket which becomes the staple coin yeah it's interesting i i do think all of these factions will play out uh to some extent as they have already uh david what do we got coming up next oh my gosh coming up next new liquid staked eath token on the scene got another competitor to lido's stake teeth and rocket pool's r east coming out from a big exchange i wonder what exchange that is and how a roll-up just made ethereum seven times bigger that's a big number seven ethereums uh we also got facebook and instagram expanding their nft offerings which you know usually is like a big headline um uh and so we'll get into that as well but also i think a really funny story it's not that big of a headline but a funny story crypto.com accidentally sends 10 million dollars instead of a hundred dollars to an australian woman woman and uh ryan guess guess who's got a new house the australian woman's got a new house uh so all these stories and more after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitram is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you can now bridge straight into arbitram for more than 10 different exchanges including binance ftx kuobi and crypto.com once on arbitrary you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe new to arbitron for a limited time you can get arbitrary nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrary odyssey the odyssey is an eight-week long event where you complete on-chain activities and receive a free nft as a reward find out more by visiting the discord at discord dot gg slash arbitrome you can also bridge your assets to arbitrarily at bridge.arbitrum.io and access all of arbitrom's apps at portal.arbitrum.one in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are

get started alright guys we are back a new liquid staking token is on the scene that is staked eath but liquid so you could do all the things that you do with the steak d uh token that you do with eath itself uh coinbase is the one doing this right now david what are the details here uh yeah i mean it's pretty straightforward cb eth alongside our ether from rocket pool and staked st eth from lido we now got cbe i think this is the first significant staked derivative token from a centralized exchange so that also enters the world of d5 staked east derivative tokens in d5 now coming from coinbase uh it is important to note that like coinbase charges a whopping 25 of your staking fees if you stake with coinbase and so if you buy this cb ethan defy you're implicitly paying that percentage uh and so like the yields on these things because there's going to be a yield war ride on these like staked derivative tokens like you know who who's going to be able to inject the most yield into their state d token uh 25 fee on this one yeah yeah um absolutely and he here's a dune analytics board about this so there is um 654 000 uh cb eth so far right now so that is about a billion down in market cap that's a ton and so are are you worried david that like you know the centralized exchanges will come like they are the liquidity engines of the entire market because they have the the gateway to fiat and like many of like the rocket pool doesn't have that for example are you worried that something like cb eth is going to take from uh just using raw kind of liquidity power of its of its stake derivative token take from all of the decentralized uh you know options and from solo stakers i don't know i do always believe that the ethereum ecosystem has like the natural antibodies to resist centralization like this dan elser when he wrote this piece the death of ethereum the d-e-t-h of ethereum the delegated eth was predicting this stuff like this would emerge eventually and he was totally right so like it's actually kind of cool to be able to fast-forward like two three years after he wrote that article he's like oh here we are um uh i mean the 25 percent fee versus lido's 10 percent and rocket pool's 15 uh that's gotta it's got to mitigate that somehow and also like if rocket pool had a bug and we lost all the eath like that's a protocol so like no one's really coming to save you if that eath gets locked if coinbase has a bug and like depositors lose their eath like i bet you coinbase is gonna pay figure out how to pay back those that lost funds and so like there's probably some implied like insurance mechanisms based into some of these centralized ones that are pretty compelling i don't really know but i'm happy to see there's more competition on the market per all per usual yeah so so am i i'm happy to see the competition i you know i part part of me wonders if we won't just have another lesson to learn in crypto like some of these um derivative staking centralized derivative staking tokens will become like very big and then at one point something bad will happen we talked about some of the bad scenarios in our episode with justin drake earlier this week right so maybe there's a social slashing type event right maybe one of these uh the staking of this exchange uh goes down maybe they start like censoring transactions maybe they like straight up lose their keys right not your keys not your crypto right so any cbe that you're purchasing essentially uh the backing of that eath it's an iou for an eath that is held by coinbase so it's not at all the same risk profile you need now i guess all this to say um i think investors will and you know holders will probably make the classic mistake of the they'll look at the rewards and they'll look at the ux and the ease of use but they'll forget they'll forget about the risk side of the equation because risk is very hard to measure and there are a lot of risks that go hand in hand with using a centralized staking provider to stake your eath and the only time we really recognize our the risks is when something like celsius happens right or throughout his capital or like like the terra luna fiasco and then we're like oh okay this is why we need to centralization all right now decentralization thing i forgot that is my worry but um i do think over time like over the long long run we'll have a good balance of centralized and decentralized staking providers and um i think that episode justin gave me more hope on that uh speaking of more hope scalability on the way we teach this a few times but ethereum just got a 7x upgrade okay this is an episode we did earlier this week arb trim released released nitro which their original arbitrarium roll up arbitron one rollup was one uh eth worth of space capacity you can think of it that way and nitro just 7x that so now we get seven ethereums in nitro david how do they do that and what's kind of the news they do that the way that we always make all transactions cheaper on blockchains is through compression magic developer compression technology that's like outside of my brain uh but basically they went from one ethereum worth of scale to seven ethereums this is like a very rough way of like uh explaining these things but it's directionally correct uh and basically that means that they figured out how to compress a arbitrary transaction or a bundle of albert from transaction seven times more previous than versus previous and so now there's just like a smaller per transaction footprint on the ethereum layer one which translates into cheaper gas costs on the overturn layer two absolutely we did an episode if you're looking for all the details behind that we did an episode earlier this week that you can access on the bankless feed of course uh david optimism no slouch either they are just hitting uh all-time highs i think in their metric of gas used that is block space used compute used on optimism as well so it's not just arbitrary moves heating up optimism as well yeah all-time high usage of optimism like i've said it a bajillion times before you've said it too like all of the ingredients for a layer two summer layer two season is like here uh like broccoli doesn't say summer anymore because it's putting a timeline on it yeah well no it's the summer is like growth period it's like black it's more of a now we're going into like we're going into winter in the uh upper hemisphere but we're going into summer in the bottom hemisphere crystal somewhere crypto exists both in both hemispheres anyways uh you know optimism usage all-time high arbitrary nitro on the scene the arbitrary community is absolutely stoked about nitro uh you can just feel it in the chat in the youtube chat uh and so like the the the blossoming of layer twos continues to blossom once again there's a data giant i don't know if you saw this but um a cloud data provider called uh hertzner i've never heard of it before yeah i have not either but um it's apparently it's very large they just banned all ethereum nodes so you can no longer run an ethereum node in the hertzner cloud this is i guess like a mini amazon web services or something like banning ethereum nodes and i guess they said not permitted using our products for any application related to mining even remotely related is not permitted uh hertzner said in a message to its customers even if you just run one node we consider it a violation of our terms of service so they're taking a hard stance against anything crypto inside of their cloud i have no idea where that's coming from maybe um they're worried about sanctions david i don't know the details but i guess one take is um good for decentralization it'll get some of our nodes out of these cloud service providers what's your take yeah i don't really think these stories mean much i was doing a call with coinbase one of their like education education calls and somebody asked this question about like yeah is is this bad and like this is also a conversation on twitter it's like is it bad that we have a ton of nodes in like cloud infrastructure and in my mind like though like if you host a node in a cloud infrastructure like it's the most meaningless kind of node possible like why do we run nodes in the cloud it's because the cloud gives you the easiest and cheapest computer if you need to run a node you can either like go to the store buy a computer build a computer host one yourself and like keep it up and running in your own apartment or you can go to aws and run a node there it's always going to be easier to do it in the cloud no matter what your cloud service provider is but it's always it's also therefore the most inconsequential so if it goes down you either just go to another cloud server or if all of cloud servers go down and they just outright ban all the theorem stuff then you go and build your own note and so it's the same concept of like water flows downhill and nodes will be spun up on the infrastructure that's easiest to spin them up on just to make development easier but that doesn't actually mean if you if there are like if they say say orion there's about like 10 000 ethereum nodes out there maybe 20 000. maybe we add on like 20 200 000 ethereum nodes on aws that has no meaningful consequence on the direction of the ethereum blockchain that doesn't give jeff bezos any undue control it just means we have a ton of nodes in aws yeah and if he bans them all we just route around him you just route around him and like if jeff bezos is like oh all of these nodes that are in aws i want them to listen to the ofac chain of ethereum well those are meaningless nodes because the more meaningful nodes are the ones that are run by individual community members that are are just like inside of your own homes those are the more valuable versions of nodes and even if you went to the worst case scenario where all the cloud providers together colluded which is like very improbable they all clued and they said no ethereum inside of our cloud infrastructure it would be a pain in the ass it would be like a ux it was a problem temporarily it would slow us down but then we'd route around we'd use decentralized networks we'd use like ipfs we'd use like bittorrent type p2p type technology and the network would still continue until they relax their policies you can of course always go to ethereumnodes.com and see just a list of publicly available ethereum nodes that you can hook into at any time that you want i basically i think david they'll be forced to reverse this kind of thing because the greatest defense that crypto has and will always have is the value it brings to the world the utility yeah right and so um once it would start that utility starts to kick in then uh hurtster is going to reverse their decision to be like oh we like nfts oh we have to run ethereum nodes in order to have all of these you know um all of our customers who want nft infrastructure okay we've reversed that decision i mean that's that's how it happens that's my take on this is like somebody just saw like ofac ethereum and then they're like are we exposed to this and then they say oh we are exposed to this you know what we should do ban aetherium and like they put that much thought into it yeah exactly uh vitalik maybe put a lot of thought into the book that he is releasing by the way this book is on its way to my house david if you've got your copy i haven't got my copy yet no it's called proof of stake this is vitalik's first book i think this is like a rehash of of many things that he's written um it's kind of co-written with him and another writer who's taken some of his work but i think vitalik's goal here is to actually um you know talk to kind of the the philosophy of krypto and the blockchain as he does so often on his blog and not talk so much about like kind of the the price and other things uh so i'm looking forward to getting this but he just released a digital copy nft copy with all of the proceeds going to uh git coin i think there's been like 100 eth or something raised so far oh not sure what the latest is great uh but pretty impressive yeah we were making that joke though the first time this was announced that like all this ethereum merge thing is for vitalik to be able to sell his book that's a terrible terrible joke uh i did ask for talent hey if you talk you want to come on bank list we can talk about your book he's like well the book is just like an aggregation of everything i've talked on bank list over the last like 15 episodes i've been on so but of course i'm still gonna buy it i'm not gonna not buy vitalik's book obviously uh instagram david facebook and instagram are allowing the posting of nfts i think this is in some specific areas but this is meta continuing progress on adoption of nfts any thoughts on this i still haven't seen usage of it inside my corner of instagram i'm just testing it with some select us creators right now yeah so yeah you're waiting to wait until the usage you're waiting for the usage waiting for the usage uh this is what it looks like i'm showing a screenshot here i'm just sold in nft so this is an nft i guess on instagram all i really see is just like a bunch of surface area for nft haters to hate more on nfts wow that's another subject uh and it reminds me of our next like link here which is um reddit just launched their nfts but notably the term nft is not mentioned yeah it's smart well so all of a sudden everyone loves nfts if we just stop calling them nfts do nfts have a very bad name at this point they're almost like i feel like they're like icos where in 2017 except in a broader audience because icos didn't get very broad right um but nfts went on jimmy fallon went completely mainstream and now suddenly everyone hates them yeah how do you think that is just price yeah it's like it's like that in-group out group thing like why are people spending ten thousand dollars on like a monkey instead of a instead of like normal stuff uh and and also just like i will always say that when there is nft hate it's because we as an industry haven't created nft either the nft that that person wants specifically for them or the form factor isn't right yet like all of these free nfts or nfts that you like naturally accrue in your like gaming app that aren't labeled as nfts are going to win hearts and minds as soon as we figure out how to make those damn things because the brand of nft is down bad do you know i saw uh speaking of reddit i saw a reddit post uh and i just like clicked in it because it was like interesting title to me it was what's the most annoying way to start a sentence was the prompt right and so all of the redditors like replied with their response and one of the most like upvoted one was this you started with this as an nft owner i think that in the future this statement as an nft owner is going to make very little sense because nft is just a form factor especially it's just oh my god if you replied that in that in that uh thread you would have been down voted so hard david there's a reason why i don't engage in like i don't try and defend nfts on reddit ryan i have better things to do with my time well it's it but i also think that some people are um kind of rebelling or reacting to the way they've experienced nfts from like nft bros or like influencers who've tried to shield them things and so this is all part of the visceral reaction let's do a show pass let's go to ticketmaster what are they also using nfts in the flow blockchain to let event organizers issue nfts tied to tickets now i do think this means that the nfcs themselves are tickets but they can also be other things as well uh simply like just memorabilia or like a ticket stub or something just to cr commemorate the event you know i was thinking about this ryan i we've i me definitely uh have been highly critical of uh flow as a blockchain because it's just like the ripple of nft so highly centralized but i actually don't hate this use case for the flow blockchain neither do i man i think this one is like i don't even hate nba top shots on flow i don't hate any of it yeah i think that's right yeah like assets like uh like a crypto punk or like a board ape need to be on ethereum because those are very close to like financial assets with a lot of capital but like blockchains are host data now and for and forever and i'm not sure that like tickets don't want information mainnet ethereum yeah i don't think that makes a ton of sense so this use case of flow does make sense to me i think these are great use cases for like you know side chains and like um even even uh chains like we're talking with arbitrary nova which don't use ethereum as a data availability letter layer and are far cheaper or even like centralized um i guess like centralized databases right i mean that's kind of what this is uh but you at some level though at some point you you start to get with where the the chain itself is so centralized and so closed uh that's it's just kind of like why do it anyway why is it blockchain anyway why not just have a database so i'm not sure where that line is but it's a good point yeah there's something there uh all right do you remember the goose nft yeah it's the art blocks nfc yeah that was sold for like 5.3 million dollars i think to three hours capital yeah yes uh and i think suzu had the famous tweet our thesis is it looks like a goose no the thought the thesis is we like the goose we like the goose yeah i like the goose that's the exact quote and it does look like a goose it definitely looks like times genius this is amazing this is the future you know what that's worth 5.5 million dollars because it looks like a goose wow i wonder what it's worth now i guess the goose was just um uh sold a year ago on the 27th two three years capital two three hours capital and now it's part of the bankruptcy uh liquidation process some people are speculating that's actually going to go for more than 5.2 million are you kidding me yeah just because of the story i can't even it's not like it's just like instagram is legendary it's very legendary this is what the goose took the the trillion dollar hedge or the you know 20 billion hedge fund down that's the story you can find the straw that broke through capitals back the goose that broke three errors capitals back beautiful see now you're feeding into it you just made it more valuable good job dude totally in interesting news on the regulatory side the fbi just issued a warning over vulnerable d5 platforms and they outlined three specific attack factors and they cited the 1.3 billion dollars in crypto that was stolen just the first quarter of this year so this is the fbi david's saying uh guys get your stuff together you're making our jobs hard and also like uh basically the america's enemies like are taking this money what percentage of gdp do you think north korea made on crypto hacks last year what percent of their gdp minimum double digits right like that's incredible so you can almost you can understand north korea make money how do they what's their what's the north korean business model there is not much coming in i mean it's all kind of like um you know raw like materials like um physical materials and this sort of thing right um sadly uh it's definitely definitely not coming in from other sources and so the fbi said here are some attack vectors d phi you should watch out for flash loans watch out for those and they name a project project bzx where thieves got 55 uh million dollars exploiting a vulnerability and defies uh in token bridges such as the nomad token bridge or manipulating uh cryptocurrency prices by exploding oracles like this is the fbi getting into the details they just described a flashlight a bridge attack and an oracle attack here and i understand so i guess what i would say is i very much understand where um the executive branch is coming from in these types of things because they're having to clean up they're having to be the enforcement when things get stolen in the real world and go like this is this is this is who the d5 companies the bridges attack they're calling the fbi and saying hey can you help us guys like criminals made off with our money and fbi's like what are you doing you left the doors open yeah get your stuff together this is kind of goes back to our conversation of like we need like new internet police like new we need like the the white house it does sound scary we need like the white hat version of like the lazarus group so like oh the lazarus group just hacked that bridge well we need like the un lazarus the lazarus undoers to like go hack the lazarus group to get our funds back like we need something like that yeah and we need like internet avengers more robust code as well internet adventures yeah that's something son would be uh would be on there yeah david give us this story oh god this is hilarious okay crypto the crypto.com 10.5 million dollar accident so crypto.com accidentally transfer transferred 10.5 million dollars to a woman instead of a hundred dollars the women uh user customer of crypto.com asked for a hundred dollar refund which they just happily like refunded her but they instead refunded her 10.5 million dollars instead of 100 what what happened was that they accidentally account entered her account number into the payment field rather than the refund amount and then hit send and of course you know irreversible blockchain transactions this is how this happens uh and so uh after and that was seven months ago that happened seven months ago and they didn't realize it so for seven months this lady received 10.5 million dollars uh and you know what she did with that with that money ryan i'm sure she gave it all back to krypto.com the moment she received it i'm sure she did not do that so what she actually did was bought a 1.5 a 1.35 million four bedroom property in melbourne and then smartly immediately transferred the ownership of that property to her own sister who lives in malaysia which has made it extremely difficult for crypto.com to get their money back because she like quickly bought a house and then transferred ownership of that house to somebody who's like irrelevant uh and so like i'm sure this lady is gonna get in trouble like yeah like you that's i'm sorry no like and that's funny not it's not yours yes but she bought a house and gave it to someone and so like now they have to go undo that which i that has to go to courts and i don't really know how that's gonna unfold a bank has made an error in your favor collect 10.5 million dollars and then go buy a mansion with it and give it to your sister wow that's so funny uh all right quick rebrand in the orca protocol world orca protocol is now metropolis and they are opening up their pods for beta access i did a layer zero with uh julia rosenberg about orca and now metropolis and about how uh orca now metropolis allows dals to become uh modular uh so uh ryan and i believe that the future of blockchains are modular blockchains and i also believe that the future of daos are modular dows rather than monolithic dals and metropolis metropolis protocol is pioneering this future so they are now having a rebrand and they are open for beta very cool metropolis like the like the city i guess cities yeah moving on to raises you know proof so this is uh kevin rose's um initiative around the proof collective and the um moon birds community yeah the one the one that's behind your head right now yes the one that's behind my head right now uh they just raised 50 million dollars from a16z and many more i feel like at some point in time we're going to have to get caught up with kevin rose to see what they are doing with all of this funding but i think they're going big on this stuff creating an entire ecosystem creating like entirely new worlds around proof uh and i'm pretty excited to see what they what they deliver what they build and i think like thank god we have kevin rose building out this frontier of what you can do in this corner of like the web three universe like a real use case for and he knows what he's real because he knows what he's doing and he's putting all of his energy behind it like this isn't just like a side project uh he is intentionally like building out he's like he's pioneering this planet this frontier single-handedly yeah and uh i thank him for that service totally good uh all right reddit uh do you know alexis ohanian i guess no we just we just talked about dig now we have to talk about reddit huh alexis ohanian he just raised 177 million dollar crypto fund so this is all going to crypto the quote says now is potentially a unique opportunity to invest in strong founders at a discount this is from alexis ohanian and their marketing material i love that he says a unique opportunity to invest in strong founders at a discount because back at the top of the market in 2021 like the favor was definitely in the hands of founders it was like which give me all of your money vc's because you're totally gonna give it all to me and now the the the tide the tables have turned very much in favor of vcs with capital uh and so that leads us into the next race with genesis raising 500 million dollars galaxy and genesis execs range raised 500 million dollars uh because you know power is in the hands of the vcs uh and so there's still plenty of private money out there uh going into crypto startups well this i i mean very very good strategy obviously for vcs to raise during the bull market and then deploy during the bear market and of course that's a good strategy for you too retail investor like if you're thinking about these markets right um better to buy during the dip or when things are quiet than than by the top um david gotta talk about jobs this is our opportunity your opportunity i should say if you're a listener in a bank list to go get a job in crypto we've got the jobs board here from bankless i'm gonna read out a few jobs number one from superform is senior backend engineer bick green a full stack developer oh my god david has lights this time a software engineer market data at missouri another software engineer over media dydax needs a back-end software engineer steak fish an hr business partner what's that typical back-end engineer full-stack software engineer at stake fish a front end and a devops engineer at stake fish too bankless needs somebody over media operations doing podcasts and such boardroom labs needs a software engineer over dow governance go get a job in crypto and as your opportunity we will include a link to the bankless job boards you can subscribe to the job boards and get these delivered to you on a daily weekly basis we will remind you every week as well in the meanwhile until you get a job in crypto and then we'll continue to say it won't we yeah we will get two jobs in crypto start another podcast in crypto what do we got next david uh coming up next questions from the nathan nation lots of eat staking questions so if you have questions about east aching maybe this is one of yours and also an interesting question what about bitcoin maxis do we agree with right huh yeah and then of course following that some hot takes from crypto twitter so stay tuned for all of that and more but first we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible alright guys we are back as a reminder if you have a question for dave and myself you can ask that question follow banklesshq we tweet out a question every wednesday reply to that tweet get your question answered this is the first one from avigupta.eth when i it's a staking question david when i stake via all these providers like lido finance and stakewise who am i trusting my eath with and can my youth get slashed david who is avi trusting when he is staking his eath with lydo and stakewise yeah so you know not your keys not your crypto and not your keys not your validator and so when you stake with lido you're staking the lido system the letter o dao and so your in lido specifically goes into one of 24 validators and if uh it also i guess gets co-mingled with all the other depositors but say for example like one of the lido validators 124 one of the 24 of them gets slashed holistically like they lose all that ether then i guess like lido becomes like under collateralized by one 24th stakewise like i'm sure they have like a network of validators too but basically you're giving up your rights as a validator your ability to assign messages to whoever you trust so if you stake your ether with coinbase you're trusting coinbase if you're sticking with either either with stakewise you're just trusting stakewise if you shake your ether with rocket pool you're trusting the rocket pool protocol uh and so can your east get slashed it's like well that's up to the facts and circumstances of every single provider anyone can get slashed for all of the reasons that one would get slashed it's definitely not something that is like accidental like you are either trying to attack ethereum and you're double signing blocks and that'll get you slashed that's a big slash that's a big slash you don't just accidentally do that you know like oh i think i'm gonna accidentally happen if people like misconfigure their networks badly enough that's when it can happen i've seen that happen but that's also extremely avoidable right that's the idea of like you have a redundant computer to start signing messages if your first computer goes down but the risk of that the reward of that is like not that much it's just like none of these stackers uh stakers would do that and they're all professionals but it could happen that's one risk um and so like yes technically it can get slashed it would probably be just negligence or just something some crazy black black swan accident by one of these stake providers but technically you're out of control for that um i wouldn't be too worried about that risk one interesting slash condition though that justin drake mentioned on the call is kind of that or on our episode earlier this week is kind of that idea of social slashing so let's say a whole bunch of stakers that you were staking with um decided to censor transactions right well then if the ethereum community kind of like forked onto an uncensored version of ethereum uh you might want to withdraw your deposits from that uh from that staking pool um so there's i think you would you would see that coming yeah you would see that so far away yeah yeah you would hear about like you would hear me unless you were in a cave like you just left it there for a couple of years that sort of thing uh david this next question is from eight hyphen l you're gonna pronounce that i tried i tried 8 hyphen l.e what would a home staker have to do on a practical level to be slashed i thought the recommended client software didn't censor by default and thus not be something to worry about and are you solar stakers or plan to become question mark uh yeah so as a home staker what do you have to do to get slashed the most likely event is when the one i talked about where like you have your computer you have your validator and it's staking as it should and then you want to get like fancy with it and you want to have a redundant computer with the same signing keys as the active computer and you have it configured so that the active computer if like the internet cuts out or like loses power or whatever then the the standby computer notices that the active computer is offline and so then the standby computer goes online and starts signing messages to maintain zero downtime the risk here is that the standby computer comes online and the active computer is actually still online for whatever reason uh and then you are have two computers signing with the same messages and that will get you slashed that's we've seen that happen before there's definitely ways around this look at dvt technology from obel and also just don't do it just take the penalty just take the the the leakage penalty the leakage penalty is so low it is equivalent to how much ether rewards you are making but in the opposite direction as opposed to getting slashed and getting penalized instead you just make a negative amount of yield and so just like just take just take it you're just like you set yourself back a day two days i know how long are you away from home uh and it's not worth the extra risk that's the most likely reason why you would get slashed uh you see uh this asker says i thought the recommended client software didn't censor by default yes all client software does not censor by default uh you have to do something you have to tinker with that client if you want to start censoring things that's going to be at an ad hoc basis so yes it's not something to worry about are we a solo staker or do we plan to become one uh bankless does stake we stake with a friend of ours who is not uh located near us they're at a different physical location uh so i guess we're not solo sakers because me and ryan stake together with the help of a friend uh i travel a lot uh and ryan has kids that might kick over his computer so who knows i do actually plan to become a solar staker david on the other side of the merge just like running a little bit um from the house i think that's important i want to you know test it myself another question on staking from happy joe at happy joe asks if i have 64 eth do i get more yield by staking 2 times 32 eth or 1 times 64 eth what's at the root of this question david yeah so actually there is no such thing as one time 64 eth there is only units discrete units of 32 ether so if you have 64 eth right or you know a 6 ether you have if you have 96 ether you have three validators uh you don't make one validator with multiples of 32 you just spin up two validators uh and so that is and that is when david says two validators by the way you can spin up many validators on the same machine so he's not talking about like oh you have one computer per value could you imagine no so so you could have one computer like my my macbook my laptop could probably run i don't know hundreds of validators yeah i think a raspberry pi is considered pretty damn safe to 10 10 validators so one raspberry pi can manage that's 33 320 each right um i think if you're on a macbook pro like yo you can like really juice that thing up i think people get confused about like um the 64th because when you deposit and like a staking provider like um like coinbase it feels like oh i'm giving 64 ethan to this thing and or 12 or arbitrary number right but behind the scenes of course coinbase has to spin up as many uh validators is kind of divisible by by 32 and the total amount of heath divided by 32 is the number of validators they are running in the background correct right and like when you deposit 16 eth into rocket pool as a validator 16 more eth comes from other people to fill to backfill that and then you get to 32 for example yep so it's all 32 all the way down 32 all the way down it's like bits uh all right what are the things you agree with bitcoinmaxis on this is teemu.lens asking that question david do you agree with bitcoinmaxis on anything yeah quite a lot right it's like i agree with bitcoin bitcoiners have everything right on principle like our principles with what bitcoin is i think is really really aligned that venn diagram overlap is significant it's the execution that we disagree on so things like a self-sovereign monetary policy that humans don't tinker with i want that uh a calcified blockchain that doesn't change in the long term i want that uh you know censorship resistance i want that all the same principles we fundamentally agree with bitcoiners it's just like we disagree on how to actually apply that when it comes to a blockchain so i think you know if you have a bitcoin blockchain you actually don't get censorship resistance because you have to do financial activity at the centralized layer like there's no defining bitcoin and so i disagree with how you actually achieve censorship resistance versus what bitcoin or c but the base principles are very very aligned i very much agree with them on most things in that camp will said i have nothing to add i pretty much agree with uh with all of that and one thing i will say though is um vitalik has uh said before that ethereum values are bitcoin moderate values right and i think that's an interesting take too uh one maybe area of disagreement with bitcoin maximalists is because the question is specifically with bitcoin maximalists they agree or they they think that the only manifestation of this thing is bitcoin right um and like that is the the departure i would say from what you and i believe and what they believe um and um they're not like there's not the pragmatism i would say that there is in kind of the ethereum community of like hey there are different routes to get there and some are some are more pragmatic and um you know not as cut and dry as bitcoin was created by satoshi it's never changed fully immutable 21 million forever right um that's kind of like written in in bitcoin maximalist law so the ideas are similar but the i guess the manifestation of those ideas the implementation of them are different right i'm reminded of that meme where it's a star trek beam where the lady is asking two dudes like are you two friends and the bitcoiner is like no and the ethereum is like yes i totally agree with that um all right david some takes of the week why don't you read this first one from gaston yeah good times create centralized projects centralized projects create bad times bad times creates decentralized products projects decentralized projects create good times i love this take i thought this was so good i feel like this is just really emblematic of the tail end of 2021 where a bunch of centralized products projects which touted decentralization turned out to be centralized and created a bunch of bad times ryan i think you name the blockchain what comes to mind uh tara sir yeah yeah that whole fiasco created some bad times not only that um three hours capitals big centralized kind of fund on blackbox celsius you know centralized lending celsius also touting decentralization but was super duper centralized yep uh some bad times but on the back of this it says bad times create decentralized projects does that mean during the build market that's where we are we are here we're here okay bad times creating decentralized projects i'm okay with being here for like a while yeah like i could spend a good year here before we get to like the good times how long are we into this thing are we just a few months is that 20 22 six months or second half of 2022. um i think stuff really started to go bad you know may this year may june yeah so we're a little bit more than one quarter into it yeah just a quarter okay so i could i could spend like five or six quarters here before i'm feeling a little restless yeah or longer i don't care i i'm down to have a wintery winter for sure that's cool uh here's the take maybe it's maybe because of this ryan shot out of him says 99 of the crypto industry is a joke but the remaining one percent will change the world first off any thoughts on that take since it's yours but also why uh why i just wanted to say this it's a bit of um you know uh of course you know the market cap of legitimate projects like bitcoin ethereum many other projects that we think are fully legitimate is greater than one percent right sure so there's a little bit of hyperbole here but the reason i wanted to say this 99 of the crypto industry is a joke is i think that we should say that explicitly to lower the defenses of people who aren't on the inside of our industry but are on the outside looking in like the very first thing we should say is guys we acknowledge all of the scams all of the shenanigans all of the stupidity yes that you see it that you see in here you are correct you are hundred percent right we acknowledge that i'm not trying to defend any of it it's stupid and then after that you kind of say but there's something here there's like one perc there's a sliver of like incredible technology and political social movement and social layer that is absolutely going to change everything and if you stop at the 99 of the joke part you don't get to that one percent will change the world then you'll miss out on this thing but first step is acknowledging it specifically you're talking when you're talking to someone outside the crypto industry good take love it all right david now we'll get to your take this is you the merge reduces eth's gravity by 90 percent david hoffman take okay i know it reduces eths issuance by 90 of course we've talked about that the triple happening post-merge that's what's going to happen why are you saying the word gravity rather than issuance here right because uh proof of work minors the the theory behind proof of work minors is that proof of work as a mechanism fundamentally approaches 100 of cell pressure therefore issuance plus proof of work the combination of those two things is always like a downwards pull on price and so proof of sake is the fundamental opposite it's the complete inversion of that so proof of stakers are competing with each other on who's more bullish because as more people stake more eath the yields go down and so like the way that this works is that the people that accept the lowest yields are always the last one staking and so the most bullish people are always accepting the lower lower and lower yields as staking becomes more and more saturated and so where proof of work miners are on a race to sell their asset stakers are in a race to be more bullish than the asset so like with proof of work it approaches 100 of cell pressure and with proof of stake it approaches zero percent cell pressure it goes in the opposite direction and so when we reduce our issuance by 90 percent it's like it's just another metaphor like last week i was talking about like this swimmer that has a swim upstream and it grows really strong muscles and then the current goes away and all of a sudden those strong muscles can move ether forward the same thing with ether issuance is that when we reduce issuance by 90 and go to proof of stake it's like we're turning gravity off on the east price it's like when it jumps it's going to jump 10 times higher because the gravity is turned off on ether we have no moon gravity rather than yeah e3's got moon boots yeah well it's easy it's 10 times easier to get to the moon how do you like that metaphor i i like it a lot since it's merged temper i'm feeling in the mood for these uh kind of bullish tweets i think you're always in the mix david uh last thing i'll read it from eric wall on the last take of the week andrea andreas antonopoulos was and still is a great man and probably the best bitcoiner who ever existed and this is kobe under it saying he's such a legend and then uh picture what are we looking at here yeah a picture of just a kobe and andreas and tanobus posing for a photo with just a nice high five which definitely looks like a london bar uh i'm guessing uh that's because that's where kobe is uh and kobe says the world's greatest bitcoiner era of course andreas next to the world's worst bitcoiner which is of course kobe i just thought it was a good photo it's a nice black and white photo kind of looks like an oldie photo that was a good photo i um andreas is one of the people who got me into crypto i will say back in like 2014. and um he is i know sometimes david and i give bitcoin maximalists a hard time we're not giving bitcoiners a hard time um andreas to me is like the greatest bitcoiner who ever existed he i think he exemplifies all of the good parts of bitcoin and i wish more andreas's were still counting themselves as bitcoiners because like that is a person that um does not embarrass me like when i call myself a bitcoin i'd be i'd be proud to be associated with someone like uh andreas he's here for the right reasons um he cares very deeply about the fundamental values of censorship resistance and immutability and like what we're building in crypto and he stayed true from the very beginning he's also incredibly articulate and a very persuasive thinker and a genuinely good person who's upheld his reputation over the decades how many other people in crypto can you say that about so right um if you ever want an example of of somebody a bitcoiner that um david and i think very highly of uh and would want to emulate and would want to be backless to be associated with it's andreas antonopoulos um he should come on the bankless podcast we still haven't made that happen we've tried to we've tried to get him on he'll come on eventually hopefully um his his internet of money books ryan were they they were the first like piece of non-technical bitcoin literature that really opened up my brain to what this thing is and when i would listen to his talks on youtube and they're all just chock full of metaphors and like people uh talk about like bank lists they're really good at their metaphors like i'm so honored that people say that about us because i look to andreas antelope antonopoulos as like a personal hero in this space as somebody who really commands like the literary power of metaphor to help democratize access to the information behind crypto uh so like not only is it am i totally in agreement that like he's the world's greatest bitcoiner just straight up personal hero uh yeah and if you haven't read andreas antonopoulos's internet of money volumes one and two add that to your like required reading material because it will grow your understanding of crypto yeah absolutely uh there we go alright what are you bullish on this week david uh i'm bullish on bankless's brand new live streaming infrastructure which i think the viewers on the youtube definitely got a taste of that because the formatting is a little bit different still got some work to do so let me get some templates from our designer to make that black background more interesting but the obs the broadcasting suite service that i use and also this physical studio has now finally been done like we're done here it's good you turn the lights on again yeah i'll say that again so okay oh i i should have let into it uh but so the uh wes the guy that was helping me set the stuff up he sets up the the normal like lights right so like youtube lies got some blue in the background and and then once he's done with that he's like okay i'm done setting up all the lights for the studio but would you like party mode lights and i go for a half second yes yes i would like party mode lights and so now i have party mode lights in my in my uh apartment wow that's awesome man are you going to use that outside of the podcast i have people over here oh like this this is like when i'm just working like writing and doing some work we got party mode lights on that's awesome i don't know david's in the club it's good uh right we need a lot of things uh roll-ups i think arbitrary nitro earlier this week right so it's only been a year since roll-ups kind of came out like evm compatible roll-ups uh and uh we just got seven x more ethereum's out of it in just a year's time all right seven more ethereums yeah i don't like you don't have to do the math but like if you do 7x every year that's a lot of transactions per second that's a lot of scalability and not only did they do that you also have like technologies like nova for example which is like relaxing the requirement to put data on jane and store it else elsewhere what i learned in that episode we did earlier this week is like if the data availability piece if that part goes bad that it just folds back gracefully into a roll-up i didn't know if roll-ups could do that david um so it's not like that bad of a trade-off at all and i guess all of this makes me kind of wonder about sort of the thesis for like if you're a monolithic layer one how are you competing here right because you can't be compete on a security from a security perspective right that's out of the question and now roll ups are getting like just as fast as you and just as cheap as you faster so how do you compete how do you compete ryan you you go sue other layer ones that's what you do well if you're shady but like if you're not shady and i think there are some like many layer ones out there that like aren't developing into shady practices maybe a solana for example right um is legit trying to have more respect for solana now than i used to well trying to do things well right and so how do they compete they have to compete on business development this is why we see things like a solana store i genuinely believe they're trying to compete on business development um but i think the long term on this is that um it's going to be difficult because i'm seeing some of these roll-ups and their biz dev is firing up right so like polygons already crushing it right like optimism we got zk sync we've got arbitrary like arbitrage hired that like former face somebody big ass big big company marketing development team they are they are learning like the business development skills and they started technical now they're learning the business development so it's gonna be hard for uh the middle to hold and so what i think we'll be left with honestly is like on one side you'll have ethereum which is kind of the the modular settlement layer strategy and on the other side you'll actually have cosmos right and like i mean the cosmos ethos not necessarily cosmos but this messy array of self-sovereign chains and i i think they'll be not much in the middle i don't think the middle will actually hold yeah so it is back to kind of like you got ethereum and then you got the cosmos ecosystem and not much in the middle right and maybe this has always been the way um this industry has kind of evolved because these have been the two dueling visions uh anyway that was kind of a realization for me this week and i'm excited about the scale we've just brought to uh to ethereum once again 100 yeah i do think the era of monolithic blockchains is over like you're going to get outcompeted just by raw tech by the way we're doing a lot with uh cosmos in october and sunny from cosmos to come give us the cosmos vision uh but i mean we wanted to do it now but like can't do it now it's merged timber so we're going to do cause tober with um there we go all right david meme of the week time what are we looking at uh we're looking at the drake drop uh so drake the drake meme you know the one who's like shunning the first one then pointing to the second one is drake is shining his own drake album drop and then he's pointing towards the actual real drake justin drake the dropping on the bank this podcast ethereum uncensored if you didn't listen to that episode what the hell are you doing go listen to it it was real good did you listen to the second time yet yes i did yeah so did i yeah it was it's because actually i felt like the first time we didn't listen to the entire thing because like connectivity was so bad between justin and ourselves yeah a little fun little piece of trivia on that episode is that uh we um uh it was the internet was so bad that we were using skype which i hate we were all recording both video and audio locally talking to each other on skype uh and then our like magical editors uh luke and dave just like saved this episode uh and you know it sounds flawless it sounds promising yeah it sounds like even maybe better than normal i don't even know how they did that but um thank you thank you thank you of course our time to remind you none of this has been financial advice bitcoin defy crypto all of it's risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the journey it's not for
