you know mark zuckerberg he's creating this metaverse thing he wants to charge people 50 commission on nfts sold in the metaverse and this is basically the uh kind of the app store model you know apple charges 30 and everything i it seems like meta think they can just port this model over to the metaverse and over to nfts and i don't know how he can think that we definitely do not pay 50 on the things we use in crypto and nfts i mean granted we do pay 2 to open c 2.5 right so that's that's something on purchases and that's probably worth it but can you command a 50 margin maybe there's part of the story that like we're not familiar with but also like maybe just people like oh yeah like i'll pay 50 to not get scammed by web 3. all this whole like web 2 doing web 3 things as people get more and more comfortable with it they're going to realize like why am i paying mark zuckerberg such high rent i'm going to go do it for free in web 3 and maybe this is going to be a positive pr move for web 3 over time
