[Music] hey bankless nation i'm excited to bring you my conversation with leighton cusack who is the founder of pool together and for those that don't know pool together is a prize linked no loss lottery and basically what that means is that when you come together to come to pool together uh you come and deposit your your stable coins your crypto dollars but also now defy tokens as well or in into the future many more um but what it does is it kind of is kind of like depositing your money into compound or into ave and you get a yield but instead of getting your interest the interest goes up for a lottery right so you actually don't get the interest unless you win but if you win you not only get your interest but you get everyone's interest and so it's a way to get outsized uh high risk outsized value capture of many people's yields right and so it's a little a little bit of a gamification and it's a really interesting app and uh just a number of weeks ago they released the pool token which helps govern over the protocol we go into all of these details and more in this episode with leighton this meet the nation episode before we do though we want to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get unit swap to be a sponsor for bank list and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto bison cells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over

i actually met layton in person in tel aviv in 2019 i think uh and so one of the few people that i actually met in person before i met online uh but now as we all know now there's very much an online world and so good to see my good friend uh leighton cusack here and uh leighton uh tell us about uh pull together and how it came to be and also what it is yeah yeah for sure well thanks for having me and uh yeah like you said it's funny because we've known each other for a long time and you know i've done some stuff with bank lists i wrote i wrote a newsletter for you guys a couple about a year and a half ago but it's it's funny because there's so many new people in d5 now that we have people all the time who are like hey when are you guys going to go on bank list what are you going to do bank list and uh i thought maybe that means it's time for for another round so yeah so cool together it's actually one of the one of the oldest d5 protocols um it was started about two years ago and the basic idea is it's a protocol for on-chain uh price savings otherwise known as no-loss lotteries and so it's a really cool concept basically it's a savings account you deposit your money you can withdraw whenever you want to but while your money's deposited all the interest from everyone's money is uh is essentially grouped together and then randomly distributed and so basically you have a chance to win um to win really large prizes as opposed to winning like as opposed to earning like a small amount of interest so right now there's like 225 million dollars deposited that generates about like 200 thousand dollars a week in uh these no loss prizes that all you have to do to be eligible to win them is just deposit your money so it's a really um it's a really powerful concept it's a really important uh financial primitive for specifically for people who don't necessarily have a ton of money right like if you're yield farming with 10 million dollars then then uh you know maybe it makes sense to earn uh 10 apr on your money but if you only have 10 000 or something like that then it's much more compelling to have a chance to win like really large prizes than to just uh you know get incremental returns in your money the reason why i really like pull together is that it it's one part like psychological trick and one part uh really good sound responsible money management where like right we we know that the lottery the legacy lottery has product market fit we know this because people keep on buying lottery tickets all the time yes we also know that the lottery as a financial investment as a place to put your savings is not the best thing to do mainly because the odds of you winning and the risk-adjusted odds of you winning just don't play out in your favor it's basically a tax on gambling uh and the nice thing about pool together is that you put in your money and you never ever lose your money and so you always get your money back but it does satisfy people's degen sites right like if they if they want to you know right you try and like input fifty dollars and receive back fifty thousand pull together conserve that need for you right right yeah and that and that's the thing there's there's a lot of people who uh who need that financial tool right and actually so this is a fun little stat because our luckiest winner so far uh they deposited 74 dollars and they won 43 thousand dollars and so they never they they deposited that money they could have taken it out it wasn't it's not like buying a lottery ticket where you lose that money um the the mathematically speaking the key thing with like price savings versus a lottery a price savings is always expected value positive mathematically speaking using a lottery is always expected value negative so where you're what you're saying is totally correct it has like it basically takes the the psychology of like of of randomness and that being fun and it also combines it with actually a healthy behavior which is saving money and puts those two things together and so um yeah it's and it's it's a lot of people are like oh this is this is a brand new idea it's never been done before and it actually it is very well known in certain parts of the world not so much in the united states although um it was because it was only legalized in the united states in like 2014. so it's fairly recent thing in the united states but um but internationally it's very well known and uh it is um it's it's it's it's there's hundreds of billions of dollars in price savings accounts all over the world and so doing it on ethereum obviously it's just like 100 times better right now we have the global digital version of that where which everyone could access which is probably uh maybe you don't do maybe you have some stats perhaps available where you maybe you could compare pool together versus historical pricing savings accounts so do you have that off the top of your head by chance well i mean we're i can tell you that we're just we're just scratching surface so like um just so just in the uk right uh price savings right now is there's a hundred billion dollars deposited into price savings accounts and as i mentioned there's like 225 million and pooled together so we're not even at one percent of like of what price savings are in just one country so it's definitely a lot a lot bigger um and you know in the uk you know 100 billion dollars they're paying out um you know 100 million dollars a month in in prizes obviously on ethereum with higher capital efficiency higher rates of return that could be a billion dollars a month in prices which would be pretty amazing that that's that's the the community has kind of a big goal right now to get to one million in no loss uh prizes per week and right now as i mentioned we're at about 200 000 250 000 depending on interest rates so we're almost you know we're almost there yeah yeah the in the world of crypto the difference between a quarter million and one million actually doesn't really seem all that big it's kind of kind of weird but yeah yeah yeah it's growing fast it's it's coming it's coming quickly so leighton uh say i am a new crypto user and i've just discovered that apys on ethereum are really really awesome and so i want to take my 20 000 in savings and i want to go and deposit into compound to go get that yield uh pitch to me why i should instead perhaps deposit it into pool together yeah yeah for sure well so so a couple things first is i i probably would say do both like most people who use pool together are also using compound or ave most people who are using compound or ave are also using pool together so it's not binary but um i think i think so there's two ways to look at it you can look at it mathematically and say look if i have a certain if i have a certain deposit size i actually mathematically am going to have a better return by going into pool together than by going into compound directly and we can talk a little bit about why that works with the sponsorship and the reserve which is an idea that we talked about a while ago but long story short depositing and pool together has a higher expected um uh return than using the underlying yield source directly so you have a mathematical way you can make you could look at that way the other way to look at it though is if you have twenty thousand dollars you know which is a sizable amount of money um and you're saying if you wanna put say you wanna split that in half and put ten thousand to pool together that's going to give you a chance to win a hundred thousand dollars every week um versus you know even at ten percent apr ten thousand dollars is a thousand dollars a year that's um less than a hundred dollars a month that's not really for a lot of people like earning an extra hundred dollars a month isn't going to make a meaningful difference in their finances but having the chance to win a hundred thousand dollars every week for a year potentially makes a way more meaningful difference and that's actually like a more important financial tool so anyways i guess i'm rambling but like i there there's basically two ways you can kind of use it you can certainly do like the math on it and actually get a better return or you can just say like hey um for me personally having an extra small interest rate isn't going to make a meaningful difference so i'm going for um a life-changing amount of money yeah when people are seeing their like interest rates in their savings accounts or even in compounds like they're not the interest rates that are getting from compound they're not daydreaming about any like villa in some like exotic part of the world right but like they if with their winnings and pull together perhaps they actually could do that um right actually to to me what is interesting to me is the mathematical reason as to why it's actually on a risk-adjusted level why it's beneficial to uh if you are ready to commit to pull together for the long term it actually makes more sense as to why you should deposit in to pull together so why why is it is it true that you can actually get a better return on investment with pull together over the long term yeah so there's there's two there's a really interesting mechanism called the reserve so basically what happens is a portion of every prize gets actually redeposited back into the prize pool and that what that does is then sits in there contributes interest to the prizes all future prizes but it's not eligible to win so like for example right now in the usdc uh prize pool there's about 550 000 of this what we call sponsorship um that basically is money that's sitting there that's eligible to win but um is is sorry it's not eligible to win and it's contributing interest to the prize and so what that does is it effectively it affects it raises the effect of apr um because you have you have more money more money contributing interest to the prizes than there is eligible to win the prizes and so that and that just keeps compounding week by week by week so just like today the usdc prize was awarded and like 60 000 was added to the reserve and you know uh next week it'll be like another 50 or 60 thousand dollars um and so you know you could do the math over the course of a year that's going to be millions of dollars that's going in there so it's a really cool perpetual growth mechanism that basically raises the the yield to always be higher um on top of that which we haven't actually talked about too uh at least right now all depositors into into pool together are also receiving the pool token which governs a protocol they get that for free as well and so that's actually kind of changes it the economics even more right so the the reserve or the or the yeah is it the reserve or the sponsors yeah the reserve it's the reserve rate the reserve rate creates the sponsorship yeah right to to me that is like the the magic perpetual motion of the pull together system right because it basically guarantees that there should always be interested parties depositing dye or uscc into pool together because it is rational over the long term because what this is is like you guys have generated a money robot a contract on ethereum which we don't we don't have to reward we don't have to reward that contract and in fact we can make it reward us that contract rewards the participants and so what's happening is that there is a like how much did you say like one third of the die inside of uh inside of a a a lottery is actually just uh part of the uh the reserve or is that well i was i was talking about the usdc prize pool so like as of today that has like a half a little over a half million dollars in the reserve um so it's like it's like having like a half a million of your competition not be relevant right like all of a sudden your competition actually is just actually in your favor right uh and so and and this is why when you you can look at the compound apy and you can add on a percentage upon on top of that as well proportional to the size of the reserve because you know that right that size of the reserve is only is actually your ally not your enemy when it comes to fighting over this lottery winnings yeah yeah and it like you said it's really cool because it is it's this perpetual growth machine and it runs on its own which is amazing like it just keeps going like it will it will keep going forever because even if every single person took their money out of pool together there would still be a prize because they wouldn't take that reserve would still be there that would still be contributing interest and so um so no one will you know people won't will never take all their money out because that would well it would be very economically irrational to do that right because if everyone took all of their money out then and if there was only no one was there you could immediately re receive free money by depositing one dollar into pool together and then claim all of the interest of the reserve which is growing all the interest yeah and now it's growing yeah which you know in a few months millions of dollars so you would be effectively earning the interest on all that money yeah for free yeah for free how fast has that grown what was the reserve size like just a few months ago well it's i mean it's going fast um so this is actually something that governance just activated like literally a couple a few weeks ago and so um right now right now across the protocol it's growing um a little over a hundred thousand dollars a week um and like so in most sets in the stable coins like the dye in the usdc so like i said just today the usdc grew by 64 000 um and dye is on track to grow by like 50 000 this week so you know yeah let's let's just call it a hundred thousand dollars a week right now um so we're looking at you know five million dollars a year that that's that's really awesome that's really awesome so let's talk about uh the pool token uh so when where did the idea uh talk about the the genesis of the idea of the pool token and also when did the pool token come about it was sometime recently right yeah it's very recent and that's another thing right so pool together has been around for a long time but the the token um is only in the last like 12 weeks or no probably less less than 12 weeks maybe 10 weeks it's been it's been a bit of a whirlwind but um yeah but from the beginning we always had the plan to um build a decentralized protocol that a lot of people could integrate with and that pool together inc the company could then build on top of um and so this was always a plan but we really wanted to work really hard to make sure that before we decentralized it that we had you know the security of the contracts was really solid the audits were the audits were good etc we also wanted to make sure that um the economics like just the way the whole system works made sense and was well balanced and all that and so um we and make sure the protocol was built in such a way where it's very modular so that it could be easily plugged in and so we took a long time to kind of get those things right and and when we felt like it was in a good place where it could sustain itself without us needing to contribute to it um uh that's when we decentralized with the pool token and so that was about 12 weeks ago and yeah we we did a large uh retroactive airdrop that went to everyone who had ever used the protocol and additionally started a um an initial pool distribution to all depositors so we really love this idea of user ownership obviously and um i think it's really cool this concept of like if you deposit into pool together you automatically become an owner and there's no so that's how it works if you deposit into any of the prize pools you automatically immediately start getting the pool token you don't have to do any anything else you don't do any staking or any like crazy stuff and so um yeah so that's that's been a big catalyst for growth yeah you do have to claim it yes but you do um yeah yeah yeah but you don't you just any any any regular deposit will start earning the the pool token um and so that's live right now that's even an additional reward on top of the already slightly juice reward from the pull together lottery so you also are getting a token right and the token comes to you no matter what just a very stable or not not stable but like a weekly distribution rather than a lottery mechanism right there's no there's no lottery mechanism for the winner correct correct correct correct yeah yeah so i think it's like since we've been since we've launched the the like effective like apr has been like 20 in the 20 to 40 percent range on like the stable coin pools for the last like 12 weeks but you know but as as more capital goes in that obviously kind of evens out and so in its current form what does the pool token actually govern over well i mean it controls it controls the protocol so basically you know and that's sort of like an abstract way to say it but there's there's sort of three main things one is um it controls the prize pool so like this reserve right i was talking about it controls the reserves it sets the reserve rate how much how much of each price should go back into the reserve it um it controls the the prize pools in terms of like how many winners are there per week how often are prizes awarded the governance can change those parameters um it also controls about half of the total pool token supply is still is undistributed and it's under the control of the pool token holders so the holders control future distributions of that with the idea being that it should go to the people who are helping to build the protocol so um anyway so i kind of said two things the first thing is like it controls the existing no loss price pools it controls the further distribution of the pool token and then it also controls new no loss price pools so there's a lot of um new yield sources being integrated uh new asset types um deploying on new uh new networks l2s um and so that's the other thing that the pool token holders also control and so where where let's talk about the integrations there if uh just to make sure we check that boxes where does yield actually come from from pulled uh for pool together so the the four the four no loss price pools you see right now if you go to the uh website those are all compound they use compound as yield source but um there's a lot of new yield sources that are being integrated right now so ave actually is launching this week so um there'll be obvious yield source uh yearn uh what iron finance integration is uh is being um audited right now um there's uh there's an integration with like um x sushi so you can actually like the sushi staking mechanism basically any yield source you can think of pool together as a game like a no-loss gamification layer on top of yield generation and so any yield source on ethereum whether it's compound ave you know a staking one rari there's all sorts of them it can be integrated with any of those yield sources so people can then create their own no loss price pools using that yield source and so the the the reserve there's one reserve for every single yield source as well right or is it for every single asset um it's for every the reserve is set uh on the pri at the prize pool level so each prize pool has its own reserve rate and it's set and um that so that's how that works okay so there will be many many different reserves that the pool token governs over all of them collectively correct correct yeah so that's actually kind of a cool thing too so like right now the the the primary no loss prize pools are dye usdc comp and uni and so um the reserve is accruing all of those tokens it's accruing dye usdc comp and uni it accrues whatever the native token being generated is and so as like a sushi pool comes online or rap bitcoin or an ethereum pool etc the reserve is accruing all these different tokens and so essentially you know holding the pool token is you're holding all these different tokens right okay and so this is where highgate really really bullish right because the reserve can be across many many different yields uh uh yield sources and also many many different assets and in theory the pool token just governs over the growing pool right and the the the nice thing about pool together in my mind is it's both actually a relatively simple app to build and i say that as somebody who doesn't know how to code uh take that with a grain of salt right but it's like a relatively simple app to build uh yeah and and also it's relatively simple to have some sort of evaluation on because you can look on chain and see the growing pools the growing reserves of many different asset types and you can see you can see how big they are and how fast they are growing and to me to evaluate pull together would actually be relatively simple it's a relatively simple calculation that is some sort of premium on top of yield aggregate yield inside of defy and so in theory pooled together pull to pull token odors maybe they just want to say call it quits one day and just like empty all the reserves and like i don't i don't i don't think this is ever going to happen but this is a metaphor to illustrate why the pull token has value is that the pool token owners could just like say hey like i want to liquidate i want my share of every single asset that has been accruing for the last like x years uh and i and i just want them uh and in theory that is possible to do by pool token owners and so the pool token is probably evaluated by something uh some some the the net assets under management by the pool system plus the future cash flows of the system plus future growth i think it's really cool yes yeah for sure so i mean you know anyone who hangs out out in our discord knows that you know especially as being someone who was involved in the creation of the project i i don't i don't speculate on on on future evaluations or anything like that but i do but you do but um but in theory you're correct i mean at the end of the day the the honest reality is the pool token holders do control this protocol and you know we've had six governance proposals at this point i still haven't even voted in any of them and so um which is a great thing and so uh yeah and in theory all this is all this is possible and um there's something else i wanted to say about that oh well i do i do certainly think it i view it sort of sort of like an endowment where um the idea is that you know we the governance could also say like once let's say once these reserves get to 10 million or 20 million the governors could also say like oh let's actually allocate these into different protocols or allocate these into like do other things to generate yield with them and then you know bring that back to um to to to create the the no loss savings prices but um there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of interesting things you can do with uh with um once you have like a large amount of capital it's sort of just there to generate yield right there's i can't remember who said this line i think it was like chris burniske but like at maturity all defy apps turns into into on-chain like vc funds or or not hedge funds that's fun right it's kind of true i mean that's kind of what urine is for sure right and and it's actually interesting with urine too because like yearn deposits into pool together but then we also pool together also uses urine as a yield source or is going to use urine with this integration and so there's um yeah there there's there's definitely an interesting uh i think i think that's pretty true yeah yeah so what else does a pool together have in its roadmap what do you guys have lined up next well i mean there's a lot of people working on a lot of different things um i'm privileged to uh to be you know i definitely get to hear about them so um one thing that i wanted to mention because it's launching um today which i'm super excited about is uh dharma the dharma app which some of your viewers probably have heard of it's a really awesome app basically makes it really easy to go from your bank account into d5 they're launching a direct integration so you can deposit directly from your bank account and to pull together um for people who are in the united states and so um that's something i'm really really excited about so everyone should download dharma app try it out um and that sort of fits into like broad categories i would say the main things that people are working on in the ecosystem right now is um like integrations that make it easier to get into easier to deposit and or cheaper to deposit it gas fees are obviously a huge problem so there's um there's a lot of people who are working on like like dahmer is an example of that there's also this thing called pods which is launching another really cool thing where basically it groups people's tickets together which lowers gas costs to deposit but also lets them split the prize if they win so basically anyone can become a whale which is kind of cool um so that's on the front end those are some of the big things and then on the back end it's it's mostly integration into new yield sources uh launching new prize pools with new asset types and deploying to new um uh new like layer twos so those are sort of the main the main uh things going on right and those on-ramps are critically important right because well just aligned with uh pull together simplicity is like all you have to do is deposit like that's basically the only thing you have to do and when we were talking earlier about the magnitude of pricelink savings accounts like elsewhere in the in the legacy world like right that's massive and all we need to do to help export the what the strong premiums that pull together is offering comparative to those things by building building off ramps right so we can get more capital into into pool together um uh i i think dharma is going to be the thing that satisfies the demand of retail season in my mind i think retail season is coming and they and retail is going to expect a user experience right that is comparable to what they are coming from which is things like robin hood or their brokerage uh and i don't think i haven't found any other application other than dharma that offers that sort of experience so i'm perhaps very optimistic about like cash flows into pool together just coming from dharma yeah yeah i mean it's definitely a different it won't you know it's not it's not the whales it's going to be more the mass adoption but i do think i think you know like you said poolgate is very simple and so um i think it is an ideal on-ramp for new people into d5 for like a first d5 protocol to try out because you don't have to put in you can put in 100 and it still makes sense um and so i'm really really excited for the dartmouth integration ding that was a nice pun that you just made out and i don't know if you caught that one did i i don't think i did you put in a hundred dollars and it still makes sense yeah okay now now i get it you're thinking faster than i am um but uh but yeah anyways agree agreed that retail retail is definitely coming and i am so happy to be able to get to a place where i can tell my friends and family like hey you can actually just do this one thing and you don't have to jump through 100 hoops hey guys i hope you're enjoying the interview with leighton so far we get into the subject of pods and how pods allow users of pull together to pick their own risk spectrum which layton calls the reward spectrum really it lets you do you want to put in a little bit of money and have a very low chance of receiving a lot of money or do you want to put in a little money amongst a big group of people and have a very high chance of receiving a much lower amount of money pods are super cool we also talk about l2s uh and also future innovations coming out of the pool together app so don't go anywhere we have so much more to talk about in this interview but first we're gonna talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange let's go into the pods a little bit more um so me me i got a a chat with me and some college buddies and we all like to to play around and defy um say we wanted to pool our money together how would we use pods to get that done yeah so pod serves two functions like i said one is it it batches deposits which is um lowers transaction costs so lower transaction costs deposit by about like eighty percent um but the other function which is really fun is basically if you deposit into a pod and any of the any of the deposits in that pod win uh that prize is automatically split among all the people who are deposited so if you and your friends wanted so say you know a common thing a lot of people say like oh i feel like i don't really have a chance to win i only have a thousand dollars so what you can do is you can say oh get with 10 of your friends or if you want to be more aggressive you could say get with like a thousand of your friends and then you'll have a million dollars and then you'll have a way higher chance to win obviously the prize relatively will be smaller but that actually also gets really interesting too when we think about the interest return being higher than the underlying asset because then you could really like hypothetically if everyone was in one pod you would just be earning an interest rate that's higher than the underlying yield source just right it's just distributed not every second but instead like once a week so um there's a lot of interesting things there but yeah that's that's the idea of pods so i'm really excited about that i think introduces like a cool social dimension to it too um and that those uh should also be going live this week too there's been a developer cain's who's been working on that um and he's been working for several weeks and i think he's almost done to me the cool thing about pods is that it allows uh depositors to really choose their risks risk spectrum right so they they say like what you just said like well if they're if they have uh money in every single pod well then they are just aggregating the they are just getting an aggregate of all pull together yield everywhere and so there's actually no risk right because they are receiving all dividends anywhere from anywhere or they are just doing a solo which is like right or one pod just a pot of one and you're taking maximum risk where like you are highly likely to receive nothing but right perhaps perhaps uh in a very unlikely scenario able to receive a lot and pods kind of let you go through the whole gamut of that full range depending on how many pods and what size of the pods you want to get into yeah yeah and i love that and i yeah i say it's a reward spectrum right because there's i would like to say there's no risk right because right regardless you're not you're not losing your money but you can essentially choose you can choose the return profile you want do you want a return profile that basically offers exponential returns on your deposit but with a low probability or do you want a return profile that offers slightly higher than normal yield with a high probability and you can basically just choose your own adventure on what you want do you have any opinions or ideas as to who is really going to use pods first or what type of other maybe other defy apps or cohorts of individuals that would really find pods useful i mean i think i think we're gas prices have definitely priced out a lot of people who want to use pool together and like we can see that reflected in our stats there's a 100 correlation between gas costs the number of deposits and so i think the first the first big market is people who are in d5 who want to use pool together but don't have a million dollars you know or even ten thousand dollars maybe they have you know pool together is very popular and like uh like china is the number two country for traffic to pool together um south america is really popular as well and so there's a lot i think the main target audience right now is basically people who are in d5 but just don't they're priced out because of gas right and right this will be um helping them have a way to get access to a better yield is there a layer two conversation to be had with pull together yeah well we're already deployed on we're do we're deployed in polygon and that's um that's gonna be launching with integrations to the ave uh deployment on polygon and so that will also be obviously lower transaction costs um planning to use optimism when that launches so our the basic strategy is sort of like deploy it on all of the evm compatible uh blockchains out there and then see which one i'm assuming not all of them will stick and some of them will stick and that'll just be how the cards settle right right yeah yeah let people let people yeah make sure it's there for people to use and um i think uh you know right now though you know i think polygon's gotten a lot of traction especially with this new ave campaign and um you know there's a lot of excitement for optimism um but there's also there's just a lot there's a lot of great stuff i i'm feeling good about skill let's call it scalability summer [Laughter] i was just gonna call it defy summer round two but i do like scalability summer that does roll off the tongue i would like to fight some around too as well either way those both sound fun leighton is there any uh future thing coming out of pool together that we haven't yet talked about or did we just cover all the bases um that's good i think we've covered most spaces like i said there's so many people working on different aspects now it's really cool you know now like i mentioned you know we're not even working on the pods like someone else is doing that and dharma's doing the app and so i'm sure there's other stuff that i don't even know about that's being done which is the beauty once you decentralize the protocol that you have more people working on it but um i think that's the main thing and um yeah yeah i think i think i think we covered the the the big points do you have uh people in the pool together like find a pull together discord trying to find each other to make a pod together have you seen another scene i haven't seen that yeah i think we'll probably see that when it officially launches because it's a face oh that's right that's right it hasn't launched yet just one pod and then but then people are free to obviously create their own and so it will be uh it'll be curious i'm very curious to see how it plays out like do we end up with one really big one or do we end up with like you know 100 small ones right we'll probably be somewhat aggregated because of um just because gas costs sure i'm excited to see how people use pods in ways that we can't really think of right now because i would imagine that there are a bunch of because really to me a pod is just like a it's another version of like a dow it's like a pool together dao that's dedicated for pool together only like there's there's something there that i don't know what it could be but some creative minds i think could really take that into a very interesting logical conclusion right right yeah for sure i mean there's been a lot of people have been interested in like um winnings that go to non-profits or things like that and so you could do that too where it's like okay set up set up a pod and then like the the all if it wins all the money's given away stuff like that is also i think really interesting no no lost donations right yes yes yes uh here's one thing that we haven't actually talked about uh what is pl dye pl die well okay uh it's basically your tokenized if you when you deposit into pooled together you get back a token that represents your deposit and it trades it's obviously one to one to die because you're it's no loss and so um it's uh actually the the ticker technically is now pt die it was pl die previously yeah but um so pt die is your tokenized balance in pool together it's so easy to transfer that or do whatever you want is that fungible with other people's pt die because how do we claim okay so how does the winnings work with pt die the winnings are actually they're literally they're sent to you literally so like if you win your wallet balance will just go up that day okay is it and and pt die is transferable right right so if i transfer the pt die then how do i get the winnings because i've given away my my deposit oh so are you talking about like with a pod uh no no i'm just so like say i come in i deposit 100 die and i get 100 100 get 100 pt die back right and then i send that pt die to my friend right who has the claim on that deposits my friend your friend does yeah yeah right yeah and so if if until my friend now say say that the the deposits win the lottery and but now my friend gets to gets the winnings right whoever i sent that pt die to right and so how does how does he or she your friend would get that money yeah how is the winnings actually associated with specific pt die out there if every if all the pt die out out there is fungible or is it just to the ethereum address that holds pt die is that how the the lottery winners right so right so when you when you transfer when you transfer if you transfer that pt die when doing that transfer will update the eligibility structure in the protocol to say this address now holds this this deposit and so when the um when the winner is chosen which is done it's done using the random number generated by chain link when the winner is chosen using that random number generated by chain link if if if if the index if the number of the index falls on that deposit that's how the protocol knows who to award the um the accrued interest to and it's awarded it's literally it transfers the action of awarding the prize that transaction actually sends that out to all the people who won okay okay so what if what if i have my pt die like uh collateralized inside of maker dow and then like then if you guys sent the winnings there i wouldn't be able to go get that right right so that's actually yeah that's actually a very good observation and that is like a a a problem to be solved early and that's that's part of what um actually pods does though is positive solution to that because it makes it pods operates in a different way where um if the pod wins the exchange rate changes and your balance stays the same and so that's actually fully fungible in that sense whereas the pt die you're right that's why like you don't really want to deposit it on uniswap because uh uniswap would win if if those won um and so there are a few things that uh we're looking at in terms of like you could be able to like wrap them or or things like that to be able to get like uh use them as collateral but that's definitely a outstanding problem to be solved yeah perhaps a call to the uh community to help to help for sure for sure well i mean i i sent a tweet out a little while ago i was like if anyone can figure this out they'll immediately have like 200 million dollars of deposits on their on their platform right because there's so many people who have deposited and pulled together and right now they're not using that as collateral anywhere and so that's definitely a call to the community to say hey uh if you can figure this out you can get a lot of a lot of deposits right right yeah the more and more capital efficient that pool together becomes the more capital will be deposited there right really really interesting right leighton uh this is a pull together has always been one of my favorite defy apps so thank you for coming on bankless meet the nation to tell us all about it if any bankless listener has uh wants to know more about pool together where should they go uh best place
