the concept of layer 2 is actually extremely simple how can we take transactions process them on layer 2 and then roll them up to layer 1. the way that you should understand layer 3 is that essentially we can take the exact same concept and then do it one more time so remember that process that i just described well we can do the same thing where we gather a number of transactions on layer 3 generate a proof for those transactions and then verify that proof in a layer 2 transaction which remember is going to be later verified itself in a layer 1 transaction when that transaction itself is rolled up this is called fractal scaling and what this means is we're able to build different roll-ups with different trade-offs which can be even cheaper which can make even deeper trade-offs and you can build those such that they share a settlement layer in ethereum so you can see in that l3 slot you have a number of different designs for what a layer 3 might look like there's the application specific roll-ups there is the private stark nets all these things which can be built customizably to the needs of world-class games but which can settle all the way back to layer two and will be even cheaper than layer two transactions
