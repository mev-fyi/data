[Music] what up coordination how you doing today on the pod we are talking to governor dao which has a few different primary objectives they're trying to incentivize and maximize engagement of all of their participants in their ecosystem and are trying to do that with a thing called proof of existence which is a sybil resistance tool which helps create more one human one boat systems if you are new to the green pill podcast you may not know it but we are in the middle of season two which is all about decentralized identity and civil resistance so governor dow has been working on proof of existence which is a kyc free biometric enrollment of face and voice that creates an irreversible hash which is a basically a character string that is a unique identifier for a person this biometric data is a one way hash and it is used in order to create a one human one vote system on chain so continuing our streak of talking about decentralized identity and civil resistance we're talking to governor dao about governance as a service and proof of existence if you're inducible resistance i think you'll really enjoy this episode if you're not maybe one to skip over but uh i think civil resistance is one of the most important problems in the web 3 space right now how can we go from one token one vote systems to one human one boat systems that is the design space that we are exploring in season two of the green pill podcast and we are exploring with governor dao this week so without further ado i give you governor dao the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view

for having us really excited to talk about governor dao can you tell me what uh governor dale's use case is and how you all came to build it yeah for sure yes so uh gov governor dao is uh you know primarily an anti-civil resistance uh mechanism um created for you know a variety of use cases we wanted to have a fast easy and anonymous way that doesn't require you know any kyc in order to stop um you know civil attacks and the vectors that come out of them um you know there's a as far as how we kind of came about you know i had previously worked for a biometrics company called finibon uh about two and a half years ago after getting out of there and uh coming back to the blockchain world you know we had kind of collaborated and realized that there was a real use case for you know merging the two technologies and getting them in one place i think jeff can kind of expand on that yeah the the broader ideology behind governor dow is the notion that we think decentralization is good we think dows are good when done right it's very hard to do decentralization right it's very hard to do dow's right um and we try to help people do it better our proof of existence the civil resistance tech that john highlights and probably what we'll spend most of today talking about is our our biggest flagship build out and it's everyone throughout the crypto space has problems with uh with sybil and there's so much cool inspired nuanced things projects could be doing if they could come at civil resistance from a place of confidence and we have other stuff we built on top of it nft mints token launches governance voting modules all that good stuff beautiful so uh green pill is actually in the middle of a deep deep rabbit hole on decentralized identity and civil resistance uh and i think most of our listeners are pretty familiar with civil resistance but just for the avoidance of doubt it's sock puppet resistance so how do we basically increase the cost of forgery and make sure that people aren't making up new accounts and then that what that allows you to do is move from one token one vote systems which are inherently plutocratic to one human one vote systems which are more democratic so any objections to that overview of the civil resistance problem i'd be curious how you would frame it one voice one vote is literally our our kind of our catchphrase um so i mean you you summed it up very well you know i i usually just say uh you know a person appearing to be more than one you know um or variance of that so i mean it's pretty much the same thing i think you it's summed it up very well i think outside of the kryptos uh crypto centric use cases it's just sometimes you don't want bots sometimes you want one person gets one account that's applicable to gaming social media pretty much everything we do online in some way or another right so i'd be curious can you take us down the rabbit hole of proof of existence in governor dao how does that work and uh what does it look like for a developer to integrate with proof of existence john do you want to explain the tech and i'll explain the blockchain yeah sure sure so um proof of existence came out of a previous uh software called seitech right satex created by finnevon a partner company of ours that's used in uh you know various banking applications mostly outside of the us but there's quite a few of them especially in south america africa um some places in europe and you know this this tech was used in call centers first uh you know you call your bank uh you know bank america let's say that's not a place but uh you know you call your bank and um they're able to verify that okay this person's the same person that talked to us last time that talked to us before then so on and so forth and they can get a score of that you know um from there it had moved into a an application format where you know same type of thing for mobile banking you were able to verify with voice and face in order to perform large transactions or kind of administrative type things on business accounts we had taken that same style of tech and you know uh put it on the chain pretty much so we although no inherent portion of the api is obviously on chain um you know that that kind of still exists how it was initially uh currently the the actual pov token itself you know it's obviously uh handled on chain so uh you know the basic uh chain of events is as a user comes to governor dow to our website they take a short series of video clips that you know say a phrase and um locally on their machine the the api hashes or javascript hashes i should say their their voice and face data into uh keka cache cash that's deployed to a an environment a server environment that is quite secure in which case then we are able to fingerprint against that in the future when future verifications come in it uses a best-of-two scenario so it literally says okay this is what you looked like and sounded like on day one this is what you look like and sound like today and not only does it verify with today's against day one it's also going to update to some extent to make it flexible so you know there's a lot of use case scenarios where people say kind of have outliers what happened if i got into a car accident or something else you know we try our best to mitigate those with this kind of learning live technology yeah and then specifically for how it relates to the blockchain we compare that output hash that is your summary of your biometrics against everyone else who has signed up if your hash is unique from all the other hashes it means you haven't signed up before means this is your first time in the authentication portal the wallet that you're signed into when you go through this is now eligible to mint a soul bound or a non-transferable erc20 that we call poe and so we take all the recent enrollments batshit wii bots take all the recent enrollments batch it into a merkle tree plug that merkle tree into a mint or smart contract and then you can go in and mince your poe token it's anchored to your wallet indefinitely into the future and then for any developer out there all you have to do to human gate your uh interaction your your smart contract call whether it's an nft mint or a a token sale or a yield farmer you know anything you want to do in web3 you just append the the function the contract call the the web3.js front-end sign-in uh with one line of code that checks for a balance of this erc20 token and a lot of people ask us uh why not an nft because an nft is more conducive to like identity and it seems like it's more apple samples but the erc20 token that's that's the easiest to integrate uh you know it's like the the atom of web3 smart contracting it's the easiest for any project anyone out there to permissionlessly append their code and check for that and the the ease of access uh for both people signing up and developers integrate is really what we wanted to push for when we created this got it okay so it sounds like governor um gdal proof of existence is kyc free there's a biometric enrollment of face and voice that creates an irreversible hash um which kind of turns uh it's a one-way hash so basically it turns it into a character string which cannot be converted back into the video data because it's a one-way conversion and then that's for security measures and it also probably compresses the data from there there's a merkle tree that creates a balance of an erc20 token and anyone that wants to build on top uh proof of existence can just make sure that you have a balance of that token before you access that smart contract is that a good summary correct correct erc20 balance of equals one for you know developers up there right okay cool um in which which chain is this on is this on the ethereum main net is it on other chains right now we are on ethereum polygon uh rinkaby and kava um where because the um the enrollment is uh off chain stuff that we push on chain we can do it on any evm chain and so basically we just duplicate the um the mentor smart contract and the token smart contract any chain you want to opt in to have your poe token on you mint it on that chain it really just for clarity i mean we could technically be on every evm chain right now it's really that grants process which you know kevin i'm sure you're quite aware of where you know we kind of have to queue up beforehand and work with them you know so i mean whereas this could be like a weekend deployment for us in theory at least uh you know kind of working hand in hand with people like cava in order to make sure we get uh you know our piece of the grant you know for example that's kind of what stops us from pulling it all off this weekend for instance cool yeah makes sense given ethereum's modular architecture to be able to deploy new chains depending on who needs to depend on you and different chains absolutely um i'm curious what kind of applications you've seen built on top of this yeah um a lot of the first stuff we've done is internally within our own community so we've done uh we've created or we've sponsored a handful of one per person nft mints um we use it to democratize governance in our own dow um we have a quadratic formula that is you know very similar to git coin but rather than using uh the passport we use our own technology um and uh outside of our project we typically see it uh people who want to do more provably decentralized project launches so an nft mint where i want to make sure someone's not buying up all the supply um a token launch where i only want someone to get so many of the tokens most of what we've done has been within the realm of friends and family and that's a byproduct of us being a very small fair launch no token sold a dow that we're kind of just a volunteer collective that started from scratch and it's been a very grassroots approach to building out the application for sure i think they're but you know to also understand like you know we have our liquidity generation events and multiple other kind of services packed in here and all of that's very modular in the sense that all of them that i can think of off the top of my head are all have a poe component you can kind of add that into the market basket if you will so you know you can run any of our other services as well kind of with or without poe so because of that basically the majority of use cases out there you know someone is approaching us about one of those other services and then we can hook that in so uh you know at the moment we are talking to quite a few people to to hook this into uh regulatory level type stuff as well as kind of everything in between but um you know there hasn't been this uh this long laundry list of you know big names that have uh kind of hooked this in already to be transparent coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who need

accelerating refi summer for a positive impact on people communities and the planet if you're attending ecc visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts uh i was looking into y'all's uh toolkit and it sounds like you have something called governance as a service a toolkit that includes a nft launch pad and then a few other tools uh are these all things that are sort of built on top of proof of existence or adjacent to it yeah they're all adjacent uh they run in parallel so you know it's pretty much kind of like what i just said so you have the uh the air drop functionality you have the liquidity generation event functionality um you know we have cons everything from you know consulting advising engineering as well as part of that uh governance as a service kind of as an aside um set up pretty complex governance systems for all different scenarios and you know that that modularization of poe can be plugged in or left left alone or added in the future for all of these so uh you know government says the services itself is exactly what it sounds like that's setting up governance systems for new existing or you know soon to come dows and ecosystems uh just because you know we we were actually there on day one as a legal entity dow in wyoming and you know have had a lot of experience and you know kind of setting this up have had a lot of the growing pains and we you know recognized that quite a few projects out there that were doing much better than us sometimes had kind of flimsy governance systems or could be improved upon and that's kind of what we look to corner in and kind of take that out of the equation great so what do you think a world looks like in which you all are maximally successful i mean take me forward five or ten years what's sort of the end game here yeah um our our intention is to help to help everyone um do decentralization better with that uh every step of the way we make a good friendship a good relationship we have a good partner we keep some ownership in their project as part of our our business model we cross-pollinate our communities the the end goal for governor dao is like this i picture as like this big octopus of we have governor dow and we have our our tentacles out in and touching all these different projects and we help them be better and we help them grow bigger and scale and it all comes back to us yeah you know i i think that really the the endgame that five or ten years is that over that time you know um both uh or poe as it currently stands assuming that you don't need the consulting in order to get it plugged in or whatever i mean it is a single line of code it's pretty basic for most developers that's a free service uh as far as you know public poe so um you know anyone can hook that in and i think that as time goes on and as we you know better communicate the security behind this and implementation factor and why this is so important um that will really scale up you know over the next five to ten years and as jeff mentioned i'd really like to see that you know uh co-mingling of many projects using you know technology similar to this in order to make you know democratic voting as well as kind of democratic functions much more uh of a placeholder within the space beautiful um yeah i mean i think that you know civil resistance is obviously really high upside for the ecosystem if we can as an ecosystem move to war one human one vote type systems then i think that that just creates so many more use cases for everyday people not just the ones who are moneyed to use these systems so i'm a huge proponent of civil resistance systems getting more and more prominence and there's a really neat network effect here where the more people can get rewards for verifying their identity the more people will verify their identity and the more people verify their identity the more the ops will create rewards for those things so it's just a really beautiful flywheel and i think the sum of governor dow uh and all the other simple resistance tools in the ecosystem could really help spin that flywheel together yeah that's exactly how we're trying to how we incepted proof of existence and how how we'd like to see it build out yeah i i think really um and i i can't remember exactly who wrote it but when i think of all this i i really consider the uh you know there was an article written i think it was by onopolis uh if i remember correctly it was kind of you know a paradox of what uh blockchain would look like today with civil resistance in place since day one uh similar to you know tradify and uh it it was really interesting kind of to see some of the parallels there and how you know something as simple as yield you know when you when you look into kind of how these functions operate and you know how much is taken off the playing field because of you know civil actors i mean it it gets really interesting to see how much stronger and how much more rewarding the ecosystem can be as well as how much more you know straightforward it can be um you know and i mean even recent air drops at you know high levels uh you know seeing how much these have been gamified and how much this has really kind of blown a hole in you know some of these governance tokens that are dropped and everything else i think that technology like this is is simple it's modular and you know can solve these problems in real time at a level that's previously not really uh able to hook into so it's something i'm definitely looking forward to that future yeah same well is there anything that i didn't ask that you all want to say well i i think the only thing really is just to highlight that you know this is really the kind of the core service as you had mentioned but there's there's much more going on at governor dao um you know there's a lot of other product service suites there and uh you know at the end of the day i i think that uh getting people to just take a a look at civil resistance in general which i mean if they're listening to this podcast i'm sure they already have but uh you know getting people to look at that as well as getting people to understand that uh you know how important this is in this space in order for us to kind of get over the next major hump uh i i think that that's really key here um and there is a lot of technologies that can you know take kind of take this out of the picture but i would say that um the scalability aspect as well as the ease of uh kind of throwing this into the mix is really key for projects that are already existing and for you know projects as they kind of come out in real time so all these are kind of key components of how we built this and how this was put out there and uh yeah i mean i think it's all really worth saying beautiful yeah yeah looking forward to seeing governor dale grow um i know that get coin dao which i'm involved in in some ways has recently relaunched bitcoin passport so hoping to see an integration between those two projects in the future and hopefully this civil resistant ecosystem grows together yeah absolutely i think we've recently established uh contact with with git coin and i think just within the past few days we got their um their information regarding how we build out the integrations definitely on our high level uh high uh um to do this priority thank you that's what happens when you travel i i know where well where can people find governor dale and proof of existence online yeah so uh quite a few places but uh governordao.org governor d-a-o dot o-r-g um we have uh only one me so exactly how it sounds only one me governordow.org will bring you to uh the poe portal as well as passport.governordao i would highly recommend that people use the passport interface to not only kind of test it but also mint one if you will uh that's kind of the one stop shop uh besides that you know we have um you know all the basic socials uh docs.governordow.docs.governordao has kind of a very good overview of all the different components so um most certainly we'll uh that's where i would point people towards uh zayn i don't think i'm missing any uh we've got um for people who are just interested in the civil resistance tech we have a landing page proof of existence.xyz and that's a dedicated uh homepage just to explain uh civil resistance and proof of existence as well as the stipend poc but that's kind of uh i guess that's something that will be kind of coming very very soon we have a kind of proof of case scenario for um yield as well as uh uh ubi if you will on kava so uh that that's something that you know we'll have a permanent resting place relatively soon to link people too so sounds great well uh i think we'll put some of those links in the show notes and we'll definitely look forward to seeing proof of existence grow so thanks so much for coming on the pod guys awesome i appreciate it kevin thanks for your time thanks for having us [Music]
