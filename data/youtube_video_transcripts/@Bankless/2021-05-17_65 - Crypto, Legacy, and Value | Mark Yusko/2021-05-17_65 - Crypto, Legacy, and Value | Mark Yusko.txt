welcomes bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bangles david excited about this next guest he is a seasoned investor on both the traditional finance side and also on the crypto side learned a lot in this episode uh tell us what we covered uh we covered so much and it's always really good uh to get people's perspective like mark huskos where they know money they know finance also they are not tricked by some of the uh the uh shenanigans i would say is going on in the legacy market specifically with regards to the federal reserve and mark has a lot of very strong opinions with how the federal reserve has really dictated how the world works uh and and so that was that was just always a treat to to hear that perspective from somebody who is a seasoned legacy investor who is also very attuned to what is going on in the world of crypto and getting more and more attuned every single step of the way and i think there's a lot of through lines between what mark values and what he sees as valuable and what we are seeing going on in ethereum and in the defy app player and i actually don't think mark has all gotten all the way there yet i don't think he completely sees what we see uh but that is kind of the the unique perspective that uh that mark brings is that he sees things as valuable and he went through a list of things that he sees as valuable and what i saw is him rattling the loss of ethereum character rattling off a list of ethereum characteristics uh and so if mark represents uh the typical seasoned skeptical investor uh that is makes me very optimistic about the future of this industry yeah absolutely i there so there are three parts to this conversation the first part we talk about the the world as it is now what's happening in the macro world and mark absolutely tears into banks he tears into uh central banks the federal reserve um talking about how the existing markets have become almost a ponzi game and then we got to talking about crypto and we asked him the question about eth basically the question is eth money and this is an interesting conversation because uh mark has partnered with anthony popliano and there have been many twitter back in fourths between myself david and anthony about this question um some people like pomp think that eth is uh not a money that only bitcoin has established the ability to become a store of value asset of course bankless is much more open in fact sees the emergence of ether as a money in addition to bitcoin as money we've talked so much about ultrasound money uh and the future of ethereum it's it's just really hard for me to take a contrary viewpoint so we talked to mark about that and got his insight i don't think he completely agrees with his partner on this but he also doesn't completely agree with the bankless idea on is eath money so uh that was an interesting conversation and then we ended with what are the tips for crypto natives so somebody who's you know crypto might be their first real investing experience there are some timeless ideas timeless concepts from traditional investing that somebody like mark can bestow so it's worth listening all the way to this end of this jam-packed episode david before we get to this conversation with mark we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com bank bankless nation we are super excited to have our next guest mark yusko he is the founder and chief investment officer of morgan creek capital that is the traditional legacy side of investing and he's also a managing partner at morgan creek digital assets which is the crypto side we're going to talk a lot about legacy and crypto and the bridges between them he currently manages uh close to 2 billion in assets how are you doing mark it's great to have you on bankless all right doing great ryan thanks for having me and uh although i guess is it ryan only or is it ryan sean oh wow i go i just go by ryan only on the podcast you know ryan john adams is there was a singer songwriter ryan adams you may be familiar with him he sort of he took my name first right so because i came after i had to insert the middle name and uh that's what i'm doing now now i actually never asked that question before really i always use my middle initial and people look at me like why do you and i kind of know so my dad did it and so i do it yeah so i'm always mark w so yeah you have to have like um a unique identity i think because the internet is so large i'm i think i'm not even sure how many other ryan adams are there out there there's got to be hundreds there's probably orion adams out there listening to this podcast right now yes and there are not a lot of mark yusukos although there is one up in greenwich connecticut and he is a dj uh for some small radio station and so i've had whenever i go up in the the east they're like oh i heard you on the radio like no yeah yeah so all right that's cool you got a dj i have a rock star it's you know yeah yeah yours is better well if we're on the same subject there's a dave hoffman lawyer out there who did an analysis of ico claims about vesting schedules and then he actually went into these smart contracts and looked at if the icos the contracts investing contracts actually upheld what the actual commitments were and he found out that like 95 percent of them were not uh and that was dave hoffman the lawyer i love it well and and i think you should just go with with hoff right because hasselhoff uses that so that was high school yeah exactly we need to get the other david hoffman on the podcast smells it sounds pretty smart yeah all right mark let's talk about this we are going to talk about crypto as a wealth creation opportunity i think that's going to be the through line and theme of this we also want your advice for the crypto natives listening to this podcast that's our audience mark for a lot of the crypto natives the asset class where they learn to invest is actually crypto right so there's some timeless things that i think you know that we want to transfer to this new generation we really want you to be sort of our sherpa our our bridge there are some things that are different in crypto there's crypto there are some things that uh stay the same but i want to start with the big picture the thing that affects everybody both in the traditional markets and in the crypto markets and that is the macro landscape in uh 2021 what is happening in the macro world it feels like things are getting crazy we've got stocks at all-time highs we've just had uh corona um you know wreck things for over a year but stocks at all-time high is wealth inequality at all-time highs debt levels at all-time highs may be distrust in our current legacy institutions at all-time highs i'm not sure what is going on uh money printing liquidity and to your point they're they're only at all time high stocks or only at all-time highs if you denominate them in you know the toilet paper we've created which is the us dollar and uh what's interesting is if you look at u.s equities uh since 2008 they appear to be up right the nominal prices is higher the index number is higher however if you denominate by central bank assets by fed balance sheet dead flat okay so let that sink in for a second if you denominate in gold which is real money and has been real money for 5 000 years we're at the same level in u.s stock prices as we were in 1996. okay now if you were to denominate the s p over the past uh few years in bitcoin it's ugly so it's all about your reference currency and this is called money illusion and it's been going on since 1913 and you know yes what's going on macro is the the plan is being executed flawlessly right the dictator playbook and the dictator gets to the top and surrounds himself with cronies the cronies own all the assets and then you devalue the currency and it's been going on since 1913 and it was a plan hatched by amy aldridge john d rockefeller's father-in-law along with john d and and jp morgan his buddy and it's it's been executed flawlessly and and covid was an accelerant in literally it poured gasoline on this this paper currency bonfire that we've been having for the last hundred years and here's a crazy stat right i'm sure you've heard it right 39 of all the dollars ever printed in the history of our republic were printed in the last 12 months and so we have this illusion that things are going up and you see it every day right housing prices went up the most ever quarter over quarter in first quarter 18 1 8 in one quarter housing prices went up you know collectible art they take the people right i'm not a fan you know no accounting for taste some people like it i don't like it but i respect i respect what he did right i have not brushed my teeth every day for the last 13 years the dude created a piece of art every day for 13 years so i respect that and put it all together and created one and one of anything can be uh valuable now it doesn't mean that everything that has one should be valuable so not every nfd is going to be good but um anyway that's a long rambling answer ryan to to your question but it it's so important right now to to step back and say okay this is a liquidity event well what does liquidity mean and i have this great chart and we don't have charts but just visualize if you will a straight line for 5 000 years and that is gold and for for 5 000 years literally one ounce of gold has bought a fine man suit which i guess now i say find person suit but but a fine man's suit from a suit of armor to a suit during the american revolution to a zoo suit in the 20s to a fine man's suit on savile row today one ounce of gold now it was money for all that period and money is different than currency money means something that exists in the absence of a liability so gold has been money currency is different currency has liabilities associated governments issue currency by issuing debt and so governments perpetuate this myth that currency is valuable but what's really happening is it gets devalued which creates the income and wealth inequality that you talk about and so in 1974 we untethered our world from the gold standard and we went to a fiat system which means money could be created by fiat by whim and that's when things started to get really ugly so if you look at income inequality wealth inequality racial all the things that get fomented when you divide the classes it all really accelerated in 1974 and that's the point at which uh we went to a fiat system so now the line changes color from gold to green well now in 2008 and it's not it is not a coincidence that bitcoin was released i won't say created but was we're not released at the depths of the financial crisis that was not an accident right it didn't just happen overnight they were working on it for a while again whoever he she they are satoshi came along and said okay i'm going to create this thing there's not an accident that the genesis block as a reference to the chancellor's bailout none of that is accidental and so now it's the x factor so we got the x that fiat currency is going to slowly decline and cryptocurrency is going to slowly ascend so mark that is a really insightful answer and i think i've heard people articulate it um similar sentiments before but none as explicitly as as you did just now i think what you're saying is basically a fiat currency modern monetary policy is the root of this warping effect that we see across all assets but you said something different and this is the part that was most explicit to me and maybe comes out in a tweet i recently read um from you which you said the fed has only one goal just one goal to transfer wealth from average citizens to banksters and the top one percent through stealth tax of inflation what you're saying implies something a bit more insidious that sinister right that this has been all part of a um priest you know prepared plan since the early 1900s and it's now just coming to fruition it's not sort of a an accident of the system or a byproduct or an after effect this is very intentional is is that the case absolutely intentional come on and and people get all mad like how can you say this you know you're going to get put on some target list and no i'm not look people don't care what i say um the reality is that jp morgan right was the original bankster and he created this incredible organization and there was a law passed well let's let's back even up further so banks were started by the medicis in the 1300s with this idea that you needed a central middleman to uh referee lending so in the good old days right single entry accounting i would lend you money and i would write down that you owed me a hundred dollars and you had to trust me that i wrote down the right amount in my ledger so then these gregorian monks or something i remember who it was exactly came up with they said what if we had two ledgers so now both ryan and mark could write down what they owed each other and they actually used something called a tally stick right you'd break a stick in half and you'd carve a notch and if those notches matched up then you knew how much you you owed but you could fudge your notch maybe or or what if i wrote down 200 and you wrote down 100 well the medici said ah we will sit in the middle and we'll charge a little fee and we'll have those accounts and we'll take care of your your money because then again the old days of money money was just a substitute for barter so you had chickens i had cows and we would drag our chickens and cows to market we would trade and we're like nah that's stupid why don't we just print little coins and you put chickens on your coins and i put cows on my coins and we'll swap the coins well then we got this big old sack of coins and i don't want to drag those all the way to market so how about we deposit the coins in a trusted third party and they issue paper an iou that says you left your coins here and now you have this amount and the chinese invented that in the 1300s and they called it flying money i'm sorry the 700 700 and they call it flying money because they flew away in the wind right it's amazing if you didn't if you didn't hold it down and so all of this system was created by the banksters to control the wealth and so if i want to send you money i have to have a bank account you have to have a bank account and they charge us a fee to send it and they're really happy and they built this great business so in the 1600s the rothschild said huh banks what about a central bank well create a central bank so they create a central bank in the netherlands and said we'll use this to finance our wars and our exploits and our and our uh accumulation of wealth and worked really well so the spanish created one and then the french created one and then the brits created one and then we created this little republic in he called the united states and we said huh okay well let's let's borrow what the rothschilds did so we stole the word dollar from dolar which was dutch and we created this idea of a national bank we're kind of a central bank we have a national bank and so we chartered the first national bank it lasted 20 years chartered the second national bank the last 20 years and then andrew jackson came along and said whoa whoa these banks appear to be owned by the wealthiest european families and i love this quote our most opulent citizens such a great quote right so it's basically the rich people own the banks and are owning everybody else so i'm gonna i'm not gonna renew the charter we're not gonna have a bank and so we went for about a 30-year period where there was no national bank and everybody issued their own money texas had its own money companies had their own money and it was a show i mean it was horrible and so in the 1890s they said yeah this is a bad idea reconstruction all right we'll have a new bank and so they created banks and then they're like well to fix the problem of monopoly bank power will allow trusts to be created and few trusts start to grow and there's this trust called knickerbocker trust and jp morgan famously quipped i like a little competition and he said all right so that knickerbocker trust is taking our business away so i'm going to spread a rumor that they're insolvent they have a problem and we've all seen the picture of the run on the bank of the men and women in their suits and ties and you know running to the bank with the umbrellas to get their money out and basically knickerbocker went down and jp morgan wrote a little check for 25 million dollars which is a lot of money back then and saved the banking system happy to buy all the assets it's like you know mr potter and it's a wonderful life he brought up everything that was on sale and fast forward his buddy he was buddies with john d rockefeller and johnny rockefeller's father-in-law uh it was amory aldridge amory had married off his daughter to john d rockefeller to get some power and amy became the most powerful senator and they hatched a plan called the aldrich plan to create a central bank in the image of the rothschild central bank always goes back to rothschilds topic for another day um and so they hatched this plan in 1907 and it took six years to get it through congress but they did eventually get and i could not make this up they signed the documents to create the federal reserve which by the way is not federal and has no reserves that's my joke that i stole from somebody on jekyll island right the creature from jekyll i mean you couldn't make that up right you know jekyll and hyde so they create this creature and there's this great book and i've i've done presentations on i've tweeted pictures of it there's this great picture of a guy wrote a book about the altar plan and how horrible it was going to be and it shows this octopus with these tentacles in everything in corporations and it's basically sucking money out of everybody's coffers and then up chucking it onto wall street and that's what the banking system does and the fed is owned by the banks to make the banks rich that's what it does and that's why we bail out the banks at every turn and it's why inflation we've perpetuated this myth that it's good for you why is rising prices good who is that good for it's good for you if you own assets it's bad for you if you have a fixed income if you're on minimum wage if you are retired and own bonds it's horrible for you so inflation is a wealth tax it is theft of your wealth and transferring it to the rich and that's why from 1913 to today income and wealth inequality has gone to the widest in history and it's why this this myth of of inflation being good for you and why that should be a goal of the central bank it's just ridiculous but i don't feel strongly about that right mark you would fit right in in the bankless movement sir you know like look i mean this is what we've been saying since uh we started this thing is crypto and d5 more specifically is money by the people for the people it removes if it's done well if we get to a future that is decentralized then we don't need the banks in the middle anymore this is what the entire movement is about and why it's so important and i think why people are uh you like listening to this and engaging in and and joining us in crypto can we talk about this i i feel like the the bankers would have a different take on all of this of course so their reframing of what you just said is like but mark the people really needed this the chaos the runs on the banks that were happening they asked us to step in to restore order and to restore calm chair powell gave a speech i believe uh yesterday depends on when people listen to this but um somebody asked him about froth in the equities markets specifically about gamestop and um and uh yes uh they they asked him rather about uh gamestop in in dogecoin and um he made some statements about yeah froth in the equity markets i don't like what's going on like be careful like be careful out there but when i was hearing what he was saying i was just like do you realize you've created this you've turned the entire financial system into a ponzi game like people can't even buy a house without having to engage in in rampant speculation as to what the price is going to be um is like i guess my question to you is mark what is the central bank's next move because the framing of the macro is we're in an era of money printing right um and we've been doing a ton of it what happens next how do we get prepared for this decade what's powell's next move no you could print more and look the history on this is is very consistent um all empires fail every single one uh reserve currencies end and uh the final throws of those empires is rife with this type of cronyism this type of of taxation without representation so to speak this type of rampant inflation and money printing and and go back to the roman empire right so the roman empire uh there's some quotes from from marcus aurelius right that could have been written yesterday i mean literally they just talk about you know rampant government spending and and lack of discipline and and people being too too lazy and not wanting to work and and when to pay people not to work and all the things we talk about today things like universal basic income what a crock modern monetary theory what a crock right it just means producing more of a wasting asset um so roman empire had these daenerys these gold coins and then underneath it they had silver coins and and what they did is they they would clip the coins literally they would clip the edges and steal the silver that's why quarters have ridges on the side so you can tell if you've been clipped and so what happened to the roman empire failed and so then go to the ottoman empire or the british empire right british empire right sun never said on the british empire when we were an emerging market run by a gang if you ever seen the movie gangs new york 1860s not a fun place to live the united states right you walk down the street you get killed i mean it was it was tough and uh british empire ruled the world until what happened 1913 they invaded mesopotamia incurred a bunch of debt pound sterling collapsed and uh the dollar send it took 30 years for the dollar to ascend to bretton woods and for us to become the world reserve currency and i know people are tired of hearing me talk about the world reserve currency but the world reserve currency was historically held by the company with the most powerful navy so it started with portugal because they had the tallest trees so they're the fastest ships spain took them over got the trees taller ships and then france and then the netherlands and ultimately the steamship was invented and the uk became the superpower and then we invented nuclear and so we have subs and so we became the most powerful navy now what's interesting is uh world reserve currencies last about 70-ish years so our run is about over and everybody says oh bitcoin's gonna be the next one no no there's a step between bitcoin i think and and uh the dollar uh which is the remnant b i think uh china figured out 10 years ago that uh the next war will be fought with chips not ships and i can't believe it took me this long to actually watch it but i've been watching mr robot for the last couple weeks oh my gosh blown away blown away at the genius of the writing the accuracy of the story lines and this whole thing about china rules the world they do right ten years ago you had to choose what do you want to be best in and the united states decided we're gonna be best at social media and we rock at instagram and facebook we are the best china said you know what i think we're gonna be the best at ai and 5g one of these sounds more sustainable you know one of them sounds more sustainable one sounds more important and and so china has literally been ruling the world and they have this long plan this this 30-year plan so the previous 30 years from 1990 to 2020 their 30-year plan was a harmonious rise to drag 700 million people out of abject poverty into the middle class and a harmonious rise sounds very nice it doesn't sound very threatening well their next 30-year plan is to become a global superpower okay stated goal global superpower and so that's why all this cold war 2.0 rhetoric has popped up and why china's the enemy and now it also helps to have an enemy right the military-industrial complex works better if you have an enemy um so we had the ussr back way back when you know and now we got we got china but it's really more about this that the next war isn't going to be fought with ships we fought with ships the next war is all about cyber it's all about technological prowess and it's why china will be the first with central bank digital currency they are way ahead in ai they are way ahead in crypto and you know americans suffer from this this problem i i joke that americans are like notre dame football fans right you see my fighting irish picture in behind i'm a notre dame guy and notre dame fans think that we win the championship every year the fact there's been one since 88 it's a long time and if you talk to my father and i was like no we win every year i'm like no george when you were there we won every year because after the war we went overseas we got all the guys from army and navy to come back as 28 year olds and we had a pro football team for four years and we went undefeated for four years at notre dame in the 40s and we won four national champ or actually went three they stole one but bottom line is you don't get to do that anymore except at byu so now you actually have to play the game with 20 you know 18 19 20 year olds and notre dame is not irrelevant but we're not or at the superpower now you have to cheat like alabama doesn't i shouldn't say they cheat and over recruit so um but they're the superpower and china has figured out that the the war is going to be won in in cyber and and digital and so it all goes back to this idea of the american empire right which americans think that we rule we're 20 of crypto globally you know and maybe 20 maybe 25. it's not 100. and so we're important but we are grasping at straws from a legislative and regulatory perspective or you know talk about oh we're gonna ban bitcoin okay first of all you can't ban it's like squeezing a balloon the air just goes someplace else china tried to ban it in 2017 quote unquote they actually didn't um but they said they were going to what happened price fell 40 and the exchanges said oh we'll just move to south korea and japan they're like bring them we'll tax you it'll be great good for us and south korea becomes a leader and now that you know us is talking about over-regulating so what's going to happen is instead of embracing technology instead of embracing the movement to digital currencies we're trying to fight it and why are we fighting it because we like our legacy system we like being in charge at least the people at the top like being in charge people at the bottom don't like it as much people at the top really like the fact that they own all the assets like i was saying the other day uh you know there's threat of raising taxes uh and someone said are you kidding pelosi's never going to vote for that because he and her husband are really rich and so they don't want to pay more taxes and but they'll exempt the congressmen and senators just like they exempt them from insider trading can you believe that it's legal for congressmen and senators to insider trade right yeah and when they asked when they asked them about it this is great when they asked and it's not a political statement one side or the other but when they asked one of the the congressman or one senators number of years ago she's like well of course it's part of my compensation because they were saying well it's right for you do you think it's right for you to vote to hold up something that increases the profits of mastercard and you're a big holder he says well of course that's okay it's part of my compensation i think i think i think so much of the infighting between left versus right is is very uh media driven not to get on on politics but i think every american at least that is not among kind of the elites is anti-corruption right like we oh hey man and ryan look i'll i'll sum it up for you and i don't mean to cut you off but this is my thing right there's no left there's no right there's no republican there's no democrats remember it's democratic republicans you know the hamilton thing there's no left or right you're right it's just the media there is in and out yep that's all there is and when you're out you do or say whatever it takes to get in ronald reagan donald trump lifelong democrats got in by being republican being republican uh once you're in you do or say whatever it takes to stay in let's take our current president again no no left right comment just current president remember before the election oh my gosh the world will end if biden becomes president because oil companies will get over regulated and all this and they'll go down what's the best performing sector this year energy oil because he got there and he's like oh they write those kind of checks those are big checks oh okay i'm not gonna i'm not gonna regulate them so it's in and out and so when you're in you're part of the elite and what you want is to preserve your wealth and the wealth of your crony friends and the most extreme example is that called the dictator playbook are true dictators let's take maduro right so maduro what do you do he got all his friends at the top cronies and then he devalues the boulevard what happens the average person in venezuela totally out of luck right and what happens unless they found dash or monero or bitcoin they basically lost everything because the currency was destroyed and that's happened in places like you can't see it but on my desk over there i have a 100 trillion that numbers sink in for a second 100 trillion zimbabwe dollar bill yeah and i say this all the time like one trillion we'd have to sit here together and talk for thirty one thousand seven hundred and ten years which i guess talking to you guys would actually be pleasant but thirty one thousand years but and spend a dollar every second that's a trillion one trillion and so now we talk about four trillion dollar stimulus plans again your mind has to be blown because if you start with a trillion of money and you add four trillion you just devalued that currency and so the idea of bitcoin as a deflationary currency instead of an inflationary currency and a true store of value as opt-out insurance as schmuck insurance as i call it is we know that the schmucks are going to do what they do we know that they are going to devalue the currency we know that they want to preserve the empire we know that they want to foment class warfare and increase the wealth at the top of the pyramid that's not a surprise in fact i i thought this was really cool so another thing i watched a while ago was stranger things you know the the show yeah and there's this amazing thing so right you got you got uh the um the lab building right if you look at the i can't remember the name of it now whatever the lab was called um it's the name of the town but if you look at that building and you look at the fed they're the exact same building they look exactly the same and if you go back to that 1910 book i was talking about that talked about the aldrich plan they showed this multi-tentacled monster that was inflation that's the mind flayer it looks exactly the same i mean you it's life imitating art i mean it or art imitating life it's unbelievable that the stranger things that are happening inside the fed are basically this tentacled monster taking the wealth and putting it in the banksters and mark the uh the life imitating art i think is actually a really good way to illustrate the fact that people understand what's going on maybe not as explicitly as you have stated it and that's why we've brought you onto the podcast to explicitly state things but people feel this right young people feel discouraged they don't feel included they feel lost right and it's not just young people but it's the majority of the united states and this is the same through line that we saw in the roman empire right where the people of the world they knew that things were corrupted they knew that things were wrong and history if we look at take a historical perspective people saw inside the roman empire it was harder to it's hard to see it fall in real time but if you look back in hindsight the writing was on the wall and we now now we have this historical perspective right we can see these same same parallels we can see people make a farce of the current status quo right like money printer go burr uh jeffrey epstein yeah kill himself like all these things like people know subconsciously at the very least that something is going wrong and at least we have these parallels to draw throughout history and we can also talk about the new things the unique things about this current state where well now we have this thing called bitcoin right and it is in direct uh opposition to the status quo um how do you feel about like cultural understanding of some of these uh nefarious activities that are going on that really define the world that we live in yeah i i think it's a really great point on the uh inability to see something when it's happening to you right i talked to him i wrote a letter about this uh it was the year of the frog a few years ago and uh i know i think it was the year of the dog and i called it the year of the frog in that you're basically being boiled and when you boil a frog if you drop it in the hot water it just jumps out but if you put them in cold water and slowly heat it up you can paralyze and can't jump out and so you're right you don't see it when it's happening to you but i will say the the younger generation does see it for what it is and i don't really know why maybe it's because media is so much more advanced today and it you know in the olden days right my days of walter cronkite coming on and reading the news that was the news that was created so that you would consume it some of it propaganda some of it really knews but you know and not that he was a bad person he's just doing his job um today you know if i want to know about the argentinian elections i don't wait for a reporter to write a story to get edited to get published in a big national media with their particular slant i watch a periscope of people in line at the polling place and so the immediacy of information and the ability to to get source data i think has just been enhanced by the internet and and by by all that and so i think there is a really interesting digital divide i talk about this all the time if you ask anyone over 35 who's your broker i don't know merrill lynch ubs whoever how much gold do you have i don't know three four percent how much bitcoin do you have oh are you kidding me it's a ponzi scheme dude damie diamond is a fraud and and you know warren buffett warren buffett he calls it rat poison squared and he's like yeah not to be outdone his partner charlie says you know it's like trading newly harvested dead baby brains i apologize but what the seriously he says that to be extreme right why because he's an incumbent 46 of berkshire hathaway is financial services jamie dimon okay i love that tweet though down and maybe you did whoever did it of the six stages of jp morgan right they went through the denial and then the degree and and now their acceptance and oh we're gonna have an actively managed fun but it's it's amazing to watch but but look incumbents will always tell you that the new disruptive thing is bad right at the turn of the century horseless carriage the average person doesn't know why stoops in downtown new york are nine feet above street level we've got the old buildings from the 1700s the stoop is nine feet above street level hazard today well it's it's because of horse literally the poop would get swept to the side and power three four feet up and the ladies didn't want their dresses to drag in it so they built elevated sidewalks nine feet high and you'd walk into your house to your point a hazard get drunk at night fall off right into the horse poop and never be seen from again bad plan but that's why it exists and so the street sweepers didn't want to lose their jobs when the horse's carriage came out so they passed out pamphlets saying that you would die if you got in a horse's carriage my my grandfather-in-law went to work for the airline american airlines left the train safe job and his parents thought he was an idiot and the train companies passed out pamphlets saying if you got on an airplane your body would cave in on itself because you'd be going too fast so fear uncertainty and doubt has been around fud has been around forever and so back to the digital divide ask anyone under 35 who's your broker what's what's a broker you mean my robin hood account i got one of those okay how much gold do you have oh you kidding me boomer rocks are you pet rock no zero what are you talking about how much bitcoin do you have i don't want to talk about it why not because it's a really big percentage of my net worth because i don't have enough yeah i don't have enough right and and why is that you know why do the boomers think it's a ponzi scheme why is peter schiff which i call it upon i mean what incumbents incumbency right incumbency but also there was this great thing and i actually retweeted it on plasticity that if something's invented when you're born it's normal if it's invented between when you're born and when you're 35 it's innovative if it's invented after you're 35 it's against the normal order of things it's hardwired wow right that's exactly right and if you think about my my tech cycle that i always talk about which is you know 54 is the mainframe 68 was the microchip 82 is a personal computer 96 was the internet 2010 was the mobile net in 2024 okay is the trust net it happens every 14 years why and it always is led by young people why marc andreessen was 19 sergey and larry were 20s why is it always young people because the creative class okay they don't know any better and again before he was a bad person bill cosby was this funny comedian when i was growing up and he had this great stick that he did about this kid and he said this kid was amazing he could ride his bicycle anywhere he could ride it up over the swing set over the top of fences he could do 360s six inches off the ground and he never fell you know when the first time he fell was when someone explained him about gravity and so young people don't know what they don't know and so they experiment and they and they try things that are new and then they discover things and they innovate and innovation is what creates wealth and you asked at the very beginning of this is this a an opportunity to create what this is the greatest wealth creation opportunity i will see in my lifetime money over an internet protocol is the greatest invention of this century bar none and everything that is happening in real time and that's why i went from spending none of my time eight years ago and look i've done plenty of stupid things and i am not a gazillionaire because i wasn't smart enough to get involved when i first got exposed to this in 2013. and noah's crying for me i'm doing fine you know it's not that's not the point but the reality is that i didn't get it because i didn't do the work and i was over 35 and i wasn't as open as i should have been but now one because i'm hanging out with people like you two because i met pomp and others and and i now get to hang out with the crypto kids and i get to hang out with people who are smart and motivated and energetic and i'm kind of reverse and i have a little bit of wisdom because i've seen some things that have happened in the past and i can kind of use that to my benefit and i've had more fun in the last eight years than i've had my whole life because this is a big deal and it is a chance to take 40 of people in the world don't have a bank account 40 of the people in the world don't have a bank account okay so they can't get financial services they can't get lending and you know now we are going to provide financial services to everybody and to your point about bank list right i mean we can all be bankless we can all interact we can all move from these legacy financial systems that were controlled by this this banking cabal to a more democratized and open society and and i'm not in the you know back to mr robot i'm not in the f society not  society no no i'm about let's move society to a more open and less ponzi eyes and ponzi ponzi is an important word because people want to talk about bitcoin as a ponzi or a theory no no that means you don't understand the word ponzi works like this in the old days of finance right your banker lived in your town he knew your name he knew where you lived he knew your family and you would go to the bank and they would do what was called hedged finance they would lend you money with the expectation of getting paid back principal and interest and the bank kept the loan on the balance sheet and they took the risk and you were partners and then we moved over the years to speculative finance where the banker kind of knew who you were and he didn't really think you could pay back the principal but he's pretty sure he could pay the interest so they would make you a loan for a second house or maybe some speculative real estate and we moved to speculative finance well in the last couple decades we've gone full-on ponzi finance where the banker don't know your name banker doesn't live in your town it's a nameless faceless organization you get the money they don't ever expect you to pay back principal or interest right bullet loans and long-term it's just can you pay i mean can you flip the house at a higher price can you flip the stock at a higher price can you gamify investing or gambling like game stock or all this other crap that's going on i mean dogecoin does just everything that's wrong and maybe hopefully you guys don't love it but it's everything that's wrong we don't love it today pardon we do not love it okay good so it's everything that's wrong with the markets started as a joke a bunch of people want to pump it and buy it because the price is moving if you're buying something because the price is moving you're a degenerate gambler now that doesn't mean you're a bad person it just means you're gambling if you buy something because you think the value you think the price is below the value you're an investor and if you buy something because you think the growth is really good you're an investor and so the way i think about this is as technology evolves and as we move to this more open society and more democratic society and and more equal society and as jimmy song who i love and we talks about this and if you have a a fiat currency based income and he says it now so i'm barney you're a slave like okay it's a little dicey of a word but it's true right you are an indentured servant to the fiat masters who can devalue your asset at any time which they've done in spades yet if you own this other asset that's outside that system and is fixed in supply and has a beautiful deflationary monetary system now people say well but mark but it lacks all the benefits of fractional reserve yep i actually don't hate fractional reserve i think if you look around the world the countries that have fractured reserve banking systems actually are better off than those that don't um so the idea of depositing assets lending the assets is a good thing that's why we invested in block fi and other c5 so i don't think everything has to be d5 i think c5 has a role i think it replaces tradfi and i think defy will replace everything that is human and will go to code like derivative contracts humans don't need to be involved structured products right if i want to buy high risk bitcoin meaning you know basically bitcoin on leverage or low risk bitcoin meaning low volatility bitcoin i can do that with a smart contract now that's why i invested in in bond through barbridge so there anyway that's a long rambling branch on stuff you probably didn't want to talk about mark there's there's so much there right so some points some points you made right so like the the overarching point of course is the reason things like doge are possible is because of the central bank monetary system today right that's why things are trading on memes and narratives rather than deeper fundamentals so at some level like jerome caused this you know uh the bankers caused this and you also made the point about having like using systems in order to understand what they are it's definitely a core component of the bankless program we encourage everyone listening if you want to understand what crypto is hold it buy it if you want to understand how to use defy go out and take out a loan on ave or a compound open up your metamask account actually use these systems if you want to understand them but so before before no no ryan i want to i want to reiterate that because again particularly for us guys right the old guys for a young person who is is digitally native having a metamask wallet a piece of cake having a hardware wallet no no problem understanding you know what a direct lending on ave is no problem but for my generation they're like i don't know it's tough i get it it's tough but your point about doing it and and so yeah i'm lucky you know um although he's moving which i'm kind of sad about but you know the the guy who founded barnbridge lives here in chapel hill and so he comes over and he gives me lessons that is awesome on eth and d5 and it's awesome because i i want to learn and you know he's he's he's helping me do uh you know wrapped bitcoin and depositing it and then you know staking it and using it to borrow and and i love this stuff and it's it's awesome it's oh yeah that's yield farming it's a scam i'm like no it's supply and demand right and all interest rates started high right banking interest rates used to be very high and they got low because supply and demand got equilibrated today there's more demand for digital assets than there is supply so interest rates are still high that will change over time and that's okay but your point about using something is so important and look i got sim swapped twice thankfully i mean literally thankfully i didn't lose anything because i wasn't dumb enough to put a lot of money on on my my hardware wallet on my phone and by the way anyone listening if you are still using a phone number for two-factor authentication please don't do that please security use a second email address never ever ever use your cell phone number it it it's a horrible experience to go through it went through twice um and anyway but uh thankfully nothing bad happened but it's one of the hazards that comes with actually using these systems we call it uh going west because you're really setting out on a journey west and like bad things can happen mark i we want to get to crypto and talk more specifically about crypto but like just to put the final point on the macro um picture here right so we're we're painting you're painting kind of a bleak picture the u.s loses its reserve currency status um you know asset price inflation inequality continues to grow i think that the question in people's minds as they prepare for the 2020s particularly if they're maybe a younger crypto native uh investor is okay what does that mean for my portfolio what should i hold over the next decade like lynn alden uh is is somebody who might say she was on the podcast recently she's on she might say something like hold scarce assets right and be careful of things like sovereign bonds they are not going to do well what's your allocation maybe we can use this to segue into a deeper crypto conversation but let's say traditional assets versus digital assets what's a good portfolio mix do you think going into the this decade yeah look i couldn't agree more on on the concept of scarce assets i mean scarcity is what what drives price ultimately right it's just it's the the uh misalignment of supply and demand uh if there's not enough supply of something the price will rise i mean look at oil right now oil is recovering from negative prices we had negative prices in the crisis because everybody got locked in their home right which again not not to go here but you know the word quarantine uh is about taking sick people and putting them aside not taking healthy people and putting them inside a whole another topic for another day but so we locked everybody down oil demand collapsed oil supply didn't and so prices went negative for a month well then what happened a whole bunch of companies went bankrupt because they had too much debt and now supplies have have collapsed and opec finally realized that some discipline made sense and so oil's been the best performing asset this quarter and and so and i don't think oil per se is scarce but i think this this myth that tomorrow everybody's going to drive a tesla right even if we all wanted to drive a tesla we couldn't because there just aren't you can't can't make enough it's going to be 30 years before we even get to 50 50 ice versus ev on the roads 30 years so oil is going to be pretty good but but scarcity is really important and so if you look at anything where there is a natural scarcity so rare earth minerals is a good example as more people try to build evs there's going to be more demand for those things but other scarce assets digitally scarce assets you know bitcoin to me is the perfect scarce asset because we know exactly how many are there going to be and that's why i tell everybody right get off zero zero is the wrong number i mean you cannot have zero exposure to bitcoin you just you can't and and i believe five years from now it will be deemed fiduciarily irresponsible to have zero that's a big change right today a lot of people i talk to are like oh we're fiduciaries we can't do this like no no you have to do this as a fiduciary and there's this great article in pension investment age you know which is the rag for for boomer to people uh about the big pension fund in fairfax that gave us kind of our start in the business and has committed you know hundreds of millions of dollars to this space and they've been rewarded handsomely and they were very brave and very visionary and catherine molnar and and andy speller are fantastic visionary leaders but so scarce assets is one so i i do like commodities broadly i think um we're in a world where because fiat is going to be devalued everywhere not just in the united states in japan i mean look japan makes the fed look like amateurs japan prints money like nobody's business and they are over indebted like nobody's business but if you go to japan it's okay right apartments are nice cars are nice businesses are nice restaurants are nice but what it what it creates is a kind of a zombified world in that you know you go to work you do your job you get paid you live in a nice apartment but your assets that you think are appreciating are slowly being eaten up by the inflation that isn't counted in cpi and i think that's going to happen in europe and in the u.s and in all the the graying societies right i got the white hair to prove it is if you look at emerging markets that's another place i would own i would own places where they have lots of young people places like india places like china people think oh china's grey yes they are but they also have 330 million millennials we have 90 million millennials in the united states they have 330 million so they got a lot of young people too so latin america fantastic story particularly in brazil so that's another area i like private markets most of my net worth is is kind of barbelled between private markets and then scarce assets things like commodities and digital assets and then i do hold a decent amount of long short equity because i like active management in traditional markets because i think for every winner they'll be a loser and so i like that long short approach but i'm very very overweight innovation as an asset class and i believe that you get most of that alpha from the private markets i'll give you one funny story on that right and david um so three years ago we're up in in fairfax talking to the police pension fund to try to convince them to give us money for our infrastructure venture capital fund two and a half hour meeting which is actually a good thing it means they're asking all the right questions all the buy questions and we get to the end and the chairman who is an active duty police officer and i am not making this up i couldn't make this up harley outside helmet and gun on the table sunglasses mustache full uniform right out of central casting says all right mark i hear everything you say but you're telling me i gotta go tell my guys i just put their retirement in drug dealer money like no well okay i see your point okay no what you're gonna tell them is as a fiduciary your job is to make seven and a quarter percent actually assumed rate with bonds at two percent and likely to do worse and equities at low single digits based on gdp growth and and profits uh it's going to be really hard to get to seven percent unless we embrace innovation as an asset class and find alpha through illiquid markets like venture capital and growth equity it's like all right and get behind that next day newspaper pension fund invest in drug dealer money literally and he was quoted almost word for word saying nope as a fiduciary we have to find alpha we have to get that through the illiquidity premium because there's only four ways to make money in the whole world right if we take no risk we make no return if we leave our money in cash we make no return now it's worse than that you actually lose because inflation will chew up all your earnings the long-term inflation rate is equal to i guess so excited i hit my my speaker um my microphone uh the long-term inflation rate is equal to the short-term cash rate so you make no real return so you have to choose to take risk investing is about taking intelligent risks if you take no risk you get no return hence the name risk-free rate so you have to choose which risk you're going to take and intelligent risks are risks that you're compensated for so the reason lynn hates bonds as many people do and should is you're not being compensated for the risk because a bond interestingly is a contractual claim so i buy a bond i take a risk but if they don't pay me i can sue so there is a contractual claim so you don't get paid very much for that you only get two percent above risk-free well if risk-free is close to zero and two is the maximum the risk reward there's not very high so bonds today are certificates of confiscation meaning if rates rise i could lose years of yield instantaneous like what happened in the first quarter you know bonds were down four percent that's two years of yield in one quarter and so they're just not really a good risk reward second risk i could take is equity risk equity is a contingent claim meaning you only get paid if the bondholders get paid that's why i don't like tesla investors oh but you've been wrong on tesla maybe i'm just early tesla's debt exceeds their market cap i mean i mean their equity so if they had to pay back all their debt holders if people wouldn't keep giving them money because they like the fact that he's you know innovative and actually looked at the fact that they will never make money as a business the only reason they made money is they sold some bitcoin so that business the assets i mean the liabilities exceed the assets so the equity is negative i think that's not worth very much but other people disagree so equity only has value if the bondholders get paid so there are a lot of companies today 40 of the russell 2000 don't make any money if you don't make any money you can't pay off your you can't even service your debt let them pay back your debt crazy so stocks i think are really highly overvalued and i don't i don't love them today which is why i like long short third risk you can take is liquidity risk ah illiquidity risk is awesome private equity private real estate private energy private debt growth capital venture capital making private investments the only difference in private investment public investment is liquidity if i have a share of microsoft i can sell it to you if i have a share of a private company i have to convince you to buy it from me and therefore i get paid more i get five percent above equities but so bonds make two percent above everything one thing the the the other difference though is that um uh only accredited investors get access okay yeah yeah so it's such a pain point i think for many of our listeners that does not exist in the same way in crypto it's a scam and it's it's look it's not intended to protect you from your you know from the ravages of of the scammers it's in it's created to protect the rich right the rich created the credit investor laws not to protect the small investor that's a crock i know plenty of people who aren't rich who are really smart and know plenty of people who are rich or not very good investors and vice versa so a credit investor is to protect the wealthy so that they get access to the great deals it's like why companies stayed private longer right they stayed private longer because the only people that could invest were accredited and qualified purchasers and that's you know they invested into tiger globals and the co2s and the you know t row privates and the wellingtons and they kept these companies private now through spax we can take these companies public faster we can get them into the hands of individuals faster you can own these companies in the future and it's a democratization of access again topic for another day but the fourth risk you take is leverage and leverage is just a tool hundred to one leverage in crypto bad idea people still do it dumb idea 100 to 1 leverage in fixed income dumb idea not as quite as dumb as 101 in crypto but but still a dumb idea 30 times 40 times leverage still a dumb idea we got banks in europe 40 times leverage that's a bad idea look you want to use leverage everyone leverage their house four to one other people lever other assets you want to use margin debt fine but make sure you understand how it works if you use hundred to one leverage you need a one percent move and you've lost 100 of your equity and most people don't think of it that way there's like oh the price is going up so i'm making more money yeah but and i'm a big believer that credit risk not very attractive equity risk today not very attractive because of all things we've been talking about with the the money printing illiquidity risk is the best i've ever seen because most people don't want to be a liquid and here's something for everyone on the cost so i have this thing that i talk about and my daughter when she first got her job she was a pediatric oncology nurse and she worked nights and she called me up one day and said uh dad what should i do with my 401k and i just got angry my daughter has no business being in charge of her 401k not because she's not smart not because she's not a wonderful person she's doing god's work as a as a nurse but she works nice she's tired she doesn't have any interest in the market she doesn't want it and she's not educated in management of her assets and why do 401ks exist they don't exist to help the average investor they exist because the mutual fund companies lobbied to create them because back in 1986 you used to have to have a defined pension a defined benefit pension fund and the company took care of you after you worked for the company and they said oh no but it'll be portable no no no by going from defined benefit to defined contribution you cut the cost to companies by 30 percent that went straight to the bottom line how did they get that done through lobbying which is just a fancy word for corruption and so the mutual fund industries get really really rich and the average person it should look so what does my daughter do and she's great she's smart but she does one over n she got five choices she puts 20 percent in each and that's how the average person invests well why should she own any bonsai it should be against the law for a 25 year old person a 35 year old person to own bonds in their 401k you can't touch the money for 50 years you should have 100 in venture capital growth equity real estate commodities it should be against the law to own bonds but then it wouldn't be profitable for the mutual fund companies right so you got to consider the source and you got to consider why things exist remember a couple years ago they were trying to get the thing the rule passed called the fiduciary act where you had to invest in etfs instead of mutual funds because they were lower fee guess who wrote that bill the head of vanguard and the head of blackrock who were the head of the etf groups because they lobbied a lot to get the ability to write that and thankfully look mooch and i were friends and mooch he had 10 days and off in the administration but in those 10 days he convinced them not to do that thankfully but i just i do get angry about this because the average person has everything stacked against them the average investor has everything stacked against them from accredited investor rules to the inability to access talent to inability to access the best assets in the private markets they can't get into sequoia and kleiner and all the great venture capitalists they have no chance to uh be involved in in private real estate or private energy except in crypto right absolutely it's a venture capital investment it is a d round of a late stage venture capital investment why because if i want to own amazon okay amazon is not a company amazon is a network amazon doesn't make anything they're a search engine they match buyers and sellers and they take a cut they take a very large cut a friend of mine bought this company called lock laces it's the thing that runners use to slide down their shoelaces so they don't have to tie them he bought it he went to amazon said i want to sell on amazon they said okay we take 45 percent of revenues he said what 45 no way like all right then you're not on it's like fine and it was a good thing because the sales went up 10x so he made five times more by putting it on amazon so they are the unbelievable network but a network grows according to metcalf's law and it grows exponentially so the most valuable companies in the world today are networks amazon apple facebook those are not companies there are networks bitcoin is a network it is the fastest network to 100 billion dollars ever in history it's the fastest network ever in history to a trillion dollars it will be the fastest network to 10 trillion dollars and then 100 trillion dollars and what people don't understand is how exponential math works right if i say to everybody on a call right what's 2 times 2 4 easy all right what's 17 times 23 i'll wait that's the limit of human intelligence the average person cannot do that in their head they need a calculator so what if i say how about non-linear regression how about parabolic exponential growth huh probably not good at that and i use this example all the time just to make it if i take 20 steps across the office i'm on the other side of the office linear steps 20 linear steps other side of the office if i take 20 exponential steps i go around the world twice and that's the beauty of being able to invest in the protocols themselves which are venture capital investments you can own them no matter what your net worth you can own them directly you can own them in fractional pieces you don't have to own a whole bitcoin you don't have to hold o you don't have to own a whole ethereum all of these things are democratized access to capital formation business formation wealth creation in a way and imagine a world this is where my mind gets blown imagine a world where every asset every stock every bond every currency every commodity every piece of art every piece of real estate every private business every everything is digital trades 24 7 fractional ownership and i have an algo instead of me trying to wake up and figure out what to do with my 401k i have an algo that owns a little piece of that beeple owns a little piece of the most valuable or the best performing asset in the last 10 years which is not bitcoin it's collectible porsches you know why because of the dentist rap phenomenon so the dentist wrap phenomenon is this dentist go out buy a porsche they don't know how to drive it they think you're allowed to accelerate and turn the steering wheel at the same time which you should never do and they wrap the car around a tree and that porsche is out of commission so over a number of years there's one or two left and they become rare back to rare assets scarce assets there are three guys in the world jerry seinfeld jay leno and john shirley number three guy at microsoft who will pay whatever it takes to buy that collectible porsche and put it in your garage and buff it with a cloth i'm like dudes at least drive them at least let us see them put them in a museum or something but the more scarce an asset is the more valuable it is but imagine an algo that owns a little piece of that that owns a little piece of agricultural farmland in the ukraine owns a little piece of uh an innovative company startup that's going to i was talking to israeli israeli company the other day they have a technology and i don't know if it works but i'm going to find out they have a technology they think they can put cryptographically secure technology into cloud computing that'll be big hey guys i hope you're enjoying the episode with mark yusuko so far in the second half of this podcast we go into the concept of ethereum as the new bastion of emerging markets mark loves to invest in emerging markets and takes the point that perhaps ethereum is the biggest and best frontier of emerging markets that currently exists in the world today we also get his opinion on ether as a monetary unit is mark sold on the concept of ether as money all of these fantastic conversations and more but first we have to get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is

and a lot of what you're saying i find a ton of residents right and so to back up a little bit you talked about how you love to invest in innovation you love commodities you also love emerging markets also accreditation laws are really gatekeeping young people and non-accredited investors from accessing these uh sort of things and all of these automation strategies are actually ridding people of their self-agency towards investing and when you just said that all these assets can become digital and cryptographic tools the through line that i'm seeing between all of these things is ethereum and and i really want to turn to the conversation there because ethereum is the world's largest emerging market it's a digital native economy oh man that is a new hashtag i i love that david man i'm stealing that and not only uh is ethereum's the the internet native emerging market but also ether is the commodity asset that powers that native economy uh and also people get to access uh uh illiquid markets as you've said with these defy tokens right many defy tokens uh instead of going to seed seed investments maybe they do maybe they take one seed investment but they go to like quote unquote public markets on unit swap very quickly and that's why i think there's this reservation from the legacy institutions watching these defy tokens like uniswap go from four dollars to forty dollars in under six months and they say that's a ponzi that's a scam where all these young people who are using these protocols get access to these upsides that they've never been able to to access before because they are not gate kept by the the accreditation laws you bring up so many great points but the really really great one that i think people will miss is no one says that the returns earned by venture capitalists are a ponzi no one ever says oh i put a million dollars in that company like we put three million dollars in this company called beyond meat now i wouldn't eat it actually because i you know got seed oils and all this stuff but i'm really happy that i took out 150 million now no one would call that return upon mm-hmm if it happened in the public domain oh it's a ponzi totally no no you're missing the point by allowing access to capital formation company formation venture capital process you get a multiplier effect you get that illiquidity premium you get that that what used to be a discount that was gonna get too exciting um you get that discount that was basically uh created by forcing that only wealthy people could be involved by now having more people get involved and that discount now gets realized by everybody and when something is a big return people want to say oh it's luck or it's it's a ponzi i mean no no well people are trying to have like rid themselves of cognitive dissonance of missing out on it that's why bitcoin has such great points is like oh 20 000 games that i missed out on must be a scam and i'm gonna go sleep easy at night knowing that it's a scam yep but but your point about the the digitally native land um or or the biggest emerging market being being ethereum is is exactly the way i talk about now i again i'm old enough to remember that uh this guy vince cerf invented this thing called tcpip back in the 70s when he worked at darpa and it took until 1994 for tim berners-lee to come along and invent the internet and tim right he's not a rich guy he's doing fine he's a professor at mit and actually has a cool crypto company that may make him a really rich guy but he's not a rich guy because he invented www dot i mean he created the first web page and there were 80 internet protocols eight zero today there are five right there's tcp which is the base layer then you got smtp for email you got http for websites you got ftp for file transfer and you got www dot that ties everything together it's the toolkit as we go forward and say oh there's all these cryptos no they're not they're 12 cryptos there's a whole bunch of utility tokens most of them are going to xero because they were just crowdsourced venture capital but you didn't have a right to equity debt or current cash flows so most of them are going to zero but the ones that don't like we have a little one called the graph and it's done really well and it's now powering d5 and it's pretty interesting but a lot of them are going to go to zero but cryptographically secure technology is not going away so that's first cryptocurrencies as protocol layers are not going away and the way i view it and maybe this is wrong the way i view it is bitcoin is the base layer like tcpip okay filecoin will be ftp now smtp and http i don't know polkadot cosmos solana i'm not sure which one wins there but one of them is going to win and then on top is eth it's the www dot of the internet of value or the the trust net as i call it and that has been established and everybody says oh no something else is going to come along it's not the way it works so paul romer won the nobel prize two years ago for the what's called the law of increasing returns when i was in business school back in the 80s i read his paper in 87 and i said man this guy's going to win the nobel prize someday it took a freaking long time for him to finally win but the law of increasing returns explains two things so one why all the car dealerships are in the same place while there's always a burger king across mcdonald's where there's always a target across from walmart the concentration right is leads to higher wealth right if you have one gas station on a corner you get x if you have two you get four x if you have four you get 16x so you get a lot more revenue by having more the second part of law of increase in return says it's not the best technology that wins it's the technology that gets critical mass first and most people don't know the story i grew up in seattle so i know that there were two competing operating systems for personal computers dos and uh cpm cpm far better right never crashed more stable we wouldn't have to restart our computer or phone all the time and so ibm was building personal computers they flew to seattle they met with the microsoft guys and i joke look i grew up in seattle most of my friends don't work anymore i still work because i wasn't smart enough to go to work but if you've ever seen the picture of the original microsoft 11 you'll forgive me they were kind of rough looking we were all rough looking in the 70s but they were rougher than most and so they show up they meet with bill they think he's the coffee boy they're like we're out of here they go to california to meet the husband and wife team that founded cpm and the guy's like not meeting with you sign my nda and we're like we're ibm we don't sign ndas right you should be kissing our feet he's like nope not meeting with you so they went back to seattle signed up dos and the rest is history so it's not the best technology that wins it's the technology that gets critical mass and whether bitcoin is the best technology or not i can argue that it is it got critical mass first and the lindy effect says the longer you survive the longer you will survive and in an open source world there's no way to myspace it right you can't have facebook come along and do better because i can just copy paste onto chain and make it better ethereum is different in that it may or may not be the best technology but because it gained critical mass first it now has more use cases and the same way that tcpip became the base layer of the internet and tim didn't get rich because he didn't own tcpip the people got rich or zuck and everybody else who built free applications by the way if it's free you're the product remember that free applications and he got rich by monetizing your data and now we can own a piece of that protocol we can own eth and it was oh it's a coin and oh it's a ponzi scheme it's going to get rug pulled like you're missing the point all of these things that are built on this platform particularly the d5 world actually generate real revenues right we just made a ton of money with coinbase direct listing we're really happy and i didn't make as much as the guy put in 300 000 on day one but we we did okay for our shareholders and uh we're really happy but there are companies on d5 that have a reasonable close proximation to coinbase's run rate and coinbase is a 60 billion dollar company so um i think there's a lot going on that the average person just can't really understand and it's not because they don't want to understand i mean it's because they're busy and they've got their life and they just haven't spent this time look guilty said i made lots of bad decisions in 2013. i was introduced to this really early had a chance to to but i didn't get it i joke i wasn't running drugs on silk road not a cryptography student didn't get bitcoin in 2013. i got infrastructure and i made tons of money in infrastructure we did corbett we did coinbase we did we did lots of stuff that had done really well for us but i was late to the party in bitcoin but now a big believer and i've done pretty well i'm not again no one's crying for me but it took doing the work it took me going from spending zero time to 80 90 percent of my time and loving conversations like this where i get to really dig deeply into the next level and you know it's like this conversation i had with these these founders in israel the other day they're doing something that is really interesting that will take this innovation to the next level where we intersect with the traditional universe and and i talked about you know get the metaverse and the universe and they were like this and now they're suddenly overlapping a little but pretty soon it's all gonna be one and there will be uh opportunities to uh really exploit that overlap and opportunity and it just triggers one last funny story that i think is so cool which is the reason tim draper became a you know he was already a billionaire but he became a multi-multi-billionaire because of of a sword and it's a great story so his friend was from south korea and was telling him about this story where his son wanted 40 bucks to buy a sword he's like i'm giving you 40 bucks your mom's not going to let you have a sword this is not a real sword dad i want a virtual sword in my game and the dad's like no i'm not giving you 40 real dollars to buy a sword in your game no and which i fight with my son just about every night on brawl stars about this um and or me and pokemon go actually or actually do put real money in it um but the reality is that tim heard the story and went wait a second virtual money virtual goods wait a second didn't they just you know close down this silk road thing and he went to the fbi auction and they're auctioning off the i think it was 260 000 coins and uh the price was three dollars and everybody was trying to steal them for like a buck fifty a buck sixty and tim bid three dollars in one cent got them all that was good it was good trade hold on time mark so um i guess part of what david was asking i think is it sounds like you're very bullish on bankless you're very bullish on d5 as a capital asset and you're probably bullish on eth and its network effect and ethereum as an asset one thing that um we've had some back and forth with with pomp is he believes that bitcoin is the only monetary asset that can exist in crypto and i understand where he's coming from because he's like look it has the history it has the network effect it has the fixed uh supply 21 million all of those other things part of the bankless platform is we are looking for the emergence of new crypto monies bitcoin is absolutely one of those we also think there are other emerging assets that can also receive a monetary reserve type status and that ether is one of those it has an issuance policy that is always going down for instance it is used as an asset within the ethereum economy it's used as money for nfts it's used as collateral backing all of the loans on like ave and maker or a large portion of them for instance what's your thought on that so it's broader than the question of are you bullish either because i think you'd say yes i'm bullish this platform right what do you think it's potential is to also become a world monetary asset in the way that that bitcoin is yeah look i i tweeted uh actually last night um that uh you know i hate to disagree with pomp for the first time which someone pointed out he's he's joking mark says there's two people always have the same opinion one is unnecessary which is true and and pomp and i have disagreed on many things and we've had great conversations late into the night about everything under the sun and and you know he is he is a a good friend and partner and and compatriot and uh and and look disagreement is good this idea that we the the world in which we live has has tried to tribalize and and and and discourage open debate and dialogue and discourse you know discussion and debate is about seeking truth not convincing the other person of your side that's not the goal but that's what social media does it's what you know media does and and so this idea that the people can have a different opinion and therefore they don't like each other or you know it's bad no nothing can be further from the truth right we are we should all be seeking truth and so to answer your question on you know look pomp is absolutely a maximalist and he he definitely believes as you described and i don't want to put words in his mouth but i believe differently in the sense that i agree wholeheartedly with him that bitcoin is money just like gold is money and remember money is different than currency money exists in the absence of a liability and bitcoin has no liability associated with it it is digital gold it has all the properties of gold as money and now it is more scarce because of the last having and therefore i think it is on on a course to become uh a bigger part of of money right so if you think about this great chart and shows that bitcoin today is roughly in the circle with all the fangs so it's a network that's equivalent to these other networks the next step is gold equivalents where it becomes the equivalent of of a monetary part of gold now pure gold equivalents would include all the jewelry and that's i don't know maybe but 4 trillion is kind of where we get to monetary codes the monitor because gold is the only thing that's a currency and a commodity when people trade it like a commodity the price goes down like right now and people trade like your currency the price goes up like since 2011. i mean i'd be from 2000 to 2011. and so i think if if you if you think about it in those terms i can make the case that yeah bitcoin will be that base layer protocol that monetary protocol and it'll be the tcpip of the internet of value and second layer systems like lightning and others will create payment rails that'll replace bitcoin bitcoin replace visa and mastercard and and so i i can i can go with that i view eth differently right i view eth as this www.this toolkit that allows you to build all of these other things now unlike www.which you can't own to your point you can own eth you can use eth as collateral you can't so i will i will agree with you which doesn't mean i disagree with pomp there's a difference right i can agree with you and agree with him i will agree that eth could could have a monetary role now i probably don't see it being used as a monitor monetary store like look i i do think some central banks are going to own bitcoin and some may already have it right china may already have it russia may already have it and look i think china is the first digital currency uh central bank digital currency i think russia's second i think we come in third and hit you know say i hate to quote ricky bobby but if you ain't first you're last so you know you definitely needed to be first but uh it's bad so china's gonna win that one again and china china's going to win the next century that's just that's just going to happen that's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing um so we'll do we'll do fine um just like fine to live in the uk even though they're not the world reserve currency and they're not the superpower anymore but i i could see a place or a time where eth's market cap got big enough where people said yep we could use it too but i don't think it needs that to be wildly successful i don't think it needs that to power what i think will be an even bigger opportunity set which is d5 which is again every stock every bond every currency every commodity every piece of value every derivative contract every structured product every everything is going to code all that's going to be on smart contracts all of it and people like mark that's ridiculous i'm like no it's not it it is and it's mark i'd like to add in here that uh ether the asset is actually currently at a market cap that uh bitcoin was at when the bitcoin on balance sheets conversation started yeah and i said i i don't have any problem with the idea of owning eth uh as a monetary asset i really don't and i kind of do too i mean i do i mean i have i mean i don't know what the exact numbers are but but call it you know 81 or 82 percent in in btc and and by 17 18 percent in eth and uh then some other various and sundry percentages and in smaller projects but um that's kind of the way my my holdings it's cool it's cool to hear you talk about this mark and you know i know you are um you know a very open-minded uh investor in general and um that's something that i've learned from many of your other podcasts is like hey you got to keep an open mind and you know there's a difference between having conviction in something and actually changing your mind and like figuring out where you were wrong and it's really important and it's hard i think in investing in crypto to strike the balance like how do you know whether it's conviction that's making you you hold this thing uh in the face of everyone saying oh 95 drop it's gone it's over the thing is dead it's used for drug lords and scam artists all icos are complete frauds uh you know are you convicted in that moment or are you sort of um do you have a bag bias in that moment and you you just need to admit that you're wrong i want to maybe end on on this question which is what advice do you have for the crypto natives like um again a lot of people as we started this podcast listening to bank lists crypto is really their first experience in investing they're learning about investing through crypto which is sort of bizarre but um i think they're leveling up faster than they might in the real world um but there's still some timeless lessons that can be applied from traditional investing here what are those share some so the first is to understand the difference between investing trading speculating and gambling and none of them are bad or good necessarily just like introvert and extrovert right people oh introverts are are not cool and and extroverts are cool it's not what it means okay it's how you recharge your battery at the end of a long day do you recharge by being with other people or do you want to be by yourself neither one is right or wrong neither one is good or bad but societally we attach meaning to words and so if i say gambling oh that's bad no not necessarily right gambling is gambling and understand what it is right it's partly entertainment partly excessive speculation uh and and to to define it really it's it's where unfortunately the odds are actually tilted against you so the longer you do it the more you will lose so it doesn't mean you can't win as a gambler you can um but the odds are tilted against you speculation is where you are uh putting capital at risk simply based on price right and it is you know you you haven't done any work you haven't you don't really have any conviction to your point and you're basically just speculating on on movement trading is uh the same idea your your moot your you're acting on price movement but both directions right you're okay with things going down because you might go short you're okay with things going up because you might go long and so i can be a trader either way i can go long and go short i can i can trade actively um but none of that is investing investing is very different right investing is where you hold an asset because you think the price is different than the value of the asset right you buy things where you think the price is under the value and you sell things where you think the price is over the value and so investing has lots of theory behind it right markowitz won the nobel prize for this idea if i take cash which is the riskiest asset there is actually seems really safe but it's really risky because you're chewed up by inflation and i add bonds which are riskier meaning they have a higher volatility and i put those together the risk my portfolio actually goes down well if i add stocks the risk the portfolio goes down well how does that work well it's because the assets are uncorrelated and therefore they zig when the other zags and your overall portfolio return is smoother and your compounding effect is higher right if i can truncate my downside the upside takes care of itself and it's you know if you're down 10 you gotta be up 11 down 20 you got to be up 25 down 50 on you know got to be a hundred so if you can truncate those losses through diversification you win so first piece is understand what you're doing if you want to have a gambling account go for it it's great just make it small because you're going to lose it all and uh i used to talk about there's three buckets for an investor right there's the get rich bucket right and that's where it's your friends condo deal your brother-in-law's you know startup company you know some tip you got from a broker you're going to lose all of it so just keep it small right 10 to 15 percent in the get rich bucket go for it then you got 10 to 15 in the liquidity bucket and that's what you need to fund your lifestyle and that has to be super safe you know cash and short term duration fixed income maybe a little gold but stuff that you can get liquid that you can use then you got 70 to 80 percent in the middle that's the stay rich bucket and the stay rich bucket okay look getting rich is about concentration every great portfolio every great fortune in the world is created from concentration concentrated stock position concentrated business ownership concentrated real estate position all of it but every small fortune comes from concentration how do you create a small fortune start with a large one and stay concentrated uh people say i want to pay the taxes wait long enough you won't have to right cisco went up to 286 286 times earnings back in 2000 and then it went down 84 and to this day it's still not back to where it was in 2000 think about that for a second in fact if you bought the fab four stocks that were can't miss in 2000 microsoft intel cisco and qualcomm and you held them to today you're still down that is right frightening so concentration makes you rich but diversification keeps you rich and so as a young person you should have more concentration you should take risks and steinhardt said it best michael steinhardt famous hedge fund manager says make all your bad decisions and make all your mistakes when you're young it doesn't really matter and so investment is about willing to be wrong with every investment we become richer or wiser never both right if you make money you don't learn a thing it's like the degenerate gambler goes to vegas right it's my brother day trading back in 2000 first trade he made made more than his salary the previous year worst thing could have possibly happened to him because what happened to the rest he lost everything literally lost 95 of his money because he thought that was skill instead of luck and the difference to be able to differentiate between skill and luck is really really important and luck is very good i like luck i'm a big fan of it right like thomas jefferson says it seems the harder i work the more of it i seem to have i love luck it's very good but you have to differentiate between skill and luck and about probabilities and possibilities and part of the problem for most investors is like most of us live in fear and the trophy the participation trophy world in which a lot of people listening to this grew up doesn't make it better right we're not allowed to fail you know no one fails everybody gets a trophy bull loney my ten-year-old when he was four okay i have to have older kids and a little guy's caboose 20 years after our first two um same wife and she's the miracle and when he was four he went offer in soccer and they gave the team a trophy and i took the trophy and i put in a trash and my wife said what are you doing i'm like didn't earn that no you don't get trophy for losing all your games no this world's about winning okay the problem is we're so afraid of failure that we don't follow will smith fail fast but fail forward and winners in investing lose more often than losers because losers are so afraid of losing that they don't take risk right so they don't do anything and they stay in cash and they stay in bonds and they don't try crypto and they don't do this and then they miss the two thousand percent return and say oh that was just luck no it's because you did what you're supposed to do as an investor take intelligent risks take risks where you are compensated build a portfolio of you know concentrated ideas let the winners run right julian robertson mentor friend you know i've been very lucky in my life to have great mentors and that's things everyone should do is seek great mentors and and actually podcasts make that easy because you can talk to a lot more people than you could person to person they did but the key is that he said you know i asked people what made julian a great investor and he said oh he had an uncanny ability to double up it's the hardest thing to do in the world which when something's working put more behind it and so that comes from conviction and how do you get courage to double up only if you have conviction how do you get conviction do the work the average person doesn't do the work the average person's afraid of losing they're afraid of failing you've probably heard this story right my wife's only heard me speak one time she came to vegas for a conference uh and at the end of it she said mark you can't say things like that like what do you mean she says well you say things with such conviction i said what's wrong with that he says well people might believe you well that's the whole point he says well what if you're wrong i said i don't change my mind i'm wrong all the time i don't mind you know and that's the one thing i hate about twitter i love twitter i love twitter work together because of twitter i love twitter i have friends all around the world i have met incredible people i get to meet the president the biggest bank in greece because i post a picture of me in athens during the banking crisis friend called me and said hey you're in athens you want to meet the president of the bank i'm like yes and that was cool so i love twitter but the one thing i hate don't go through my old tweets from three or four years ago and say oh you said this and you were wrong like i've changed my mind seven times since then please i'm wrong all the time it's not about whether you're right or wrong george soros said it best it's how much money you make when you're right how much money you lose when you're wrong this game is not about being right all the time it's about taking risk risks that you're compensated for it's about a constant discipline to rebalance okay it's about a constant discipline of you know evolving to new ideas about cutting your losers fast again where if you did something you didn't have conviction you hadn't done the work and it goes against you you're not right you're just wrong get out and move on to something else there's so many good ideas so many good opportunities and if you don't try them you can't win and so sitting back and complaining about everybody else and saying oh they just got lucky that's just lazy it's intellectually lazy it's like telep right it's going to zero you've been saying it for eight years dude eight years at some point you just look stupid well actually the long past since looking stupid and look i think peter schiff does it to you know get interest it's like nope he's a pt barnum believer you know all publicity is good publicity so i think part of it's intentional um and now his you know sparring with pomp is to drive you know traffic to his site so people buy his mutual fund um anyway that's a long answer which you probably didn't want this is look this is these are timeless lessons for every crypto native uh what you're talking about is make sure you're bucketing your various know whether you're gambling or speculating or investing um invest with conviction these are all themes that we talk about on bankless so much and you've just summarized them very very well guys go listen to the the last five to ten minutes where mark was talking about this again because we need to embed this knowledge in our head it's what's going to get us through both this bull cycle and then future bear cycles uh that that play out in crypto but long term look we are bullish this asset class if everything pans out the way we talked about at the beginning of this episode um crypto and digital assets are going to do quite well mark thanks so much for sharing your expertise and experience with us today now ryan dave thanks for having me this was this is a ton of fun i uh i say so i was on a show the other day and someone said you know the secret to a great podcast is is get a good guest and sit back and shut up and make money and like no no no that's not how it works the secret is you know try to find some good guess that's fine but then do a little research figure out a couple good questions actually listen to the answers and then formulate better questions and let the conversation flow and you guys did that flawlessly really enjoyed this could have talked all day and uh hopefully we'll do it again sometime well it's fun and mark when you get the chance keep trying out those d5 protocols man uh using uh barnbridge is really awesome to hear so you are you are in the
