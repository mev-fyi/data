is it fair to like lump luna the algo stable coin ponzi scheme in with like the other alt-layer ones i feel like if i was like anatoly or emin from avalanche i'd be like dude that's not fair like you're not an algo stable coin ponzi scheme sure my response to that would be that you know all's fair in love and war right so on one level uh that is true but i think so much of the like memetic power over the last 18 months for all tell ones has been price action sure right so when one of them blows up and you go oh wait maybe these things aren't invincible especially when you know the price action has been negative for a lot of the hotel ones as it has for everything right but like it doesn't really matter if d5 tokens are going down if the thesis was that like cosmos or avalanche is going to surpass ethereum and then you know everyone who's kind of betting on that thesis gets wrecked it's going to have an impact on that and people's conviction in that theory
