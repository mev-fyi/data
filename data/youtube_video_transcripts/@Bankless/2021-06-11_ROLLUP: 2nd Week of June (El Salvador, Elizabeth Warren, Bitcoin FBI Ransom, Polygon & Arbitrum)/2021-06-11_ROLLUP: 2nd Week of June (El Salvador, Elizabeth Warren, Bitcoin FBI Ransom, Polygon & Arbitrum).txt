[Music] thankless nation it is friday morning the second week of june roll-up time david you ready for roll-up time ryan i'm always ready for roll-up time it's honestly the favorite my favorite piece of content that we produce here on the vanquish program is the most fun just so consistent every week we bring you markets releases news takes what we're excited about it causes david and i to go in depth on the week to make sure we absorb all of the headlines so super exciting this comes at you every friday morning so you can enjoy it with your morning cup of coffee youtube i think is the best way to view this because we've got lots of visuals but if you are podcast only enjoy it on the podcast feed to david before we get to the first section we got to announce something that's uh kind of exciting this is a partnership between the bankless dow and pai dao which is an index um yeah a defy index organization and they are also a doubt and they've created a way to earn uh liquidity do you want to talk about this for a bit yeah this is uh something i think that where the through line is really about dow to dao partnerships right pai dao wants uh liquidity and asset deposits and it is uh incentivizing the bankless dao uh to both uh uh submit liquidity which is what the paidow wants but also use a referral link to generate referral fees for bankless dao uh and i like i said in the in the future of work article that came out on bank list last week the future of work is like dow to dow relationships we can bootstrap these things ourselves so if you go to the link in the show notes and you deposit liquidity and stake your lp tokens you get a pretty healthy yield at least at current doe prices um right now you are getting 375 apy at current liquidity and good current doe prices so big asterisk um on the dough to the play to do lp and then on the dough to eat lp you're getting 290 again at current liquidity prices and current dough prices uh which are pretty awesome yields if that is something that you are interested click in the link in the show notes and bankless dow gets the referral fees there you go there's a whole how-to guide if none of that made sense to you read the how-to guide and you will learn more all right david you ready to get into this let's do it ryan there's there's so much to talk about this week per usual i know i know all right market let's start there bitcoin price bitcoin still number one last i checked house bitcoin price hanging this week yeah bitcoin touched a low of right below 32 000 which again was really really spooking people but then the el salvador news came and bitcoin pumped from thirty two thousand dollars all the way up to three thousand seven hundred and eight hundred dollars and now we are at the current price of thirty six thousand and eight hundred dollars with the bitcoin price uh we had our state of the nation with ledger status and he kind of schooled us on ta and analysis and he kind of uh pointed out how broken the bitcoin chart looked and how scary it looked it doesn't look awesome it doesn't look awesome right now but my my take is that this el salvador news could be the news to help repair the bitcoin chart uh it's very it's very plausible it seems to be an easy take to say that this el salvador news is going to what is paints the floor of the bitcoin price possibly possibly we'll definitely see the charts don't lie is what i learned from from ledger but there's still a lot of fear in the markets david this is the the feed the fear and greed index uh from an organization that monitors sentiment for for bitcoin we're still in the extreme fear zone and i think this is on the back of just a lot of um you know downward price action but also energy um fear uncertainty and doubt going on in the market even some regulatory clampdown talk so that that extreme fear sentiment is uh is still pretty active for bitcoin any thoughts there yeah the bitcoin has had an insane amount of headwinds especially coming out from the regulatory environment we've got we've got the energy crisis for bitcoin which they are still fighting now we have these uh ransomware attacks bitcoin is having some pr troubles and for me that's that's where i get a little bit of my fear is like can bitcoin overcome these pr issues because there's a decent amount of the people the people of the world that are you know going after bitcoin right now that don't care about realities and are just going through narratives we'll we're going to be talking about this in the weekly rollups but like the anti-bitcoin narrative is growing from people who don't care or know about bitcoin yeah absolutely and we'll see if that el salvador news which is going to be a big topic this week is enough to combat that okay let's talk about eath price so we're hanging at uh 2500 at the time of recording so we are down on the week uh what yeah what's going on here down on the week the weekly high is just above two thousand eight hundred dollars the weekly low is just below two thousand four hundred dollars and we are at the current price of two thousand five hundred and six dollars um flat on the week so that means that liquidity providers are probably pretty happy because they're generating the liquidity fees but people long eath are probably you know again like kind of antsy if you're long eath you want it to be higher than where it is right now uh kind of in the same vein as bitcoin like we are really looking to have some like support and catalyst to really make sure that you know this doesn't this whole entire like weekly or two weeks of price action just doesn't break down let's look at the greed and fear index again for eth so we're not an extreme fair fear for eth according to market sentiment so again this analyzes social media channels all sorts of sentiment indicators but we are squarely in the fear zone that feels about right to me i think eath holders are uh still doing okay still feeling good about the gains on the year but also a bit fearful i think the big question comes out is like the question we asked ledger hey what's going to happen next what do the charts tell us are we going back into a bear market like is the bull run over or um you know will bitcoin drag eth down uh what's going to happen in the future that that remains kind of the question one of one of the possibilities ledger laid out which i don't think uh has been clearly articulated on on bankless before by a guest is just that hey what if we're just flat for the entire rest of the year the whole year the entirety of 2021 and that's definitely a possibility too and what he said is that if we are flat for the year that hurts because everyone is expecting up when everyone is expecting up and you get flat that is down from expectations right uh so that's bearish versus expectations and so um it seems like it's in the cards and like that being flat is actually causing fear and that's kind of that's kind of what happens when like you get kind of get used to up and to the right only uh all of a sudden flat is bearish yeah me personally david uh i'm not in that fear zone like i'm not concerned at all i'm probably closer to the to the yellow green zone um i just think even a flat year actually feels uh feels really good to me at this point in time because it clears out a lot of the the folks who are just here for short-term gains but it would be a break in the cycle like crypto hasn't traditionally um you know had such a short bull run and then gone back to flat zone before a steady rise up in the way that ledger was describing so we'll have to see how this plays out if you are long term on the journey of course this doesn't factor in as much to you the weekly uh ups and downs don't matter but let's look at the ratio eat the bitcoin ratio so what's going on here yeah ryan if you want to zoom out maybe to the three-month chart uh the ratio peaked out it was climbing really really steadily up until right before this el salvador news topped out at .077 when the btc ratio high was just a little bit of above .08 so almost touched the highs that we set a couple months ago then the el salvador news came and and people uh in bitcoin had a pump off of its floor now we are down to .067 each btc uh which is still a really healthy number uh and it i think this indicates uh the same thing that ledger was saying it looks like it's going to range for a while it looks like it's going to range between .055 and .08 for a decent amount of time um and and depending on on you know how how much you want to believe me it looks like it could it could range for like like ledger said the whole rest of the year um but again i don't know anything well we keep referring to that el salvador news i promise guys we're going to explain that in the news section what's going on there let's talk about d5 though really quick while we're on the numbers so kind of flat again on the total locked value metric in d5 flat at about 60 billion or so anything anything to talk about yeah 61 billion locked in defy i think the cool thing to talk about is ave dominance ave has taken the number one spot on locked at assets locked in defy 13.2 billion yeah it used to be maker as of very recently but ave has really sucked in a lot of liquidity and assets and some of that is definitely due to their polygon integration assets locked in ave on polygon is going up a lot yeah i remember a time david when uh d5 was concerned that uh maker had too much power and influence and was too almost like getting too big to fail it used to have 80 yeah 80 remember there's like a maker dominance um sort of index for for a period of time and now it's hanging out number two it's it's still got that that silver medal but um wow the ascent of ave has been quite a story i think we'll we'll talk a bit more about that but let's talk about the d5 pulse index so once again these this is an index of the top blue chip i'd call them uh d5 tokens and we're down on the week um buy a decent bit what's going on here yeah started the week at just above 400 dollars now we're at 336 was a pretty decent dip yes defy tokens taking taking a beating not recovering as well as ether recovered and this is i think where a decent amount of this fear comes from like if people or or a result of the fear one one of the two uh when people get fearful they go risk off and they go up the market cap stack into the more secure assets like bitcoin and ether that's why ether has you know dipped versus bitcoin that's why defy tokens have dipped versus ether when people get fearful they go risk off and they go into you know more safe haven assets well let's see how uh this is working out for you david you made a bottom prediction on the dpi to eth ratio and oh my god i don't know if that's held what was your absolute bottom prediction the absolute bottom that i'm calling is one three and we are currently at point one three four except the thing is like look at that downtrend just like look at that just straight down and to the right and it almost tried to break out of it but no uh and right now this downtrend is very much intact uh and so uh your your boy might be invalidated pretty damn soon here we'll see but it was it was fun while it lasted yeah well i guess what this means is uh maybe we get layer two summer but we might not have a defy token summer repeat right we're entering into um d5 summertime last time d5 tokens were just starting their ascent in june of this time last year um we may not see that repeat in this summer it could be a chilly summer honestly i don't think anyone knows what the hell happens next true we'll have to see okay um but let's talk about this the story i think in the markets really is a story of cool down uh this is joel john who gives some takes on this maybe we'll go back and forth on a few not read them all but number one is he says i was intrigued because the seven day moving average for volume had become begun declining substantially over the past few weeks it peaked at 90 billion for daily volume is currently 44 billion so he's saying daily exchange daily volume has peaked and definitely started to uh to cool off that's his first take where we're seeing this cool down yeah it is cooling off from 90 billion but also if we go back just to two months the 44 billion like one month two months ago was actually like the new peak right and to some degree like bitcoin yeah ether moved really really fast and also ether had the most volume out of any asset in the last like two months uh and so like again like from the peak it dropped off but right like its current level is still really high and honestly i'll say the same thing about ether price the peak four thousand three hundred dollars really high current price of two thousand five hundred dollars comparatively low but if you go back two months still kind of flat right like still good yeah and still definitely above 2017 all-time highs um let's see the second one david you want to yeah coinbase slipped from the ranking of number two in the app store to a number 121 implying that there's a lot less downloads of coinbase which there's a means just intrinsically means that there's a lot less retail demand so that very much falls in line with the dropping in volume it's kind of cool for a brief period of time coinbase the app was bigger than the cash out from square that's pretty cool now that's back down a similar cool off in the number of portfolio apps so blockfolio is one uh it's surged the last few weeks but um kraken pro etorio crypto blockfolio from an app's perspective all sort of trending down except blockfolio is somewhat up so that's another interesting marker of what's happening yeah and another big marker that i remember being very big in 2017 was uh daily active follows of uh exchange accounts twitter twitter uh twitter exchange accounts the new number of twitter followers following exchanges has declined from the height of 546 people joining every single week right now to where it is at 200 000 people following twitter account crypto exchange twitter accounts every single week again indicating a declining interest i kind of like these social metrics because we don't look at them often david so it's worth looking at oh here's one this is um the number of prominent youtube influencers crypto influencers um it does not include us yeah what includes people like uh ivan on tech data data dash box mining the moon andreas legit um and two others i don't think we are any of those two others but anyway it's gone from a peak of new follows 130k a week to just 36k users each week so it's definitely declined the youtube influencer traffic has declined as well our numbers are yeah if we were there we would be the outlier ryan we don't hit these major numbers that some of these other so-called influencers they've been around from 2017 so they have that one up on us yeah yeah and look it's different kind of content ours is sort of uh less i don't want to slam mother i don't want to slam other influencers but we're definitely like long-term oriented we don't have charts up all the time we don't have charts up all the time uh okay let's talk about this though the nft market bubble has popped we've got the charts to prove it so it was sort of like a uh this these charts are saying a near 90 collapse in nft sales and i think it was saying that look the nft bubble is three to four months long and now it's crashed what do you think about this take well uh we do know that there were a bunch of terrible nfts that were getting sold and so to some degree like we kind of need some some quality to return to nfts in some way you didn't you didn't buy any of the lindsay lohan no i did not no i um and like you know uh crypto punks which are still like i would consider quality nfts were going for an insane exorbitant amount of money um but i would like to say that the take here is while volume is coming down perhaps perhaps again a return to a new means setting a new floor um but i was talking to jamis from pleaser dao who's very big in nfts and very focused and he's very you know connected with all the nfc issuing platforms and all the just very much into the details of what's going on behind the scenes and nfts and he says that the amount of innovation and development and competition between nft issuing platforms is absolutely insane and so this is very much a if you look at the charts it's an nft bear market but if you look at the development it's a development bull market with nfts uh and that's kind of the story of crypto like development doesn't happen when they're when there's retail mania yeah i think it's great look uh unquestionably nfts are here to stay i also think it's healthy like this is sort of a um a sector bubble in crypto that peaked retail mania and then collapsed but didn't take the rest of crypto with it right so maybe this is evidence for sort of that super cycle theory where different sectors and cryptos sort of go up and down and have their own manias and collapse but um we obviously haven't seen a secular bear market 90 sell-off in other crypto assets and yeah as you said like the bear time is when builders build this is kind of the best time to be involved so if you were intrigued by nfts i would say now is the time to actually go start maybe buying them maybe seeing what's going on maybe starting to build things definitely build your your network in the space because um the mania has left and now is the time to do it bear markets are where wealth is created you find you're right you're at the correct position in bear markets and then you eat your ramen and then you wait and then when it finally comes your turn like you're well positioned position yourself during the bear markets absolutely david all right um this is kind of cool eath had the highest trading volume of any crypto assets across all the major not decentralized exchanges but centralized exchanges in the month of may reserve asset for crypto question mark this is coinbase number one overtook bitcoin uh binance same story just barely over bitcoin but still um uh huabi trading volume eth was number one ftx eth was number one actually pretty impressive to see the strength of volume on centralized exchanges and so sort of calls into question like there was sort of um a maximalist take that bitcoin would always be the reserve asset for crypto and always be the dominant most liquid trading pair and we're just not seeing that now whether whether it can kind of hold that into the future is sort of the question right so i will say there was a period of time where doge was actually crushing bitcoin on some of this right so one month doesn't really change the situation very much it does point to some strengths but we'll see from a long-term perspective how this trading volume um plays out it's important for ether to be on the board so like you know one month uh is what ethers got under its belt as the leader in trading volumes and you know it didn't have that before uh next up one year how many months will it take until one year of ether trading dominance over bitcoin uh we'll find out right um okay this is really cool david um let me let me blow this up this is from our friend the token terminal this is a visualization of daily borrowing volumes from the leading lending protocols last year do you see this it's kind of a horse race between compound maker ave and a few other centrifuge and others look at compound compounds just taken off crushing it right this is after d5 summer wait ave is coming up there's ave wow look at that volume right that's crazy so i don't what happened near the end there like what happened the last two months to cause that yeah what was yeah what was the what month was that um let's see that was like april and may of 2024 may 20 market volatility man market volatility volatility is doing something different um well ave integrated on polygon uh this is layered obviously markets yeah i do think um back to the theme we've been talking about david is um what as you're a value as people are evaluating d5 protocols i'm doing this myself it's like you have to evaluate what their layer two strategy is right now because that's where a lot of the the growth is going to be in the future um and ave has just been i think has a very solid layer two strategy compound is doing their own independent chain right which is interesting um i'm not sure what their plans are to expand into like we haven't heard much about that i haven't heard much about it the other the other thing that differentiates ave from compound and i think why ave just like jumped at the very end is like avi's got all the tokens and tokens did very very well in april and may right true all right guys we're going to be back with the releases but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get unisoft to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right guys we are back with the releases in crypto last week the first one we want to talk about is arbitrary stuff player two summer stuff unit swap now deployed on arbitrum wow that was fast community voted for it they deployed it a few days arbitration of course not open they haven't cut the red ticker tape and open it to their theme park to guess but uniswap is deployed and apparently works on arbitrum kind of cool wait so is it arbitrarum that is preventing users from coming or is it uniswap that's preventing users from coming i think it's uniswap ah so i thought it was arbitram i thought that um arbitram wanted to wait until they had some rides in their theme park that wouldn't chop people's heads off um and they said it was more social coordination rather than like so like the infrastructure of getting a block explorer up and going and getting metamask integrated and getting chain link on so that you could power whatever feeds that a d5 protocol needs i think they were waiting for some of that to come to place and then they were going to open it and not all the rides would be open at that point in time but at least it would be there would be enough there for users to start so i think that was kind of the dependency but i could be wrong no i think that makes sense because unit swap is talking about you know how developers with white-listed addresses can uh can you oh here you go yeah yep okay i guess that doesn't say it doesn't it doesn't really specify but i think if if we're talking about white-listed addresses like who's in control of that arbitrary's in control of that uh so that makes sense um and also it also makes sense because you know they want to establish some sort of credible neutrality uh and so i think white lit or like allowing white listed addresses only which are developers like basically developers only yeah i think everyone gets to like have their here you have your slotted amount of time to build your stuff so you don't have to have this rat race like you don't have to you don't like sushi would just win that race because they just integrated crazy right yeah and so i think they must be giving some sort of like grace peers like all right you have this amount of time to like build your apps and then we're going to you know literally cut the red tape and it's so bullish look i think this is cool because unit swap v3 is is awesome it's really great and um they haven't yet expanded to a roll up yet so they've let um automated market makers like quick is a quick swap quick swap on polygon kind of dominate right now and it's because unit swap has decided not to enter polygon why because polygon does not have the same economic assurances as a rollup like arbitrum but now they're in the ring and they're going into layer two and so i i'm super curious to see how the automated market maker money robots all fight for liquidity and like fight each other and we're the beneficiaries of course but it's going to be cool to watch and unit swap v3 is a very high touch amm right like concentrated liquidity mike makes you like you need to like be on the on the ball with like how you how you choose to lp and having that on the main chain with gas fees and like long block times really hinders that and i expect the unit swap v3 which is already so like it's supposed to be a very fierce competition that competition just gets more fierce when you have like almost instant block times and almost free transactions yeah and it's it's great to be able to play with it without like having to worry about really high gas fees anyway so arbitrarium humming along um they arbitrarily hiring nuts in their their uh twitter header but i think they're also excited to announce that graph protocol is now offering hosted services on arbitrary one we did a great episode of the graph they they provide a lot of the sort of the data indexing infrastructure to all of these chain link for the inside yeah it's it's kind of basically that so the graph protocol is there now to set up in the theme park um david we should talk about uh as long as we were talking about uniswap v3 a fantastic unit swap v3 calculator came out and i've looked at this it's it's i haven't spent enough time with it but it seems super useful i think we should just spend a few minutes like walking through what this is this is from flipside crypto but if you were curious about um how much money you can expect to make a like a model for how much you can expect to make as a liquidity provider in uniswap v3 how this works because as you said david it is more complicated this calculator is a great way to model it so what dials should i set here well like what would be a good demo of this yeah let's so we are looking at the usdc to ether pool at specifically the point zero five percent uh fee there's also the same pool but with point three percent and that liquidity is different um but it looks to be that the dominant pool for ether to usdc is the point zero five percent fee so let's keep us there ryan uh let's go ahead and put one thousand dollars i don't know why it starts at seven seven seven let's put one thousand dollars in uh and the i think that this liquidity positions graph right on the right here uh that is i think something that we as an industry and as a globe will look at until the end of time because this graph tells you where the liquidity is and also this dot this dashed line is where the price is all of the green is where the liquidity is uh and this is this is where we are playing this is the game people that have their liquidity positioned under the line are winning and look at all that all the people that have that spike of liquidity i i it's kind of hard to eyeball this price but i think it's like at two thousand five hundred dollars to two thousand like six hundred dollars ish right now price yeah that's east price right now ether is dipping at two thousand four hundred and eighty two dollars there's a lot of people who position their liquidity at above this price and so the people that are positioning the liquidity at below that big range where everyone else is are getting out sort like an outsize amount of fees because they they are where the liquidity is inside of the bands and so ryan on the left here you have a uh according to this website you have a band a liquidity providing band of concentrated liquidity between two thousand two hundred and fifty five dollars and two thousand nine hundred and eighteen dollars so that means that if you deposit your liquidity here you think that there's going to be a large amount of time that ether is going to spend between these bands but if you if you had a conviction that the eth price was going to stay at an even narrower band you could drop that 2 900 price let's say we're bearish i think we had just the most bearish weekly roll-up uh market section that we ever had so let's drop let's drop that top price down let's go down to 2 500 uh which is right above where it is right now and then it's just and just to be clear david what we're talking about with this liquidity band is the thousand dollars that we have in the top here we're only providing that a thousand dollars worth of liquidity and this is usdc for that band let me keep the price so if it goes outside of that band if ether goes above 2 515 which is the top of the band that i have right now if it's you know 2 600 for instance as a liquidity provider with my thousand dollars not making anything no transaction fees and you have it all in ether and i have it all in ether right because the ether price is north of your band and so you have sold all of your dollars for ether you have bought that ah that's interesting if it kind of forces you to buy the dip if it goes outside of your band yeah um and so and so uh let's say i don't think ether price is going down below 2 300 so let's raise that band from 2250 up to 2 300. okay and the other cool thing is look at that prices the last five days and so according to the band that we have you can see that green highlighted zone and you can see like retroactively what eath price has done in the last five days and you can see how much um how much of your band ether has been in historically in the last five days now ether price has largely been north of this band the last five days so if we have a band right now between 2 300 and 2 500 that means that we are bearish ether in comparatively to the last five days and also going back to that liquidity positions in the top right um you can see that highlight and lighted band of where everyone else has put their liquidity and that's also where you have put your liquidity and that dash line is inside of that band and so using these parameters that we have put in we have a price assumption of four 2 490 this website defaults to the current eth price and then we've also selected a band of between 2 300 and 2 500 with an investment of 1 000 we are making roughly 10 every 24 hours while ether is inside of this band and so annualized that is 336 annualized and so if ether spends its entire uh one year time between these two prices 2 300 to 2 500 1 000 will net you 360 percent over one year uh and that's just the takeaway here like i don't expect ether to stay within this band for the whole entire time that would be like as an lp that would be just like a complete w like massive win for you unlikely um but this is just a very fun website to tinker with unit swap lp positions and really just get a grip on what it means to lp and uniswap v3 and so if you are still trying to wrap your head around uniform v3 i would recommend just come to this website and just play around it's good practice it's good modeling it gets it's a good way to comprehend what's going on here totally uh it has the other pairs too so if the impermanent loss usdc to eth kind of scares you or is this another factor to consider do something like die to usdc right with a five percent and see what your thousand dollars would do there with a band um yeah i i'm not sure i fully understood kind of how to how to model this and how to enter into uniswap positions before this this website and this tool so super handy guys definitely check that out david let's talk about another automated market maker with release this week this is curve finance so they just put together a volatility algorithm and they deployed on both ethereum and polygon interestingly enough what is going on here yeah so this is curves response to unit swap v3 uh and so from this if you go into the white paper the white paper is like only like three pages long but it's got some like crazy math algorithms in it that make my head explode but what i've tried to gather is that this is uh the a similar thing to concentrated liquidity and unit swap but with curve it's a variable curve according to an algorithm uh and so curve curve is stepping into the concentrated liquidity game with their own specific um with their own specific strategies uh and kind of the the tl dr i've got is that this is really good when prices range but uh this curve is not less optimized for price discovery that's like the tl dr that i heard however that's also the same tl dr as unispot v3 and concentrated liquidity at large uh and so basically with the the tl dr here is that you know there are multiple strategies to try and create concentrated liquidity and when everyone understood and got it got their heads wrapped around unit swap v3 they were like oh it's the curve killer well you know don't discount he's adapting don't discount defy innovation right like curves got it yeah got some cards up its sleeve this is why i go back to robot wars david like you know the unit swap robot just added a buzz saw and now curve is getting its own buzz sauce as you can tell like i love it battle box battle yeah it's like that's what's happening in real time here and again what do we get out of it more efficient uh capital markets like and this is what we always say it's like this ecosystem in d5 is so darwinian it's so brutal crucible from a liquidity perspective it's a crucible right and it's all adapting and evolving these organisms exist in a different planet versus traditional finance but once these two civilizations meet oh my god we have these highly adapted like robot organisms meeting traditional finance and the old traditional finance civilization does not have a chance against these sci-fi weapons um and that's what's being built here dude battlebots that's such a great meme it is bad a lot all right let's talk polygon so polygon is is kind of cool i think because it shows it's it's almost like a a cookie cutter of what we think is going to play out with all of these other layer twos like arbitrary and optimism and you can kind of see how it's evolving how all of the d5 tools are being added so what's this first one what's polyscan david yeah polyscan is just the polygon version of etherscan everyone loves ether scan it's god it's it's straight up god's gift to the earth so yeah polyscan.com if you want a ether scan fork i guess of for polygon and so if you've been having trouble like interpreting your transactions with the uh polygon block explorer uh now there's something much more similar to paul uh ether scan but wait is this from the ether scan people uh it's i mean it looks like it i do i don't like i mean we also had binance smart chain scan right and and i'm definitely that was definitely like made by um yeah finance binance uh so i actually don't know um either way very happy about it except for the fact that they didn't call it polyscan paulie scans better than polygon scan yeah poly scan come on guys mr t they probably couldn't get the dot com that's why um let's talk about this another polygon ecosystem thing hop protocol uh has deployed well they already were deployed on polygon but what's this polygon to ethereum withdrawal in a minute and 30 seconds instead of three hours so this is a different bridge we're talking the arbitrary guys about all of the different bridges to side chains and layer twos and that sort of thing this is kind of a hop is providing an alternate way to access polygon it's faster yeah so this is all about lping on both sides of the l2 right if it takes you maybe sometimes as much as an hour or even longer to get off of polygon getting onto polygons pretty quick it takes about 10 minutes um but hop protocol is boasting 1.5 minute transfer times and the re the way that they do that is they have lps liquidity providers providing you the assets that you have and the assets that you want on both sides of the chain uh and so you basically sell your assets to the hop el pier on the ethers on the ethereum side and then the uh poly the hop protocol lpr sells you the same assets on the polygon side minus a small fee not only that not only is it an l2 l1 you know ramp but it's also l2 to l2 right so polygon to arbitrarily arbitrary to optimism optimism to polygon uh and uh and this is kind of where a lot of like the user ux issues gets really it gets solved by kind of like this mesh network of you know l2s to l1s to other l2s fun fact uh connects is also uh tinkering in this space with their their payment channels and they set up a bridge and they just take a toll on that bridge so there's a small cost not too bad here it looks like um uh you know for fifty dollars about 50 cents in transaction fees so not bad not too bad and hopefully it gets more competitive another bridge that's being built to polygon which again we expect to play out in layer two uh summer to all of the other layer twos um is chain is exchanges rather crypto banks providing a fiat on-ramp another bridge a fiat ramp directly into these ecosystems this is okay x a decent decent sized exchange not a nobody has introduced a way to deposit assets directly from their centralized exchange to polygon you could withdraw 23 assets uh no wait time so that's super cool not just stable coins but 23 assets and this is awesome for a number of reasons this just goes to illustrate that you are probably moving everyone listening probably is moving to an l2 we're all packing our bags we're moving out of manhattan it's too it's too congested we're moving to an l2 and some people aren't even starting in manhattan they're coming and living in the manhattan suburb which is an l2 from the get-go right and so ok x is building a highway straight to a suburb on ethereum an l2 and you don't even have to go through manhattan to do it uh and i i think okay x is doing a great job pioneering this uh other exchanges let's get this ball rolling come on guys like people want to be on in the suburbs suburbs are hot right now uh i think they're absolutely going to david only a matter of time i like with all this layer two stuff going on i find it i don't care what what's happening with price i find it so difficult to be bearish right by the way we've got a layer two we've got eip 1559 we've got um eat staking in full effect in the merge so hard to be bearish that's exactly right let's talk about matcha we're not even done we're not even done talking about l2s macho users can now trade tokens on polygon i use matcha as like kind of my main exchange of choice i agree with the theory as an aggregator great uh uses the 0x protocol and now it's on matcha oh excuse me now it's on polygon uh and so you know an app now also moving to polygon specifically a zero zero x app uh and so this is the the zero x if you i guess you can call it a dao uh is now also on polygon yeah super cool so once again guys we've got a block explorer we've got chain to chain bridges uh we've got fiat to layer two and side chain bridges and we've got aggregators all active inside of networks and what's going to happen is the same thing that just happened with the polygon as this ecosystem is building and thriving that's going to play out in these other layer twos as well that's what's so exciting we're gonna have a lot of additional real estate for ethereum transactions and macho wasn't even the first aggregator on polygon slingshot was dude it's it's all happening so fast all right let's get to the news david we got to start with the big news item which is we talked about in the markets el salvador el salvador is recognizing and this largest past um through their legislative system recognizing bitcoin as legal tender inside of their country here's the actual law that i've got pulled up this is a translation into english uh what's happening here is this a big deal so a quick history lesson of el salvador el salvador had its own money from 1892 all the way to 2001 and then it decided to dollarize and it accepted the us dollar as the native currency of el salvador and now el salvador is also adding bitcoin as the native currency of el salvador the officially accepted legal tender uh and so that means that bitco businesses have to accept bitcoin as a currency in el salvador and uh for for businesses that don't necessarily want to accept bitcoin uh and and kind of just want dollars uh el salvador claims that they are offering just like kind of instant swap feature using the lightning network uh and so the merchants are paid with the lightning network and then it goes to an automatic dollar exchange that is government run uh and and so like there's a this is a huge win for bitcoiners uh nick carter called this using bitcoin in its intended way uh and bitcoiners are just up in arms about this they are so incredibly stoked it's extreme validation a whole entire country has bitcoin as its native currency with lightning network adoption uh and so i think this is going to be the time where like bitcoin makes or breaks it right like does bitcoin work as a native currency for an entire country can it execute on that will that work and we're about to find out yeah i think there's a lot of takes here so like i um i'm bullish on this but i also have some reservations i would say but like even with the reservations i think no one c how no matter how you feel about this no one can discount the fact that this is an absolutely historical moment like if we're talking about the the history of monies every historical timeline in the textbooks is going to include june 2021 the date that the first country recognized a cryptocurrency as legal tender so whatever you think about this uh whether you think like well maybe this is kind of coercive or whether you're super bullish and excited and this is bitcoin's intended purpose you have to recognize that this is legitimacy of cryptocurrency on the world stage at a whole other level i know el salvador is a small country but this could also be a leader for central american countries um you know mexico is talking about incorporating this um you know they're brazil even there's rumors like central america south american countries might follow their lead and for a country to stand up and uh say this and a major politician to get behind it i think it's pretty historic um look can we talk a little bit about more about this like so um what what is actually happening here caitlyn long had sort of a thread of what what this would mean if el salvador adopts bitcoin as legal tender and she said this is a this is a really big deal for a few reasons um one is it would make bitcoin likely get a status as money so treat it on par with foreign currency by banks and i'm not sure if this extends into sort of international recognition david um but she said it could possibly get cash accounting treatment under and she names a treaty that i don't know much about um but i think this kind of enters bitcoin into the world stage cryptocurrency discussion that's one of the reasons bitcoiners are excited about it what are some other reasons here yeah so having bitcoin as a currency status a legal tender what that does for people living in el salvador you don't have to pay capital gains tax on your bitcoin because it's money it's like it's like no one pays capital gains tax on the dollar because the dollar's money inside you know we're heroes or euros right yeah you don't pay capital gains on money that's nonsensical all of a sudden bitcoin gets that same treatment inside of el salvador and so el salvadorian citizens if bitcoin goes to three hundred hundred thousand dollars then they don't pay any taxes on that uh as a capital gains and so that's really attractive to a lot of bitcoiners um the el salvadorian president said you know no capital gains tax on bitcoiners permanent residence for crypto entrepreneurs and so this is also a strategy to attract bitcoiners uh and a lot of bitcoiners have max keiser uh who's that crazy bitcoiner that was like you know we're not selling f elon musk that guy uh purchased uh purchased real estate in el salvador it turns out that was actually a mistake he got the address wrong and it was actually in a different country but that's just that's a separate that's a separate story yeah he really effed that one up but the point is is that bitcoiners are now interested in moving to el salvador as like a safe haven for their bitcoin uh and p and bitcoiners who tend to hold bitcoin and hold it for the long term probably have a lot of capital gains tax that they probably want to not have to worry about in the future and so it's really enticing to go live in a place that accepts bitcoin as currency and so there's a big like push in the same way that like malta and gibraltar and all these other like you know singapore all these other crypto safe havens like salvador's raising their hands like yo crypto safe haven over here yeah i think like the big win for bitcoin is is legitimacy because this it's not the case that el salvador has um launched a plan to purchase a massive amount of bitcoin for its central bank reserves right correct like they haven't done that at this point in time right it's really just saying like hey we've got the dollar and now we also have bitcoin as as legal tender the language though of legal tender is somewhat interesting david because this goes to into kind of maybe some of the pushback here right from the crypto community um and i think it's which number is it here that i think i think number seven is the one you want number seven article seven so article seven in the actual bitcoin law that would go into effect this is a translation from spanish every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whomever acquires a good or a service right so this is sort of coercion by the state well that's like what this is a normal legal tender law this is which is coercioned by the state right which is coercion by the state right uh and you have to you have no choice right uh and and you know uh the president of el salvador has bitcoin laser eyes and if you listen to we we have to talk about the twitter spaces that happened um but the guy's a straight-up bitcoiner right he's a straight-up bitcoiner he looks like a bitcoin bro i mean he quacks like a bitcoin or walks like a bitcoin uh and and like the the bearish take the critical take is that this is a bitcoiner who happens to also be the president of el salvador who's imposing bitcoin upon an entire country to pump his own bags maybe yeah well that's that's the critical take that's the critical take uh and you know bitcoiners are very happy about this about you know legal tender laws of a nation state to me if in ethereum and tokens on ethereum it's about maximizing choice and yeah citizens of el salvador now have a choice between the us dollar and bitcoin so they get one more choice but still it's not in the complete ethos of cryptocurrency congrats like i i was listening to um a guy's guys take which is the bitcoin audible uh podcast and he's reading an article and he goes and the first like literally the first 15 to 30 seconds of the articles all about how nation states impose their fiat currencies on you and that's evil and now we're doing it but now we're doing it with bitcoin and now it's okay because it's bitcoin because it pumps our bags well and and to be fair not all bitcoiners are are pro this particular article in the laws like so eric voorhees has spoken up against it like hey this is not the values of bitcoin this is not um the values of opt-in anti-coercion this is not why we're here um but overall i'd say the bitcoin community is is pretty excited about it and i actually don't know much about the um el salvador as president um it seems like he is definitely a populist uh some might call him massive support but some might call him like veering the direction of sort of populist authoritarian as well um which is like i don't know i mean is that what we want for bitcoin adoption yet this is very much the formula from the bitcoin standard like if you read that book david and i know you have uh safideen a moose is just like this is kind of what bitcoiners want to happen in order to get to a state of hyper bitcoinization and i think that they would argue that um hey at least if if you have two choices in el salvador for your people you've got the dollar which can be inflated by basically elite baby boomers in the u.s at a whim money printed and then you've got bitcoin which is resistant to that level of inflation then it's better for bitcoin to be sort of the standard in that country and that is a uh that leads to a better more free world i'm not sure i'm i'm sold on that vision though i've got to say and then there's also like the implementation of it which um you talked about like lightning network uh wow lightning networks just hasn't worked like largely it's adoption has and state channels haven't worked in ethereum to be fair it's the same tech and so that's going to be a test and part of me wonders it's just like you know if you wanted if you wanted to give the el salvadorian people a financial system in a box why not just do stable coins us dollars are already part of your legal tender laws why not just do like roll up or sidechain with us dollar stable coins and give everyone access to that you could totally bypass and like upgrade your banking system uh just like just like that but no it's bitcoin instead well it'll be an interesting exploration as to whether like hey what about wbtc on an arbitrary rollup right like is that bitcoin like it is right i think it's bitcoin uh you know count it like why wouldn't we count that uh and so maybe that is if if that conversation happens i will be tuning into that i do want to cross across some t's and dot some eyes ryan if you go to the next page um just to just be accurate reporters uh let's see are we reporters right now we are yeah article 12 those who by evident and notorious fact do not have access to the technologies that allow them to carry out transactions in bitcoin are excluded from the obligation expressed in article 7 right so if you are an individual in el salvador and you don't have the means to accept bitcoin you don't you aren't forced to accept bitcoin so that's a nice clause if i was just super nitpicky i would say like don't write a coercion law and then write a an exception just don't write the coercion law yeah in the first place in the first place but again the argument is that's what legal tender laws are that's what yeah what else is awesome yeah also that's also true uh going to put out a press release that just says hey please everyone adopt bitcoin no they're gonna be like hey this is now legal tender and you you have to if you can there's a an article that is called uh i'm not gonna i'm gonna butcher his name but nieb buckley's power grab in el salvador if you look into the history of this man he's not necessarily the best representative of a leader um picture doesn't look great yeah that yeah right uh and so apparently he is there so you readers need to fact-check me on this but uh um he there was a bill that was going through congress and and it was he he wanted it and it was losing and he threw in the military and forced congress to vote for this bill um i'm i'm just coming to like get into what el salvador history is um i think we should be uh cautious and we should all as a community and as an industry research who this person is and that's that's basically me telling me this because i need to read more to fully understand this i just want people to kind of pump the breaks before we pull put our full weight in steam behind el salvador well this is this is the thing david it's just like this is where i get a little um worried i i would say about where we're going with things is is it the case sometimes it feels the case that the crypto community and i'll narrow in on the bitcoin community for a minute uh they're happy to accept anybody that pumps their bags and gets them to the end state of hyper bitcoinization right so like part of me wonders if like despots like king kim jong-un adopted bitcoin if they like wouldn't be celebrating that or factions wouldn't be celebrating that right like um i think that there are principles that are and values that are much deeper right and this this goes back to maybe the our next conversation about the bitcoin conference and kind of your experience there and what you saw there but there were panels um about toxic bitcoin maximalism and how it's good the argument was it was good there was a the clip that i saw where somebody said if you're against toxic bitcoin maximalism you're against freedom followed by cheers from them so first if you're against toxic maximalism you're against bitcoin and if you're against bitcoin therefore you're against freedom ah it's that link it's that bridge right mm-hmm so so this is what um bitcoin is fundamentally good and it doesn't matter who accepts it because the means to an end it's so incredibly good that it doesn't matter how it gets adopted see that that is so concerning to me right because like there's another layer beneath bitcoin which is the values layer right and that is the thing that if you're going to be maximalist about something you should be maximalist about values that you really care about to the extent they're instantiated in bitcoin okay but to the extent that they're not don't be a bitcoin supporter right isn't that why we're here um i feel like there's some loss of plot going on here now i'm not saying again this is like this is good news for crypto legitimacy it's absolutely historic but this is also the reason right personally i feel uh cautious and not super excited i'm not completely ready to throw my weight behind this again i think the legacy of this story will be a massive acid test for bitcoin is the lightning network real can it be used is do people of a third world country actually want bitcoin we're about to get some really important answers to really important questions there was a um wasn't there like um a meeting a chat where was the chat with like the actual president of el salvador on twitter yeah it was on twitter spaces yeah so nick carter just spun up at twitter spaces as he does normal normal times and the el salvadorian president showed up the guy promoting this bill the guy with the bitcoin laser eyes and so the other the other through line here this is such this the story has so many layers is ultimately uh it got out that the el salvadorian president was in there and he was in there because he was in congress at the time that the bill was being voted on and when it came time for the bill to get it was approved almost overwhelmingly i i don't know the numbers but it was like three or four to one yeses versus knows and he put the he put his micro his phone up to the audience applause of the applause of the bill getting passed which is really cool and you know how many on twitter spaces on twitter spaces and you know how many people were in twitter spaces at the at the peak over 20 000 and and uh nlw had a really good take about this is that this is the this this event this monumental event was broadcasted on twitter spaces directly i was listening in on this i was there i was i was part of the 20 000 people listening to history and the reporters that were also in there reported on it the next day but the people that were already in twitter spaces they already knew everything that the reporters were reporting on because they were there it's a huge democratizing like news event because it happened in twitter spaces well that's cool like okay so another layer to that though which is interesting is like um there's no there's no nation-state diplomats that are negotiating this right so like you'd expect the dollarization of el salvador it might have representatives from the us that are cheering this on or negotiating with el salvador and and its government but here you've got like bitcoin or twitter influencers who are are almost like the ambassadors right bitcoin interacting with the leader of a nation state that's bizarre and wild too and there's so many more things to talk about right uh you know anthony pompliano reached out and when he had his time in the twitter space and said hey mr el salvadorian president how can the bitcoin community help you all right like how can we help you we want to help you obviously bitcoiners want to help you and the the the other topic of conversation is volcano mining inside of el salvador they have a volcano that spits out heat and so they use that for steam energy uh and so now we can uh you can press command minus a few times ryan i think that will help scale out that video um yeah there you go um and so el salvador could potentially mine bitcoin with free energy from from the volcano mine which is really going to the conversation of like not only is bitcoin green but it actually allows for more energy extraction this is exactly the bitcoiner narrative that they've been talking about david i feel like i want to let this one settle before i uh figure out how i feel about it but we're going to have nick carter on state of the nation next tuesday and get a digest from him and i think that's going to be a really interesting conversation so that's next tuesday i think right is it regular state of the nation 11 am pst 2 pm est we're going to live stream that so if you're interested in this story and nick's take who's been on the ground from day one he started the twitter space he started the twitter space the big corners take on this and probably the bullish case for this then listen into that conversation too wow a lot but look el salvador is huge news it's historic guys this is this is bitcoin's biggest opportunity ever and if it doesn't it up a lot of sorry sorry for that uh if it doesn't eff it up uh it could this could be the moment where bitcoin really breaks out and fulfills what bitcoiners like illustrate as its manifest destiny absolutely all right in other news back to nfts no nfts nfts are coming to ave this is kind of cool this is from mediversal william piester from mediversal this week um all eyes on ave why because stani said this nft as collateral is coming to ave why is this super important i think it's less important for sort of the the beeple art and more important because every unit swap pool that we were talking about david not actually an erc20 right it's an nft and the reason for that is these pools can be kind of unique and these pools can be sort of different so if you're going to make that nft and those liquidity pools composable and super fluid as we did previously new swap v2 you have to have in your protocol some support for nfts as collateral looks like ave is working on that right now it's coming stani didn't mention a date didn't mention the how to but like this team delivers so it's coming i do want to nitpick here about that uh stani tweet that we see on screen where he says nfts collateral coming to ave if you read that you're thinking like wearable art or super rare art not uniswap nfcs because uniswap nfts are actually just a rapper around erc20 tokens like ether or w ether and like die and stuff like that but it's also infrastructure for future nfts these are the low hanging fruit nfts the safe nfts but once you get these nfts in there uh we can now start to talk about like more complex more like illiquid nfts yeah and everyone's hungry for those uniswap uh lp nfts for sure um all right well let's talk about another story which is just a weird like strange story kind of bitcoin related certainly crypto related and also regulatory related and that is the ransomware attacks now the media's been calling these bitcoin ransomware attacks um but like the only reason they're calling them bitcoin ransomware attacks is because the attackers are asking for bitcoin as payment so it's kind of fair but it does put bitcoin in a very negative light from a media perspective and i think there's probably two that we should talk about like the first was the big pipeline hack that happened this affected a lot of people on the east coast so um you know i like i know people on the east coast like locally for me i couldn't actually get gas for a few days david like the crypt you're telling me that the crypto world impacted your real world life well kind of i mean the hackers they hacked the pipeline right and they were like i guess if somebody paid them in bitcoin earlier then i could have gasoline quicker i'm not sure how like but maybe it affected my real like so anyway this was a big thing a big event that happened uh in the u.s and apparently the fbi has recovered some of that bitcoin um as of this week from the hack so the the the um the pipeline people actually paid the hackers the hackers received the bitcoin then they exited the system the pipeline was restored and now the fbi has somehow tracked down the bitcoin has actually gotten the proceeds of the payment back how did they do that what's the story here yeah so the tl dr that i've heard and i didn't look too close into the story is that the hackers were competent hackers but were bitcoin novices and apparently they just used an exchange address to put their bitcoins in and so the exchange was like oh thank you we're gonna confiscate these they they forgot about the whole not your keys not your crypto thing so weird though right so like the the the other i guess weird part of the story is how can uh ransomware hackers be so competent like hacking into a major us pipeline yet forget about their private keys and give that to a third-party custodian oops whoopsie like does it seem weird to you it does seem weird to me it does seem weird it does seem weird this is one of those stories that's really complex and i'm just gonna wait for like the truth to come out over time me too but the conspiracy theory is that well maybe some of this was done to make cryptocurrency look bad question mark the us would never do such a thing we don't do like behind the scenes psyops like this no the ca cia super clean agency meat company was uh hacked yeah bitcoin ransomware attack i don't know much about this story but this was last week too um they paid 11 million dollars in bitcoin to get them to exit their system jbs holdings meat company basically the tl dr is that there's been two bitcoin ransomware attacks in the last two weeks and that's bad in of itself um and the attackers are actually getting away with it they're being sent bitcoin and it's a pr disaster for bitcoin it is and we'll get to that in our time and our industry not just bitcoin our entire industry another week another week that microstrategy michael saylor is buying bitcoin this is this one's a special week though this one's a special okay why six four numbers 500 million dollar junk bond offering not just dollar cost averaging into bitcoin a big buy uh and so uh apparently i'm confused on the numbers but uh microstrategy has reportedly attracted more than 1.6 billion dollars worth of orders for its latest deal to purchase bitcoin uh but then in the firm you know upped the raise from their 400 million advertisement in the initial like you know seeking of investment up to 500 million i'm not sure which is the right number anyways microstrategy again doing a bond offering to buy bitcoin but microstrategy michael saylor is just taking every bond it can get and plugging that into bitcoin purchases which really goes to uh ray dalio's conversation is like why are people buying bonds instead of bitcoin why are they going through a microstrategy to do that there is an answer to this question and i got that answer from listening to the castle island podcast a couple of months ago and so that answer is out there apparently it's complex and i'm not prepared to say why all right michael sailor buying bitcoin is the headline though um we talked a little bit about the 2020 bitcoin conference that you're at uh david anything to add on that yeah uh it was the world's biggest event since the super bowl which is crazy largely because coveted you know killed all the events 12 000 people went to the bitcoin 2021 conference 30 000 people went to miami and this was very much like a tale of two communities because if you were a bitcoiner and you went to the bitcoin conference you were like immensely satisfied with what happened right like it was a straight up like first and foremost we call it a conference no it's a festival it's a festival of bitcoin culture like burning man ish a little bit right like um i mean there were talks in the end panels and stuff like that very conferency but like it was more of a festival it was a celebration of bitcoin as a celebration of bitcoin culture the bitcoin art there was awesome i saw it myself i was there it's my favorite part about the bitcoin conference the bitcoin art is deep it has layers it's complex uh and so like i don't want to uh you know we're kind of known in the in the world in the banquets world that's kind of waiting towards ethereum but bitcoin art is winning hands down like it's it's complex it's nuanced it's delicate oh my god it's so cool um and and all the bitcoiners were very happy with what happened at the conference now the ethereum people saw the same thing the same reality and came up with a different story they saw toxic maximalism they saw you know bag you know just pumping the bitcoin bags uh you know and and you know anthony suzanne was tweeting out the real winner of bitcoin 2021 was ethereum all the ethereum people agreed with it it's interesting to see this one this uh one shared reality having two completely different interpretations by like the depending on what community you're in yeah and i really enjoyed your opening note david this week on on bank list on monday which kind of went through your on-the-ground experience with it um yeah just super interesting i guess you know ethereum conferences i feel so much different or look so much different and like maybe part of this is the difference between like ethereum conferences are much more geeky and technical and like building focus there is some culture but it's like not as much and i wonder some of the differences it's a project that's still building versus a like what really do you talk about bitcoin from a technical perspective like taproot and lightning right but like the project's mostly done so but with ethereum you're talking about like roll-ups and sharding and like what's you know the next advance in cryptography and all of these things so i wonder if part of this is the uh the life cycle of the project it's just after a project has ossified maybe it just turns into like a uh a festival type of environment and cultural type environment rather than a builder's environment so i went to the the section of uh the bitcoin conference that had all like the booths right like you know conferences they sell booths to vendors and all the vendors are like custodial wallets bitcoin banks you know uh just all all the things that like are centralized and just don't really intrinsically interest interest me so i was walking around like oh yeah you're you're a centralized exchange you're a centralized custodial wallet you know blah blah blah blah and like where like for me i just felt like where where are the where are the defy app guys where's the d5 where's sushi swap where's the unicorn like the the culture's just extremely different um but at the end of the day uh 12 000 bitcoiners went to the bitcoin conference biggest event in the world in the last year since the super bowl uh and like the other takeaway is that now that kovid's over uh people want to have fun people want to have fun especially since asset prices like pumped uh yeah and bitcoiners also the other takeaway is that bitcoiners are also like very very like anti-covered as in like they're just ready to shed the whole covid laws uh and so it's it's no surprise that bitcoin had the first big event uh in the world since the start lockdown of kovid uh uh christian corollas my pov crypto podcast co-host says bitcoiners are on the forefront of freedom and you gotta hand it to them if you are frustrated by covid laws the bitcoin community was the first one to put their foot down and saying we're having a 12 000 person event in miami and i i was there it felt like covid wasn't a thing uh and i have my vaccine so it's chill um but like very much felt like oh yeah i completely forgot about covet and now that i've come back from that and i'm in seattle i'm like still in that mindset it's like i've got my vaccine two weeks out like why are we still doing this mask thing granted i'm gonna be patient wear my mask when i'm asked but still that's my other take well there's there's some culture clash here and i think that uh maybe comes in with what's going on in regulatory which we should talk about so um this is a super interesting clip this is just from i guess wednesday and i think i want to play this so this is senator elizabeth warren who um i i think is obviously red for president is is kind of a big deal in the democratic party and i want to play what she says she's she's commenting on bitcoin here it's about we've talked a lot today about the dangers that cryptocurrencies pose to our economy we've talked about the rip-offs the instability the extent to which they're used to help criminals with cyber attacks like the attack on colonial pipeline and jbs but there's another piece too the adverse environmental impacts of the computing activity used to mint many of these digital currencies in the first place i'm going to pause it there david but she she goes on so you heard about that so she mentioned that like the volatility she mentioned the hacks she mentioned the scam she mentioned uh ransomware and she also mentioned the the energy issue with bitcoin the rest of this clip is all about the energy issue energy consumption issue with bitcoin um this is the first time i've seen a high-profile senator go on the offensive in this way against cryptocurrency now it is i think mostly constrained to environmentally wasteful cryptocurrencies but i mean bitcoin and proof of work and ethereum is still on proof of work that is the bulk of the money layer of this of this industry right now so this is almost all active cryptocurrencies and there wasn't a lot of nuance when i went through the rest of this video like there wasn't a lot of like yes there's volatility yes there are rug pulls and scams yes there are you know crazy prices but like let's talk about the freedom this brings to a population let's talk about decentralized finance let's say one good thing elizabeth say one good thing one good thing right but it wasn't so what's interesting here is kind of the observation that um you have a large group that is both on the right and the left in um in the us i think that are kind of the the group that wants uh more authority more control more governmental control over crypto in general and this spans both sides of the aisle i think then you also have a group that is um kind of demonizing the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies right now and i'm somewhat worried david that these two groups come together create a wedge issue out of this thing form a coalition and like start to attack the industry right we've always talked about the final boss it's always been out on the horizon now we've got a country adopting cryptocurrency are things about to go a little faster from here on out what are your thoughts yeah i'm really worried about like the woke cancel culture coming after crypto right uh because they'll go the whole theory about cancel culture is they'll try and cancel anything for clout uh and there's always kind of this like jostling for for clout and it's like all right who can cancel what and for what reasons and if you can justify your cancellation of something uh then you get clout and world culture and cancel culture and so like oh yeah environmentally wasteful uh nfts are you know they their nfts are killing the environment right like they consume all this consumption bitcoin is killing the environment uh the thing is like elizabeth warren got all of it wrong like i'm not and i'm not saying that bitcoin isn't wasteful but she was saying that one bitcoin transaction uses as much energy as 54 house or one household uses in 54 days which is just absolutely the wrong way to think about it yes you can you can critique bitcoin on its energy consumption but it's not on a per transactional basis so you're just showing that you don't know what you're talking about nick carter had a really good tweet where he just went through all of the things that elizabeth warren was just criticizing right he called it knives out knives out right yeah bitcoin energy use is a disaster for our planet bitcoin is disproportionately used for illicit purposes even though we know that that is absolutely not true i'm pretty sure it's less than one percent uh bitcoin is unproductive and has no utility the only people that think that bitcoin is unproductive and has no utility are people that don't like bitcoin like if you if you like bitcoin then you think it has productivity and utility and like this is my problem with i like elizabeth ward she's generally a good senator i'm a left-leaning individual uh this is an example of why bitcoiners and libertarians that large get pissed off by governments because they're coming into this industry without any knowledge about it and saying what this industry needs to do yeah from their like bird's eye like you know throne room because david i think that they're not looking to actually understand the industry they're looking for like you called it clout but like they're political wins is what they're looking for and the commentary they had a common uh i can't remember the individual's name but he was like yeah you know what would be great is if we um we ban with other world countries and we we make bitcoin to fiat transactions illegal just like across the board and that way all the people who are doing illegal activity have no way to convert it to dollars like just the assumption that everyone who holds bitcoin or cryptocurrency is doing illegal activity and like in that video too elizabeth warren pitched it as like uh legislation against energy consuming cryptocurrencies is a way we can have a win for the green gotta protect the children but we have a win for the green agenda but she said it costs us nothing why it's because it's a whole bunch of criminals using right in this industry yep it's it you know it's like it's like they see it as a win for green and political clout and agenda right and there's no cost to it because it's not affecting any of their constitu like any of the the interest groups or constituents that they care about right right yeah and again like we could play this same clip it could be a different issue and it could come from the internet like yeah exactly terrorist financing like it could come from another place um but what's interesting i think is is following the uninformed takes on crypto and i i tweeted this out yesterday david i was like is there just one individual in the house uh in in either you know the senate or the house one representative who has ever used d5 like can we just find one right i'm going to talk to that person closest person is andrew yang oh he's not and he's what is he uh running for mayor of new york running for mayor but also also previously ran for president so a little bit worried david in the short run krypto doesn't have a lot of allies um we'll have to see how this plays out i forget andrew yang on the podcast we're going to make him make a transaction on you swap it has to be something he has to buy something worthwhile though maybe something stupid if andrew yang if you're listening to this yeah all right knives out we'll see what happens not great news how about oh my god okay irs seeks millions in fresh funding to expand crypto tax informant enforcement and hire outside experts the irs knows that there is an absolute mountain of money waiting for them uh if uh in in the crypto world like capital gains tax uh especially in the in the short term all in crypto and so irs irs is making some moves to make sure that they get their paycheck oh the next one cft commissioner criticizes defined decries lack of intermediaries the last cftc commissioner was our friend this one may not be such a crypto advocate so we'll see what happens there consumer u.s inflation rates hits 5 for the last 12 months 5 percent inflation for the last 12 months ending in may which is a high number meanwhile amazon doing okay and they are looking for defy experience in job postings for a head of blockchain big tech entering blockchain entering cryptos probably a theme blockfy raising 500 million dollars in a series e funding round at a prevaluation free money valuation of 4.75 billion dollars that's a big number crypto banks crypto banks crushing it uh as is ledger the hardware wallet they landed an additional 380 million in a series c round so lana labs raises 314 million in a new funding round led by a16z and polychain capital so long has gotten some attention lately decent a decent amount of attention it definitely has a decent treasury as well so if you can buy your way into legitimacy uh solana is definitely able to do that with its treasury i think buying your way into legitimacy's an oxymoron uh didn't work for eos we'll see um coinbase partnering with a 401k advisor to off offer crypto investments for retirement accounts this is a much needed gap um you could do this with a self-directed ira 401k we've talked about this on bankless coinbase looks like they're trying to come up with the easy button probably a good move that is it for our news we're going to get to the sponsors and we'll be back with some takes synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right guys we are back with some hot takes then we're going to get to the meme of the week the first one is from joe weisenthal this is based on an article and you really enjoyed this article what's joe saying in this tweet and in the article david yeah the article is titled there's a hot new vision for crypto and it's wildly different than bitcoin uh joe weisenthal host of odd lots podcast very popular podcast in the in the trad five space uh and he's also on tv all the time uh amber sorry bloomberg bloomberg yes yeah importantly bloomberg yeah not just tv um but uh this this article is all about defy uh joel weisenthal playing around in defy and accurately i think reporting on what makes defy cool unique and special and importantly different from bitcoin and so i i wouldn't really just want to reread the headline because it's really important there's a hot new vision for crypto and it's wildly different than bitcoin from bitcoin right and this is kind of what the hammer we've been trying to be on bank list is that defy a decentralized app player is a brand new banking layer and does all the cool new things that bitcoin doesn't really get to talk about or do uh and joe eisenhower reporting on this a very like prominent thought leader on bloomberg with his own podcast writing a very very in-depth article talking positively about defy he said it's why and why it's time to stop talking about this space as a monolith i'm glad he said that too and he he's used terms in his tweets before like um traditional finance being eth-pilled which is super interesting i think what he's talking about is uh mainstreaming defy to traditional finance and uh if you uh have been paying attention to joe weisenthal on twitter like he's been engaging with defy folks talking to hayden adams talking to defy dad i've had some back and forth messages with him um i requested him to come on the podcast and he punted uh but he also said he was interested so he maybe he said maybe later yeah very cool um this is another take this one from me i'll just read it it's easier for a 14 year old to learn metamask than it is to open up a bank account gen z will be the bankless generation this really just hit me it's kind of i guess a shower thought but i was just thinking about um like kids young kids and like their adoption of crypto i mean they've grown up in this digital world and if you're talking to someone who's like 18 or under um metamask is so much more i guess intuitive to them versus going to a bank branch presenting your information and registering to get a bank account and i think this is really going to be the case is like bank accounts become obsolete for these newer genera uh you know digital generations right it's like yeah but if i open up a bank account can i put my game items in them right like can i put my loot in it like well okay can i put this awesome art right like all of the the clout the nft clout no i can't put that in the bank account like most of their value is going to be external to the traditional financial system and things like metamask are just going to be super intuitive to them so uh yeah i do think like at some level um millennials gen gen x and others were like we're kind of building this system but sometimes we're gonna pass the torch and gen z is just gonna it's gonna be party time they're gonna go wild with it they're gonna like finish the entire experiment and like be born into it in a way that i think the millennial generation was born into the internet so that was the take super excited about that that's a really good take worldwide too man i just realized like what does wells fargo do other than hold dollars for me can i even hold a different currency in there right i don't even know uh yeah i mean it's not doing anything for the bajillion currencies in my ethereum account it's not too much this is a really good take from brantley milligan of ens browning a while ago had this threat about one of the coolest things that crypto and ethereum has done is put a private key in the hands of so many people and so he follows up that thread with this thread where he goes the ethereum community has accidentally solved a major problem of the internet single sign-on quote sign on with ethereum quote is the future login for every app on the internet crypto related or not what he's saying is that instead of using your email and password you can use your private key to sign into a website because all website needs to do is to log who you are as a unique identifiable user and that is the purpose of a private key and so in the same way that like you sign a message to log into a defy app or you log into metamask with your ledger all you have to do is sign a message and to prove your that you have a specific public address and all of a sudden the website can log you as a unique identifiable user and you don't have to give up your email or your password or your date of birth or anything and so this has always been a terrible part of the the the web 2 world is you've got to use an email and an email is extremely identifiable private keys are a much better way to sign on to websites and again this is not even you not you are not broadcasting a transaction to ethereum this is just signing a message so it's using public private key cryptography as a tool that's independent from cryptocurrency or blockchains or whatever and and and think about like all of our password management tools like how many username and passwords do you have infinite like god it's just getting unmanageable i i might have hundreds at this point david like just like because you don't ever uh disconnect them either don't ever discontinue them so this is all of those compact into one login all right david you had a take here too i'm gonna read it out bitcoin is physical ethereum is digital bitcoin physical ethereum digital what do you mean by this yeah so this is uh something i've been chewing on for a while and definitely uh came about with this whole el salvadorian bitcoin is legal tender for a country uh conversation bitcoin has a strong interest in being very very instantiated in the physical world it loves sucking energy out of the world because it wants to be a part of the world itself it wants to be part of the physical world it needs physical energy to power this physical bitcoin proof of work mining operation it also wants to be the legal tender for physical meat space countries right bitcoin wants to be a part of the physical world and that's one of the big cultural divides between bitcoiners and ethereums bitcoiners celebrate a nation state and meet space nation state adopting bitcoin as a currency ethereum and aetherians we want everything to be digital proof of stake is the most digital form of security consensus we don't want ether to be the national currency for any country we want people to be able to choose their preferred digital token or ether as their as a result of their own choice and so to me like ethereum will never go after some sort of nation-state national currency it's the currency of the internet it's the currency of the digital world it allows the bankless nation to choose their own currency and maximizing choice and bitcoiners always talk about like freedom from oppression freedom from coercion we talked about this earlier in the conversation but to me the ethereum app player is the manifestation of the most choice possible and what defy is we talk about defy as a crucible of competition that is always best for the user and this online virtual uh network this this defined native this internet native network is the most f you know this motion digital money system possible and these differences in communities i think are really really interesting and and personally i think the digital world is going to 10x in growth than the physical world right we were talking to ryan you and i were having a private conversation with someone who said uh something on the lines of when they were an internet entrepreneur and they said in the in the 90s that the physical world is really really big and the internet world is really really small and so i want to be where people are going to flow too people are going to flow into the digital world and same thing with ethereum the digi the physical world's already really big and people are going to flow into digital assets and digital money and ethereum is the instantiation of digital first money yeah i i do think that's a good take i i think um could add to that like bitcoin is about the existing institutions right like that's what you mean by sort of physical whereas ethereum is more about building these new institutions i think that's another great way to look at it um totally yeah super cool david we got to get to this listener question um i'm just going to read it out so this is a comment on the debriefs that we do at the end of each of our podcasts for premium subscribers appreciate the debrief one thing my friend was telling me is that it could be a big sell-off when eat staking of 32 eth um people get all their eats back do you think that will be a thing or will most hold on since it's a triple point asset david what do you think about that yeah right so he he's asking amal i'm all fi 22. thanks for the question um he's saying that like uh when people started putting their money in their ether into the deposit contract ether was like four to seven hundred dollars now it's two thousand five hundred dollars and it's a one-way bridge it's a one-way bridge right like you're stuck there you're until until like the merge happens so he's asking here she is asking well when this merge happens and people get all their eighth back do you think there's going to be a big sell-off because all these people made all these gains and they haven't been able to sell because it's been locked and so the way proof of stake works is that people that are the most bullish on ether are always the first to stake people that are intrinsically long ether the asset always want to be staking so yes it's very plausible that people want to take some gains off the table you know make their make their personal lives for the better and for the people around them uh but also they're already the people that are the most bullish on ether the asset that's why they're staking and also when the merge does happen staking yields go from like ten eight to nine percent where it is right now and it goes up to 20 to 25 depending on gas fees because you get the transaction fees and the mev fees uh and so yields are actually going to go up when the merge happens and so we have the most bullish people who have staked all the eth and they're going to be able to get even more yields than they're already getting and so there's some definitely some very significant arguments as to why there will not be a big sell-off when the merge happens i think i pretty much buy those arguments i don't have anything to add um i think that's gonna how it's probably going to play out um guys if you have a question find a way to get it to us either twitter or on one of the bankless newsletters uh we will include some more of these in roll-ups moving forward david let's get to what we are excited about what are you excited about this week i'm really excited about this article that came out on the bankless newsletter by a brand new bank list contributor ben giov giov ben i don't know how to pronounce your last name sorry um and uh he's somebody i connected with because he's actually the president of chapman university crypto club which is my former college uh and he wrote this fantastic piece uh earlier about all about polygon it was great and so i challenged him to write uh do a write up on vitalik's proposal that the uni token becomes an oracle token in addition to being a governance token over the unisop exchange vitalik did this write up about how uni could be a token to make an offshore an off-chain price oracle for price fees into d5 and that resembles an entirely new value capture mechanism for the uni token if they if the unit swap governance decides to go down this path and so ben did a very fantastic job tackling a very hard subject and talked about how this uh what this oracle could do how it's different or the same versus train link how it helps uni capture value and what are the similarities and differences with other d5 protocols such as uma so ben excited to have you on the bankless writer squad nice job on the article ryan the other thing i'm excited about is the nick carter state of the nation we're going to ask all of the questions about el salvador and so bankless listeners if you want those questions let us know and then for the third thing ryan i'm triple dipping is tomorrow morning i pack up all my stuff and i leave to san diego gonna be a san diegan uh by this all right guys like okay so everyone say bye bye to david's background because it we will never see this again you should you should uh take a screenshot or something so we could do a green screen well it's very very different than what you're used to but uh you're here sad i think some of them have to stay i was sad to hear that but i think they're all coming but we'll we'll say stay tuned oh my god we're gonna look we're looking forward to seeing what you have set up in san diego man that's gonna be cool if you are our bankless dow member let's meet up in san diego ryan what are you excited about uh look man i guess it's all bankless content this week because i was super excited about this panel that we did on wednesday with three of the biggest like defy brains in the space i feel like one was vance spencer spencer noon and santiago santos and that panel is just super cool you guys should watch it from beginning to end but the last question really resonated with me and we actually didn't have that question on the notes in the agenda so you kind of like popped it up and and surprised me with it but it was like the question was how has defy changed your life and the answers that these panelists gave were super cool um i think one of them said first of all it's an unbelievable investment opportunity that i would have never had access to why because i'm not plugged into those vc circles kind of the silicon valley circles the wall street circles that you need to be and i kind of discovered this for myself but all of them were united in these two things too that's like number one the mission of d5 excited them creating a bankless money system for the world so it's great to see investors who are mission inspired they also reflected on what a privilege it is to work in d5 like d5 doesn't discriminate um santiago talked about hiring a 18 year old at and an 18 year old anon completely anonymous uh and it's because just this person was the best at what they did and again didn't care this person's age didn't care what degree this person had um i love this about d5 that is completely open accessible to the world if you have a hunger you are talented you want to learn this stuff you can get involved and you can rise pretty quickly so there's just so much opportunity at this early stage in the industry defies is such a cool mission and man this piece of content was was really awesome so check that out thankless youtube check it out on the podcast i think we called it the current state of defy a panel with those three gentlemen and the future of panels out of the bank list uh youtube is going to be hot we already are planning our next one yeah with uh cooper turley uh and uh it's gonna be all about the creator the creator economy uh and so stay tuned for that one uh i think that will come at the end of this month david it's time for meme of the week favorite time finally the whole point of the weekly roll up finally we're here what is this this is it looks like a tweet from james it's a real tweet from chase bank and it's a it's a hypothetical conversation between you and your bank account and you you say why is my balance so low and the bank account says make coffee at home bank account says eat the food that's already in the fridge bank account says you don't need a cab it's only three blocks you you say i guess will never know why my balance is so low and the bank account says seriously question mark monday motivation and then strong juxtaposition with another tweet from public citizen the whistleblower community the whistleblower organization says bank that pays its ceo 31 million dollars and received a 12 billion dollar bailout after crashing our economy tells poor people to stop being so irresponsible with their money but fu maybe i wanted to take a cab of three blocks maybe my foot hurt don't tell me what to do with my money stop bailing out banks with golden parachutes f yourself yeah i like what's the motivation after i read something like this like my motivation is to shut down my chase account yeah motivation yeah it's a motivation to go bankrupt absolutely that's the meme of the week guys we've got one more moment of zen so stay tuned for that it's been great to with be with you on the weekly roll ups thanks a lot hey what's up what's up what's up vic hey we
