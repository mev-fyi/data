[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we have the altcoin slayer on the show eric wall how was that conversation yeah this is the first time i've actually gotten able to talk to eric wall and he's somebody that's really helped me formulate mental models in this space and eric wall for those that don't know very very prominent in 2017-2018 as a guy that seemed to go against everyone's grain like not just one particulars community's grains but everyone's grain uh and so like while he's a big bitcoiner he's not afraid to tell bitcoiners when they're wrong and while he was never really uh conv convinced by the ethereum crowd he has as of late uh talked very positively about certain merits of ethereum's construction but then we'll also go ahead and say that the overall ethereum project is a complete mess so this guy thinks for himself and that's kind of why we got him on um not to go into depths about his mental models and the way that he thinks and his opinions about certain things but then also as an exploration into the way that he puts thoughts together inside of a space where so many people are telling you how and what to think eric wall thinks for himself this is bankless meets tribelis i really feel like eric wahl strives as much as possible not to affiliate himself with one particular pattern of thought or one particular tribe in fact i think early on he he very much associated himself at with uh as a bitcoiner like very much uh put the the mantle of that tribe on his shoulders and we we talked about almost his like ejection from the bitcoiner sphere by by the so-called high priest and what that what that felt like it was almost like he was excommunicated so we we went through that not i guess maybe the through line here is we have a a contrarian thinker a tribeless individual and what's interesting to me david is he is coming to some of the same conclusions that we've come to as part of the the bankless platform some different ones but also many of the same conclusions but he's doing it like out outside of uh the ethereum ecosystem's influence or the bankless ecosystem's influence he's almost like arriving at these opinions independently and uh that that's what was so interesting about i think this podcast and eric's journey and his story it's just the way he thinks but how he has arrived at these opinions it's definitely not through group think and through like tribe affiliation it's like when he says it you know that like he actually believes it in that moment not to say he doesn't change his mind because there are many instances where he he's admitted changing his mind in fact you know the the tweet that got him on the show i think was uh he said in 2020 he stopped being wrong about eth those are his words not mine he stopped being wrong about eve so this is someone who's also very willing to do it like a 180 when he sees that um the evidence points in a different direction so kind of a cool thinker somebody we've wanted on the podcast for a while and we actually written down a rabbit hole that we weren't expecting to towards the beginning of the podcast where we get to talk about my favorite subject of like evolutionary crypto assets not planned yeah what is it like biology biology and like the evolution of crypto networks right uh i'm i have a deep-seated belief that the best way to understand this industry is through a biological perspective uh and eric wahl shares that belief and we actually kind of went down that rabbit hole earlier in the podcast and i think that's going to be a new line of a line of topic on the bankless podcast that we haven't really touched on i'm really happy that we were actually able to touch on it yeah it's kind of like expect the unexpected in this podcast right at the very beginning he actually called me out on some beef that we've had previously right so we just enter in on that conversation so overall really fantastic episode of course you can get a download of david and mai's thoughts in the debrief episode that is available for premium subscribers on the bankless premium feed so make sure you check that out too if you are a premium subscriber and with that david let's talk about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest eric wall is a contrarian crypto investor he is the chief investment officer at arcane investment he's someone i don't always agree with yet he's also someone i always appreciate i think that's because he busts through groupthink he isn't afraid to change his mind yet he manages to stay extremely convicted in his beliefs at the same time i think we're going to learn a lot from eric in this podcast eric welcome to bankless how are you doing today thank you so much ryan um kind of surprised to be here because we've had this uh you and me we've had this uh ongoing spat about a particular argument that we've had in the past about how to correctly apply the term trustless to different types of cryptocurrency systems and because of our inconsistencies of opinions there i've i'm a principal i'm a principled person and i try to stick to my principles as hard as i can and one of my principles is that if somebody uses terminology in a way that i think is harmful to the overall ecosystem then you know i cannot prevent people from saying what they say but i can at least uh choose who i engage with uh i think the spat that we had was you know kind of a mild one and you know now i'm pretty much over it but it would be good if we could just you know just spend a few seconds just you know hashing over that little piece of disagreement that we had around trustlessness uh i can i can explain the argument if if if if that's helpful to you yeah let's do it and and to bankless listeners uh as you can see the the introduction did eric justice because we didn't plan any of this pre-recording and we're jumping right in with the contrarian opinion um eric yeah i'd love to i'd love to hear you i so i think this is in regards to an article that i wrote uh sometime in march 2020 and the reason i'm remembering is actually because i did pull it up because i was wondering if if you would uh pull this up and want to talk about this first and the article title is called eth is irreplaceable and uh it's basically a taxonomy about the uh trustlessness the spectrum of trustlessness of certain assets so i make the basic uh assertion that you know different assets on ethereum have different or in crypto writ large have different settlement levels of settlement guarantee right and like even in the real world different assets have different levels of settlement guarantee some are backed by the nation state some require uh like legal um legal trust uh some are more bearer asset instruments and some i put in a quadrant called a trustless quadrant and again i pitch this as sort of a spectrum of trust right recognizing that nothing on earth nothing that can be created nothing that has ever been created is completely trustless but i think you take issue with the uh the term trustless in and of itself and i would love for you to explain that as we start this episode where you take issue and uh we'll we'll see whether we actually disagree at the end of this uh or whether we agree yeah so i can give my take the reason that i took issue with how you characterized uh the trustlessness taxonomy was that uh if i remember it correctly and please correct me if i'm wrong you basically put different cryptocurrency projects on an axis on on a spectrum where they went from uh more trustless to less trustless whereas in in yeah you can see uh in this this chart here that uh basically you can go from more trustless to less trustless where i think that there are uh things that are completely trusted that should not be on a trustless diagram at all so i don't think that trustlessness can in can incorporate everything because there are some things that should be completely outside of this spectrum because they're trusted so i don't think that you can say that you know uh a bank is just uh less trustless or or or and that the die is more trustless i think that banks are 100 trusted and doesn't belong in a diagram of trustlessness at all uh i think that's if i that's how i recall the argument and i tried to persuade you to remove completely trusted things from a trustlessness diagram and you rebutted and said well you know that's not how i think about it and i said well in if that's the case then i'm going to stop engaging with you until uh you've refreshed your thinking on it and then we had all these discussions around how you can view this topic and uh now i'm you know i've i've listened to your bankless part and i i i don't think that you are a malicious actor in any way we just had a disagreement about terminology but i don't think that you are harmful or that you're bringing a negative nuance to the industry so that's why i came on that's why i've now come around so i'm on the pod now i think we can get over this and we can we can be friends again and and chat about things that are really important because i think that our main goals with our efforts in the cryptocurrency space are pretty much 90 percent aligned so eric i think that if i'm interpreting what you're saying correctly that what you are really asking to change in this diagram here is really asking to change where like the x x and y axes are it's like on and so perhaps so you you do agree that there's this thing in concept called called trustlessness that some crypto assets try to emulate like you know bitcoin and ether to perhaps the most degree and what i think what you're saying is everything to like perhaps on the left side of this diagram you you are saying like why are we even calling it uh putting it on the trussless spectrum at all in the first place let's use completely different words for exactly completely different part of this zone exactly exactly what different words would you use than eric versus trustless no i just put trusted and trustless in completely different axis you should have a split here where you put things that ultimately do depend on trust in a complete on a completely different axis here and because right now if you look at the you have trustless issuance on the y axis and then the trustless settlement on the x axis i think that you should have there should be uh an axis that goes to the left where you have completely trusted things uh but you know i don't want to spend too much time on this bat can i just can i just say something i actually don't think uh there's a real spat there i think much of this is actually uh semantics and probably the result of uh me just being a sloppy diagram drawer i think maybe someone who's listening to bankless uh and in the bankless nation can take the diagram that we're showing right now and come up with something that better illustrates that because fundamentally i think i agree with with what you're saying right like some assets are completely trusted on on one side of the spectrum and then you have the spectrum of trustlessness where maybe you get this this perfect state on the other side of the spectrum that's that's completely trustless but of course no asset can achieve that i just think the diagram is maybe drawn in a way that does not make that clear and somebody else could do a better job i am not a diagram that is not my day job i was just trying to write an article to get a concept out there and a mental model out there which is the mental model of different assets on ethereum have different degrees of trust so if you're buying usdc on ethereum final settlement actually happens in meat space it happens inside of a coinbase uh bank account in the traditional finance world and that is a much that has much different settlement guarantees than something like die where you have a larger degree of that settlement happening on chain and of course that is much different than something like bitcoin where the entire settlement process it's a bearer instrument the entire settlement process is on chain i felt like the crypto world didn't completely understand that at the time anyway i actually think that we are closer in alignment maybe than uh than was previous thought coming into this podcast and some of this is just as a result of a sloppy diagram design that could be improved upon what say you sir i'm perfectly happy with this resolution of the argument and i think that if we just zoom out a little bit and like why are we having this types of disagreements in the first place it's because you know my um interest in the cryptocurrency space um you know i've i i got into into the bitcoin industry uh very long ago i purchased my first bitcoin in 2012. uh please don't rob me because i got i lost all of them when mount gox collapsed in 2014 so don't think that don't come to my house and think that you're gonna find an ocean of bitcoins there that i bought for uh ten dollar space um uh but uh you know i've become so fascinated by cryptocurrencies as a concept and as a revolution that i'm so ideologically and philosophically interested in the space that you know how i view my participation and interest in this space it's not about you know i don't care as much as i probably should from a commercial perspective about uh you know making the right types of business relationships or uh positioning myself that strategically like if i had that intention of you know just building out um you know making as much money as possible then i would have been on bankless podcast a year ago or you know so to to to market myself but i care about the space and i care about things being stated correctly so that we can as an industry move in the direction that i think is most interesting and that direction is where how much can we decentralize pieces of the economic world and the finance world to to basically create a form of revolution that changes how humans can interact and how society can function that is much larger and much more interesting goal to me than you know caring about who i am friends with so that's why i will get into arguments with all sorts of people that i kind of actually like um but i cannot you know i'm just trying to make sure that we're all on the right path of uh optimizing uh how much we we can improve uh the systems for the systems of today well eric wall i think that is an extremely noble goal and it's a goal that we share on the bankless podcast as well we very much view this as a very fun industry with a lot of you know money-making potential but really at the root of it is much more of a political and cultural revolution uh and we see ourselves as uh you know people that are attempting to steward that revolution into into existence and so tip of the hat for for being on that on that same you know path as well and i kind of want to just dive deeper into why this industry and why this revolution resonates with you so much you talked about your philosophical interest in uh this industry okay just let's uh just dive deeper down that hole what about this industry do you think really uh is fitting for the future of the world that you think should come about um yeah i i just want to add one one thing uh to that uh before we get into that topic which is you know what how come you er the three of us we seem to have the same ideological alignment how come we get into these kinds of spats and i think that has to do that i am such an old i describe myself as an old dog you know i my terminology and my way of thinking of things comes very much from the early days of bitcoin and we uh shaped the early terminology for things uh in order to make sense and classify different crypto cryptocurrency systems and that has been a very you know conservative and restricted type of terminology and taxonomy so uh that's why you know people that come into the space perhaps a little bit later that aren't uh you know as plugged into that type of taxonomy thinking that's why i think we can get into disagreements it just happens that we come a little bit into the space from different angles i'm a long-time bitcoiner we care very very much about very specific anal things and we are a bit ocd in terms of that so that's the only reason that i think that you know we have these kind of kinds of spats but to get back to your question um you know i have a i i have um i have actually i i don't have a youtube channel but i have a youtube account and i use that youtube account just to collect all the videos of presentations that i've made that other people have uploaded and i put it into a a playlist so that i can you know gather all my performances in the in in the past that have been recorded and one of those performances that i personally uh liked the most was when i was invited to a swedish uh cryptocurrency uh um just a meet up and they asked me to talk about consensus algorithms and uh in that format i got full full uh control of what i wanted to express and what i wanted to say and what i wanted to talk about there was and now i think maybe this sounds uh like an outdated take or you know everyone's heard it before but when this happened this was four four or five years ago i think it was four years ago when we talked about it i described how i view bitcoin as a digital uh a primitive digital form of life because if you think about what actually uh constitutes life what is life form is an amino acid a life form is a bacterial life form uh there is no discrete the step where something uh goes from being you know not alive to more alive it's it's a spectrum just like the trust trustlessness spectrum that we talked about uh we when things are complex enough and they are self-sufficient enough and they act organically enough then we say they are alive so you know a bacteria operates almost entirely algorithmic and i think that bitcoin when i compare bitcoin to a very uh primitive life form uh like a bacteria or even perhaps a mushroom mushroom is the one that i think bitcoin mostly resembles uh i do classify bitcoin as a as a as a as a primitive form of life and i think that there are going to be more and more uh primitive life forms like everyone else of course like ai when ai becomes sentient but you know not all life forms are sentient uh but they can still be sent because they can still be life forms so we don't have sentient uh digital uh life forms yet but we are now seeing that we are are having digital life forms that haven't reached sentience yet so the way that i think about it and what makes me most interested in the cryptocurrency space is just thinking about uh how we are seeing digital things come to life and we can analyze those as life forms and i think that if you look at the bitcoin system um you know every 10 minutes there's a block almost like a pulse and if you listen if you put your ear uh next to a bit main server hall you can actually hear bitcoin's breath um so i do think i do think of these things as primitive life forms are very interested in and and all cryptocurrencies are competing uh with each other uh which makes it uh that we also have an evolutionary aspect to it which where the uh strong and the weak uh this is the strong it's it's the survival of the fittest uh it's basically like a big hunger games game and what adds an extra interesting quality to this evolutionary game of cryptocurrencies is that what's um you know in the in the physical evolutionary world uh you know a cat cannot clone the features of a dog a cat it can do that over many many iterations uh and it can evolve into a dog if it needs to but in the cryptocurrency world uh one cryptocurrency can actually steal features from another project which changes the entire dynamics of the evolutionary game so uh charles darwin when he was analyzing different life forms and evolution um that was probably very interesting to him uh to think about and i think that we have a new uh evolutionary game with different rules that are to me because they're new it's it's even more interesting so it's the intellectual uh challenge of being able to actually take all of that in and analyze it from that perspective and that later also translates like if you understand the evolution of cryptocurrencies if you have that as your framework that you're thinking about it as as things that have different evolutionary characteristics that make them uh fit to survive then you can actually become an investor because if you can pick the ones that are likely to survive then you can also be a good investor so that's how uh even though this sounds very you know abstract and theoretical and scientific it actually maps perfectly well with being a cryptocurrency fund manager because i just gotta try to understand the dynamics of the game and the evolutionary game and and and i think david that you've probably written some article that uh also tunes into this team haven't you yeah yeah this is a really one of my favorite subjects in this industry is is i actually don't think you can really understand the crypto industry at large if you aren't viewing it from a biological perspective uh and one of the reasons like this this industry is famously like so multi-disciplinary and that complexity of so many disciplines turns into complexity theory uh which turns into just the the conversation that you started off with with is where does life actually begin and we don't really know but the patterns are that life is always about the management of economic resources and if some sort of organizational entity can manage these economic resources appropriately to to the benefit of the life form and growing because it's as a life form it is efficient at consuming economic resources while also capturing further economic resources all of a sudden we have like the groundings for sustainability and so i i applied this same sort of mental model to um to defy apps right uh where defy apps are and i used ether as like the metaphor of like nutrients or food value is like the the new communication medium inside of the you know the internet of money or the crypto world and so defy apps that consume ether and then output some sort of like useful product that is demanded by the market are able to go out into the world and venture into this new landscape that is the internet find nutrients which is value you know valuable assets uh and then produce something new right and so the the mental model for this is that like or more concrete model for this is that maker dao you come in and you submit ether you can and the maker dial consumes that ether and then it outputs die and that die is demanded by the environment around maker and so because maker is a viable economic manager life form it has sustainability and we can talk about that with basically every single defy app like there's some amount of value input there's some amount of value output and because the output is demanded and because the uh the defy application is efficient uh there is more value that is created by the defy app more than it is consumed and all of a sudden it is a net outputter of economic resources which is good for the world there's more value created by these things than what is consumed and that's why they are sustainable and we can put them into the category of life forms and i think this is an insanely interesting topic of conversation that i was not actually did not know we were actually going down this rabbit hole but it's literally my favorite rabbit hole in all of crypto might as well um but yeah that was uh something that i dived very deeply into into 2015 2016 and it's been my framework for of thinking for a very long time um but it's it's i think you've phrased it very well and i resonate with with what you said to a very large degree um but yeah let's let's jump into the other other topics that you guys wanted to discuss well really quick there because i think we're we're starting to see how eric wall thinks right which is a kind of part of the the entire purpose of this podcast because i think you you bring some really interesting insights uh to the table but you almost just painted yourself just now as sort of a digital biologist of types right just studying the evolution yeah i used to call me i i used to call myself uh crypto darwinist i was thinking about i was i was i was thinking about uh actually giving out that you know there's this darwin award that you give to someone does something really stupid though right yeah and i was thinking that i could be the crypto darwinist and i could give the darwin award to like projects like you know like iota uh yeah yeah that has you know if if a crypto project has you know one server and if that server shuts down the entire system fails then you get the darwin award um okay so this is this is like the question of like your lens on the world is a crypto darwinist a digital biologist right like the the large question is um i think in that perspective what sorts of digital life forms are more likely to out survive others because if that's your lens of thinking that's really how you have to think about everything whether it's bitcoin or uh ether or ethereum or any d5 protocols i'm curious before we get into some like specific takes from you eric um about that lens what sort of digital life forms do you think have the best fit in crypto well um i'm gonna answer your question like from how i thought about it from three years ago but my thinking has changed a little bit since then but how i used to think of it was that if you're gonna think of something as a life form uh is the centralization a very big necessary component and i do think that it is perhaps one of the most fundamental components into creating something into a life form because you know if if you know a server on your computer is that a life form i mean you can turn it on you can turn it off it doesn't have a a an ability to sustain itself like if you look at the mushroom the mushroom actually does provide it it takes up nutritions from the soil of the ground and it it it transforms that into a resource for the rest of the ecosystem of the nature uh so it live it doesn't live it lives in us in a kind of science symbolic uh relationship with nature and i think that all life forms ultimately uh in order to survive in the long term have to find their place into the ecosystem into the into the ecologics of it and i think that bitcoin fits very well uh in that category because um you know bitcoin pays for itself so so uh people want access to the censorship resistance system of bitcoin to preserve wealth and transfer value uh so that's how bitcoin contributes to us as an organism and then we contribute to bitcoin by providing energy and electricity to to bitcoin so there's a symbiotic relationship there where uh you know it's very difficult to kill bitcoin because bitcoin provides something to us uh and as long as that organism is providing something to us and and we need uh and and actually pays for itself with the currency that the miners can can get from from mining it then uh i see a very a very strong likelihood for that organism to survive but then of course you know there are uh and i'm not saying that that may you know that the most decentralized currency and this goes into my to my later stage thinkings of as of late you know how much does decentralization actually matter you know uh is a cryptocurrency like if you take something like cmi decentralized cryptocurrency does it naturally have a shorter life span just because it is more centralized you know mine too my intuition tells me that more centralized platforms they have regulatory regulatory risks around them that could cause them to get shut down at any point in time so that the more centralized platforms uh are much more likely to survive in the long term but uh we also have to consider that okay so so what happens if if i if a semi-centralized platform meets regulatory crackdown can they not fork that platform uh to use a more decentralized consensus algorithm and make the organism survive anyway so i'm not as convinced today that you know i used to just look at the current fundamentals of each system but now i am taking much more into account the uh transmutative qualities that all cryptocurrencies have and i think that perhaps what breathes life into bitcoin is not the uh code in the bitcoin system it's much more the community and the the developer community that breathes life into the bitcoin uh system as well as the ethereum system and that uh changes the equation a little bit uh if you catch my drift eric so i'm reminded of this metaphor about um like ant colonies or beehives where like there is this organism right but the organism isn't the bee it is the swarm right it's not the it's not an individual ant it is the system at large and these ants seem to be working in like this mindless just like algorithm this mindlessly each ant feels like this little bit of code and just is part of this overarching system and it's the overarching system that is the entity at large right and that very much feels like bitcoin or ethereum right where like the bitcoin is it's one there's one thing there's one bitcoin but uh there are like you know in potentially infinite nodes right and you what bitcoin is when you download the bitcoin uh blockchain you are replicating bitcoin you are going through the life process of you know copying the dna and then putting it on your node your server so it's not your server that's the live but it's the desire to replicate bitcoin and so holistically uh i mean there's a reason why bitcoiners on crypto twitter are called cyber hornets right like the metaphor sticks um and so the not one um person or individual represents bitcoin it's about a collective movement but also my question to you is like you know or to some degree ant colonies and beehives aren't really the most paradigm breaking thing as a life form on this planet like you know humans i would say with with more in my opinion centralized energies inside of us you know a a cerebral cortex and then just straight up like brain power i would say that is a an analogy towards more centralization and to some degree like the question is like well if there's more centralization is the lifespan of the system uh shorter perhaps but if the regulatory risk never comes to some degree there is some sort of justification for more centralized operation more more prefrontal cortex operation if you will because under the paradigm that you know regulatory risk never actually comes well then you can actually plan and progress further into the into just you know become more progressive and more iterative faster how do you feel about about this analogy in this comparison no i like it because uh i like the ant um colony analogy and i think that if you apply that to humans humans are also ant colonies in two ways the first way is that you know we just like you said each individual individual ant is a very primitive being that can probably only have perhaps 12 different ideas and one at a time in their head go left go right it's hot here it's warm there it's the key you know and also smell is one of the things that you use but and we humans we are also but the colony itself the ant colony itself is a completely different life form that can resist uh you know if somebody puts a shovel into an ant colony it restructs it if you reconstruct itself so that the ant colony is much more sophisticated and has much more uh stronger chance to survive than what a single ant does because it works in this unit unified it uh as a unified life form and we as humans uh we also function that way in in two ways the first one is that we are made up by a bunch of cells and by bacteria and all and our internal organs each component within us is also a little bit like an ant they have they do have very very simple tasks that they perform but the collection of all of those components creates the sentient beings that are us so in that way each individual human is an ant colony but then if you bring it into a larger scale and you think about society society is also like an ant colony and because we are compared to a society each human is pretty you know simplistic they go to work they have their desires that they want to fulfill and they write and do things or carry objects but in us but if you think about like a nation or a a dao or a you know human humanity humankind as a whole that's also a very big ant uh colony and uh i mean of course humanity as a whole has much more uh a bigger chance to survive than a single uh human uh does so i do think that uh decentralization happens at many different levels and i do think that you know and that's still something that i'm grappling with you know when i'm analyzing cryptocurrencies uh how much the decentralization quality uh is necessary for the uh long-term life line of that project also because the thing that i previously mentioned that these projects can transform they can change they can warp very quickly much more quickly than anything we've seen in the physical world so let's talk about uh applying your brain and that lens to things so you mentioned earlier in the introduction eric that you're part of the old guard got into bitcoin early got into bitcoin to to study this digital biology that was in front of you just intellectual curiosity you also got in for the social movement decentralization you got in for the right reasons before everyone knew it was going to jump to like 50k right um but we had an inkling at that time i i'm curious though because i've seen you on twitter and other places you're also not afraid to break rank with some of the old guard and i think of course it's uh difficult to say that bitcoin has any one singular uh thought view but certainly bitcoin maximalists do which is there shall be only bitcoin bitcoin will accrue the most value there there are certain other ideals i would say that would i attribute to bitcoin maximalism i'm curious your thoughts on this eric what do you think bitcoiners get wrong um yeah this is such a uh such a tough tough uh topic to discuss and something that i've been one of my like main not only professional but also you know there's personal challenges in life um you know i as i said i think that you framed it pretty correctly that i'm this digital biologist and i observe these different life forms and i'm very interested in the dynamics and the interplay and the hunger games of crypto that's what i'm primarily interested in so i don't and in that game you know i have things that i root for and i root for the decentralized ones to survive because if they survive and the industry moves in that way then i think that we have very i mean if we focus on centralized systems and then they get shut down and then the game is over and there's nothing more for me to analyze that's why i try to make sure that we keep things as decentralized as possible and that's why i have been a proponent of bitcoin for very long but if uh there is another system that comes along and it can uh flaunt their wings in a way that uh is interesting you know i'm not gonna say that i just want this single life form uh to persist i want the evolutionary process to produce the absolute uh best uh winner and in order to do that uh you have to um uh you you can't you can't lock your mind into a single frame of thinking and one of the what's happened what happened to me interacting with the bitcoin space was that uh in 2017 uh what happened was that you saw all these other cryptocurrency projects pop up and you had tons of capital flowing into icos and all of them market them marketed themselves as the next bitcoin that had unlimited uh scalability no fees and uh perfect decentralization and i saw that a large of the community that could that could have become bitcoiners and that could have contributed to our goals of breathing this life form or helping this life form uh develop were uh directed in the wrong direction and i and i knew that because of my computer science background i was was uh and i i i actually my master's degree in computer science i did uh study i took my degree to specifically arrange it around the cryptographic primitives that underpin blockchain technology so my master thesis that i wrote in 2015 was about blockchain technology so i knew that i had the ability to dive deeply into these different white papers and understand which projects are poorly constructed so i took it upon myself to try to educate or help people understand which projects are the wrong directions if we want to create everlasting life forms so the reason that i became very popular in the bitcoin industry was because they uh they they they used to call me the altcoins player they viewed me as a person that attacked bitcoin and you know i had confidence i had i had uh meetups that i would go to here in sweden where they would you know basically before i went up on stage they called let's bring on the altcoin slayer and then everyone applaused and that made me very very likable everyone liked me in the bitcoin industry and of course i liked being liked by a lot of people a lot but my i my intellectual interest in this space has never been tribal in the sense that i just want my coin to survive i i i zoom out and i just want the industry to survive in order for the industry industry to survive it means that we need to make the best decisions possible so what happened to me was that i noticed some types of research going on in the ethereum side of things uh if you if you want if we want to get specific it was actually uh the ability that you could construct uh layer two solutions on top of ethereum that provided very very attractive decentralization properties whilst also preserving much much more of the ux advantages than for instance lightning does so i think that lightning is very good at being decentralized but i don't think that lightning has a great user experience whereas if you look at the roll-up it's it has a very high degree of decentralization because they've solved the so-called data availability problem that's used to haunt these their two solutions on ethereum protocols before but they solve that problem and a roll-up functions very much in a way as a side chain functions where maybe maybe if i'm getting too complicated with things but if i put it simply in a roll-up what you can do if you have an ethereum address like right now i can send you money and an endless amount of money or well not endless but i can send you any amount in my wallet to your wallet on the roll up without you even knowing about the roll-up system existing without you running a node all you have to do is generate the private key give me the public your ethereum address and i can send you for low fees at an excellent user experience i can send that money to you whereas in lightning that's not possible the recipient has to run a lightning node they need to have inbound liquidity in order to accept the payment so when i noticed this uh that the layer two systems on ethereum um were uh providing benefits that we couldn't do in bitcoin because we don't have statefulness we don't have uh and if we look at something like zk rollups we don't even have the um we don't even have the uh the the the uh the virtual virtual machine in bitcoin or op codes if you will we don't ha i don't know if you're familiar with the word but bitcoin basically operates on something called opcodes and each op codes executes a programmatic function and we don't have complex enough op codes in bitcoin to create something like ezk up and zk roll ups and optimistic roll ups are excellent layer two constructions and we can't build those in bitcoin unless we upgrade the system in a little in in some way so that made me um you know i tried to i thought that you know i had this naive theory that because i had been a bitcoin for so long and they i was the old coin slayer and everything and i thought that everyone really believed me when i uh that i was intellectually honest i thought that i had made enough progress as a bitcoiner and demonstrating how much i'm committed to the right goals and ideals that when i say that there is something happening in the ethereum space that we should pay interest to because it moves it moves the needle in terms of technological innovation i thought that they would believe me uh but they didn't what happened instead uh they called me uh peter todd called me potentially dangerous and john carollo uh basically called me um i don't know if he called me a scammer or many of them called me an idiot and rejected uh they thought that i'd become a corner but yeah corner is basically what happened they started psychology excommunicated from a religion it feels like a little bit by the high priest yes that's that's very much how how it felt like and i um you know i try to uh say like you know if you want to perfect the like you know i'm still on your team and i think like if you want to make bitcoin the best it can possibly be then we need to look at all types of innovation that is happening in the cryptocurrency space all of that is relevant it doesn't matter where it comes from um and i think that people like and i don't want to mention names but there's a lot of people that just inherently mistrust any type of innovation that comes outside of the bitcoin uh community and that i think that that comes from ignorance that it's because they don't have the ability to i mean it's just a technological system the roll-ups are a technological construction it's objectively objectively defined doesn't matter at all uh who's the author if you just look at the code and that is a part of the bitcoin philosophy that we don't care about who satoshi nakamoto is we care about the code and what it can do so i really don't understand how you can be so against uh innovation coming out of other projects if the results of of what what the technology can provide is actually helping you that seems very much to me like some just you know tribalism and unintellectual uh yeah like you said religious type of behavior that saddens me a great deal and actually i i i said that it broke my heart to see bitcoiners not being able to take this in because it did it did break my heart and it made my uh entire cryptocurrency uh experience completely different realizing that you know we weren't uh people didn't see it the same way as i did and i am still trying to do what i can to to work for the bitcoin system but i do see so much things happening inside of the ethereum system that i think is really really interesting as well and now i mean bitcoin is this digital gold and i do believe that bitcoin has legs as a digital gold but uh and and i am following the the innovations in bitcoin like taproot upgrades i do think that's interesting but um i mean if you are if you are intellectually curious and uh you want to see what you can do with the blockchain protocol um then it's more interesting to just as a researcher to look at what's happening inside of ethereum right now and one of the things that made me um uh that actually cemented uh my understanding that bitcoiners weren't acting in a good faith technological uh view on these things was that after uh zk roll ups were presented and i tried to i try to to to bring a zk rollups as a is a research project to the bitcoin community and i asked them on twitter like let's look at this research research that is being done and isn't it quite fantastic what they've been able to achieve and everyone said no no no that's just com complete that comes from italics computer scam nonsense pre-mind blah blah blah blah then uh greg maxwell gregory maxwell who's the one of the most respected and original uh long-time contributors to the bitcoin system he came out and said that yeah zk roll ups those are awesome but they were actually my idea look at this forum post that i wrote in 2013 and i and i was like you see like the developers the the the most knowledgeable developers of bitcoin actually resonates so much uh with the uh how good and how useful this technology is that they've actually been trying to create it themselves and now that it has been finished because the ethereum foundations and other uh cryptographic like the zcash community has worked so much on perfecting uh zero knowledge proofs those are now efficient enough that we can actually use them now that they are here uh and and and now bitcoiners are saying you know they're calling it a scam even though that you know we've been trying to create these primitives in bitcoin for such a long time so that just made me you know how what can i argue with you know there even the bitcoiners designers themselves wanted this and i think there's just this big gap in the bitcoin community where the developers like the the the the the high priests of bitcoin like the the people on twitter uh they have uh one understanding they have a limited understanding of the bitcoin system and they but they're very uh the the the tones that the the how they phrase themselves and how how how they act and how they behave they think that they're carrying the torch for uh the bitcoin developers that they're they're they're they're preaching the gospel of the the the bitcoin the core views of the uh smartest people in bitcoin but many times they aren't and that's my problem that many times the people who are the loudest in bitcoin are sometimes uh are not the most uh educated or knowledgeable about bitcoin so then i get into arguments about these with these people because uh you know it's usually i don't have that much disagreements with real bitcoin developers i just have disagreements with people who don't understand what bitcoin developers uh truly think and so but me being very vocal on the person on twitter the bitcoin developers aren't that vocal uh on twitter put me in a different category and i had to you know i thought i thought i would be able to bridge the gap between the ethereum and the bitcoin communities but i ended up becoming this controversial figure uh ethereums call me a bitcoin maximalist bitcoiners call me a coiner i'm trying to stick true to the facts and i'm trying to stick true to technological innovation and progress if that makes a ship cleaner and a maximalist of me at the same time so be it i'm not going to change who i am and what i say and uh i don't want to i just add a nuance of humility to that because now i'm making it sound like i'm the smartest guy in the room and everyone else is stupid that only happens most of the time some of the time i'm i'm i'm completely i'm completely wrong i'm kidding uh i am i'm not the smartest i'm not you know i don't consider myself to be uh you know so much smarter than everybody else uh you know i'm also in the space just trying to learn as much as i can and figure things out uh and and this is the situation that i've gotten myself into yeah eric i i've also attempted to try and bridge the gap between bitcoiners and ethereans and it seems to be just an insurmountable chasm to to cross so my question to you to really finish off this this part of this conversation before we move on to other things is that you know you talk about bitcoin and its merits and then you also talk about the bitcoin community and their rigidity and thought did your experience with being um you know being called a coiner by the bitcoin max lee back maxie's and everything that you've talked about did that change your stance towards bitcoin the system at all or do you separate the community from bitcoin and say look well there's this tribal community around bitcoin but it doesn't really impact the bitcoin the system bitcoin btc the asset bitcoin the protocol or did your reaction in relationship with the bitcoin community also change your stance to what you think bitcoin really is yeah i mean uh when i started to talk about zk roll ups and the necessary op codes that we would need to implement in uh bitcoin in order to facilitate a state machine and an opcode that can interpret the zero-knowledge proof and also just seeing how the discussions are on drive chains is going i am a little bit more bearish these days that the types of innovations that i think are necessary to create a useful uh a user-friendly payment mechanism out of bitcoin uh have been restricted because uh you know because bitcoin if we're going to upgrade and and make the system as useful as possible then we need to i need to make sure that when i speak to the bitcoin community and the developers speak to the bitcoin community that they understand uh what is the most rational path forward and if we become stupid as a community a stupid community cannot make a coin survive good and i don't think many bitcoins believe that bitcoin is perfect as it is and it just needs to continue on and then it will win the world but uh it's not like that i mean you're not gonna have you don't have the capacity in bitcoin uh for everyone to open even lightning channels and even if we even even if we say that we did have the capacity to open up lightning channels using channel factories and other things that you can do with lightning um like then even then uh the user experience of lightning may not be uh sufficiently well equipped to actually become the payment mechanism that the entire world uses so i do think that there are challenges to be overcome uh when it comes to making bitcoin perfect i do still think i do still think that bitcoin is uh uh the the project that i like the most but yes getting shunned from well i wouldn't say i'm shunned you know i still have i'm still relatively liked by a part of the bitcoin community so i'm not like completely shunned but yes of course you know [Music] it broke my heart and it also um uh made me perhaps diversify my portfolio uh of you know i didn't hold i've made it public that i didn't hold ether um um let's talk about that can we talk about that eric hey bankless nation i hope you're enjoying this conversation with eric wall thus far we are about to turn to a recent tweet that eric wall just made where he said that i stopped being wrong about ethereum sometime in in 2020 where eric wald decided to change his mind and be more optimistic about the future of ethereum uh so we asked what what did it take for him to really change his mind after he came uh after he had he had these negative experiences with these bitcoiners we also turned to an article he wrote that really impacted me where he titled it proof of stake is less wasteful and this actually ultimately became one of the core components of ultrasound money this thesis that proof of stake is inherently extremely efficient because it has to award the least amount of ether because the people that are staking are the most bullish on it so they'll compete for the least amount of ether possible and that's why proof-of-stake doesn't have to issue all that much eric wall as a contrarian lone wolf investor has been through so many cryptocycles so we finish off this conversation just asking eric about what does it take to really make it through this industry in a multi-cycle time frame and so he has a ton of great lessons and takeaways that i'm really excited to share with you guys guys in the second half of the show but first we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in the device with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bath t-shirts to much success bouncer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto

check them out at gemini.com go bankless what we've seen up to this point i think is uh someone who is a digital biologist looking at these systems also not a bitcoin maximalist may be more of a decentralization optimizer decentralization maximalist and it seems to be the case that that's part of the reason that they called you the altcoin slayer is because you called a lot of the altcoins out on their  on the stuff that wouldn't work uh but that intellectual pursuit also brought you to layer twos and ethereum and some of the improvements in in roll-ups that are being made and you saw the potential for uh decentralization in these layer twos that didn't quite exist in uh bitcoin i i put this tweet out uh i guess a couple weeks ago um i was wrong about eth i said no one actually says that i was wrong about eth but a lot of people should be saying it i get a lot of replies of course it's just you know it's fun on twitter to like poke the bear a little bit eric not that you do that at all it is fun though um and then your reply was the one that actually was most interesting to me out of the the many hundreds of replies that that that threat got and you said this 2016 i was wrong about eth when i sold it for six dollars after the dow hawk hack 2017 i was wrong about eth when i rushed home to grab my 2fa exchange login after the first enterprise ethereum alliance announcement think i'd missed the rally 2020 i stopped being wrong about eth and i think you linked to a specific tweet that you made in august 2020 presumably you purchased some eth at that time before you hadn't had as much can you talk about that journey i think a puzzle piece to the journey is um bullish on rollups maybe bullish on ethereum scalability in this new avenue but was that the only part of the journey tell us about the journey yeah yeah uh first of all i think the tweet that you're referring to uh i bought uh ethereum and i had an ethereum before that but i did acquire as much heat as i could when it was trading around 110 uh dollars and this was during the covet uh the coronavirus driven crash in must have been march 2020 but yeah i did i i was wrong about you know in in 2016 during the dow hack i was uh like you said a decentralization maximalist and when i saw that the way that i thought about ethereum was that this was an immutable attempt to build an immutable execution engine for autonomous programs and the dao hack showed that social consensus overrules uh the programmatic code which means that and at this point in time in that point in time the project was heavily centralized around the metallic thought uh it's become it's it's improved from that now um so so i i didn't i didn't think that uh after the dow hack and seeing that uh actually i saw the reason that i sold was just seeing that the dow got hacked and i that's when i immediately just rushed and sold all my ethernet at six dollars and then i was skeptical whether or not fixing surgically fixing the dao hack using social consensus was the right path now i do think that it is the it was the right uh decision to make i've changed my my mind there but uh i i i let's perhaps address the thing that you asked specifically like when did i actually start to come around to the ethereum system and i think um i think it was probably around i mean in 2017 that's when i heard about the enterprise ethereum alliance and ethereum was trading at 11 and i was at work listening to this uh this this webcast where it was being announced and i i understood how huge this was going to be enterprises that were going to use ethereum now the enterprise interior the enterprise ethereum alliance didn't turn out to be that big of a deal from my perspective anyway they haven't been that uh major of a contribution but it did bring so much um like validation to ethereum as a project uh so i knew that that was going to be massive and that's why i i i rushed home to to acquire more eath at that time but i would i wouldn't say that i was like an uh an ethereum believer at that point i just saw that there was gonna be uh probably a rush in the price at that point what happened was that i was working in the traditional financial uh sector as a technology technology provider company so we were building the company that i worked for was called sinnover not a lot of people know about this name but in terms of providing exchanges like like the new york stock exchange or the australian securities exchange like it changes where stocks and other financial instruments are traded uh there are two large companies or there were two large companies providing matching engines and clearing house technologies uh to the world and that was nasdaq was the largest one they actually had their market their market technology division here in sweden where they developed the tech that they sell to other exchanges and the second company is also here in sweden it was called synovo and they were the largest competitors with each other for 20 years and i joined that firm right after i finished my master thesis on blockchain technology and actually wrote the master's thesis for synovo and the thesis was about how can we use uh blockchain technology to to create a decentralized security settlement system um and then i got to work with the cenober for quite a few years and i very quickly became the head of the cryptocurrency and blockchain strategy strategy there and i was involved well not i was to some extent involved in the uh you know i got to learn how do we supply these exchanges with technology like when an exchange wants to upgrade like in a mac if a matching engine run by the australian securities exchange wants to upgrade their system and how slow that process was they had to get the technology from a technology provider and then it goes through all this you know q a and testing and uh it's just these types of things could take five years to move from one system to another the types of innovation that i was seeing happening in the internet overall you didn't see that in the financial world at all and you didn't have open permissionless innovation in traditional finance it was very clunky and you had all these antiquated systems that were interlinked with each other and the way that the securities and also the banking system has developed is you know you have the paper-based processes and then you digitize those paper processes to emulate what you could do with pen and paper into digital uh processes and then you just built on from that and you ended up with this incredibly complex of a system with different moving parts that like if we wanted to recreate the security settlement system and clearing system of today i think we would have done it completely differently but we cannot you cannot change the entire plumbing of the financial world uh by improving the current system i think that you got to start from scratch and i think that if you want to start from scratch and you want to give you want to make the [Music] the if you want to make the if you want to create the correct environment for innovation then you have to look at how innovation has happened on the internet like when i for instance if i get in if i go to when i went to the us i visited a crypto conference in the us in 2018 and i rented a car a jeep and i wanted to drive through the nevada desert to go to las vegas which was where the conference was and i had a gps system there and the at one point in time i was running out of fuel and uh i uh took i used the gps system to point me to the closest uh gas station and they said i had to drive two hours to this location and and i was driving on this uh straight road for two hours and when i arrived there two hours later and now i'm almost running out of gas i the gps tells me that this this is the first time that you can turn around your car and go back the other direction and drive four hours that way instead and that's the closest uh gas station so i almost i almost died in the nevada desert this was in the death valley part of of the uh of the of the us like it's close to the yosemite uh national park so i almost died because of this shitty gps system and it's because uh the car company they got their technology delivered by a specific technology provider provider and if i have my smartphone instead then you know there i can choose between any type of map app i can choose between apple maps google maps and if they aren't any good there's going to be another app and that's what you want i think of traditional finance as this jeep where i'm restricted to this shitty system that a single company has developed and if you want to upgrade that you have to ask the company give us a better gps system whereas if it's the internet then you can have all people from all over the world deliver apps and you can just install the best one and use the best one and that's why uh map apps on smartphones are so much superior than than the shitty gps systems that make you die in the nevada desert uh that you that you that you'll find in the traditional world so i want that type of uh permissions permissionless innovation environment to happen in uh in the financial world and i wrote a long email to the ceo of our company i still have it it was in 2019 where i told him that you know the what i'm seeing happening in ethereum is exactly this vision uh of not the dying in the nevada desert because we're having permissionless innovation for financial apps happening right now in ethereum and it's going to move so much faster it's going to it's it's and because we cannot upgrade we cannot wait for a thousand engineers to upgrade a thousand antiquated uh financial systems running on uh programming languages from the from the 70s that's not gonna we're not gonna get there with it with the current financial system but cryptocurrency like ethereum platforms like theorem bring us a clean slate where we can create the right type of environment to create the best type of of uh platform for financial innovation so i think that we basically have like when the taxi industry had their uber moment i think that the traditional finance industry is having their uber moment right now and i go and i meet like traditional you know market making companies and financial institutions and you know i think that they should look at d5 and uh that also makes it complicated for me to talk with bitcoins because they hate defy and they hate defy because they look at all their rug pulls and they look at all the scams but i think that's the wrong way to think about it because you could have looked at bitcoin in 2011 and you could have said well the only thing that bitcoin is used for is to buy drugs on silk road and they would have been correct but it's the fundamental properties of the system that decides what you can do with it in the future it's not how it's currently used we used to always say bitcoin is always used to say well yeah there's a lot of people buying drugs doing shaving stuff with bitcoin but if you look at uh a car for instance uh who was the first uh which demographic was the first demographic to use cars well the cars were very very expensive normal people couldn't afford cars but people that were making bank robberies they uh could spend the money on a car because that could make them actually escape the police when they robbed the bank uh so they would buy cars and uh that's why uh criminal people uh will be the first one to buy bitcoin because then they can buy drugs and they can make a lot of money and in ethereum there's gonna be a lot of people that are making scams but if you just focus on that initial usage and you don't think about what can happen with the technology it's i mean it's the same way like maybe internet was mostly used to send around pornographic pictures between horny geeks at one point in time it didn't mean that the internet wasn't going to change the entire uh the entire uh world of finance one day and i have described the phi as like a few an hour i think we're moving away away from it but i think that i have described a few a year ago i described d5 as in the the ascii you know ascii as cii version like the ascii porn version of the internet basically but we you can see that the fundamental properties are there everything is working kind of shitty now but i do think that you know what's going to come out of this industry is going to be completely amazing and change the entire world yeah i i like the metaphor of like just the siloed data providers or service providers for the gps with as like the current financial institution whereas defy is like this massive crucible survival of the fittest if you don't if you aren't a good product you're not going to make it and and it's all done on this one canonical platform right it's very much like the how we articulate the bowl case for defy as well i want to turn to uh one of your also ethereum subjects that you've written about and talked about in the past and this was really a pretty like at least for me it was very much of a groundbreaking article for how i understood proof of stake and that was your proof of stake is less wasteful article and this was for me the first articulation of the nature of proof-of-stake security that is ultimately now a part of uh a very fundamental piece of the ultrasound money thesis uh and and so the the way that um you articulated this is that you it was like you articulated the natural efficiency of proof-of-stake systems to provide security uh and the way that i articulated this in response to after reading this your article is that ethereum naturally and proof-of-stake in ethereum naturally rewards bullishness very much like a defy yield farm right but incentive instead of the incentives of this this ethereum native yield farm which is proof of stake the incentives are so incredibly uh strong because they are being rewarded with ether the asset and naturally the cost of proof of stake is the how much you have to pay people to be bullish on ethereum and if there are plenty of people who are super super bullish on ethereum then the actual cost to secure ethereum are almost minimal and eric you wrote this piece back at the end of 2019 so um one i want to ask you about like do you has your mental models about proof of stake become updated at all since then uh and how do you articulate this the same kind of thesis like a year and a half later actually i think that uh you know i spent such an immense uh amount of time uh thinking about um you know i had i had you know i was very influenced by paul stork as a friend of mine now uh that i was very much in the same way as most bitcoiners at the time thought that uh you can it's it's it's inherently impossible to create a more cost efficient consensus algorithm because you have a security budget which means you have a reward uh that can be formed by miners or validators and uh you're always gonna be able to everyone is always going to spend as much resources as they can to earn that reward as long as they're still profitable so if the reward is a hundred dollars you're gonna spend at least 99 dollars worth of work whether it be locking up your capital or burning electricity so you cannot create a more uh cost-effective system than what proof-of-work already is and that was the way that i thought about it and then you have this entire conversation around okay well uh locking up liquidity uh versus burning energy uh if we contrast those two things uh paul stewart's argument was that well you know locking up liquidity also has a cost uh it has a cost that now you make capital uh inaccessible to society that could have been put to bed to better use um that's that's a very very uh actually complicated uh thing that i go through in the piece and there's multiple ways that you can look at that one way that you can look at it is that okay but when you lock up capital uh the value doesn't get trapped there it actually flows back to the like if you have if you have like if you have bitcoin and we take 50 of the supplier bitcoin and we lock it up and only 50 is circulating then it's gonna and demand can only go into the circulating amount of the supply the value is going to rise in the in the in the uh unlock in the circulating pool so you cannot fundamentally trap value but the the the nuance there that i go through in the article i think is that uh when when you have uh specific parties locking up their capital i mean the the the participants that has the the this capital to lock up they are usually people that have accumulated resources and people that have accumulated resources probably have some type of knowledge and when they lock up their liquidity and it just flows back and it gets splashed over this uniform blob of people then you actually do lose some economic potential because it's now yeah yeah concentrated uh portions of liquidity that can be injected into projects that can it can be invested it can be used to do productive things now it just flows back into a a gray blob of people and they don't necessarily like if everybody if you put a hundred dollars in every a person's pocket it doesn't necessarily mean that anything exciting is gonna happen they're gonna buy a hot dog and then it's over uh whereas this single investor with all that capital could have created a fantastic business so i do think that there is uh there is definitely uh like some uh there is a cost to society for locking up liquidity but if like you said if the person that is blocking up that liquidity if what he wanted to do with that liquidity was just to hold ether then it then there is no there is no negative uh consequence and that's what i realized in the article uh that uh if you have these bullish people on ether then they are they are going to be the uh and they when they are staking ether they're not causing any cost to to this society overall and and uh just in the same way that we're talking about in bitcoin mining the people who are going to be the most profitable uh mining bitcoin are the ones that have access to the cheapest source of electricity and that that's usually uh people that are monetizing excess uh renewable energy like the energy that they can't use for anything else they can only throw it away or mine bitcoin with it their cost for their electricity is zero so that's going to be the bitcoiners think that's going to be the predominant source of electricity uh for bitcoin and if you apply that same length of thinking to ethereum then what is the cheapest source of liquidity in ethereum well it is the people who are committed to holding ethereum for a very long time they have no alternative cost there's nothing else that they would have done with the capital they have zero cost to to to to to use this capital to to stake either they do take on some risk there's always of course some risk there must be some risk with staking but there is no cost to society and with mining you still have like even if you say that all the energy in the world uh that is being used to mine bitcoin you still have the cost of actually producing the asics the asic miners you cannot make uh those that cost disappear you cannot say that that is 100 produced by renewable er you know you didn't get the steel from from wind i mean so so because of that proof of stake is actually less wasteful and i do think if ethereum becomes a form of money or something that people believe in like an investment that people want to hold the i don't want to go exactly into that right but if we just take us a a a cryptocurrency system that runs some proof of stake and we say that this system is going to be the hard sound money that we're going to use in the future then there's going to be tons of people that just hold the currency because hard money inherently increases in value in alignment with the the output of society growing the the production rate of society uh as that improves it's going to increase the the the the value of the currency that's how economic that's how economics work and it works very well when the supply of the currency is fixed so yes i do think that what's written in that article very much you know i think i came to the to the conclusion and i paul actually wants to debate me about this article he thinks that i am wrong and we have scheduled uh a preliminary debate we haven't set a date but we have decided that we are going to discuss this in deep detail at one point however other people say that they want us to do it in written format because it's too difficult to go through these very very complex nuances online but i hope i answered your question that yes what i wrote there is very much how i think about it today eric what's so fascinating to me about this is like bringing this uh full circle to sort of like human beings as a having collective power human beings is almost like a an ant colony right so like what is money money is um the collective thought of a society of a group of human beings in terms of where they want to store their wealth and where they want to store their value right there's there's almost like this mimetic quality uh to money what is the best money it's the money that everyone else chooses uh to be money and what's interesting to me about your argument is like we've talked about this with justin drake in in ultrasound money which is like an ultrasound money episode uh which is like if a network a crypto economic network like bitcoin or ethereum has a monetary premium in its base asset it gets this economic security for free essentially and you just extended that in 2019 with your article to proof of stake so like if there's a bunch of people who are bullish about ether and they hold their ether they're going to do this at the lowest possible cost it's almost like the network gets economic security at a discount why because the base layer asset has this special privilege in that it is a monetary asset and not all cryptocurrency networks get to have that privilege bitcoin of course has had it we would argue on bank list that ethereum is also getting it but i noticed something eric that you stopped short of calling ether sound money and i'm curious because you have um this history in bitcoin what is holding you back from thinking about ether as sound money or am i wrong about that do you think ether is sound money right now um i think i think i think you know my answer already and i think that um i mean bitcoin is a reaction to that money can be so easily manipulated by politics in the central banking system and uh bitcoin goes in the completely different direction it goes it takes us back to the gold standard and we we adhere to the philosophy of bitcoin and bitcoiners all over the world we care most of all about the um predictability of the monetary policy of bitcoin and we view that as one of the most foundational properties of a good sound money whereas in ethereum you have a different philosophy where you care more about securing ethereum you want to secure your defi systems by having a sufficient security budget for that and you don't have any qualms about changing the emission rate of ether to accommodate what the system needs so the reason why i do think of bitcoin as having a upper hand in becoming a dominant store value and the dominant medium of exchange is because the meme of a strong monetary immutable monetary policy whether or not that actually factually works in practice or not we know that reality factions and facts don't actually [Music] have so much influence into the thinking and brains of humans but it it it is the means that that count so i think that the meme of an immutable predictable uh monetary policy that bitcoin has historically followed uh whereas ethereum hasn't and also the the the very beautiful uh inception of bitcoin of the satoshi nakamoto who never ever uh spent a penny of of the early bitcoins that he made and then he disappeared and had no influence in the system bitcoin is much more this abstract brand it's just bitcoin you don't know who the founder is and the monetary policy is immutable it aligns so it fits so much well uh uh it's if it fits so much better into this category of a digital gold than ethereum does and i do think that there is uh very strong reasons why gold was the most formidable form of money for thousands of years in human history and i think that the cryptocurrency that better emulates those properties are gonna win in the memetic game of of creating a sound uh money because after all it is a magnetic game uh now i don't think that the bitcoin is gonna the mistake that bitcoiners did uh was focusing on the stock to flow ratio which is um i mean you know gold has an emission rate right uh there's new gold being brought out dug out of the ground uh that isn't 100 predictable but all we know that is roughly is around two percent every year uh so but but because bitcoin is supposed to have a fixed supply then uh this whole idea of you know that you you know the stop to flow model of course i think perhaps most your listeners do i mean now so many bitcoiners think that the reason that bitcoin is going to be successful and hyper bitcoinization is going to happen it's because the price is going to go up so much just because bitcoin has a fixed supply but if you are now in that frame of thinking and now ethereum is going to burn a portion of its fees after eip 1569 gets activated and ethereum could create it and it's already creating a meme of itself uh in having a deflationary supply or a supply that shrinks because the gas fees are being burned then now the stock to flow ratio of uh of ethereum isn't even infinity it goes into the negative because it actually goes into the complex number plane so i think bitcoiners have shot themselves in the foot by play trying to play the memetic sound money game by looking at the stock to flow ratio and you know how much i did to uh try to get bitcoins away from that uh because i knew that this would uh everything up for bitcoin if we focused on too much on the stock flow ratio and that's why i've spent the last year or so trying to get people away from the stock to flow ratio uh obsession and getting them more focused on the rainbow chart which doesn't have this uh supply-centric uh way to analyze how the price should develop and that's that's why i'm now uh the rainbow guy uh because i i knew that this was going to happen i tried to get people away from from the start to flow ratio uh i ultimately i think i perhaps failed and because of that ethereum is gonna uh have a great uh chance to compete in the mimetic game of being sound money that's the bitcoiner's fault on the road they created this situation for themselves and the way that i uh the way that i how i acted in that situation is i just i i uh i had i built a larger ether exposure in my bags because uh in in 2001 one year ago i i i knew that uh uh first of all i knew that the layer two solutions uh for ethereum were gonna uh work out and i knew that um i i also knew that the uh uh there's going to come a tons of people into uh into the cryptocurrency debate and they're gonna think that uh bitcoin uses too much energy and as uh also i understood that eip this happened a bit later i think that a while later that i understood that the supply of ethereum is also going to shrink i did see that you know now ethereum has so much potential to start competing in the mimetic game of being money that you know flipping is no longer off the table you know i personally still prefer the predictable monetary policy like that's how i think that uh we should that's most powerful uh principle to stick by if you want to create uh sound money but i do think that ethereum has been fundamentally undervalued because it has these other arguments that also resonate very well so i did build out a big ethereum stack and now i'm outperforming bitcoin because of that so uh thank that's thanks to the stock to flow bitcoiners that made stock to flow such a big part of what cryptocurrency is that i'm now and now i can bank on the meme of uh deflationary supply in in ethereum because of that so i guess in that that's the silver lining of being tortured by these stop to flow obsessionists and eric do you think that ethereum being sound money ethereum is ether is disqualified from being sound money or do you think that it could become sound money um via like different routes other than just a completely hard cap monetary policy is this something that ethereum ether and ethereum can find over time uh and then also uh do you think that if there is a flipping that it is uh pre the prerequisite is of that you know if the ether being quote unquote sound money in the eyes of you know the people that value it or can it or can it flip in bitcoin via other um you know just other merits well i think that ether can become a money uh i don't think that uh ether can become sound money in the sense that bitcoin can become sound money it become it can become a kind of money that people may use and they might even use it if this edge case of the flipping does happen and uh ethereum wins over bitcoin and people start to use it as money it's going to be much much sounder money than any type of fiat money that we have because uh even though that yes the monetary policy can be changed it's still going to be uh it's like bitcoiners like to say well bitcoin ethereum is not no different than you know just the central bank uh deciding to buy uh treasury bonds or changing interest rates and then printing money but i do think it's different i mean it's it is after all the centralized protocol and if you're if you're involved a little bit in ethereum governance you know that uh if the earth at least has the potential to segment its strategy around the monetary policy much more than what you could expect from a nation state so i do think that ethereum can be much sounder money than fiat currency can be but i don't think that the theorem necessarily should strive to ever become uh i mean ethereum can become a sound mind in the sense that this the supply is very constrained right we can reach that phase where it's actually a negative emission rate uh year over year uh but that's not you know my definition of sound money my definition of sound money also includes the this predictability and it's never gonna get as good of a brand in that category as bitcoin has because bitcoin never changed its monetary policy and bitcoin also uh has this immaculate conception and leader leaderless launch and brand uh around it that ethereum can never uh compete with but that doesn't mean that you know it doesn't mean that uh it still can't but it can't win ultimately so i do think that the flipping can happen a theory can be relatively sound money but uh it's never gonna it's never gonna get as far uh if if bitcoin succeeds a sound money it's gonna be a sounder form of money than ethereum can achieve in in its best case scenario if that makes sense so eric we've um given bitcoiners a hard time on this episode i think it's time to give ethereans a hard time too what's something you think ethereans get wrong oh my god well it was too much is your brain just spilling over with all of these things i mean uh you know i don't i don't want to point fingers at specific people in specific projects but i think that there is like the i think that like overall the entire ethereum uh project is an entire mess right now and uh some can think that it's it's a it's a beautiful innovative mess but i actually do think that governance wise it's uh kind of a a cluster it's not the best uh governed uh system that that you have out there uh i do think that uh uh the ethereums themselves like the ethereum people they don't uh they many times they don't understand the types of uh like if you take a defy application for instance and then they start to then they start to talk about the qualities of this defy application and what they're describing like if you talk about the decentralization and the trustlessness properties of this application compared to what the factual reality is then uh ethereums are very easily misled into thinking that the product is much better than it is and they underestimate so many of the risks that they are creating in the file [Music] that that you know i'm seeing these i'm constantly seeing these systemic risks being built up inside the ethereum system and i don't think that the stewards of the like the ethereum thought leaders and the builders of ethereum i mean i i i see so many uh things coming out of ethereum's mouths that make me uh shiver on on a daily basis like like if we just take an example like do you remember when we had this full uh supply gate scandal uh in when we tried to get just somebody to respond to what the supply of ether was like how many units and for for listeners there was sort of a narrative among bitcoiners it's just like hey you can't prove what the supply of eth is ethereums tell us what the supply of eth is and a number of of prominent bitcoiners you know pushed this out and kind of challenged the ethereum community to to say what the supply of uh ether was that's what you're referring to yeah and then vitalik said look at either scan and that was i mean i i cannot understand like did you just miss uh eight or ten years of crypto economic history like did you just miss the entire purpose of what we're trying to achieve here we're trying to build systems that can be independently verified by everyone uh then you cannot if you if you're creating this uh you know acceptance that looking at sources like infuria looking at sources like either scan if that is the basis that you you your your your that's how you're educating people in your in your system you're gonna end up i'm thinking you know what i'm most worried about in ethereum is that you're constantly compromising on decentralized but i mean and i do i got first first of all i gotta give ethereum kudos that compared to uh solana and avalanche and mine and smart chain and all these other ethereum killers then ethereum has stayed true to the decentralization philosophy much more than those other quantities that is why ethereum has difficulties scaling and then moving fast and and you know they are you know ethereums are actually trying a little bit to have a decentralized system uh whereas many of you know the dfinity in these products they don't care and heather hashgraph they don't care about it at all ethereum they you do care you don't care about it so so i gotta give computers for that first of all but uh when you when when we're talking about you know sinking the an ethereum node for instance we're all we're always moving uh the gold posts so first it was let's sink the entire ethereum chain then you know let's just look at the uh the state route of ethereum and let's just sync from that and then we can then we can use what's called fast sync so we just so we just look at the we just look at the current state and then we just verify the proof of work on the headers uh and now we're moving to snapsync which syncs even er like in fast sync you actually did sync uh you did fully sync uh part of uh from from from a snapshot you did sync uh the actual ethereum blockchain uh but in snapsync you're is thinking even less of the uh and that's becoming the default now that you're you're actually validating less and less and less of the ethereum protocols and roots uh all the time in order to make your clients faster and i think also that they determine the terminology and the language uh is deteriorating where because i think it's fine like i think it's completely fine if you want to snap sync your node if you think that security mechanism is enough for you by all means do it there are bitcoiners that run their clients with assume valid flags where they also skip part of the validation but if you're going to call that a full node if you're going to call those nodes full nodes and you say it validates them what people are going to think is that they are independently invalidating the entire system then you are creating these systemic risks in the ethereum system where uh all of a sudden we change the terminology so much and we change the default settings of everything so much that we can actually have the entire system collapse by uh very few nodes actually collapsing like if you take matic for instance like uh i did tweet about matic uh pretty recently and i did say that i am uh just learning about the system because i haven't been nordmatic for a long time because i consider it to be a uh just a proof of stake sidechain and i'm much more interested in the roll-up things uh but but uh from my understanding a matic node uh it re it gets its uh the the the keys the the validators in in matic they are chosen in an ethereum uh smart contract on the main net that's where those keys are set but the full notes in mavic they don't sync the ethereum chain so how do they know when they're looking at that contract how do they know that what is inside that ethereum mainnet smart contract is actually valid if the matic nodes don't actually sync the clearing chain so it's these types of things that i see where you're having applications that are just reading information from completely centralized sources and you're creating uh not at all in many cases decentralized uh systems uh i do i i do have to say though that i have changed my uh my my um i used to be uh so anal about the centralization when it came to ethereum that i that i didn't think that that i thought everything was going to fail but i have later changed my thinking now to valuing much more than just the permissionless quality like what you really need to have in order to create this innovative environment is just that people can build things permissionless that they can use it without there being any guardians so it's permission it's permissionless to build that's the most important quality and i don't know if the centralization i mean the centralization decentralization saves you from a few perhaps not very likely risks that may not happen or regulatory clamp downs that may not happen but the the the the the way that the d5 evolution and and the revolution is going to happen uh mainly uh comes from the permissionlessness quality and the composability qualities uh more so i'm i'm not i'm not that concerned about that ethereum is just semi decentralized uh these days [Music] are did that answer your question it does yeah and we absolutely don't have uh time to go into all of those items i will know on the supply issue the ethereum community eventually provided a much better response than what you said was vitalik's initial response with some code that sort of validated the ether supply but what's super interesting eric is i think among honest bitcoiners that we see who are drawn towards the thesis of decentralization we hear kind of a common sentiment of like the thing i worry about ethereum is an erosion of the values of decentralization and it can happen to a community quickly and i think that's really what your expressing in your comments here what one other axis of decentralization that i think um the bankless program emphasizes to you is like the the access of having a banking layer that is custodial right so that i feel like is an erosion of the bitcoiner uh value systems if you're using instead of you know a a trading system like like uniswap which is relatively decentralized you are doing your trading on coinbase or or binance when you are using block fi instead of ave right so that is another access that i feel like the bitcoin community doesn't look at enough the decentralization of not just their monetary system but the banking layer on top and eric we probably don't have time to get into all of that because we've got to uh come to a close is there anything you want to say though quickly no i want to say that i think that you're correct and i think i was on a podcast with stephan lavera and revert timer talking about okay so what if lightning doesn't work out they said well we're probably going to use you know custodial solutions for transferring bitcoin and i do think that yes because you can do so much more with ethereum we're going to be able to decentralize more things inside the more parts of finance is going to be decentralized in ethereum um so i do very much resonate with what you just said right now and i do think that it is true that bitcoiners do underplay that part of this the conversation uh so yeah i i i agree with you on that show definitely yeah eric on the bank list podcast we like to give out this line about uh just how we are all like going west we are all exploring the frontier you don't have to do it alone you can join a community you can join a club but uh i i see you as venturing off in the frontier very much on your own as like this this lone wolf person who very clearly thinks for himself uh but has you know chosen to specifically not be tribal and really just stick to your own guns and stick to your own values and and thought processes uh and and you and the other characteristics i would describe to you is that you kind of default to skepticism uh and you generally proceed with caution which i think are very valuable characteristics to have and perhaps why you have been in the crypto industry for so long and not gotten washed out as so many people do so can you kind of reflect on on these qualities uh maybe the ones i named and maybe the ones i didn't name that you think have really been helpful for you to navigate this industry for such a long period of time and then also what do you have any other advice for you know first cyclers or crypto novices who are just getting into this world of crypto and think that perhaps like cardano or ripple or the future yeah definitely uh you know i um it's pretty crazy but i did find a unique what i found in my opinion was a unique niche in the cryptocurrency space was to just stick to the truth like just stick to the like what is the actual nature and reality of the situation and speak your mind without bias so i try to be as as unbiased as possible and surprisingly there's almost nobody else that is trying to fill that niche of being as unbiased as possible you know most people they have their project they want to make the best out of that project and and i don't know if there are any other unbiasedness maximizers uh out there uh i know that there are some like there i like i think that probably uh hasu a friend of mine that he also i feel like he sticks to that principle of just not caring about bias and just caring about the reality so so yeah that's that's why what i have to add on that and you also asked me about um uh you also asked me about uh if i have any first cycle recommendations to people uh when we started to talk in this podcast we talked about how i came into this space as this uh uh digital biologists that but it's actually not entirely correct i actually came into this space as someone that wanted to learn how to become a financial trader so from it was only a few years down the road when i really understood the components of the blockchain that i understood that it was a primitive life form but i spent i spent two years or three years trying to learn how to trade and and for many of those years i was using very very stupid primitive technical analysis i was looking at the same dumb indicators that you see all of these technical ta advisors use i was following the macd rsi rsi indicators and trading based on that and it didn't it took me until i learned how to program and back test my own strategies to understand that i was doing complete nonsense things and then i started to question the whole field of technical analysis and especially the bitcoiner technical analysis that i found out that it was basically just a big scam and if i could give anybody some advice uh don't go down the technical analysis route you cannot they don't work they're not gonna sell you a course that's gonna make you infinite money for 50 dollars a month try to get involved in communities like try you can you can become uh actually very rich in the cryptocurrency space by just learning how these systems work producing value and becoming members of princeton's thousand ethereum and uh i mean these that like i think you have put it in a pretty nice way that like we have dows in ethereum that are looking for workers and if you can provide work to those dows you you can get crypto coins then you can use those crypto coins to invest in other systems that you understand and then you can build wealth for yourself that is how you become profitable in this industry if you're starting with no capital today uh versus them you know trying to buy a fifty dollar course that's that's pretty much my my advice there you go bankless nation that advice from eric while of course none of this was financial access but eric has been in crypto since 2012 he survived up to this point by holding views on decentralization and thinking about the long term of the space the long-term trajectory eric it's been a pleasure to have you on bankless you know what man i feel like we're much more aligned than i thought we were at the start of this podcast and it's always good to see a kindred spirit in the space who's here for some of the same reasons we are on the bankless podcast so thanks for joining us man it was a pleasure thanks for having me on action items of course you have to follow eric wahl at ercwl on twitter got some fire thoughts coming at you we will also include some of the articles we've referenced in the show notes one that david mentioned proof of stake is wasteful on cows volcanoes and staking if that doesn't tweak your interest prove your sake is less wasteful it's less wasteful thanks very important point a very important point disregard what i just said anyway the show notes are available for you to read those articles are referenced of course guys risks and disclaimers bitcoin is risky eth is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're
