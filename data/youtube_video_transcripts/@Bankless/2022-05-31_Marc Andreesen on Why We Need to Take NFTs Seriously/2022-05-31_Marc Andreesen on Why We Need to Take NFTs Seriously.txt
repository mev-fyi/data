the world has a fraction of the level of art that it should have there's just a fraction of the amount of music that there should be there's a fraction the number of books that there should be there's a fraction the amount of visual arts that there should be this is why we take nfts really seriously it's a way to connect culture to the internet it's a way to connect art to the internet it's a way to actually have ownership of art if you look at the entire history of art it's always been a really big deal to be able to have ownership of art it's always been a really big deal to be able to fund art to be able to have provenance of art to have artists being able to make money making art you know quite literally to be able to have the ability for an artist to be able to go online and do this and to be able to you know access an entire global marketplace of potential collectors i'm incredibly bullish here that we could have a level of creativity that we never even imagined was possible
