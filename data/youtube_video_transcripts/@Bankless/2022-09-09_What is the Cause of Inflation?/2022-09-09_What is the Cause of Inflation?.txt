what is the cause of inflation right now i think there's two causes we're going to print a bunch of money and hand it out to people and so people bought stuff they bought a lot of stuff especially in america you know stimi's right and maybe they went to the robin hood account and they bought gamestop so we have inflation because people have a lot of money and then the u.s and eu such nato and russia have a little you know falling out over this whole ukraine issue and the response was hey we're going to kick the biggest energy exporter in the world we're going to take your money we'll freeze it we don't want to trade with you anymore and so now you have real inflation of energy and food because when you remove the biggest exporter out of the global equation you make things more expensive so not only do we give people a bunch of money to buy stuff we also have a particular block of countries so we're not going to trade with the biggest energy exporter there's the monetary aspect of printing too much money and then there is we're going to upend global supply chains so it's just more expensive to get energy from where it's produced to where it's consumed
