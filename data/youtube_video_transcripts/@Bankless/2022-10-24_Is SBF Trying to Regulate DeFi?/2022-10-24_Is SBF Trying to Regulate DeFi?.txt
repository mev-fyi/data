SBF wants to regulate D5 as promised he says this is a tweet my current thoughts on crypto regulation there's a section about asset listing what's the security what's not there's this section on ofac he says this then both centralized and decentralized applications can query in real time the list of sanctioned addresses to avoid transferring funds to or accepting funds from those addresses saying basically if you're a uniswap or D5 before you let an address do something with your protocol you have to query the ofax sanctions list here's my response David with respect this absolutely sucks you're saying D5 should be oh fact you're saying on-chain freezes should be normal you're saying D5 front ends need to register as a broker dealer no this is not reasonable this would eliminate the us from the crypto race the straw man argument for those in the D5 communities oh you're in D5 you don't want any regulation at all no that's not true we actually really want Clarity we really want regulation but you know what's worse than no regulation bad regulation yes if we end up with bad regulation we could set the US crypto industry back by like years maybe Generations maybe we'll never recover
