[Music] all right bankless nation it's roll up time this is the third week of april david how you doing absolutely fantastic third week of april and one of the most monumental weeks in crypto history at least in my opinion price action is absolutely flying and meanwhile we have crypto's ever be our biggest company is now a public company on the nasdaq so many things to get excited about and we are going to go through all of them on this bankless weekly rollup guys if this is your first roll-up this comes at you every friday every friday am enjoy it with your coffee this is the fastest way to download the week that was crypto because we hit the market we have releases we hit news hot takes and then we end with what we are both excited about so david i am super excited about this week we are about to get into it but before we do we've got to mention some hot announcements that are going on the first is this the bankless badge bankless members if you're a member of the bankless nation you're paid subscriber to the newsletter you've got to pick up a badge why do they need to pick up a badge david they got to pick up a badge because they need to get one of these bankless apparel t-shirts there is only 50 of them in existence and there's only six left to give out and we are giving out all of them next week to bankless badge holders uh and so this is it works as a raffle if you have a bankless badge you can go sign up for the raffle starting on monday we're giving out one every single day for the whole week trying to get these out of my closet and into the hands of the bankless nation and and that it doesn't stop there because the week after that is another week of giveaways ending with a whole entire ether to one lucky bankless badge holder so if you are a premium

you don't want to regret it you don't want to miss out on the raffles david raffles are going to be tight raffles oh they're going to be awesome yeah better every day is what we is what the promise is uh david we should also mention something really hot that is coming from dharma the dharma wallet they've just added a ton of new functionality that we just had to mention at the front of this show david i know you're a big dharma wallet user why yeah it's really a new paradigm in what a defy ethereum wallet can be uh this has brand new backend architecture that really makes the user experience of managing this thing just a hundred times easier and what i we're going to get into this but one of the things i'm excited about is retail season which i think is coming and retail season really needs infrastructure like the dharma app to really be enabled so if you are trying to get your friends into defy yet you're worried about them getting caught up on gas prices or gas management or whatever the dharma app is the place to send them yep and here's what you do basically so go to dharma io you download the app you connect it to your bank account what you can do is move funds directly from your bank account wells fargo bank of america wherever you bank directly to d5 not just the app directly to a d5 protocol like wi-fi where you can earn 14 or compound where you can earn close to double digits in just one tap that is the key thing dharma making it super easy to onboard your friends into the bankless ecosystem particularly if they live in the us they've really solved that last mile problem david are you ready to get into the week that was crypto should we start with markets uh i we have to we absolutely have to let's do it all right well let's start with bitcoin then as long as we're on markets what is bitcoin doing this week bitcoin is reached a new all-time high of almost 65 thousand dollars for 64 715 nice job bitcoin well done well done really really crossing some milestones as well uh there are some pretty cool things about bitcoin at its current price um bitcoin is currently worth more than the entire brazilian stock market uh and so the brazilian stock market in the review rear view mirror uh and it's also bigger than the british pound sterling the total market cap of all british pound sterlings again in bitcoin's rear view mirror uh bitcoin just flying by the milestones nice drop so that makes it the sixth largest currency not cryptocurrency the sixth largest currency in the world at this point where it's touching like 1.2 billion dollars that's a pretty phenomenal milestone for crypto and definitely for bitcoin but tell us about eth ethan's having a good week david yeah all the milestones that bitcoin's flying by ether is also flying by its own milestones even faster we are perhaps on the verge of crossing 2 500 ether which is a nice a nice round numbered number to look back at we are currently at the price of two thousand four hundred and sixty-five dollars the high right now the high that we touched a couple hours ago is two thousand four hundred and nine uh and eighty-five dollars uh and we are yeah currently at the price of 2455. uh a really really strong performance of ether in this last week and as always guys when you listen to this it could be higher could be a bit lower we don't know but it is definitely flying this week we'll talk about maybe some of the reasons for this but the macro reason might be it's repeating history right what is anthony sistano telling us in on these charts in these graphs here right so this he's comparing uh anthony suzano's comparing bitcoin in 2017 to ether now the meme is always that ether is always one cycle behind bitcoin and in 2017 uh bitcoin broke through at the previous all-time high of a thousand dollars and went up to 1 300 fell back down to 1 000 to touch that support from the 2013-2014 high and then we all know the rest of the story it zoomed up to 20 000 after that and this is the exact same thing that just happened to ether ether uh broke the all-time high of 1400 at the very beginning of this year went all the way up to 20 uh to 1900 then fell back down to 1400 and here we are perhaps repeating history in the same way bitcoin did it last cycle we are moving up and if we if you do the math right ether goes to 10k after this if we are indeed repeating history and so broke the ultimate broke the 2017 all-time high retested it went back down to it found support there and now we are just zooming up up and that's a pretty fun place to be what's kind of fun to you is that like of course the market caps are much larger this cycle than the last bitcoin cycle cycle that you were comparing this to but um the the units are there's there's basically 10 times more supply ether than there are bitcoin so the units kind of match too right bitcoin of course went on that 2017 run at the bottom of like 190 or so to you know 200 all the way to 20 000 at the very top and from a unit perspective ether might do the exact same thing crazy i mean crazy i'm not calling 20 000 because i'm just not that guy but i'll call 20 000 when we're at 17 000. if it repeats history right from a unit perspective it could be similar of course the market caps are much larger now so that could have a influence but uh hard to ignore these charts we'll see if history gets repeated we're about to flip in paypal in market cap ethereum is is 85 of the way to flipping paypal in terms of market cap that's pretty major yeah and the eth price action uh dc had this tweet where he says like sometimes he feels like the the eth price action is really really hot no it wasn't dc it was uh it was jacob franek of coin at coinmetrix uh and then he sees metrics like this where ethereum as a whole is still worth less than paypal uh and then we he's reminded about how incredibly early we still are because ethereum is should be worth more than paypal like give me a goddamn break [Laughter] all right david let's talk about uh total locked in d5 how's d5 doing with total lock these days we were flat for a really long time and we are no longer flat uh we were pushing up between 40 and 48 million or billion dollars locked in defy ever since uh february uh and we couldn't really break through that 50 billion dollar mark we broke through it we are at 58 billion dollars locked in d5 uh i think over 10 billion dollars added in the last week uh so that's pretty cool also part of the the new uh new order of things is compound is now the new leader in total value locked in defy now is the first protocol to have more than 10 billion dollars locked in in his pr his application we never would have seen this coming in in 2018 or 2019 this is such a cool story yeah that's crazy i i noticed wiring as well they just hit three billion so a major milestone what this means is we're not even a year old not even a year old we we're creeping up to that 100 billion dollar mark that means money robots bankless programmable contracts in code we trust is going to be managing 100 billion dollars of the world's assets that's pretty cool that's pretty sci-fi very exciting um david let's talk about the d5 pulse index is that reflecting some of this growth i'm going to look at the weekly looks like we're up on the weekly yeah the dpi has been a fantastic asset to hold especially in the last few days uh last week it was roughly around 470 480 we are all the way up to 4 540 new all-time high in dollar terms for the dpi index david i think when we started talking about dpi it was around 80 or so so we've seen a cool 5x as even as we started like talking about dpi and every roll up moving forward but let's look at this chart i know you like this right uh dpi ratio to eth the dpi to eath ratio what are we looking like this week right so dpi versus eth has been down versus verse versus eth since march right so ether as an asset has been the better asset to hold versus dpi ever since the very beginning of march we are down to the uh low of 0.2 ether per dpi but uh in the in this last week dpi has really rocketed off that 0.2 level jumping up to 0.22 so up 10 versus ether then it fell back down and then it did it again and so what i'm seeing here is that dpi is really not wanting to go down below 0.2 ether per dpi really finding resistance at that point to level is this the final destination of dpi resistance versus ether perhaps perhaps in the long term uh and what this means is that you know people are gearing up for defy season if this resi if this support can hold for further and and and then ether can finish absolutely mooning and then quiet down perhaps some defy tokens will start to take the lead that's what i'm seeing in the charts this is all means that ether is doing well but uh d5 tokens are doing even better even which is sort of interesting yes even weller um all right we got to talk about some of the reasons for this and one of the reasons might be the launch of coins so coin of course this is um coin bases much awaited not initial public offering but they are going public and they went public on wednesday maybe this is part of the reason that eth is flying up this is part of the reason that dpi d5 tokens are flying up we'll talk a bit about that later but tell us how coin has responded and how it's done since launch david yeah so uh ryan in that upper left next to the coin ticker go from two hour time zone to down to like uh go 15 minutes go to 15 minute time tickers yeah uh and so coin a launched at the price of 410 and immediately fell all the way down to 330 and i believe at 330 coinbase is valued at 85 billion um so somewhere around that mark or six sixty looks like it's around 66 billion yeah and ryan in our 2021 bankless predictions we predicted that coinbase would uh we didn't really put a time frame on it but i think pretty soon after its launch it would be trading above a hundred billion dollars and so jury's still out uh there are plenty of buyers who are buying coin right now but there's looks like there's also plenty of sellers who are finally getting liquidity on on on their coin base equity um i don't expect this toke this asset to be uh below 100 billion dollars for a long time i think this is going to reverse pretty damn quickly here yeah it could catch on we we talked about this in our market monday that this could become sort of the meme stock for crypto it's interesting later we'll talk about how wall street bets for instance the the subreddit that has forever banned crypto is no longer banning crypto why same day that coin was released because they can get in on some of the action in their robin hood accounts that's probably why but what's also happening is uh hedge funds and financial institutions are now able to access um crypto exposure in a better way a way at least that works with their existing uh rails right publicly traded companies stocks they can invest in kathy woods arc investment fund which is a um incredible fund they've done incredibly well gotten ahead of many major technologies probably the best performing fund in all of 2020 and 20. not even by a little bit by a magnitude yes uh by the way we gotta get kathy on the podcast 200 yeah 246 million worth of coinbase is what ark bought on the day that it debuted so it's going to be hard to see how coinbase um like goes too low in in this kind of backdrop with this kind of support that that's coming in the middle of a bull run what are your thoughts here david yeah we just have to remind ourselves how long liquidity has been locked up for people who own equity in coinbase and how ready they are especially people who are savvy about crypto how ready they are to double triple quadruple down on their crypto exposure um so the i know chris burniske thinks it thinks this is true is that people that have equity in coinbase are selling their coin equity so they can access bitcoin ether defy tokens uh and he he says that he has the numbers to back that up uh and so like there there's just a a wealth shift going on uh coinbase equity holders are shifting out of coinbase and shifting into crypto and then everyone who doesn't have any coinbase is shifting into coinbase there's just a bunch of uh churn in the in the uh coin asset right now you know what this kind of makes sense to me if i'm a coinbase employee right a typical coinbase investor with now some liquidity on the coin token i'm i'm generally like a smart money investor right i i work at a major crypto exchange i'm not just looking on kind of youtube videos right uh and finding yeah except and finding that the new hot thing to invest in i'm relatively informed and what we've seen is many of the assets particularly defy assets and eth that coinbase lists have gone up since the day that coin was listed so i think there's something to what chris berninski is saying with these employees and insiders sort of cycling back into crypto that's what i would do with part of the proceeds if i was in that position david we've got a lot more to cover guys before we do we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bat t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off bouncer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of d5 here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage this means you can swap a wider range of tokens and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping all right guys we are back with releases david this is a really exciting sort of combination release this is ave plus maker teaming up what's going on here yeah this is some really cool defy money stuff this is this is why we are here right ave maker getting closer together as a protocol maker has one competitive advantage that no other defy app on ethereum has which is the ability to it has the the rights of issuance the rights to print money that's what maker does it can print die it only prints it under certain parameters but ave wants to tap in get closer to that power to mint die uh by directly integrating the ave protocol of a money market into the ability to directly put collateral into make or dao and mint dye on behalf of ave so ave is but it's it's got v2 on l1 it's also got an integration on polygon and it wants to be in many other l2s as well and it wants all of these different ways to access ave to have the same maker dao back end and so this is going to in theory add a bunch of liquidity to die because ave can guarantee above and beyond and manage a collateral into maker dow in a protocol as a protocol and so all of a sudden like a lot of liquidity that ave has can be put into maker dow to help with the die liquidity and and die peg and dive blending and borrowing rates uh and so ave and maker dow coming together it's really cool because this is not a uh user-to-protocol interaction this is a protocol to protocol interaction which is super exciting it's also a model that we've seen in traditional finance so think of maker dow it's like the central bank and ave as a commercial bank of course these are both money protocols so all of this can be automated but it's a similar sort of relationship you've got sort of the the underlying money printing bank apparatus banking apparatus that is maker dell and you've got a commercial bank which is ave for lending and borrowing super exciting to see this sort of combination innovation here david let's talk about why gas fees on eath are going down finally yeah they're going down a little bit yeah why what's happening yeah i'm used to gas fees only going up it's actually a pleasant surprise that gas fees are going down and so there's this new service called flashbots um that has allowed a lot of the gas auctions that arbitrage bots fight for to occur off-chain uh and so um what's happening is that all of these uh arbitragers who are consuming all of the gas gas space and and bidding up average gas prices are just fighting for those for for the rights to process transactions in an off-chain manner which really allows for a more efficient market discovery of what gas should be and so as a result of that there's a lot of transactions going in that didn't actually have to compete with other transactions uh and so this is actually just turning into a complete like a cut in half if not more uh the amount of gas that people are paying so really nice really nice so what's happening is basically these arbitrages david who are kind of running these bots instead of doing the auction and competing in the ethereum protocol they're using flashbots to go off protocol and do these auctions directly with miners so this is what we've called in the past mev minor extractable value right so there's value in the arbitr arbitragers doing this there's value for for miners in doing this if they get paid but rather than that happening on chain that's now happening in this kind of side network off chain and so it's alleviating the gas demand on chain which is good for users in one way but it's bad for users in another right because um there's some front running going on right like there's some ordering reordering of transactions going on that benefit arbitragers uh are we also concerned about that i mean we are concerned about mev but i don't think there's any more mev happening minor extractable value happening as a result of this it's just the fighting for who gets to claim that mev is happening in a different realm we are always concerned about the instability that uh maximum extractable value is is what we are trying to call this instead of minor extractable value um however i don't think this is actually changing how much mev there is at stake yeah makes sense and we're definitely going to talk about mev in the future it's going to be a major theme across bankless and crypto another major theme i think david is exchanges crypto exchanges becoming more like crypto banks uh adding more services this is binance launching tokenized stock trading services starting with tesla starting with the the biggest meme stock of all of course a good place to start all you have to do is trust binance right so it's it's not a bankless money system but what's happening here david yeah binance is just making synthetic assets uh to that are on like legacy stock markets and the difference between the legacy stock market and finance is finance is offering these assets to people who don't who don't live in america aren't domiciled in america and don't have access to the nasdaq or to the new york stock exchange so it's one part like democratization of financial assets it's one part um very dubious legally gray financial activity that american regulators are not going to be pleased with uh and so this is always an interesting story binance is kind of like one foot in crypto one foot in legacy yet they are a real company in real meat space uh and that is always interesting to me there's going to be friction about uh behavior like this yeah absolutely it's going to be interesting to see but i think one major theme of bankless that we predicted since the early beginnings is the rise of exchanges becoming crypto banks right will these be the new banking overlords of our system or will we have more of a defy future i think it might be a combination of both but uh we'll talk more about that in a little bit this is some cool functionality uh raid guild has put out this is a dow that builds things in the ethereum ecosystem right so this is a smart invoice david so it's like a an invoice that's programmable are you up to speed on what this does oh yeah i remember reading about this really quickly but it's kind of an invoice that turns it on it's uh that is inside out or backwards where uh you can give someone the invoice before labor is done and the invoice whoever it has to pay can pay that invoice but not send the money so the invoice can be fulfilled and then labor can be done and then the invoice can be executed and so it's a way for laborers to gain assurances that they are going to be paid for their labor because they can see that the invoice has been paid and then they do the labor and then they actually receive the money so it's a little bit like a time lock contract where the person paying for the labor or paying for the services puts up the money and so the labor giver or the laborer under sees that the money is there and they can feel assured assurances about uh that they are going to get paid if they do the labor uh and so this is really important when we talk about like global finance between internet strangers there's a lot of that in in the world of crypto is people do work for other people that they don't know and haven't met and so reducing that those trust assumptions by something like this is really helpful yeah what's really cool is this is another function of something you could do when you have programmable money this would not be possible in the traditional financial ecosystem but with uh ethereum with defy you can actually program invoices to execute on milestones to escrow things very cool new primitive um you know in time this will this will be the way we do invoicing i'm fairly certain uh david let's end with releases there and get to the news we gotta touch um the coinbase listing once again um this is this is from the sec so this is the sec release or the filings the coinbase release of i believe this is their their form s1 so this is sort of all of the disclosure information that coinbase provides investors prior to listing prior to going public there's a lot of really interesting information here one thing i'll pull out this was written inside of the filing but also came across in some of the interviews that ceo brian armstrong did was a statement he made that he expects 50 of future revenues to come not from his exchange business but from non-trading businesses in the next five to ten years those are things like staking custody debit cards david it's like banking stuff not exchange stuff banking right like what back to the theme we're just talking about with with binance this is coinbase morphing into a new type of bank and to be honest like look this is bankless so we prefer complete self-sovereignty over our money but we are sort of one foot on the shore one foot in the ocean in those in those two worlds but i definitely prefer a coin base or a gemini to my clunky old wells fargo account right like because there's so much more i can do with even a crypto bank it's very interesting to see them evolve into a fully fledged banking like system even though they're not regulated as banks right now they're becoming banks essentially yeah and they're becoming much better banks and this is something that like the legacy banks the wells fargo the bank of america that they just do not understand what is happening here or the forces at play coinbase is going to be a better bank perhaps out of the good nature of coinbase leadership but more definitely because they have to be because their competition is defau and d5 is the best money ux in history period once you learn how to manage you know ethereum and do ethereum stuff the d5 bankless world is really just competitive like the yields are higher every everything is just better and like it's just and what coinbase is morphing into is a bank that is closer to defy than bank of america wells fargo blah blah blah and so as a customer service or as a as a just what their product and offerings are are just going to be orders of magnitude better than wells fargo and all the other legacy banks that just don't understand anything and aren't trying aren't they the wells fargo and all the legacy banks are having that revolution happen to them the d5 bankless revolution coinbase is undergoing the revolution they are taking the revolution by the horns and saying we are going to be a new age bank with perhaps d5 in the back and it's going to be able to just they're going to give better products and services to their customers uh usc staking on coinbase is or not staking but like apy is is one percent which i mean it's not high comparison to defy but it's still like 100 times higher than your typical typical checking and savings account in wells fargo and so these new crypto banks are the new banks they are the new banks for the young people uh who are ready to accept them you know what david i i love that description i also would say let's not stop at a new set of banking systems let's also go to d5 but i think coinbase to your point is aware of what's going on in d52 in fact d5 is written all over their wrist section in this filing of what could potentially disrupt even coinbase so they're looking at that one way to your point that um d5 is kind of forcing coinbase's hand a little bit and maybe a small way is coinbase just gave all of their employees or 1700 employees shares just airdrop them coinbase shares like this sounds similar to some of the the token mechanisms that we've seen in d5 and i think it's maybe a nod a recognition of um of what's going on in d5 they had to sort of do the same thing yeah we we wrote about uh uniswap when unifop gave 400 tokens to all of its users um unfortunately coinbase regulatorily and just like logistically can't airdrop coinbase equity to all of its users also there's like 48 million coinbase users when there was only like oh i wish they figured out a way to do that yeah hopefully gem and i will when they ipo you know um but but like this is a companies don't do this companies don't have to give their employees equity coinbase elected to do this and this is something that i see like as crypto culture exporting itself into the rest of the world the the values and ethos of what happens when you distribute wealth in ways that benefit more people looks good upon you and this is a planting of a flag for all the legacy companies that never did anything like this for their employees coinbase is like look we're the hot new thing on the on the legacy stock market and we just gave our all of our employees 25 000 no matter if they are a an entry-level employee or they are a c-level employee they got the everyone got the same number of shares airdropped to them this is a new this is a new we are moving the overton window of capital into better and better wealth distribution mechanisms and i think that this got started by uniswap and now it's moving its way into the equity market with coinbase nice job ryan nice job brian i hope they uh that the next crypto bank ipo listing rewards some users that would be awesome that would be so if the winklevoss twins are listing guys if you can make that happen when you go public that would be really cool okay uh david let's go to some ethereum upgrades the first is this ethereum just had a new upgrade so this is a hard fork uh of ethereum but like not an aggressive hard fork where a third party this is a kind of a planned community hard fork where everyone decides to update their nodes what was packed inside of this berlin uh upgrade yeah a bunch of just uh deep coding stuff that i am not familiar with some gas some gas prices got re-managed some new transaction types are in there really it's just some protocol the deep protocol level stuff that i just don't understand it doesn't really impact the average user of ethereum um but as a an unfortunate result of uh these hard forks that ethereum commits to every now and then to upgrade the network uh we actually had some hiccups with one specific client which resulted in some bugs that people dropped off the network so that's why you might have gotten some bad some bad reporting if you use zapper or xerion some tokens didn't show up or etherscan was reporting stale transactions stuff like that we had some consensus issues there's already a a update fix sent out to the open ethereum client which is the client that was experiencing these bugs and so if you are running an open ethereum client make sure you go update that to the the new patch that was just released yup i believe it's already been taken care of and of course this was not like core consensus issues this was issues with like block explorers and people using the open ethereum clients it's also why we have client diversity as we talked about the justin drake article in the justin drake podcast of course the important thing if you're a regular ethereum user nothing you have to do everything is upgraded for you and we are one step closer to the next hard fork the london hard fork which includes eip fifteen five five nine yeah that is not a minor change that is a very exciting change uh maybe coming this summer we'll see if i get my my ethereum knowledge right there's some of the updates in this hard fork were prerequisites of eip1559 yeah so that leads into that so so now next step eip1559 in a couple months there you go all right um david consensus the people behind metamask the people behind and fiora a number of early projects that have been so bitcoin so important to the success of ethereum just raised 65 million dollars and they who they raised it from is super interesting to me jp morgan mastercard ubs they raised it from traditional finance what are your thoughts here david yeah jp morgan has always had a really close uh relationship with consensus they worked on the jp morgan had their own private implementation of ethereum and then consensus bought it they've all they've they've been shaking hands for a while now um yeah and and i think consensus is about to really pivot into a a new consensus right we're about to talk about uh git coin and how bitcoin pivoted away from consensus and i think consensus is pivoting into a studio an advisory studio or software studio specifically for big name clients like jp morgan like mastercard who know that ethereum can help them do stuff but they don't have the the employees or the builders or the knowledge to build it the right way so they're tapping into the power of consensus to get that done yeah it's it definitely reflects a desire from from some of these legacy banking and traditional financial systems to get exposure into the crypto realm so that i i suppose is a good thing um let's talk about get coin itself so they have just as you were mentioning spun out of consensus so what's get coin doing here david get coin raised 11 over 11 million dollars specifically from uh paradigm uh and paradigm is like in in my opinion ethereum's best vc fund uh paradigms behind uniswap behind some and but they're really leading the charge into optimism and solving minor obstructible value they are solving all of the hard problems in d5 and the fact that uh paradigm led the uh led the round into uh uh into get coin uh which shows that they have a lot of faith in what git coin has to offer so congratulations to get coin uh graduated from consensus into their own thing uh and i think there's going to be a lot of cool stuff coming out of the bitcoin team um they are just doing absolutely fantastic we should have them on sometime soon too david let's uh cut to dydx who we just had on bankless so cool thing about dydx is they just launched in their own ethereum secured layer two using some super cool zk uh roll up technology and their volume is just off the charts already right so they did 70 million in volume on their perpetuals volume on the weekly david like what this tells me is there is massive demand for layer two block space and for these decentralized exchanges once you release it once you deploy to layer two we're seeing the demand is already there yeah in under 10 days the ether a perpetual ether usd perpetual swap is over 14 million dollars in volume in 24 hours and again this is a brand new product these aren't large numbers comparison to older projects but these are this is a brand new thing and there's already like between and the other cool thing about this is that because they are on layer two they can do more assets than just bitcoin and ether so now there's ave unit swap and chain link and uh what antonio said on our state of the nation if you haven't watched that go watch that that they are going to roll out one at least one asset per week uh and so i just expect this this l2 exchange just to absolutely explode and they're definitely going to start with the d5 assets i'm pretty sure um all right let's uh yeah uh let's talk about what else is going on in maker dow world the the central bank as we were referring to it the d central bank the decentral central bank um they're getting into real world assets and this has long been a part of the the maker multi-clatter uh die vision is can we get some more stability for dye from off-chain assets here's one of their first i think they've had several before but what is this what are they doing here with this real world asset in make your dab backing die yeah so it's important like you said die wants to be backed as many different assets as possible because that's how you achieve maximum stability if we only had dye that was backed by ether and then ether dropped by 50 that's really threatening to die um so not only should we diversify between other on-chain assets we should also diversify to off-chain assets and we are now seeing commercial real estate loan short-term loans coming out of maker dow uh to to help uh to help bridge the gap for liquidity for people who are investing in real estate uh and so this is this is very interesting um off-chain there's an off-chain underwriter i believe i'm fuzzy on the details it's very legally complex but people that are needing liquidity that they can't find elsewhere can come to make or doubt strike a deal with the doubt and the dow can offer them die liquidity for their collateral uh and then there's also the the uh infrastructure set up under the conditions of maybe there's a housing market crash who liquidates the property to pay back the die all of that is managed uh and so um there's one world of off-chain assets becoming tokenized on ethereum and then those tokens trading around there's the other world of just offshoring assets only going into credit facilities like maker dow and staying there and then the value of these tokens being turned into die and sent into d5 which is also almost kind of the same thing at the end of the day and this model seems to be the model that is is being pioneered here and perhaps going to be the one into the future yeah it's interesting with like maker has taken this approach where of course this some of this is settled in in meat space right so it's not completely trustless at the same time there is a lot of meat space assets that are available to back die that could be partially imported into the d5 ecosystem something like 100 trillion maybe more like i've 100 to 250 trillion in like real estate assets imagine all of that on ethereum you could mint a lot more die if you had access to a portion of that real estate capital pool so this is some of it's starting to bleed over and just some grounding here there's a 500 000 die being minted on the back of these real estate loans so uh die i think is over three billion total die so not a not a good tiny just a tiny bit in the door i'm expected to grow yep all right let's talk about nfts david this is cool epic epic games wow behind fortnight yeah that's awesome um yeah so what what are they doing here they've got some plans for the metaverse for nfts what uh what are the plans here yeah so uh epic games the team behind fortnite and fortnite just exploded onto the scene i think in like 2019 2020 and fortnite was free but they made an insane amount of money selling skins and like other packages and so i think what they are seeing is they are seeing the possibility of making nfts on fortnite perhaps tradable skins tradable unique assets i don't know um but it's just obvious that some company that is making a killing selling uh selling assets on in the game uh transitions those assets into nfts on ethereum uh with there we know that this is product market fit i have no faith or a complete faith no faith no faith you know who this is also good for is those building infrastructure for these big game studios one of the companies building infrastructure for uh these studios is immutable and they have a zk roll up base starkware technology the same technology that powers dydx which we just talked about they've rolled that up into an nft specific exchange that is secured by ethereum perhaps that's something that epic can tap into in the future and they've just announced a ton of different launch partners too this is pretty cool yeah um and the golden age of nft gaming is perhaps ahead of us specifically enabled by immutable and immutable acts by immutable immutable is also the team behind god's unchained the trading card game and so they are eating their own dog food they needed their scaling solution to build to make gaz unchained their game that they made better and so they made immutable x and so they know what they needed and then they built it and now all these other platform games are coming to deploy themselves on immutable x unimutable x like gas there's no such thing as gas transactions like it's basically absolutely and still secured by ethereum so super cool i'm expecting big things here david especially these game studios start to enter these legacy game studios um let's talk regulation gary gensler confirmed finally confirmed as joe biden's sec chair replacing uh jay powell who's not like there was a i think there was an interim person taking that role but jay powell was the last chairman under the trump administration what are your thoughts here yeah so we just had that podcast with hester hester purse who expressed optimism about gary gensler as the sec chairman and this is not a world that i'm familiar with but uh hester purse is crypto mom and crypto mom is giving gary gensler the thumbs up uh and so if if you don't care about regulation it's kind of all you needed to know um but we do want faster quicker uh regulation coming out of the sec to help provide the clarity for teams that just need to do stuff issue tokens hester purse has this three-year three-year clause that allows people to to issue tokens and have them not be security so long as they decentralize within three years if that gets passed that's really really awesome for clarity for people that want to issue tokens but feel like they are hamstrung by regulation um so many good things i think can come out of this and i'm optimistic for it yes this three-year safe harbor proposal which we talked about in the podcast that just came out on monday on the bankless podcast um she has updated that and she actually put it in github for like people to comment on people to fork super cool super like crypto native of her why why is she called crypto mom because of stuff like that just still plugged in that part you got to catch that podcast you get a sense of her perspective on gary gensler i i feel like if i'm reading between the lines gary gensler may not give crypto everything it wants uh in fact some things might be not great for crypto but it will give clarity which is what it seems like which which is a benefit and which is good and hester seemed pretty confident of that so we'll see how that evolves probably good news for crypto on balance um david let's talk about some some weird news i don't know why banks are doing this right like so bankless twitter tweet it out whoever controls that account bankless twitter on coinbase i don't even know i just see the tweets and i'm like oh yeah i agree with this um tweet it out the banks are scared on coinbase launch day and you know what i think they are scared david you know why because coinbase is creeping up in market cap to some of the biggest banks in the world it's it's like a shot across the bow um this is a tweet from cameron winklevoss he's saying uh you know he's quoting that gandhi quote he says like you know then they fight you this is the bank's fighting us part hsbc a major bank i think the sixth largest bank uh in the world is not only banning the purchase of bitcoin it's your hsb client they don't want you purchasing bitcoin through them but you can't even purchase companies stock publicly traded uh companies like microstrategy that own bitcoin they're stopping that too they're banning that too this is a memo um from hsbc to all of its clients that you can no longer purchase microstrategy because they have bitcoin crypto on the balance sheet david what is going on who do these banks think they are this is so dumb like why just why control it like there's probably some compliance reasons that some of the lawyers or compliance teams say hey we shouldn't do this but other other people are doing it and like there's no benefit to this for their customers their customers only lose like and why are you fighting it it just makes no sense to me i do not get it like if any anytime a bank fights this they leave the opportunity for the banks to not fight it to profit from it coinbase gets yeah it grows in market cap right an influence i hope coinbase is like yes please ban everything every single bank ban bitcoin so we can have it all like this is just this nonsensical strategy and it's just it's insulting to the self-sovereignty of people everywhere and a stark reminder as to why money needs to be a public good because if they can control what you buy and how you buy it then you are under the control of people dictating your lives which i'm personally not a fan of i know this about you i do feel like they're digging their own grave david um but you know what uh the fact that they have the audacity to do it so great right like i think they know that they still have some strings that they can pull they have a monopolistic private public partnership with nation states they have lobbyists in washington they have lobbyists in london they have lobbyists in all of the governments all over the world there are some strings they could pull and if things get nasty and they really want to stop crypto i think they may try to pull those strings as well so we'll see if they ramp up and escalate the fight long term they're digging their own grave but short term i think they still think they're in power they still think they can control us man oh that's cute that's cute of them that they think that i do want there to be at least one bank that tries to do everything in their power to stop this revolution from happening just so we have this example model of like what a complete failure looks like in five to 15 years it's maybe it's hsbc i feel like it's not going to be wells fargo wells fargo is just going to be like we're not doing anything we're not innovating whatever we're good here we're gonna do nothing yeah all right david we've got some hot takes we've got to get to you that are super cool but before we do let's talk about the sponsors that made this roll-up possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uni-swap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dial no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eath so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eath bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless all right we are back with the takes of the week here's a take kind of a news take but also a take in it of itself wall street bets r slash wall street bets of course that made news like worldwide when the gme gamestop stock fiasco was going on they have previously not allowed crypto discussion david bankless has tried to get in there post something cool like hey check what we're doing in d5 swap ban instant ban yup now they've just released the mods have just released a post that said crypto discussion is now okay this has got to be partially as a result of the coinbase coin listing what are your thoughts here yeah uh we've talked a a few times about this in a distant past during especially specifically during defy summer about the concept of composable communities the bankless nation and the wall street bets communities are extremely composable um know it yet they just don't know it yet there's perhaps more ape culture and more degen culture in wall street bets uh in italy oh yeah dude they yeah they they're yolo into gme at whatever yeah for sure more dj than d5 oh yeah like oh yeah they are they are they are c5 absolutely they are uh and and i like i don't think they understand the degree of product market fit that defy has for some of these people uh and i i really am hopeful that uh the wall street bets community and the bankless and defy communities have this fantastic marriage so if any listener is a part of both uh do your best to be in the wall street bets uh subreddit and talk about this subject because like they already know what it's like to be censored they already know the pains of centralization they love to degen and ape like what more do they want uh and so help spread that message if you're in the wall street bets uh subreddit help spread that message we're trying to get in there we're trying to shake hands with the community we want them to be listeners and subscribers to bankless and we want to help them go bank list because that's what they want they just don't know it yet i think this is a major step though to like tearing down the wall and i think what was the wall constructed because of 2017 david they had a whole bunch of these like you know useless token projects who were expanding crypto's a scam all of this and so they created this blanket policy well things are changing the narrative is changing now could be the time for more composability um david i've got to take here you ready for it let's do it dude people say ethereum is hard to use right people say that um have you ever tried to register an llc on a state website state of idaho state of virginia state of washington like set up an llc and pay with holdings have you ever tried to do that uh yeah it's pretty goddamn awful it's terrible like these state websites rip my eyeballs out there it feels like they're they're built in circa uh you know 2000 and like no one updates them it's like they don't want you to do that it's like hey they make it so difficult and every single state has a um like a certain thing you have to register like there are entire companies like gusto and other third parties that just basically take care of that pain for you now infrastructure we've had built on top of this but i'm just comparing that because what are these state registries well they're just basically a legal meet space way to register what register a capital pool that's what an llc is that's what a c corp is a capital pool well i could do the same thing on ethereum and do that for free transactions yeah right like seriously and capital pools for breakfast this is what i mean so there are some things on ethereum that are are already 10x better right like people don't think of ethereum as as competing with um like state registries and governments in the llc and c-corp but it kind of does right right i can spin up a dow capital pool anyone can join it multi-sig i've got my banking structure structure already built into the system um i've got like any i've got an id system built everyone has basically their ethereum addresses their bank account it's just a couple of clicks so uh it makes me pretty excited about the disruptive capability even though ethereum is hard to use right it is right it's it's already better if you know metamask and you're kind of a d5 super user it's already better than what we have today in these state registry systems it's much much preferable uh than all other legacy financial institutions um yeah you said it very well no no no more needs to be said about that well let's let's get some more from hayden then hayden adams a bankless podcast guest now bentley's podcast alumni excited about that what's his take here david yeah he his take is that the new york stock exchange has 2 800 trading pairs over the last 228 years and unit swap v2 has 36 000 trading pairs in one year two of those i've made pov crypto token uh there's a trading pair there and this other token uh bap token also as well two trading pairs uh i listed two tokens on markets with uniswap uh imagine me trying to get something listed on the the nyse wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen and this is to exactly to your point like all of the stuff that requires paper pushing and bureaucracy is just now it's just a transaction on ethereum just done like here it is like oh you want a trading pair sure you i'll just hide you have to bring your own liquidity uh but like whatever just just build it and then you can build it it just reminds me people want an analog right like in the early days of media they were like what like four different news stations that's it right and then then we move to youtube you have like hundreds of thousands of channels yep right like millions of channels millions of different content producers everyone can produce content it democratized media we're we're democratizing finance we're democratizing asset creation and asset exchange everything's going to be tokenized this is why uniswap now has 13x or more the amount of trading pairs than the new york stock exchange it's only been around for like two years three years right like it's incredible imagine how many it's going to have by the end of this bull market and what's crazy to me is people don't see this coming and it's like it's coming it's happening maybe dharma sees it coming because you can anything that's on unison you can get into it with dharma there you go there you go um all right let's talk about um this tweet i guess all right so this shows how early we are this is a somebody called my attention to this this is somebody on bloomberg um and they are showing a a ticker chart of like bitcoin crypto assets and crypto related assets they spell yes they misspelled ethereum so it says the rear yeah they missed the e at the start they missed the e at the start and it feels to me like so that banker is kind of sitting here presenting it right like ethereum is still not a mainstream finance name they're still misspelling it right on uh on broadcast tv this is how early we are david and it should be ether not ethereum this is actually something that that bugs me about even people inside the crypto space is like they say like oh i bought three ethereum's like no you didn't you didn't buy three ethereums you bought three ether like i get that yeah it's a it's a nuanced point but like it's important i agree i agree that's important i've i in like i used to correct people and i used to be like what you mean is ether but like now i've taken it just like hey it's just more important that we're talking about ethereum and like like so i don't correct people but people in the know know that there is ethereum the network and ether the asset definitely which brings me to a question i actually tweeted this out and i want your perspective on it david this is a survey i tweeted out how much longer will this bull market last and so i put four options here three to six months six to 12 months 12 to 18 months or more than 18 months and you can see the results here on the screen 46 the vast majority said three to six months uh and then it was kind of scattered through the other answers what do you think david well let me let me finish off going through the numbers so 46 months for three 46 percent said three to six months thirty percent said six to 12 months only seven percent said 12 to 18 months and then 16 percent 16 said more than 18 months uh i was in the uh seven percent of 12 to eight months so i was in the significant minority 12 to 18 months yes right uh and like i was super surprised by people only thinking that this cycle goes for only three to six more months uh i guess i'm a contrarian i do we have more than six months less in this thing absolutely okay but let me ask you so 12 to 18 months that's longer than previous cycles so you are a long cycle cycle believer though i am a fan of the super cycle thesis yes uh two two cycles in one i'm a fan of this yep so this is that the cycles the bull market cycles just get longer longer and bigger and bigger because we are in a late stage fiat credit cycle money is free money is distorted uh and there's so much cash looking for places to go and crypto assets are the only remaining unallocated asset class that is specifically antagonistic to the decline of fiat if there's ever going to be a super cycle in crypto it's now this is the cycle that crypto goes mainstream maybe in three to six months uh where all these 46 percent of respondents saying that's why the bull market ends maybe that's when we have a very significant 40 to 50 correction and then we just keep on going for for six to 12 more months like it's super cycle wait super time okay let me ask you do you believe that this is the last cycle and here's what i mean by that there is a there's a thesis that goes around crypto which is like hey this isn't going to be pattern recognition for the past four to five cycles that we've seen in crypto this time it's different this time we go mainstream don't expect your 80 to 90 drawdowns on bitcoin and ether at least and maybe even defy tokens this is the point we've already passed the point of no return we're not going to get those types of things moving forward and so this is really the last cycle so what that's kind of saying is there won't really be a bear market after this like we'll see dips but it'll level off what do you think about that yeah i think that's completely in line with the super cycle thesis right um when when we were in the bear market in 2018 2019 i was listening to and i was still very new to crypto at that time people are saying like oh this new cycle is going during the next cycle there's going to be all the gains again because crypto markets go in cycles and i was thinking it's like but if everyone knows it goes in cycles like if everyone knows it it shouldn't be like that it should do something different turns out it did exactly like what people said we're just going through a cryptocycle right now but the difference is is that crypto is mainstream now and now there are the world's largest capital institutions buying into crypto assets bitcoin ether putting on the balance sheet investing in this base the difference is that there is no further places to go after this the the top of the 2017 markets we did not breach into the mainstream we did not breach into hedge funds we didn't have a micro strategy this time we have all those things there's no further places to go there's already like conspiracies about the central bank stacking bitcoin like there's no more there's no further places to go right and so in six three to six months we maybe we top out and then have a big correction but that correction gets bought really hard and then we just keep on going and then all of a sudden kryptos mainstream so i didn't vote in my own poll but do you know what i would have voted for what would you vote for around what guess you should guess more than 18 months no six to 12 months six or 12 months yeah i think i think that so i think that um you could be right and there's some probability that what you're saying long cycle super cycle last cycle is right um but i also think that this could get crazier and we've seen every every single cycle of crypto get so insane and so out of whack so far stretched above even fundamentals at the time that the valuations don't make sense right right like that it's just a dot-com boom if you will um so i kind of feel like we're going to see a repeat of 2017. blow off top um now i don't think we'll lose like 95 in ether and we probably won't lose 80 percent in bitcoin so it'll be muted but i do think it could play out the the six to 12 months so i sort of feel like and here's the last thing i'll say on that is as kind of the the other perspective on this if people like the onus is on people uh who are saying this time it's different to like disprove the pattern and the problem is patterns can become self-fulfilling prophecies right so like if all of the crypto ogs are like oh yeah we've seen this before we've seen this four times like this is what the cycle looks like at a certain point they start selling it creates a self-fulfilling reflexive flywheel effect on the way down so i'm not saying for sure but if i had to guess i feel like we've got six to 12 months and then some form of uh a bear market um but we'll see i hope you're right david you could be right man we'll see super cycle that's all i got super cycle all right uh let's talk about this one so um this is jimmy rigosa i believe what's he saying here yeah so he this is an important takeaway for what ethereum is and why ethereum has so much sticking power if any new technology that is discus gets discovered it actually it finds a way to be built on top of ethereum and tap into the power of ethereum rather than building a competitor you could actually instead just build an l2 or a side chain that hooks right into ethereum and tap into all the benefits of ethereum rather than trying to have to get this new technology bootstrap from day one so you know neo eos tron they turn into apps in 2017. solana binance train they'll turn into apps in 2021 anything any innovation that can be placed on that can be built can be placed on ethereum and if it can be placed on ethereum it is going to be easier to get that thing bootstrapped than just to build a desperate separate siloed ecosystem so ethereum is the aggregation layer of all technology uh and that's the take here i've heard this a lot in the ethereum community it's basically like now we're seeing solana and binance smart chain and maybe a couple of others polka dot maybe this new kind of breed of eath killer but we've seen this movie before and last cycle it was the same thing it was called neon neo eos tron right these are no longer the eath killers um so i you know i tend to to believe this um very much i think this cycle continues to repeat but is this an ethereum maximalist take from your perspective um let's go to the next take this is this is one that that bankless um retweeted and this is vitalik buterin on a post in r slash eath finance i think the the author of the post op was basically saying hey um i'm starting to hear a lot of ethereum maximalist type of propaganda so he compared it to bitcoin maximalism and like uh saffidina moose and some of the quotes they're saying there's like i'm hearing the same sort of thing like ethereum is the only one it will crush all competitors like beware and be fearful and vitalik is responding to that and what what is he saying in his response yeah let me just read this out thanks for doing this we need to be alert to make sure that we do not become the thing that we fight against i would much rather see people support the ethereum ecosystem because they agree with its values and social and technological vision and not because we are the strong big thing everyone else is a loser and we will crush them for focusing on the former reinforces the community's moral virtues focusing on the latter equally attracts people who have those virtues the price go up number go up virtues and people who do not and perhaps the ladder group and so it ultimately erodes them so this is a conversation on values do we want people to come into ethereum because of the technological and cultural merits that it has or do we want people to come into ethereum because it's going to crush competitors and it's going to win which one do we want to promote as a community and then vitalik finishes uh it finishes uh with and if the values erode too much anyone outside the ecosystem really will have a hard time seeing the difference between ethereum and any other chain so what's vitalik is saying is we should promote ethereum based on its merits not because it's going to crush competitors i wholeheartedly agree with that take and um you know i i think um what somebody might respond when they read that from votel like is basically like oh so you're saying every chain is the same right and i also i don't think that's what vitalik's saying it's definitely not what what i would say right the values are really of the chain are really embedded in the protocol itself and ethereum has bankless values decentralization values right it is not a protocol that is aiming to be built for a small set of validators and folks that can kind of collude together and censor transactions right so i i do think that it's important not to become sort of a chain agnostic because if you're chain agnostic you're also values agnostic i'm not values agnostic right like i'm here for bankless i'm here so that we can go bankless uh not so that we can instill a new set of bankers who now control the binance smart chain so um i i totally resonate with what he's saying i think is a great point and only vitalik can can put it in that way david should we get to the last what are you excited about this week my friend yeah you want to take this one first one yeah okay you want me to tell you what i'm excited about yeah yeah coin i'm coin release coinbase man like that's uh this is crazy so what i think we're seeing here is blitz scaling right so some silicon valley have written posts about blitz scaling in the context of social media but this is money system blitz scaling financial system blitz scaling so wells fargo about 130 um 140 or so billion in market cap right and and we've got coin base creeping up on wells fargo numbers right like close to 100 billion or so wouldn't be surprised if it exceeds wells fargo here's the thing wells fargo has 45 000 employees okay 160 years of wells fargo to get to that market capitalization coinbase is about to achieve the same thing in nine years okay with 1700 employees nine years 1700 employees that is blitz scaling how are they able to do this because they built on crypto they didn't built in the legacy finance traditional world they didn't built purely on nation-state-based technology they built on crypto rails so that's crazy order of magnitude gain okay what's next what's next is defy what's next is unit swap so another order of magnitude gain you've got uniswap which is 38 billion i would not be surprised david if we see sometime in this market cycle and a hundred billion dollar uni token like it's not that far off at this point right we talked about how crazy market cycles can get how many employees 20 employees okay another order of magnitude improvement and they did it in two years three years like this is absolutely crazy i think the outside world um we've we've talked about so often right we're talking the hidden podcast why isn't the world talking about the unit swap story you know why i think after some reflection it's because it's happening way too fast right like they don't even see it kind of comprehensive because it's uncomprehendable like this is not growing uh in the way that wells fargo they can barely wrap their mind around coinbase's growth they haven't banks haven't grappled with that and now they're going to be faced with the next bank killer which is d5 protocols good game banks right like it's over so that's why i'm excited in the context of of the coin launch um the banks can no longer control what's going on they see coin they see it's market cap they see coin base they're going to start getting involved uh in this uh but you know the competition is is just heating up and they're not going to be able to react fast enough to the blitz level of scaling that's happening in d5 and this is this just fits into the pattern of history technology and technological adoption just accelerates as as we move forward like the iphone got adopted over x number of years and then every technology after that just gets adopted faster and faster and faster and that's what we see that's what i see you see happening in the d5 space and also why here's what i'm excited about ryan as a result of that adoption quickening adoption i'm excited for retail season retail season marks the top in 2017 and i think it'll mark the top uh in this bowl cycle as well but again it'll be extended um and we just have the infrastructure and the reasons to support retail and i am getting i've been getting texts about crypto for a while but so are we in retail season we are start we are in the beginning of retail season is what i'm getting for like wall street best just opened up to bitcoin and ether uh and i'm just i'm getting texts from from people that i haven't really talked to that in a while that are asking me about like chain link and doge and so retail season is definitely getting started and i think that's ahead of us and that's why infrastructure like dharma is going to be really really helpful to get retail bank accounts connected right into defy in a way that treats them like a user of robin hood with a customer experience retail season on the way i would love to read the responses to those texts where you when they asked me i said bitcoin and ether only and then and then i got the response well what about change text and i'm like what no bitcoin and ether only and now they're like what about doge and i'm like bitcoin or ether only and it just took a while i don't have too much start it's just it's just like you gotta start there and understand why bitcoin and ether are valuable before you go anywhere else that's definitely our advice uh to people who are new david you ready for meme the week time theme of the week best part of the banqus weekly rollout that's why we put it at the end i'm sharing it all right gains in real life matter too what are we looking at here yeah so this is a meme that's been going around the internet this was created by the guy behind the bank of twitter his name's mike wong um and it's got two two ladies in the gym and they are looking at someone uh and he they're asking what is what do you think he's listening to uh and the second lady says probably heavy metal or hard rock and then and then it turns into the the guy who's also the yes guy the the the chad yes person i'm pretty sure that's what this illustration is and this guy who's lifting 500 pound dumbbell curls and the text is uh and this is alluding to what he's listening to in his headphones welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance uh alluding to the the guy that's lifting getting gains but he's also getting brain gains as well listening to bankless that is awesome i love this meme uh by the way do you ever listen to podcasts while you work out does this resonate with you oh 100 i do too like all the time it's like brain gains on on muscle gains for sure yeah double double your gains why not all right
