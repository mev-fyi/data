the arrest of the founder of the Silk Road Russ Albrecht resulted in the largest seizure of bitcoin's to date ever it was something like 133k Bitcoins which is worth 4.2 billion dollars as of the time of recording he sort of undersold me a tad it was 177 000 Bitcoins once we got the Bitcoins off of Ross's laptop too could you ever imagine that 10 years later this would be worth billions of dollars no I would have predicted the crash of Bitcoins after that
